Please take this as a memento.

6
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,857
You gave it to her, right?

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,275
Thank you for this.

8

Why can't you go steal money instead?

- Toshiki!
- You…

10
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,491
Keep out of this!

Masato Kamishiro never lived in Kobe.

13
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,961
<i>I was in elementary school</i>

Hurry, help me! You idiot!

20
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,602
You'll die anyway.

21
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,561
What?

22
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,731
But I won't be satisfied with that!

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,318
<i>I left my dad to die.</i>

24
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,112

<i>I hope you can come to see it.</i>

53
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,475
It's so cold.

54
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,394
Damn it.

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,316
You're done with work, Ryu?

56
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,193

00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,914
Akane, can you take her shift?

60
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,666
Someone needs to go in.

61
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,168
Okay.

62
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,338
Sorry to make you go in the snow.

63
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,841
It's okay, I like the snow!

64
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,097

- It's good to see.
- You, too.

You said we needed to talk?

68
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,970
Yes. How's the investigation going?

69
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,764
You're a journalist.

70
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:28,810
You should know
that I can't tell you anything.

71
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,104
Even if I can help with the investigation?

72
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,273
Help us?

73
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,825
What's this?

74
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,288
It came out from Yuhi Minamizawa's
personal belongings.

75
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,338
She was doing her own investigation
into how her aunt died.

76
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,678
The police didn't even treat it
as a case and dismissed

77
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,097
her death as a heart attack.

78
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:14,564
So, she started looking into a guy
she found suspicious

79
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,858
and was killed.

80
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,321
Who's the guy?

81
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:27,035
The ex-husband of Aya Kamishiro,
who died from a heart attack.

82
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:33,041
Currently, he's married to Mio Kamishiro,

83
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:38,129
<i>a colleague of Iroha Koizumi,</i>
<i>the murdered patisserie staff.</i>

84
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,006
<i>His name is Masato Kamishiro.</i>

85
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,846
In this,

86
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,683
you'll find the research data
on Masato Kamishiro

87
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,728
that Minamizawa
risked her life collecting.

00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,780
- Oops!
- Uh-oh!

91
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,364
Hey, be careful!

92
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,830
- You're the one who called us?
- Yes.

93
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,875
I'm Minamizawa,
from <i>Gyokuseki Weekly Magazine</i>.

94
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,169
I'm Yoshimoto, the director.

95
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,713
- You must be exhausted?
- Not at all!

96
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,174
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

97
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,636
Look out, because things
can suddenly come flying!

98
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,013
- Do be careful!
- They have so much energy!

99
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,056
They do!

100
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,810
I remember Masato Kamishiro very well!

101
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,105
I had just started working here
when he arrived.

102
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,569
Where is he?

103
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,573
He hated photos.

104
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,993
Oh!

105
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,620
Is this him?

106
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,080
Let me see.

107
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:59,210
That's it! Wow, this brings back memories!

108
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,712
Huh? I thought this was him.

109
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,424
No, this is Masato.

110
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,718
But the burn scars…

111
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,262
What?

112
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:15,560
The thing is, Masato Kamishiro
is my aunt's husband

113
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,397
and she told me he had
large burn scars on his arm.

114
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,524
I see.

115
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,112
However, this boy's name was…

116
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,530
Toshiki.

117
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:31,075
That's it! Toshiki Kanekura.

118
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,662
- Toshiki Kanekura…
- Yes.

119
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:39,459
He made an even bigger impression
on me than Masato did.

120
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,837
He has a sad past, too.

121
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,007
He lost his parents
to the earthquake in Kobe.

122
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,305
Back then, children's homes in Kobe
were full of earthquake orphans.

123
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,724
<i>Toshiki was sent here</i>

124
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:59,353
<i>because he had relatives</i>
<i>from his mother's side in Hokkaido.</i>

125
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,859
Who is this?

126
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,197
You're such an introvert.

127
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,364
Hey!

128
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,574
Show us your arm!

129
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,993
- Show us!
- Yeah!

130
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,828
- Let us see it!
- Stop it!

131
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,539
- It's so gross!
- Ew!

132
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,541
- Is this from abuse?
- Stop it.

133
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,918
Were you abused?

134
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,837
- You poor thing!
- Still gross, though!

135
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,506
- Stop it!
- Huh?

136
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,716
Who do you think you are? Huh?

137
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:32,178
I'll burn you with a cigarette
to teach you a lesson.

138
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,431
- What the hell?
- Hey.

139
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,642
- Give it back.
- What're you doing?

140
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,519
You're right.

141
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,897
I have to forget about it.

142
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,776
Hey… What?

143
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,031
What the…

144
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,993
Stop that! Stop it, Toshiki! Stop!

145
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,286
What are you doing?

146
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,081
- Stop! Let go of me!
- I won't!

147
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,332
Stop it, you two!

148
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,001
- Let go of me!
- Hey, give me that!

149
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:11,592
After that, they became very close.

150
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,887
When did they leave here?

151
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,141
Masato was here
until he started high school,

152
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:23,396
but Toshiki ran away
when he was in middle school.

153
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,356
We never saw him again.

154
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,483
You never found him?

155
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,819
No, we didn't.

156
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,324
- I found it!
- Huh?

157
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,622
This is Toshiki's drawing.

158
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,168
He's very good!

159
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,340
- Who is she?
- His sister.

160
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,717
Younger sister.

161
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,677
His sister.

162
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,016
After the earthquake,
she was taken in by a relative in Iwate.

163
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,103
Toshiki really missed her.

164
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:10,818
OUTPATIENT BILLING

165
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,986
Excuse me.

166
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:16,324
I'm here to see Akane Kanekura.
Can I have her room number?

167
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,867
Just a moment.

168
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,011
Akane…

169
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:43,976
If I succeed in my current job,
I'll make a lot of money.

170
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,189
Then I can pay to transfer you out
of this backwater place

171
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,108
to a hospital overseas.

172
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,614
They'll make you better.

173
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,116
So hang in there, okay?

174
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,266
Masato Kamishiro is…

175
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,145
<i>Toshiki Kanekura.</i>

176
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,470
Thank you.

177
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,556
Wow!

178
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,934
You're very good!

179
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,603
I've always liked drawing.

180
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,730
I see. In that case…

181
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,734
Could I ask you to draw something again?

182
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,111
Sure.

183
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,698
Please draw yourself
without using a mirror.

184
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,700
Okay.

185
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,411
It doesn't need to be intricate.

186
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,664
No, I want to draw it properly.

187
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,040
As you like.

188
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,335
Hmm…

189
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,213
Can I be alone?

190
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:41,051
I want to take a good,
hard look at myself.

191
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,307
Understood.

192
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,810
Let me know when you're done.

193
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,125
Sorry, we need some more time.

194
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,543
What is this about?

195
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,463
- You already talked to him, right?
- Yeah.

196
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,131
He's a great husband.

197
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,674
Then why?

198
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,968
It won't take long!

199
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,807
I want to know a bit more about him.

200
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,482
TOKYO METROPOLITAN POLICE ASAOKA STATION

201
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,985
<i>About Ms. Minamizawa's</i>
<i>research data you handed us.</i>

202
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,823
To be honest,
the research does lack thoroughness.

203
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:50,037
Well, she didn't get to finish it.

204
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,374
And we're journalists. Not cops.

205
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,668
True.

206
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,172
I admit…

207
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,842
I was impressed.

208
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:10,933
And? Has it helped the investigation?

209
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:11,934
Go on.

210
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:12,977
Yes.

211
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,273
We looked into it ourselves, too.

212
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,569
Ms. Minamizawa's findings
on Masato Kamishiro's true identity

213
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,029
were hard to believe.

214
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,406
I understand.

215
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:29,869
Masato Kamishiro is actually
Toshiki Kanekura, an earthquake orphan.

216
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,872
I also couldn't believe it at first.

217
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,624
This guy…

218
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,168
Toshiki Kanekura.

219
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:44,341
He was wanted by the Hokkaido police
as a main suspect of a phone fraud case.

220
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:49,179
However, he died 13 years ago.

221
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,309
What?

222
00:14:55,352 --> 00:15:00,107
There was a fire in his apartment
caused by smoking in bed.

223
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,693
His whole body was badly burnt.

224
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,380
Hey, don't run!

225
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:19,436
AKANE KANEKURA

226
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,285
Akane.

227
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,999
Akane…

228
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,463
Why did you try to kill yourself?

229
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,800
Akane!

230
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,934
Your hand's warm…

231
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,191
You're just asleep, right?

232
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,991
Please, say something!

233
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,078
Akane…

234
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,386
I'm near Sapporo now, and…

235
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,056
I got in an accident!

236
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,772
If you can get money out…

237
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,565
Do you have money?

238
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,609
You know I drive recklessly…

239
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,611
Exactly! It was me!

240
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,489
- Hello? Granddad?
- As I said, it's me!

241
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,991
- Oh hey, it's me…
- No, it's me!

242
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,910
- Can you let me in?
- Who are you?

243
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:01,330
- Go away!
- Open the door! Move!

244
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,667
We're the police! Hang up the phone!

245
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,011
Toshiki Kanekura?

246
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,055
Hey!

247
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,890
Stop! You'll die!

248
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:35,280
Why can't I die like the others…

249
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,783
Kanekura! Don't move!

250
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,285
Go after him!

251
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,957
Hey, what are you…

252
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,292
- Hurry up and go!
- But…

253
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,253
I don't want to get in trouble!

254
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,629
You'll be fine.

255
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,425
You're twisting my arm!

256
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,598
- That's it!
- Go after it!

257
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,142
- Stop!
- Don't lose him!

258
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,310
Stop the car!

259
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,855
Hey!

260
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,318
Where to, sir?

261
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,700
This is enough to take you
to the world's end!

262
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,661
You decide.

263
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,787
Huh?

264
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,375
I don't care where I go.

265
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,985
Yes! I won!

266
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,781
Yes!

267
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,451
- Congratulations.
- Thank you!

268
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,745
Here you go. Thanks!

269
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,124
Wait…

270
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,918
Toshiki?

271
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,212
Huh?

272
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,756
It's me! You don't remember?

273
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,175
Masato! From the orphanage in Sapporo!

274
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,551
Masato Kamishiro!

275
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,639
I haven't seen you in so long, Toshiki!

276
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,934
How many years has it been?
You haven't changed!

277
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,269
Why are you here?

278
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,775
Hey, what's wrong?
Have you forgotten about me?

279
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,237
Of course not.

280
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,322
I'm so glad!

281
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,324
Oh, shit!

282
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,078
Let's grab a drink
when I'm done with this!

283
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,791
Here, drink! Cheers!

284
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:56,046
Honestly, I never would've thought
I'd bump into you there!

285
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,798
This is fate!

286
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,717
I knew I was lucky recently!

287
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,178
You keep saying that.

288
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,432
I'm on a roll since I won big
in horse racing bets last month!

289
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,935
Feels like I've hit the jackpot in life!

290
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,561
How big?

291
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,105
This much.

292
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,650
- Three million yen?
- God no, think bigger!

293
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,610
Thirty million?

294
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,070
You're joking, right?

295
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,905
No, I'm not!

296
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,033
I can show you and prove it!

297
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,536
I've cashed it out and hid it at home.

298
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,329
- Excuse me!
- I believe you.

299
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,957
Even back then, you never lied.

300
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,166
Exactly.

301
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:38,088
I've had a shitty life
with no friends or family,

302
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,632
but I'm about to start over!

303
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,512
Hey, can we have another one?

304
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,972
- Certainly.
- Be quick!

305
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,390
- Okay.
- Thanks!

306
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,606
It was funny because they thought
they were so tough!

307
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,028
You were so cool when you did that.

308
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,988
Hey. Are you okay?

309
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,906
Sorry!

310
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,536
- Toshiki…
- Yeah?

311
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:14,958
Remember they used to tell us,
"If you're alive, good things will come."?

312
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,626
I…

313
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,505
I used to think they're such dumb,
empty words, but…

314
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,966
they were right.

315
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,178
Good things do come!

316
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,807
You're right.

317
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,601
All right!

318
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,270
- Come to mine!
- Really?

319
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,731
- Let's drink the night away!
- Yeah!

320
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,483
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

321
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,403
- Where do you live?
- It's not far. Come on!

322
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,039
Masato…

323
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:08,136
It's definitely fate, that we met.

324
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,563
MASATO KAMISHIRO

325
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,689
It's close by…

326
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,670
I agree with you.

327
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,307
If you're alive, good things will come.

328
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,647
Only if you're alive!

329
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,647
I'll live your life from now on.

330
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,381
See you.

331
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,567
And the scar on your arm?

332
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,325
I'll keep it.

333
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,704
It's the only thing left of my true self.

334
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,248
<i>Thank you!</i>

335
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,708
<i>Thank you!</i>

336
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,543
<i>Thank you for the champagne!</i>

337
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,669
Thank you!

338
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,087
<i>Thank you our princess!</i>

339
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,505
Thank you our princess!

340
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,883
<i>- For the beautiful tower!</i>
- A Beautiful tower!

341
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,594
<i>From the prince and us!</i>

342
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,679
<i>A big thank you!</i>

343
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,389
Woo-hoo!

344
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,309
All right, let's go!

345
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,393
Let's go!

346
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,729
One… Two… Go!

347
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:32,567
Go! Today we have many towers!

348
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,653
Shouldn't you join?

349
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,240
I'm not good at those things.

350
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,911
That's why I like you, Toshi.

351
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,164
I'm honored, princess.

352
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,291
Don't call me that!

353
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,210
My name is Aya.

354
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:55,673
Say! My name is Seiya!

355
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,718
I'm sorry, Ms. Aya! Toshi.

356
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,929
Kazu wants to talk to you!

357
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,431
Excuse me.

358
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,642
This way.

359
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,104
Is it true…

360
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:13,274
that you stole my regular
by sleeping with her?

361
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,945
Is this the older one
that looks like a sea lion?

362
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,863
I can give her back to you.

363
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,285
Fight! First strike!

364
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,288
Come here.

365
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,666
- Hold him down!
- Okay.

366
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,126
All right.

367
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,253
- Two!
- Nice!

368
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,963
Three!

369
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,298
Four!

370
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,592
You freak…

371
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,720
You asked for this!

372
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,934
Hitting the face is against the rules.

373
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,270
- You broke the rules first!
- Ow!

374
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,272
You little!

375
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,158
Stop!

376
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,538
Stop.

377
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,093
Kazu!

378
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,471
- Hey, stop!
- What's going on?

379
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,514
Toshi!

380
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,017
- Enough!
- He lost it!

381
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:30,894
Come on!

382
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,147
- Kazu!
- Is he alive?

383
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,399
- Whoa, whoa!
- What on earth?

384
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,610
- What's he holding?
- Whoa!

385
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,158
Your pretty face is ruined.

386
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,707
Now I can't go back there anymore.

387
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,212
I apologize.

388
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,050
You've had…

389
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,636
a tough life, huh?

390
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,971
No.

391
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,141
- I had an easy life.
- Liar.

392
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,063
Let me see.

393
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,941
You have great eyes.

394
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,072
Their depth tells me a lot about you.

395
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,457
What was that?

396
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,084
Well…

397
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,336
you helped me.

398
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,714
You're taking this the wrong way!

399
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,637
I don't like idiots.

400
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,430
What?

401
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,725
Who's the UK prime minister?

402
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,895
Huh?

403
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,025
What does WHO stand for?

404
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,696
Who composed <i>The Nutcracker</i>?

405
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:12,787
Being handsome isn't enough
to be a great guy.

406
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:17,959
What you're lacking
is culture and sociability.

407
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,628
Simply put…

408
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,090
intelligence as a human being.

409
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:29,679
If you acquire that,
your life will change.

410
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,024
Now, go home.

411
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,744
What's your real name?

412
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,539
Toshi isn't your name, right?

413
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,505
It's Masato.

414
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:12,221
Masato, we'll meet again
when you're a better man.

415
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,187
Yes.

416
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,601
Sorry, that took longer than I thought.

417
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,562
No.

418
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,730
It's fine.

419
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,690
For you, anything.

420
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,067
Thank you.

421
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,530
I was able to find out stuff
about myself, too.

422
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,323
Like what?

423
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,661
Like…

424
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,290
what makes me, "me."

425
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,714
Emotionally…

426
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:14,343
Stable. Good personal relationships.

427
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,473
Very social, and full of life…

428
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:29,150
Has a big goal
that he's working towards now.

429
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,790
Hey…

430
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,751
What is it you want?

431
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,346
Ow!

432
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,014
What's wrong?

433
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,391
It bit me!

434
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,560
Show me.

435
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:30,795
Oh… Sorry.

436
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,089
I'll bring you a plaster.

437
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,637
Long time no see, Ms. Aya.

438
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,223
I don't think I can live
without Masato anymore.

439
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:28,227
<i>The data was last updated around</i>
<i>her estimated time of death.</i>

440
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,647
<i>Nice to see you again, Toru.</i>
<i>Or should I call you…</i>

441
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,150
<i>Masato?</i>

442
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,861
Masato, is not the person you think he is.

443
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,988
<i>Don't ever talk to me again!</i>

444
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,781
Do you have Aya's blood sample?

445
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,910
We'll start the investigation
over from scratch.

446
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,620
