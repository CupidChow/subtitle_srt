00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:09,009
<i>Yuhi Minamizawa,</i>
<i>a journalist for a weekly magazine,</i>

2
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,804
<i>was strangled to death here</i>
<i>on the 20th of this month.</i>

3
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:15,098
They still haven't found the culprit?

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,391
You need to be careful, too.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,269
<i>The murderer could be in this area.</i>

6
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,272
- Is the startup going well?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,859
<i>I have an investor</i>
<i>who seems interested in investing.</i>

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,196
As long as I have Masato. I'm fine.

9
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:35,827
<i>I don't need anyone else in this world</i>
<i>as long as he's there.</i>

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,078
CODEPENDENT ON HER HUSBAND

11
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,164
She's gotten worse.

12
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,374
Why would I kill her?

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,419
You said that I'm innocent.

14
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,296
Then who did it?

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,340
Mio Kamishiro's husband.

16
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,303
<i>Masato Kamishiro did it.</i>

17
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,347
<i>He killed both of them.</i>

18
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:05,356
Mr. Ishiguro, are you listening?

19
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,984
Huh? What were you saying?

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,737
I said, he was tapping his foot!

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,031
Well, as I said, uh…

22
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:17,952
- I can't remember.
- I'll start from the beginning then!

23
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,371
Make it short. In under 400 characters.

24
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,623
What?

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,879
So, first of all,
my aunt died from a heart attack.

26
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:28,963
I see.

27
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:33,426
- Wait, who?
- Her name was Aya! I told you!

28
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,136
This lady.

29
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,806
She was kind, clever, and rich.

30
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,557
I was proud to be her niece.

31
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,477
I see. She's beautiful.

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,313
She had problems with her heart

33
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:49,442
but after she married this younger guy
who was very kind to her,

34
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,736
she said she was doing better.

35
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,489
Then she suddenly had a heart attack.

36
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:57,367
- These things happen!
- True.

37
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,868
She did have an illness

38
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,580
and the police said
that there were no signs of foul play.

39
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,874
Okay.

40
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,752
And?

41
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,045
And then…

42
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,840
the foot tapping!

43
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,633
Huh?

44
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:18,388
He was tapping his foot
a lot at Aya's funeral!

45
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,014
Who was?

46
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,517
The kind husband!

47
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,187
He pretended to wipe
his tears with a handkerchief.

48
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:30,775
But he looked like he couldn't wait
for the funeral to be over.

49
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,819
That's creepy.

50
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,571
Wait…

51
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,115
Are you saying
that her husband killed her?

52
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,242
Made it look like a heart attack?

53
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,871
That's what I'm looking into right now.

54
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,332
The husband's past gets darker
the deeper I dig into it.

55
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,919
I see, I thought you
were acting suspicious lately.

56
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,129
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,714
Anything I can help with?

58
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,759
No. I want to do this by myself.

59
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,761
I'm doing this for Aya.

60
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:04,559
I've recently realized that I can't keep
depending on you all the time.

61
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,437
It's been on my mind a lot.

62
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,400
That makes me a bit sad!

63
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,196
Well then….

64
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,239
Here.

65
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,699
An independence gift.

66
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:25,997
It's from where I went
to cover a story on… I forgot.

67
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,206
It was a shrine.

68
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,209
There was a big line to buy that!

69
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,211
Wow!

70
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,173
Thank you very much!

71
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,051
It was a spur of the moment.

72
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,387
It might not bring much luck.

73
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,140
I love it.

74
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,636
Please let me continue!
I promise to get a scoop on it!

75
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,513
Yes.

76
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:28,935
As I said, I can just pay
for this room myself!

77
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,895
No!

78
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,816
Never mind. You can fire me if you want.

79
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,192
Goodbye.

80
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,580
Huh? A date?

81
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,748
Yeah.

82
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,709
How about enjoying
my rare day off together?

83
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,170
Really?

84
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,546
I'd love to!

85
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,970
Let's buy our wedding rings.

86
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,472
What?

87
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,891
Remember?

88
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,268
What you said a year ago.

89
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:57,774
You didn't want a wedding
and you didn't want a ring

90
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,402
until the mark
of your previous one disappears.

91
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:07,825
I said that because
after I tried to kill myself,

92
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:12,497
I didn't think I'd be able
to be a good wife for you.

93
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,416
But…

94
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,919
now, I'm really--

95
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,926
It's gone now.

96
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,014
I'm really…

97
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,809
happy.

98
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,822
I think I want this one.

99
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,115
Yeah.

100
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,324
I like it.

101
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,077
Can we have matching rings?

102
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,370
Certainly, sir.

103
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,788
With names engraved?

104
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,248
- Yes, please.
- Yes, please.

105
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,926
Wow, I can see it so clearly!

106
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,262
Yeah, it looks beautiful.

107
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,396
We're going there
the day after the rings are ready.

108
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,981
I feel so lucky.

109
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,942
When we get the rings…

110
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,528
let's exchange them.

111
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,405
Hmm?

112
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:32,869
For our trip, I reserved
a small wedding hall near Mt. Fuji.

113
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,620
What?

114
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,122
No guests.

115
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,041
Not even a priest.

116
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,170
A wedding just for us two.

117
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,134
Thank you.

118
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,844
You're welcome.

119
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,288
Hey!

120
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:20,958
Are you okay?

121
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,752
Uh… yeah.

122
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,339
Let's go sit down.

123
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,090
Okay.

124
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,452
Can I help you?

125
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,711
I'm Ishiguro, I was Yuhi's supervisor.

126
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,140
I'm so sorry.

127
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,241
Minamizawa! Hey!

128
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,286
- Yes?
- Focus! You'll miss the deadline!

129
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,581
Mine's all finished already.

130
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,416
Oh, okay.

131
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,960
Did you look into your aunt's husband?

132
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,214
Well…

133
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,219
I feel more anxious
the more I look into it.

134
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,764
Let me help out.

135
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,850
That's an order.

136
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,560
But…

137
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,769
Hey, Ishiguro.

138
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,064
- You, come here.
- Yes!

139
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,441
Talk to you later.

140
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,859
Okay.

141
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,986
- Something wrong?
- Yes!

142
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,740
This article! You can't write about this!
I told you before!

143
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,533
Why not? It's all true!

144
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,161
Whether it's true or not doesn't matter!

145
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:24,749
We could go out of business
if we publish this!

146
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:28,377
But we need to expose it now
before the other companies do!

147
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,130
It's great that
you're passionate about this,

148
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,884
but you get too heated, for Christ's sake!

149
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,597
- For example, this.
- What's wrong with it?

150
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,098
Mr. Ishiguro!

151
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,933
- Huh?
- Yeah?

152
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,979
I'm off to cover a story.

153
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,564
Okay.

154
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,612
- Oh, hang on!
- Hey!

155
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,447
- We're not done here!
- Sorry!

156
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,991
- I'll call you later, okay?
- Hey…

157
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,952
Minamizawa!

158
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,621
Wait!

159
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:17,885
That was the last time I saw her.

160
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,607
I'm so sorry.

161
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,195
It's all my fault.

162
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,326
I don't understand.

163
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,330
Why are you apologizing?

164
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,085
I have many regrets, too.

165
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,675
I should've stopped her
from going to Tokyo.

166
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,972
I should've talked her
out of being a journalist.

167
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,851
I'm sorry.

168
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:12,314
It was all Yuhi's choice.

169
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,693
I almost forgot.

170
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,785
Please take this as a memento.

171
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,372
You gave it to her, right?

172
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,666
Uh…

173
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,591
I feel like I know you well.

174
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:46,432
She talked about you
so often on the phone.

175
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,979
"I got scolded by Mr. Ishiguro."

176
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,441
"I got praised by Mr. Ishiguro."

177
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,237
"Mr. Ishiguro gave me a good-luck charm."

178
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,033
Mr. Ishiguro this.

179
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,035
Mr. Ishiguro that.

180
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,166
Really?

181
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,630
But…

182
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,675
I guess the charm didn't work.

183
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,348
Even God couldn't help her.

184
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,686
So there was no way you could have.

185
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,239
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude.

186
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,159
Do you want a drink?

187
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,578
- I have this nice local sake.
- Uh…

188
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,622
No, thank you.

189
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,084
I'm heading to Kobe after this.

190
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,127
I see.

191
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,380
It's the true culprit's hometown.

192
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,133
- The true culprit?
- Yes.

193
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:11,267
The man that people claim
is the suspect isn't the true culprit.

194
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,856
Yuhi was trying to uncover a case and…

195
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,528
was murdered.

196
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,866
The evidence she collected
was destroyed by the culprit.

197
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,367
So…

198
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,537
I need to uncover the truth.

199
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,253
Thank you.

200
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,089
I hope it goes well.

201
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,425
Me too.

202
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:46,802
Oh…

203
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,638
And thank you for this.

204
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,487
Are you anxious?

205
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,572
Huh?

206
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,532
You're shaking.

207
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,621
Recently, I don't like crowded places.

208
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,377
Don't worry.

209
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,380
Keep holding my hand.

210
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,675
Close your eyes.

211
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,599
No one's here.

212
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,645
It's only the two of us.

213
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,064
Okay.

214
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,275
Feel lonely?

215
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,819
No.

216
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,572
Not if you're with me.

217
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,462
Okay, let's stop here for today.

218
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,047
Thank you.

219
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,468
Hey, Mio.

220
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,973
Can you stop doing the meditation
with your husband?

221
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,516
What?

222
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:19,061
But I feel so much better
since I started it!

223
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,729
I even take fewer meds now.

224
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,147
The thing is…

225
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,275
Doing stuff like that
without specialized knowledge

226
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,111
can be dangerous.

227
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,822
But Masato said…

228
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,448
Just do as I say.

229
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,332
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,044
But it affects our sessions.

231
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,550
Let me ask Masato first.

232
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,680
Fine.

233
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,566
I'm struggling to understand you.

234
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,157
I do have another request.

235
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,205
No!

236
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,379
A ladybug!

237
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,176
Yeah.

238
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,139
It's not moving.

239
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,476
It failed to hibernate.

240
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,562
Maybe it got lost.

241
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,818
Hold it for me.

242
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,827
There you go.

243
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,499
It's beautiful.

244
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,793
It is, isn't it?

245
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,104
Wash your hands later, okay?

246
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,689
Ladybugs have toxins.

247
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,400
- Toxins?
- Yeah.

248
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,612
All beautiful things have them.

249
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,659
You have a beautiful face.

250
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,249
Thank you.

251
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,793
Masato!

252
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,630
- Hey, you're back!
- I am!

253
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,257
Hi, Nozomi!

254
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,717
Do you live around here?

255
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,765
- Do you know her?
- Yes.

256
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,476
She goes to Mizuki's clinic.

257
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,687
She said she's an orphan.

258
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,397
I wonder if she's okay.

259
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,357
She's fine.

260
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,235
- She seemed really well.
- Yeah?

261
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,320
How about you?

262
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,032
- Do you feel good?
- I do!

263
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,619
Do you even still need
to go to the clinic?

264
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:27,166
I don't think so,
but apparently it's complicated.

265
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:33,297
Actually, Mizuki asked
if you could come with me next time.

266
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,256
What?

267
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,257
Me?

268
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,343
She wants to ask you
how things are at home.

269
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:42,181
You don't need to talk
about things you don't want to.

270
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,933
You're not the patient after all…

271
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,438
Sorry.

272
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,357
- I know you're busy. I can decline.
- No.

273
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,611
- I'll do it for you.
- Really?

274
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,696
I'll go with you.

275
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,282
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

276
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,038
What were you talking about with Nozomi?

277
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,581
Hmm?

278
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,208
It's a secret.

279
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,460
That's not fair!

280
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,507
KOBE

281
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,627
Did you find anything?

282
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,462
No.

283
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,673
I see.

284
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:01,969
In that case,
all we have left is unidentified persons.

285
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:10,310
Masato Kamishiro never lived in Kobe.

286
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,688
<i>I was in elementary school</i>

287
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,525
<i>when we moved from Tokyo to Kobe</i>
<i>because of my dad's work.</i>

288
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,736
<i>I was there when the earthquake happened.</i>

289
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,865
<i>Is it all lies?</i>

290
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,903
Hey…

291
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,575
who is Masato Kamishiro really?

292
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,431
What?

293
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,711
Akane!

294
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,547
Akane!

295
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,717
- Welcome back!
- Thanks.

296
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,344
I bought you food.

297
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,322
I thought I was going to die!

298
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:13,243
Akane, don't say things like that lightly.

299
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,911
Okay!

300
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,728
Oh?

301
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,146
We're home!

302
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,231
- Welcome back!
- You're back!

303
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,282
What are you eating?

304
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,540
Why is this here?

305
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,250
- I bought it.
- I see.

306
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,046
You stole it again, huh?

307
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,548
Stealing such stupid things!

308
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,550
Why can't you go steal money instead!

309
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,095
- Toshiki!
- You…

310
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,723
Keep out of this!

311
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,933
Huh?

312
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,603
What are you doing? Huh?

313
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,816
Tami! Enough!

314
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,318
Get off!

315
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,572
Ridiculous!

316
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,743
Why do I have to discipline
someone else's child?

317
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,829
Hey.

318
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,623
Give me your arm.

319
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,250
Your arm!

320
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,502
Your arm! See!

321
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,797
Punishment.

322
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,220
- Stop it!
- Hey!

323
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,554
That's enough!

324
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,100
Toshiki, it's your fault. Apologize!

325
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,227
No!

326
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,273
Please, be good!

327
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:09,651
For me! I can't survive without Tami!

328
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,779
You need him, too! We're dead without him!

329
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,906
We're not.

330
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,075
What are you whispering about?

331
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,868
- Hey!
- Fine then!

332
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,454
Stay outside until you apologize!

333
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,082
You too, Akane!

334
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,834
- No!
- Come on!

335
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:36,970
Why can't you discipline
your kids properly?

336
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,389
I said I'm sorry! Stop being so angry!

337
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,682
I'm so irritated!

338
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,809
Hey, no!

339
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,352
Let me shower first!

340
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,729
- Hey!
- But you smell good.

341
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,314
You smell so good!

342
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,190
- I said, no!
- Nobuko…

343
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,984
- Come on, now.
- Hey!

344
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,236
Why not? Huh?

345
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,450
It's no use.

346
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,579
- Are you cold?
- Yes.

347
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,419
Huh? What's happening?

348
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,509
Akane!

349
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,843
Toshiki!

350
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,178
Get out!

351
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:09,229
Toshiki!

352
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,231
Toshiki?

353
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,484
Akane…

354
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,336
Mom?

355
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,130
Where's mom?

356
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,800
Guys! It's too dangerous here!

357
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,552
We need to evacuate!

358
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,345
Mom will be fine!

359
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,432
Please take my sister! I'll follow soon!

360
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,559
- Okay.
- No! I want to stay too!

361
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,893
Listen to me!

362
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,021
- Toshiki!
- Let's go!

363
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,071
Mom!

364
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,826
Mom?

365
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,995
Mom!

366
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,965
Hey! Over here!

367
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,468
She can't be saved!

368
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,472
Hurry, help me!

369
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,556
Come on!

370
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,768
What are you doing? Hurry!

371
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,314
Use a stick as leverage and move this!

372
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,703
Hurry up!

373
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,205
You idiot!

374
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,876
You'll die anyway.

375
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,379
What?

376
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,217
But I won't be satisfied with that!

377
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,262
Hey…

378
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,849
What on earth are you…

379
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,646
Hey!

380
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,753
Hmm?

381
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,966
I've never seen you make that face before.

382
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,218
Where did you go?

383
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,806
To my childhood.

384
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,936
My mom and my dad were there.

385
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,273
I see.

386
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,320
And you?

387
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,158
I was walking around town

388
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,955
and no one was around except for us two.

389
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,457
Hmm…

390
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,651
IWATE PREFECTURAL TOKOHA HOSPITAL

391
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,624
<i>"Before the day ends,</i>

392
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,628
<i>you will depart</i>
<i>somewhere far away, my sister.</i>

393
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:08,051
<i>Sleet has fallen,</i>
<i>and outside is oddly bright.</i>

394
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,055
'Please bring me some sleet.'

395
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,768
From the reddish,
horrifyingly gloomy clouds,

396
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,021
the thick sleet comes down relentlessly.

397
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,858
'Please bring me some sleet.'

398
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,321
To collect the sleet for you,

399
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,616
I took two chipped ceramic bowls

400
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,536
with blue water-shield patterns on them,

401
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,749
and ran outside like a stray bullet.

402
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,753
Into the dark. Into the icy rain.

403
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,590
'Please bring me some sleet.'"

404
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,760
GOOD-LUCK CHARM

405
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,376
Minamizawa…

406
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,755
you're amazing.

407
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,194
Good morning.

408
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,448
Long time no see. I thought you were dead!

409
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,033
Don't say that.

410
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,617
You're early.

411
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:00,913
I had to work all night
because no one was helping me.

412
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:06,753
Our sales have plummeted,
and I'm so worried we might go bust.

413
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,046
We'll be fine.

414
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,881
Okay.

415
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:15,053
I'm counting on
your celebrity news articles then!

416
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:19,348
I'll write as many as you want
once I'm done with this.

417
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,852
You're still on that?

418
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,980
Minamizawa succeeded
in revealing a monster.

419
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,565
What?

420
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,110
She protected this data with her life.

421
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,405
What data?

422
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,075
Data collected on Masato Kamishiro.

423
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,553
<i>I'm proud to call you my brother.</i>

424
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:01,641
I've had such a shitty life
but I'm about to start over!

425
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,893
Damn it!

426
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:07,146
Masato, we'll meet again
when you're a better man.

427
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,856
<i>What is it you want?</i>

428
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,109
This is Masato.

429
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,028
<i>Masato Kamishiro is…</i>

430
