1
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,618
Hmm?

2
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,662
Oh, it's nothing.

3
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,332
- Do you want seconds?
- Yeah!

4
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:49,299
- So, work's going well then?
- You can tell?

5
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,717
Kind of.

6
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,764
We had some issues,
but we managed to pull through.

7
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,975
It was a huge task.

8
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,602
I see…

9
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,021
Everything's going well…

10
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,399
I think we're almost there.

11
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,996
Ms. Momose?

12
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,874
Hello?

13
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,170
No, I haven't.

14
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,465
What?

15
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:41,434
<i>The body of Ms. Iroha Koizumi was found</i>
<i>in a bush in Asaoka early this morning.</i>

16
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,604
<i>- She was found completely naked.</i>
- No…

17
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,148
What's wrong?

18
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,525
Ms. Koizumi…

19
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:54,697
<i>Due to the choke marks, the police are</i>
<i>investigating it as a murder case.</i>

20
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:59,702
<i>- Her belongings haven't been found yet…</i>
- Why?

21
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:04,165
<i>She worked</i>
<i>at a famous patisserie in Asaoka,</i>

22
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,835
<i>but apparently she was absent</i>
<i>without leave yesterday.</i>

23
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:11,256
<i>It is believed that she was involved</i>
<i>in an incident during that time.</i>

24
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,427
Get back, please! Get back!

25
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,513
- Get back! Come on!
- Ouch!

26
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,765
What is your problem! So violent!

27
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,977
- There were rumors about him!
- Really?

28
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,438
- Look!
- There he is!

29
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,149
- There!
- That's him!

30
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,943
- Get back, people!
- He did it?

31
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,778
- How awful.
- So creepy!

32
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,239
- Mio.
- Ms. Momose!

33
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,407
What's going on?

34
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,993
He's being investigated
as a person of interest.

35
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,871
I can't believe this. Our chef…

36
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,915
There's no way…
We don't know if he did it yet.

37
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,208
True, but…

38
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,420
What's going to happen to the shop?

39
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,220
Why me?

40
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,517
You two were arguing over money,
were you not?

41
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,855
We've seen the messages
between you and her.

42
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,858
I see.

43
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,611
That was on her.

44
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,322
What?

45
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,240
Nothing.

46
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,494
She was blackmailing you.

47
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,790
We know it all already.
We've seen the video, too.

48
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,337
I didn't kill her, though! How could I…

49
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,965
We found semen inside the victim.

50
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,927
It's not mine.

51
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,599
Can you cooperate with us
until we get the result of the DNA test?

52
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,486
- Hey!
- Ouch!

53
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,863
- Hello.
- How's it going?

54
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,158
He claims he's innocent
but he'll cave soon.

55
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,994
- I wouldn't be so sure.
- What do you mean?

56
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,789
I bet he killed the journalist, too.

57
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,667
Well, let's see what the test says.

58
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,503
<i>It's been three days since the incident.</i>

59
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:17,757
<i>The patisserie remains closed</i>
<i>while the chef's questioning continues.</i>

60
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,177
<i>Chef Oyamada is also suspected</i>

61
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,889
<i>of being involved in the murder</i>
<i>of a female journalist last month,</i>

62
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,225
<i>and is under thorough investigation.</i>

63
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,813
<i>Chef Oyamada lives above this patisserie…</i>

64
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,147
Oh…

65
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,651
How long are you going
to stand there looking like that?

66
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,319
Sorry.

67
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,697
You talked to the police, right?

68
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,867
- I have.
- You have to leave it to them, then.

69
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,828
Don't stress too much.

70
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,081
You're right.

71
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,335
Maybe I should look for a new job.

72
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,130
I'd say take it easy for now

73
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:02,302
and think about it
when we get back from our trip.

74
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,306
Okay. Thank you.

75
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,226
Hey, can you get back early today?

76
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,144
Hmm?

77
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,979
I…

78
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,106
I feel really anxious.

79
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,566
About what?

80
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,610
I don't know.

81
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,575
Don't worry.

82
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,495
- I'll come back early.
- Thank you.

83
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,458
Smile!

84
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,251
Brightly!

85
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,212
I'll try!

86
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:28,387
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY TRIP TO SAIKO

87
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:23,276
Oh, no. You're leaving already?

88
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,695
I have a meeting.

89
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:31,367
- I wish you could stay longer.
- I apologize.

90
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,413
I would love to be with you
all the time if I could.

91
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,541
I need to work hard to make it possible.

92
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,085
I see.

93
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,881
How's it going starting a new business?

94
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,967
Everything's going well.

95
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,928
Hmm… You're lying.

96
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,974
I know you too well, Toru.

97
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,478
So, tell me what's going on.

98
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,896
No…

99
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,315
I can't cause you any more trouble.

100
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:07,820
- I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
- I don't care about the money!

101
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,247
The investor I'm talking to
has demanded unreasonable terms.

102
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:23,836
See? I did warn you, didn't I?

103
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,008
You need to consider
more than one investor to create

104
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,885
a competitive environment.

105
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,679
- I guess you're right.
- Here.

106
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,599
So…

107
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,393
Let me invest.

108
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,813
- What?
- How much do you need?

109
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,440
Ten million yen?

110
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,984
- Twenty million?
- No, I can't accept it.

111
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:52,073
You know, I have an eye for people.

112
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:55,243
I know you're the real deal.

113
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,455
So I need to claim you
as mine while I can.

114
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,291
Are you sure?

115
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,837
Of course! But just promise me…

116
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,633
Don't ever lie to me.

117
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,428
Understood.

118
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,516
Everything's going well!

119
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,728
Yeah.

120
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,160
You're home is something.

121
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,288
Were they all your pets?

122
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,668
It makes you look like
a corpse-loving psycho killer!

123
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,920
Not corpses.

124
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,840
I've given them a second life.

125
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,635
I wouldn't repeat that to others.

126
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,220
It's creepy!

127
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:02,768
Can you let me go already?
Why would I kill her?

128
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,981
I…

129
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,234
- I lov--
- Okay.

130
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,945
Here's your savior!

131
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,992
- The test results.
- Okay.

132
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,293
See? I told you!

133
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,421

00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,991
I'll wait for your call, Masato.

180
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:33,706
CUSTOMER PARKING LOT

181
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,298
Hi.

182
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,426
Hello.

183
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,219
Drink?

184
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,348
No, thanks.
I'm working after this so make it brief.

185
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:36,852
Make it brief? That's not possible.

186
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,815
What do you know about me?

187
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,985
Hmm…

188
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,910
Let's say I know who you really are.

189
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,583
Maybe.

190
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,211
Well…

191
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,089
That makes one of us.

192
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,885
We could talk all night.

193
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,141
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

194
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,936
- Can I have what she's having?
- Sure.

195
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,110
You've been to this hotel before,
haven't you?

196
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,904
Yes, I have. On business occasions.

197
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,201
That was business?

198
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,080
<i>It didn't look like business!</i>

199
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,798
You like older women?

200
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,761
She's just an investor.
She invited me to her room for some wine.

201
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,348
So, you don't mind
if I show this photo to Mio?

202
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,229
You must be joking.

203
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,858
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

204
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,907
I think we might be quite similar.

205
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,492
<i>You and I.</i>

206
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,602
You have one too. A gateau invisible.

207
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,395
What?

208
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,106
Nothing!

209
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,985
Even when I first met you,

210
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,447
I could tell that there was
something about you.

211
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:59,703
I knew you and Mio were incompatible
because you're such a bad guy.

212
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,332
And we're compatible?

213
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,751
Who knows.

214
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,551
It's the chef again.

215
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,220
He's so annoying.

216
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,852
He's a creep, you know.

217
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,064
He hires sex workers
on Tuesdays and Fridays,

218
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:31,985
dresses them in the shop's uniform,
and tells them to call him "Chef."

219
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,654
So gross!

220
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,322
Hmm…

221
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:42,162
Also, you know he has a crush on Mio.

222
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,664
I'm sure of it.

223
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,376
Are you okay with that?

224
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,878
No. It's not okay.

225
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,258
Do you really love Mio?

226
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,719
I do.

227
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,265
Liar.

228
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,703
I want to know more about you.

229
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,792
I like you.

230
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,755
You're beautiful.

231
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,013
<i>I'll take you to my hideout sometime soon.</i>

232
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,911
- Come in.
- Thank you!

233
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,248
Wow! What is this place?

234
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,293
This is amazing!

235
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,420
I come here to be alone.

236
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,340
You're the first person I've invited.

237
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,758
Really?

238
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,269
So cute!

239
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,773
- Yellow boxfish.
- Wow…

240
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,567
That's a blackspotted puffer.

241
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,535
- And this plant?
- Don't touch that one.

242
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,665
Aconite. It's highly poisonous.

243
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,999
What?

244
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,668
How scary!

245
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,545
A room of poison.

246
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,881
Huh?

247
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,968
That's why I brought you.

248
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,979
Those with poison
in their veins are beautiful.

249
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,710
You're beautiful.

250
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,921
Thank you.

251
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,632
Smile.

252
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,968
Brightly.

253
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,237
- PAY ME OR I'LL SHARE THE VIDEO LOL
- PLEASE DON'T

254
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,032
- WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE SHOP
- I'LL PAY. PLEASE GIVE ME MORE TIME

255
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,877
You are amazing.

256
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,336
What's going on?

257
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,048
- What?
- Are you doing this?

258
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,886
What's happening? I don't like this.

259
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,890
No! It hurts!

260
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,735
What did you want?

261
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,197
Love…

262
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,240
What?

263
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,369
I wanted to be loved.

264
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,416
Liar.

265
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,509
<i>Hello? Toru?</i>

266
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,303
Masumi?

267
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:02,310
What's wrong? Are you okay?

268
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,187
<i>Um… Yes.</i>

269
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,314
<i>I'm okay.</i>

270
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,150
I…

271
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:13,655
I'm being chased down
by some nasty people.

272
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,908
I need to leave Japan at once.

273
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:20,704
What do you mean? Tell me what happened.

274
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,747
<i>I can't.</i>

275
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,294
<i>I could put you in danger if I told you.</i>

276
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,005
<i>I'm dumping this phone.</i>

277
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,508
- What? Hang on…
<i>- I'll be fine.</i>

278
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,720
I have a friend in Taiwan.

279
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,930
I'll double your investment…

280
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,808
and return it to you.

281
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,561
Don't worry about that now.

282
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,773
- Hey, Toru…
<i>- Let's get married when I get back.</i>

283
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:55,739
We'll have the wedding
at The Ritz-Carlton in Maui.

284
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,247
Everything will work out.

285
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,408
Good evening.

286
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,952
Good evening.

287
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:30,583
Thank you for taking care
of my wife the other day.

288
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,544
No worries.

289
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,762
You first.

290
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,699
Good luck with your job.

291
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,659
Thank you.

292
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,670
- I'm home!
- Welcome back!

293
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:22,761
- Is the bath ready?
- Oh my god, why are you so sweaty?!

294
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,598
I hadn't been exercising much…
so I ran home.

295
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,227
You're kidding! Hurry and wash up!

296
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,906
I worried for nothing. You seem fine.

297
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,784
What do you mean? I'm doing fine!

298
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,328
- Are you taking the meds?
- Not recently.

299
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,830
I'm glad to hear that.

300
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:56,961
You don't often invite me out for lunch
so I thought something had happened.

301
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:02,926
I was feeling down,
but staying at home made it worse, so…

302
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:07,514
- I'm thinking of looking for a new job.
- I see.

303
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:13,102
How's it going with your husband?

304
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,396
- Really good, actually.
- Nice!

305
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,878
Hey…

306
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,215
Is something on your mind?

307
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:43,925
Huh?

308
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,762
No!

309
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,724
Okay.

310
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,893
Cool.

311
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:04,195
I realized recently…

312
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:09,117
how lucky I am that I met Masato.

313
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:16,416
As long as I have Masato. I'm fine.

314
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:25,967
<i>I don't need anyone else in this world</i>
<i>as long as he's there.</i>

315
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:33,349
EVEN MORE CODEPENDENT ON HER HUSBAND

316
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:40,189
BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER

317
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:46,738
POSSIBILITY OF ATTENTIONAL NARROWING

318
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,793
She's gotten worse.

319
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,880
<i>But why?</i>

320
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,625
Nice to meet you.

321
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:47,548
My name's Ishiguro, and I'm a journalist
for <i>Gyokuseki Weekly Magazine</i>.

322
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,638
<i>Gyokuseki Weekly Magazine</i>?

323
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,599
Yes.

324
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:01,562
The journalist, Yuhi Minamizawa,
was my co-worker.

325
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,943
I didn't kill her.

326
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,946
Yes.

327
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:17,537
I was just so happy she liked my cakes,
I kept sending them to her.

328
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,998
I know.

329
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,085
You're not the culprit.

330
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,923
I didn't kill Ms. Koizumi either.

331
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,258
I know.

332
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,593
You are innocent.

333
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,393
I am on your side.

334
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,866
Ms. Koizumi was…

335
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:00,496
a big fan of the sweets I made.

336
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,377
She came to my seminar so many times.

337
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:13,968
Even after she joined the staff,
she'd stay late to study.

338
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,012
A hard worker.

339
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,556
And she was talented.

340
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,062
One day…

341
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:30,068
I couldn't get in touch with her, so…

342
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,362
<i>I went to check on her.</i>

343
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,657
Goodness me.

344
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,132
Ms. Koizumi?

345
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:57,678
Oh, god!

346
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:08,189
<i>Her fiancé had left her</i>
<i>right before the wedding.</i>

347
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,567
She survived…

348
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,530
and came back to work at my shop.

349
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,118
But it was no use.

350
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,955
She wasn't herself anymore.

351
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,420
Why would I kill her?

352
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,840
I…

353
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,303
I loved her.

354
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,226
Even after she had changed.

355
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,106
I see.

356
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,406
Mr. Ishiguro…

357
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,202
you said that I'm innocent.

358
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,664
I did.

359
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,793
Then who did it?

360
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,924
Mio Kamishiro's…

361
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,718
husband.

362
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,804
What?

363
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,726
<i>Masato Kamishiro did it.</i>

364
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,822
He killed both of them.

365
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,826
Wow, this is beautiful!

366
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,287
I bought it for our anniversary trip.

367
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,581
- It's your favorite brand, right?
- Yes!

368
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:52,084
I really wanted this! Thank you so much!

369
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,298
It's so pretty.

370
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:02,511
- It looks good!
- I want to pair it with my clothes!

371
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,536
I will reveal
who he truly is to the world.

372
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,457
So…

373
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,794
please hang in there.

374
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,786
<i>Did you look into her husband?</i>

375
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:11,372
I feel more anxious
the more I look into it.

376
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,624
<i>I need to uncover the truth!</i>

377
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,294
<i>No one's here. It's only the two of us.</i>

378
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,880
<i>He was tapping his foot</i>
<i>a lot at Aya's funeral!</i>

379
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:24,051
<i>- Did you find anything?</i>
<i>- Masato Kamishiro never lived in Kobe.</i>

380
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,013
What?

381
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,556
