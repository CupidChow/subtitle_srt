1
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:07,716
<i>Akane…</i>

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:13,513
If I succeed in my current job,
I'll make a lot of money.

3
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:16,641
<i>Then I can take you</i>
<i>to a hospital overseas.</i>

4
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,894
<i>As long as I have Masato. I'm fine.</i>

5
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,146
DEATH BENEFIT

6
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:23,523
<i>I don't need anyone else in this world.</i>

7
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,067
You're the real deal.

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,777
Let me invest.

9
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,947
<i>So I need to claim you</i>
<i>as mine while I can.</i>

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,783
Wait… Toshiki?

11
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,411
It's me! You don't remember?

12
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,872
Masato! From the orphanage!

13
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,416
- Masato Kamishiro!
<i>- Masato…</i>

14
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,710
<i>It's definitely fate that we met.</i>

15
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,132
<i>I'll live your life from now on.</i>

16
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,426
<i>Masato Kamishiro is…</i>

17
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,179
<i>Toshiki Kanekura.</i>

18
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,391
<i>Being handsome isn't enough</i>
<i>to be a great guy.</i>

19
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:02,145
<i>What you're lacking</i>
<i>is culture and sociability.</i>

20
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:08,318
Masato, let's meet again
when you're a better man.

21
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:18,703
Yuhi!

22
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,081
- Yuhi!
- Hm?

23
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:26,002
Sorry to make you wait! Here you go!

24
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,297
Sorry, I fell asleep.

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,800
Why did you look so happy?

26
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,636
Were you dreaming about your crush?

27
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,805
No, nothing like that!

28
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,556
A certain Mr. Ishiguro?

29
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,351
Stop it!

30
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,603
He's just my supervisor at work!

31
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,146
Is that so?

32
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,732
What about you, Aya?

33
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,776
Any plans for a third marriage?

34
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,152
Well…

35
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,655
I'm kind of done with it.

36
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,325
My health's one reason,

37
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:02,205
and I like the quiet and carefree
lifestyle that I have right now.

38
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,208
I have enough money, too.

39
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,420
Don't say that! That sounds so sad!

40
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,380
I'm sorry!

41
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:14,843
But once you reach a certain age,

42
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,305
you realize there aren't
that many great men in this world.

43
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,935
- That's true.
- Right?

44
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,687
Hi, welcome to…

45
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,730
No way.

46
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,694
Long time no see, Ms. Aya.

47
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,864
Masato?

48
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,033
- Can I sit here?
- Of course!

49
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,744
Oh, my god.

50
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,372
What will you have?

51
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,749
Uh… whiskey with water, please.

52
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,042
Coming right up.

53
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:53,756
<i>It was the first time</i>
<i>they had met in over ten years.</i>

54
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,804
<i>And then a month later they got married.</i>

55
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,224
<i>Masato was the one who proposed.</i>

56
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,898
<i>They had a peaceful married life together.</i>

57
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,525
Sorry for the wait, princess.

58
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,320
Stop calling me that!

59
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,824
<i>Aya was physically weak</i>
<i>due to a chronic heart disease.</i>

60
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,828
<i>But Masato was fully dedicated</i>
<i>to managing her health.</i>

61
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,247
What?

62
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,082
You're closing the bar?

63
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,793
Yeah. It's up for sale already.

64
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,005
I need to put my health first.

65
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,341
- Are you feeling unwell?
- Not at all.

66
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,219
I feel much better since I got married.

67
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,680
Masato's taking such good care of me.

68
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,641
Then why are you closing?

69
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,644
You said you would never close this place!

70
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,062
I am sorry.

71
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,901
I can't believe this. Please reconsider!

72
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,320
I'll be losing my second home!

73
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,283
Masato's the one…

74
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,703
that suggested it.

75
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,294
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,344
<i>That was when I noticed</i>
<i>something was wrong with her.</i>

77
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,014
<i>She was a strong woman.</i>

78
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,312
<i>She didn't need a man in life</i>
<i>and that was how she had lived until then.</i>

79
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,731
I…

80
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,612
I don't think I can live
without Masato anymore.

81
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,866
<i>She wasn't the type of woman</i>
<i>to say things like that.</i>

82
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:52,542
TWO MONTHS LATER, AYA PASSED AWAY.

83
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,880
<i>As she had died</i>
<i>from an acute heart attack,</i>

84
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,510
<i>no one doubted that it was due</i>
<i>to her chronic illness.</i>

85
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,293
<i>After her death,</i>

86
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:40,381
<i>he inherited a lot of money</i>
<i>and got remarried to Mio Kamishiro.</i>

87
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,761
<i>I thought he might</i>
<i>be involved in Aya's death.</i>

88
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,514
<i>I made an excuse by saying</i>
<i>I wanted to hear stories</i>

89
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:53,394
<i>about her as her friend</i>
<i>and relative to contact him,</i>

90
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,147
<i>and conducted my own research on him.</i>

91
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,484
<i>And then…</i>

92
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,112
<i>I found out who he really is.</i>

93
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:10,286
MASATO KAMISHIRO IS…

94
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,615
Hey, Chiko.

95
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:52,870
Masato and I are going
to have a real wedding.

96
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:58,417
It means this happiness
is going to last forever.

97
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,256
- Good morning!
- Morning!

98
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:07,260
- What were you talking about?
- I can't tell you!

99
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,596
- What! Why?
- Sorry!

100
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,892
By the way, our trip starts tomorrow

101
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,020
but no one's coming
to the wedding ceremony, right?

102
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,105
Yeah.

103
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,942
As I said, it will be just the two of us.

104
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,193
No priest, either.

105
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,113
Can I bring her as a witness?

106
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,614
What?

107
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:33,578
I mean, the reason
we're happily together right now

108
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,997
is because of them.

109
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,250
That's true.

110
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,669
You're right.

111
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,422
- Is it a bad idea?
- No.

112
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,507
I like it.

113
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,469
A lot.

114
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,391
I'll ask the hotel just in case
but it should be fine if it's in the cage.

115
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,312
Thanks in advance, Chiko!

116
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,565
We have to leave early tomorrow

117
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,235
so why don't we eat out
tonight after my work?

118
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,445
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

119
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,738
Lucky me!

120
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:16,329
It is true that Aya Kamishiro's health
was stable at the time

121
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,665
and it seemed unlikely
that she would die suddenly.

122
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:24,795
Is it possible that something else
caused the heart attack?

123
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,884
There are possibilities
of unexpected side effects

124
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,930
if she was taking non-prescribed drugs.

125
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,643
Not only drugs.
It could be mushrooms, plants,

126
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:44,690
<i>or even wild animals</i>
<i>with poisons that can kill people.</i>

127
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,237
<i>By antagonizing the effects</i>
<i>of multiple poisons,</i>

128
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,782
<i>you can make the symptoms seem natural…</i>

129
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,284
You could…

130
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,454
I mean, it's all hypothetical, but…

131
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:03,251
with knowledge, it's not impossible.

132
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:07,213
Can we tell from the blood?
Do you have Aya's blood sample?

133
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,510
The disease she had is being studied
so we sent a blood sample

134
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,763
from the time of her death
to a research center.

135
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,642
Blood, huh?

136
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,854
Understood. Leave the rest to us.

137
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,692
Yes. Thank you for your help.

138
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,054
I have nothing to tell you.

139
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,932
As I said, I'm innocent.

140
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,645
Mr. Oyamada.

141
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,734
You said the night before the murder,
you hired a sex worker.

142
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:14,030
Was the condom you used then
provided by the lady?

143
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,907
Of course.

144
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,702
Have you never hired one?

145
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,496
Oh…

146
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,168
I guess paid intercourse is illegal.

147
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,463
I don't care anymore.

148
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,594
Regarding your body fluids
that were found in the murdered victim,

149
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,304
<i>Ms. Iroha Koizumi's body,</i>

150
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,891
a tiny amount of spermicide
component was detected

151
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,644
as a result of another in-depth analysis.

152
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,688
Huh?

153
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,983
It's a drug that kills sperm.

154
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:59,992
We detected it in the condoms
the sex worker's company uses.

155
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,579
What does that mean?

156
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:11,212
<i>The culprit must've taken out</i>
<i>your used condom from the trash.</i>

157
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,174
What…

158
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,301
What on earth!

159
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,101
Mr. Oyamada,

160
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,522
we'll start the investigation
over from scratch.

161
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,535
Thank you.

162
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,454
I'm counting on you.

163
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,718
Aren't the police handing that now?

164
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,178
I'm cooperating.

165
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:05,057
Once everything's resolved,
we'll have an exclusive scoop.

166
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:10,479
Fine. I trust you.
But if this falls through, you're fired.

167
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,149
I don't care.

168
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,943
What Minamizawa was facing was far bigger.

169
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,945
Huh?

170
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:24,285
The data was last updated
around her estimated time of death.

171
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,833
Right up until her death…

172
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,548
My guess is that she went to see
Masato Kamishiro that day

173
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,177
<i>and something happened.</i>

174
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,643
I don't get it.

175
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,563
He's the one who called me over.

176
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,401
Excuse me, we're closing now.

177
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,653
Oh. Okay.

178
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,990
- Here's your check.
- Thank you.

179
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,373
Okay…

180
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:40,778
I wish I could've had
a drink with Mr. Ishiguro instead.

181
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,788
Now's not the time!

182
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,374
I need to compile the data!

183
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,523
MASATO KAMISHIRO IS

184
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,849
COPYING DATA TO SD CARD

185
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,641
What's this?

186
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,311
You're awake!

187
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:48,030
Long time no see, Ms. Minamizawa.

188
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,660
<i>Last time was at the hospital in Iwate.</i>

189
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,708
You are truly amazing.

190
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,461
You even found that hospital!

191
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,976
Right, then…

192
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,491
DELETING DATA…

193
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,998
DATA DELETION COMPLETE

194
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,102
I'm impressed with your research skills.

195
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,356
I deleted all the data, though.

196
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,621
Mr. Ishi… guro…

197
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,555
<i>Masato?</i>

198
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,851
Masato!

199
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,896
Hm?

200
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,565
Oh…

201
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,485
Sorry. I was lost in thought.

202
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,030
- Thinking about work again?
- Yes.

203
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,990
You're right.

204
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,911
Honestly! Can you forget
about it during our trip?

205
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,538
Of course!

206
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,748
I've been working hard for this!

207
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,210
Thank you.

208
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,005
- That was delicious!
- Yeah.

209
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,216
- It really was.
- Right?

210
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,724
Sorry, work call. I need to take this.

211
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,351
It's an annoying customer
so it may take long.

212
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,644
Go home without me?

213
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,688
- What?
- I'm really sorry.

214
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,150
Hello?

215
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,403
Yes, I hope you're well, too.

216
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,363
- Honestly…
- Yes.

217
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,532
Yes.

218
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,451
Okay.

219
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,503
How do you know this number?

220
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,840
Didn't I tell you?

221
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:21,637
In today's world,
there's no information money can't buy.

222
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,521
I underestimated you, Masumi.

223
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,316
Nice to see you again, Toru.

224
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,902
Or should I call you…

225
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,112
Masato?

226
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,283
I see.

227
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:50,207
I won't tell Mio if you can
come with me for a bit.

228
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,795
MASATO: FACING AN ISSUE!
SORRY, I'LL BE BACK BY MORNING

229
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,005
You must be joking.

230
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,541
Well?

231
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,171
Do you feel nostalgic?

232
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,843
This place was filled with our love,

233
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,596
and then it was tainted by our love.

234
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,435
In the end, it was all a lie.

235
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,145
I wasn't lying.

236
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,230
Wow…

237
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,860
You think I'd believe that?

238
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,832
Tie him up.

239
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,428
Masato…

240
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,830
Good evening.

241
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,999
Good evening.

242
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,960
You're alone now, right?

243
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,006
- What is it?
- I need to talk to you.

244
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,383
I'm sorry, but…

245
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,968
It's important.

246
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,723
My husband doesn't want me talking to you.

247
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,309
Your husband…

248
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:19,648
Masato is not the person you think he is.

249
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,865
Are you done yet?

250
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,287
I'm finally wrapping up
my year-long project.

251
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,957
It's 150 million yen.

252
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,459
We'll split it evenly.

253
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,422
You got it all wrong.

254
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,134
I don't care about money.

255
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,683
What I want…

256
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,435
is you.

257
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,773
What's your plan?

258
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,116
Maybe I will…

259
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,378
keep you here as my pet forever?

260
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,216
How very like you.

261
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,803
And I'll make you my slave.

262
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,306
Hmm…

263
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,142
Lick it.

264
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,231
I don't understand.

265
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,067
Toshiki Kanekura?

266
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,237
It's the truth.

267
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,489
All of it.

268
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,076
It's who he truly is.

269
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,713
You said you're a journalist, right?

270
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,007
Yes.

271
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,636
Are you allowed to tell me this?

272
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,931
No.

273
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,226
It's unprofessional and unethical.

274
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:26,608
But as a human being,
I can't let him kill you.

275
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,946
You think I'm in danger?

276
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,827
You have life insurance, right?

277
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:52,300
- I think he's trying to--
- Mr. Ishiguro.

278
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,649
Masato isn't…

279
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,777
that kind of person!

280
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,282
Don't ever talk to me again!

281
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,913
Come on.

282
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,023
Amazing…

283
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,878
What the hell?

284
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,550
You won't shoot me.

285
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,907
Don't move!

286
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,852
I thought so.

287
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:20,990
Ms. Masumi!

288
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,284
What are you doing?

289
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,619
Kill him!

290
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,519
Stop right there!

291
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,654
You can't leave!

292
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,618
Please, don't go!

293
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,830
Please…

294
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,876
Please…

295
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,548
I love you.

296
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,052
I really love you.

297
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:11,142
This isn't real love.

298
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:19,400
Which is why I'll let you live.

299
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,264
Welcome back.

300
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,644
Thanks.

301
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,272
Did work stuff go okay?

302
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,774
Yeah.

303
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,360
No need to worry now.

304
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,362
I'm glad.

305
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,656
Do you want to rest?

306
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,658
No.

307
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,993
Let's leave now.

308
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,873
While I'm riding a high.

309
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,668
Okay.

310
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,093
Sorry, it'll be uncomfortable for a bit.

311
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,143
Nozomi.

312
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,271
- Good morning!
- Morning.

313
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,942
- You're leaving?
- Huh?

314
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,528
Uh… yes.

315
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:14,075
We're going to be a real married couple!

316
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,414
Let's go, Mio.

317
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,082
Okay.

318
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,886
Bye.

319
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,189
- Mio!
- Hmm? Oh!

320
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,599
<i>He's going to kill Mio</i>
<i>and make it look like a suicide.</i>

321
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:23,478
<i>You in your youth, huh?</i>
<i>There's so much I don't know.</i>

322
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,731
<i>The prime suspect is Masato Kamishiro.</i>

323
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,650
<i>Your life belongs to me.</i>

324
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,111
That's enough, Toshiki Kanekura.

325
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,279
You were right.

326
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,365
<i>That man isn't the man I know.</i>

327
