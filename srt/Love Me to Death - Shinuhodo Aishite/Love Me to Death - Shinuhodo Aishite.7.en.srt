00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:07,340
<i>Akane…</i>

2
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:13,513
<i>If I succeed in my current job,</i>
<i>I'll make a lot of money.</i>

3
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:17,308
<i>Then I can take you</i>
<i>to a hospital overseas.</i>

4
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:21,062
As long as I have Masato. I'm fine.

5
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:26,693
<i>I don't need anyone else</i>
<i>in this world as long as he's there.</i>

6
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:31,948
<i>Yuhi was trying to uncover a case</i>
<i>and was murdered.</i>

7
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,367
<i>Masato Kamishiro is…</i>

8
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,745
<i>Toshiki Kanekura.</i>

9
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,080
You are truly amazing.

10
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,916
<i>You even found that hospital!</i>

11
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:48,089
Mr. Ishi… guro…

12
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,634
So, I need to uncover the truth.

13
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,434
<i>You have life insurance, right?</i>

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,854
- I think he's trying to--
- Mr. Ishiguro.

15
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,943
Masato isn't…

16
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,489
that kind of person!

17
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,911
<i>Listen in on this segment</i>
<i>for some parenting tips</i>

18
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,955
<i>from myself, a mother of three boys!</i>

19
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,583
<i>First up, from pen name Tefu-tefu!</i>

20
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,835
<i>"Hello, Kokomi!"</i>

21
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,086
<i>Hi!</i>

22
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,257
<i>"I'm a mother of a boy</i>
<i>who's almost a year old.</i>

23
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:35,178
<i>Recently, mealtime with him</i>
<i>has been such a pain.</i>

24
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:39,891
<i>If he finishes his plate,</i>
<i>he bangs on the table, demanding more.</i>

25
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:43,978
<i>But he also often grabs his food</i>
<i>and throws it to the floor…"</i>

26
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,316
- You didn't have to turn it off.
- Huh?

27
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,321
I went to see a gynecologist
the other day.

28
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:58,326
They told me we shouldn't give up yet.

29
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,996
Is that so?

30
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,877
When we go back,
I want to try fertility treatment.

31
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:09,963
Is that okay?

32
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,802
Of course.

33
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,762
Are you sure?

34
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,347
Yeah.

35
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,350
I'm sure.

36
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,103
Very much so.

37
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,537
NOVEMBER 17-19TH
TRIP TO SAIKO LAKE, BRILLIANTS HOTEL

38
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,834
It's beautiful.

39
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,088
Yeah…

40
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,095
Hey…

41
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,014
Yes?

42
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,949
Morning.

43
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,453
Good morning.

44
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,538
- You're up early.
- Yeah.

45
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,540
I was getting everything ready!

46
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,376
We're leaving after breakfast.

47
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,585
Okay.

48
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,122
Are you okay to drive?

49
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,999
You didn't sleep much.

50
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,250
I'm fine!

51
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,254
I often didn't sleep for days
when I was young.

52
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,340
You in your youth, huh?

53
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,467
I can't imagine it.

54
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,679
There's so much I don't know.

55
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,348
Well, I never told you.

56
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,144
You never asked.

57
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,648
I want to know more about you.

58
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,067
Okay. Ask me anything.

59
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,321
Hmm, let me think…

60
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,533
What did you want to be when you grew up?

61
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,995
Uh, well…

62
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,956
Huh?

63
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,889
Hey, Masato… huh?

64
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,957
What was that?

65
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,543
I wanted to be…

66
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,837
an F1 driver!

67
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,507
Seriously? What was that?

68
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,760
Sorry! I wanted to surprise you a little.

69
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,846
- And that truck was in our way.
- My goodness…

70
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,600
- Don't do that again, it's dangerous!
- I'm sorry.

71
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,437
I feel like I don't
understand you very well.

72
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,982
You'll start to understand.

73
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,819
Hurry!

74
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,031
The research center has found

75
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:52,495
trace amounts of aconite and fugu poison
from Aya Kamishiro's blood sample.

76
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,582
Her death will be reinvestigated
as a homicide.

77
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:02,755
The prime suspect is now Masato Kamishiro.

78
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,008
The investigation headquarters
has turned into a madhouse.

79
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,718
Thank you.

80
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,555
<i>You've done an amazing job.</i>

81
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,890
It was Minamizawa, not me.

82
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,309
<i>Where are you now?</i>

83
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,397
I was tracking Masato Kamishiro's car,
but I lost him.

84
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,443
Hey, don't put yourself in danger!
We'll head your way.

85
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:28,030
We'll track your phone's GPS
so don't turn it off.

86
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,323
<i>Where are you?</i>

87
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,951
Near Aokigahara.

88
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,622
<i>He's going to kill Mio</i>
<i>and make it look like a suicide.</i>

89
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,249
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

90
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,720
- Sorry!
- Be careful.

91
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,639
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

92
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,185
The chapel's through the woods.

93
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,062
It's a bit of a walk, so let's rest first.

94
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,189
Okay.

95
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,032
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

96
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,890
It's so quiet.

97
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,519
It really is.

98
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,067
It feels like time…

99
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,945
has frozen for everyone but us.

100
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,079
Mio…

101
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,872
Yes?

102
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:07,630
Would you die with me if I asked you to?

103
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,515
Yeah.

104
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,643
If I can be with you.

105
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,110
I was kidding.

106
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,822
Seriously…

107
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,635
Ouch!

108
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,061
Oh, okay. She's not back at the hotel?

109
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,271
Yes.

110
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,900
I lost sight of my wife near Aokigahara.

111
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:38,364
She's been emotionally
unstable lately so I'm worried.

112
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,659
Uh, no, it's okay.

113
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:47,206
I'll try again but if I can't find her,
I'll file a search request.

114
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,582
I'M SORRY

115
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,875
Yes.

116
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,003
Yes. Okay.

117
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,965
I'M SORRY

118
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,014
Okay, yes.

119
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,058
I'll contact you right away.

120
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,102
Thank you.

121
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,647
Yes.

122
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,442
Goodbye.

123
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,988
Why?

124
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,074
Huh, weird.

125
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,035
Was the drug too weak?

126
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,329
Masato…

127
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,874
What's going on?

128
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,463
You could've died peacefully
if you stayed asleep.

129
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,673
I…

130
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,384
I'm going to die?

131
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,344
Yeah.

132
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,055
Why?

133
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,229
For someone you love.

134
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,693
Are we dying together?

135
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,237
I can't die just yet.

136
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:06,243
I'll have money to spend
thanks to you, and your love.

137
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,664
You have life insurance, right?

138
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,293
So…

139
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,421
it was true.

140
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,177
You've attempted suicide before,
so this'll be believable.

141
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,638
Come on.

142
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,058
Go back to sleep.

143
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,519
- No!
- Why?

144
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,524
I don't want to die alone.

145
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:43,531
You tried to kill yourself a year ago!

146
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,450
You were alone.

147
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,702
But I saved you.

148
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:55,209
Your life belongs to me.

149
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:04,343
Also, you can't live without me, right?

150
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,054
Well?

151
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,066
We had a great year together, right?

152
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,824
It was amazing.

153
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,910
It was like a dream.

154
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,081
Then…

155
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,251
isn't that enough?

156
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,427
Open your mouth.

157
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,364
What are you doing?

158
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,326
That's enough,

159
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,120
Toshiki Kanekura.

160
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,080
What?

161
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,999
Who's that?

162
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,266
Masato…

163
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:21,063
He is not the person you think he is.

164
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,524
Why?

165
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,777
We need to leave now!

166
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,489
- No!
- Do you want to die?

167
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,367
Don't you get it yet?

168
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,579
That man wants to kill you!

169
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,662
Akane?

170
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,512
Akane!

171
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,233
Akane?

172
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,742
Akane!

173
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,653
Who are you?

174
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,030
Huh?

175
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,283
Who are you?

176
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,914
A friend of Akane's?

177
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,333
Um… Yes.

178
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,795
Well, not really a friend.

179
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,463
Uh…

180
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,217
What the hell?

181
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,761
She was a call girl?

182
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,055
I'm sorry.

183
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,516
I thought you knew.

184
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,268
She never told me.

185
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:11,150
So her working at a bar
and aiming to work in childcare.

186
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,194
Was it all a lie?

187
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,364
Not all of it!

188
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:22,494
She was studying hard
so she could pass the exam

189
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,747
to qualify as a daycare worker
and go see you.

190
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,882
We needed money.

191
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,967
We all thought…

192
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,846
the best idea was to sell ourselves.

193
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,226
Akane said she didn't want to bother you.

194
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:55,235
Also, she was dating
our driver, Ryuji, and…

195
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,363
she spent a lot of money on him.

196
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,243
So, the baby is…

197
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,662
I think so.

198
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:10,083
Akane wasn't used
to someone being kind to her

199
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,752
so she fell for him.

200
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,216
I did tell her many times
to break up with him!

201
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,764
But she'd always look troubled and say,

202
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,644
"I'm exactly like my mother, I guess."

203
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,273
But…

204
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,943
I don't think it was suicide.

205
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,616
Really?

206
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,706
That day, I went to see Akane
to have a meal together before my shift.

207
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,128
- Get off of me!
- Wait, Ryu!

208
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,756
- Stop bothering me, okay?
- Wait!

209
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,467
- Sorry! Don't worry, I'm fine!
- Okay.

210
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,219
Ryu!

211
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,430
- Don't follow me!
- Hang on a second!

212
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,974
Go away!

213
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,725
Ryu, wait!

214
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,688
- Abort it! You don't know whose it is!
- It's yours!

215
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,940
- How do you know?
- A woman's instinct!

216
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,817
You're getting on my nerves!

217
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,195
Huh?

218
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,791
<i>The driver said</i>
<i>Akane dashed out all of a sudden.</i>

219
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:38,755
Ryuji said she dashed out
saying she'd rather die

220
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,632
than break up with him.

221
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,389
When you asked me

222
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,811
if I'm Akane's friend,
I couldn't answer properly.

223
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,148
But I am her friend.

224
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:02,821
Despite how I am,
Akane stayed friends with me.

225
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,490
Which is why…

226
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:10,162
I'm scared of the police but I'll go…

227
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,664
and give a statement.

228
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,210
No need to go to the police.

229
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,921
What?

230
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:26,094
Don't tell them anything.

231
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:34,936
STAY FOR THREE HOURS 2,800~ YEN

232
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,830
- Room 205. Call me if anything happens.
- Okay!

233
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,711
- See you later.
- See you.

234
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,469
Who are you?

235
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,688
If you want to keep your balls, answer me.

236
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,024
Yes… Yes, I will!

237
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,361
Did you push Akane?

238
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,322
No.

239
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,326
Hey.

240
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,830
Lie, and I'll kill you.

241
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,124
No.

242
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,838
No! No, I didn't!

243
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,431
Tell me the truth and I'll let you go.

244
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,231
I pushed her!

245
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,068
But I wasn't trying to kill her!

246
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,904
Abort it! You don't know whose it is!

247
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,031
- It's yours!
- How do you know?

248
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,699
A woman's instinct!

249
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,492
You're getting on my nerves!

250
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,414
It's the truth! I didn't mean to.

251
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,082
Please!

252
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,419
I only wanted her to lose the baby!

253
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,337
Truly!

254
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,910
Where…

255
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,919
Where am I?

256
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,606
DETECTIVE TOMIZAWA

257
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,194
<i>It's that guy's phone.</i>

258
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,574
Oh, right!

259
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,789
I need to kill those two!

260
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,305
What's going on?

261
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,309
Shit! His GPS got cut off!

262
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:27,562
- Maybe he turned off his phone?
- Why would he?

263
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,813
Oh, Kamishiro?

264
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,941
- Come on, speed up!
- Yes!

265
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,929
Let's take a break.

266
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,933
Where are we?

267
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,394
I don't know.

268
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,104
I lost my phone.

269
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,565
Are you sure you don't have yours?

270
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,861
I think Masato has it.

271
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,280
Damn it!

272
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,200
Am I…

273
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,036
still alive?

274
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,705
Yes, you are.

275
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,749
I just…

276
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,252
want to die.

277
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,838
Don't say that.

278
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,738
But how?

279
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,708
- That's…
- Masato gave me this bag!

280
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,009
A GPS device.

281
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,178
I should've known.

282
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:24,971
What?

283
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,599
I'm sorry.

284
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,059
You were right.

285
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,897
That man isn't the man I know.

286
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,736
He had me fooled all along.

287
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,739
I feel so stupid.

288
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,077
Mio?

289
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,121
I'm…

290
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,499
fine now.

291
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,213
Chiko. I'm so sorry.

292
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,267
Huh?

293
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,833
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

294
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,227
That's weird.

295
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,118
I see…

296
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,053
Go live freely.

297
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,043
We were here before.

298
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,336
Oh, no.

299
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,632
We should stay put once it's dark.

300
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,803
Let's go rest in the cabin we saw earlier.

301
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,767
It's too dangerous now.

302
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:19,437
- We can resume the search at daybreak.
- No way!

303
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,065
The GPS cut off in here!

304
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:25,276
- He's definitely in there somewhere!
- We can't, okay?

305
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,445
Someone else could go missing!

306
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:30,239
Please! It's a matter of life and death!

307
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,057
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

308
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,941
You need to rest.

309
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,777
Yes.

310
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,453
Can you come next to me?

311
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,333
I'm scared.

312
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,399
I'm sorry.

313
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,111
I…

314
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,697
I was awful to you.

315
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,951
It's okay.

316
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,289
You were right to be suspicious of me.

317
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,500
Thank you.

318
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,758
I didn't do it for you.

319
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,219
He…

320
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,974
He killed someone important to me.

321
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:29,025
The one who's cornered is him, not us.

322
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,027
The police are on it.

323
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,739
So, we just need to be patient.

324
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:37,909
Okay.

325
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,855
