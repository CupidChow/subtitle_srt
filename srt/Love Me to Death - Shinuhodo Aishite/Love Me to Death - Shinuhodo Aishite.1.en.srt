<i>"From the reddish,</i>
<i>horrifyingly gloomy clouds,</i>

00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:19,269

3
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:24,107
<i>'Please bring me some sleet.'</i>

4
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:30,196
<i>To collect the sleet for you,</i>

5
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:34,367
<i>I took two chipped ceramic bowls</i>

6
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,913
<i>with blue water-shield patterns on them,</i>

7
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:44,627
<i>and ran outside like a stray bullet.</i>

8

<i>Into the dark.</i>

9
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,632
<i>Into the icy rain.</i>

<i>'Please bring me some sleet.'</i>

11
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,126
- Good morning!
- Oh, morning!

12
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,171
- Start eating, I'm just making coffee.
- Okay!

13
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,174
Thank you for breakfast.

14
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:39,933
<i>This is the scene of the murder</i>

<i>Yuhi Minamizawa,</i>
<i>a journalist for a weekly magazine</i>

16
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:48,358
<i>was strangled to death here</i>
<i>on the 20th of this month.</i>

17
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,527
<i>Ms. Minamizawa's sudden death was…</i>

18
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,196
They still haven't found the culprit?

19
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,115
Wasn't she your customer?

20
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,408
She only came a few times.

21
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,453
She seemed lovely.

22
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,247
You need to be careful, too.

23
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,791
The murderer could be in this area.

24
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,584
<i>Her body was in a suitcase…</i>

25
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,088
- So, have you decided?
- What?

26
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,341
Where to go for our wedding anniversary.

27
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,593
Oh, yes.

28
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,429
I'm struggling to decide.

29
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,181
I thought so.

30
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,852
I have some ideas,
so let's discuss them when I get back.

31
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,019
Okay!

32
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,275
<i>A local resident noticed a smell</i>
<i>and reported it to the police.</i>

33
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:35,488
<i>Ms. Minamizawa's body was left</i>
<i>in the suitcase for about five days</i>

34
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,615
<i>and it was badly decomposed.</i>

35
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,493
<i>The police are investigating to see</i>

36
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:44,455
<i>if it was a random killing,</i>
<i>or if she was in some kind of trouble.</i>

37
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,251
I'm sorry I'm away a lot recently.

38
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,545
It's okay, it's work.

39
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,089
Are you worried?

40
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,842
Maybe a little bit.

41
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,595
- Aren't there women on this trip too?
- Yeah…

42
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,723
Okay, I'll message you
ten times a day then!

43
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,434
- No, don't worry.
- I will!

44
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,019
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

45
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,981
- I'll be on my way now.
- Have a safe trip!

- Certainly!
- Thank you for waiting!

51
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,814
Our chef's new creation,

52
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,984
a combination of
Madagascan Vanilla-Mascarpone Cream

53
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,570
and wild rose jelly is finally ready!

54
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,490
- Can I have one of these, too?
- Right away!

55
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,118
- Your chef's amazing!
- I'm sorry. Could I change my order?

56
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,161
Me too!

57
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,372
Oh, I'll need to process a refund…

58
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:11,167
- Not the best timing, Ms. Koizumi.
- Huh? It's not a big deal!

59
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,337
Chef! We need more of those!

60
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,048
Easier said than done!

61
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,970
- Sorry, can you get me one of those?
- Okay.

62
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,767
She's unbelievable!
All she does is suck up to the chef!

63
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,395
Let me ring up your order.

HAD LUNCH AT KYO-HANADA
A TRADITIONAL JAPANESE RESTAURANT

66
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,950
I'D LOVE TO TAKE YOU SOMEDAY

67
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,870
- That looks so good.
- Woah!

68
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,831
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

69
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,916
- Your husband?
- Yes.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,711
- He's in Kyoto on a work trip.
- I see.

71
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,421
Have some of this.

72
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,965
The chef messed it up.

73
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,885
The stupidly long-named
Madagascan Vanilla something or other…

74
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,638
- Thank you!
- Of course!

75
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:10,977
It's jiggly.

76
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,359
- It's delicious!
- Yes.

77
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,406
Great chef, but I wish
he didn't flirt with that brat!

78
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,492
You're quite hard on Ms. Koizumi.

79
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:31,289
- You should be wary of her too, you know!
- What?

80
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,917
Your husband, Masato, was it?

81
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,754
<i>Whenever he stops by after work…</i>

82
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,716
<i>she stares at you two</i>
<i>with this scary look in her eyes!</i>

83
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,135
I think she's jealous.

84
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:47,055
- I doubt that.
- I'm sure of it!

85
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:52,685
When he came by and you weren't in,
she was all over him.

86
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:56,272
I mean, your husband is very handsome.

87
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,776
That type of girl wants what others have.

88
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,695
- Don't tell me that…
- Sorry.

89
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,783
But honestly, you should be more careful.
Don't trust men!

90
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:11,662
Even photos can't be trusted lately,
he might have found it online!

91
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,164
My husband the other day…

92
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,957
- Ms. Momose.
- Hmm?

93
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,170
Please… stop.

94
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,090
Oh god. I'm so sorry.

95
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,009
- I'm sorry! I didn't mean to…
- It's fine.

96
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,012
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

97
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,682
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

98
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,727
The Mont Blanc's great,
but this limited edition one

99
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,646
is amazing so do come again!

100
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,064
- Oh, really?
- Yes!

101
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,900
- I'll come again. Thanks!
- Thank you!

102
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,031
- Is something wrong?
- No…

103
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,367
- Go take a break.
- Okay.

104
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,135
- Sorry!
- What's wrong?

105
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,344
It's nothing…

106
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,014
Can I ask you to taste
my new creation later?

107
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,891
Oh, sure.

108
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,780
- Hey, Yoshioka!
- Yes?

109
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,909
- Did you find out where these were from?
- I think so…

110
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,580
- You think it's an important clue?
- Well…

111
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:40,084
It's strange she bought this many.
She couldn't have eaten it all.

112
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:51,512
- Here you go.
- It looks delicious!

113
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,391
- And I'm the first one to try it?
- Exactly!

114
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,602
But don't say "delicious".

115
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:01,189
Inspire me using your own
unique expressions.

116
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,065
Okay.

117
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,705
Such refined sweetness…

118
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,417
My mouth is filled with happiness.

119
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,793
Yes. And?

120
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,379
- What else can you taste?
- Let's see…

121
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,634
Something spicy?

122
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,551
Impressive!

123
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,553
There's Sansho pepper in it! And?

124
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,472
Uh…

125
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,641
Right.

126
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,941
What's needed for this product to be
even more loved by people?

127
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,067
Uh…

128
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,152
I want you to adore it!

129
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,906
Excuse me.

130
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,869
MASATO
EVERYTHING'S GOING WELL. ARE YOU HOME?

131
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,913
One more bite!

132
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:03,167
Um, my husband's almost home,
so I need to go!

133
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,777
KYO-HANADA

134
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,581
What am I doing?

135
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,087
Huh?

136
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,677
No…

137
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,897
The same photo.

138
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,275
Why?

139
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,326
Who is it?

140
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,290
I'm home!

141
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,499
Huh?

142
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:30,880
- You said you'd be back tomorrow…
- Things went so well that I left early.

143
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,382
I was worried about you.

144
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,760
I see…

145
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,970
I thought you'd be happier to see me.

146
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,597
I'm just startled.

147
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,892
Well, I did want to surprise you.

148
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,894
Sorry to startle you.

149
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:55,196
Hey, the work trip was in Kyoto, right?

150
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,822
Huh?

151
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,741
Yeah.

152
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,411
I brought you back some Kyoto pickles.

153
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,664
Thank you.

154
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,021
I'll see you soon.

155
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,233
Hey, what time do you get back tomorrow?

156
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,819
Uh… early evening, I think.

157
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,279
Okay…

158
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,905
I'm sorry.

159
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,616
The client I saw yesterday
said it was urgent.

160
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,120
- I should've just stayed in Kyoto.
- Yeah…

161
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,875
Wait… What's wrong?

162
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,002
Hey.

163
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:38,257
- That restaurant you mentioned yesterday…
- Kyo-Hanada?

164
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,176
Yeah.

165
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,598
What is it?

166
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,603
Nothing! Promise you'll take me there?

167
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,898
I will. I promise.

168
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,649
- Cool.
- Cool.

169
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,527
All right, I'm off!

170
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,864
- Make sure to lock up at all times.
- Yeah. Take care.

171

Relax your brain.

178
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,736
Clear your mind.

179
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,406
Clear it completely.

180
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,578
Your eyelids are starting to feel heavy.

181
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,967
Open the door in front of you.

182
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:49,263
Can you see a white staircase?

183
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,641
Go down that staircase, and…

184
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,021
You're going back in time. A month ago.

185
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,481
Two months ago.

186
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,027
Go slowly.

187
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,361
Slowly.

188
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,949
A year ago.

189
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,369
What can you see now?

190
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,833
A man.

191
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,463
My husband.

192
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,673
My ex-husband.

193
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,826
ONE NEW MESSAGE

194
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,925
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

195
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,598
- Hey!
- I'm sorry!

196
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,184
You've been coming home
late recently, and…

197
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,936
Yeah, I'm working!

198
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,900
I can't believe this.

199
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:29,196
You don't even work!
How can you accuse me like that?

200
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,156
I'm sorry.

201
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,661
Don't act like a housewife
when you can't even conceive!

202
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:39,289
But the doctor said
we shouldn't lose hope yet…

203
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,041
We've tried so many times!

204
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,086
Just give that back.

205
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,171
Give it back!

206
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,215
If there's nothing to hide,
why can't I look?

207
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,592
You did cheat on me before!

208
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,302
I've had enough of this!

209
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,096
Give it back!

210
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,809
I said, give it back!

211
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,602
Give it to me.

212
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,105
You bitch!

213
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,740
If you don't want me cheating,
try being a more devoted wife!

214
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,035
Please me more, huh?

215
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,766
Are you okay?

216
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,850
Huh?

217
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,477
Yeah.

218
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,564
You get into a trance state
so quickly, Mio.

219
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,775
I struggle to wake you.

220
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,779
- Does that mean I'm gullible?
- Hmm…

221
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,199
I'm not so sure about that.

222
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,409
Let's have tea.

223
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,501
How are things with your current husband?

224
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,629
Does he ever mention
the infertility issue?

225
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,673
No, he says he doesn't want kids.

226
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,219
I actually felt relieved when he told me.

227
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,721
I was able to give up.

228
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,516
Yeah. I'm glad you feel that way.

229
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,935
Hey.

230
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,732
Why did you come here today?

231
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,484
Huh?

232
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,029
Tell me everything.

233
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,448
Come on, we used to be classmates!

234
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,202
I knew you'd know.

235
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:47,417
Masato sent me this photo
when he was on a business trip, but…

236
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,920
I found the same photo online.

237
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,505
What do you think…?

238
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,966
Hmm. Well…

239
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,926
He might have his reasons.

240
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,303
Maybe he just forgot to take one himself

241
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,891
or he couldn't because of his clients,
but wanted to show you the food?

242
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,019
There are so many possibilities.

243
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,315
I want to believe him. But…

244
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,443
Why don't you just ask him then?

245
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,363
Catch him off-guard!
See if he gets tongue-tied.

246
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,323
But…

247
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,909
What if he did lie?

248
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,328
Then you leave the bastard.

249
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,663
It's simple!

250
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,000
It's not that simple.

251
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,751
It is!

252
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,880
There are other men, if you feel lonely.

253
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,882
It's not that simple!

254
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,345
I'm sorry.

255
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,101
So, Mio. Let me ask you…

256
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,189
Is a woman's worth determined by men?

257
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,192
Are we nothing without men?

258
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:57,613
If so, it's an insult to all women.
Wake up!

259
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:05,120
I'm not saying this as your counselor,
I'm telling you as a friend.

260
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,626
Don't get suicidal
just because a guy betrays you.

261
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,419
<i>Never again.</i>

262
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,608
Bye!

263
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,725
Hey!

264
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,518
What are you trying to do?

265
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,562
- Stop it!
- Let go of me!

266
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,314
Please, stop!

267
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,567
Hey, enough!

268
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,128
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

269
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:30,015
I was chasing some wild birds
and I heard a Java sparrow.

270
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,810
I thought it was weird to hear one here.

271
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,022
So I searched…

272
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,816
and found you instead.

273
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,865
That bird…

274
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,911
can't survive here, can it?

275
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,332
The wild birds will bully it.

276
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,460
I knew, but…

277
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,506
I was terrified of dying alone.

278
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,634
Sorry.

279
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,182
I won't ask why.

280
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:18,980
But, I want to stay here
until you feel calm.

281
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,585
Someone broke my trust and betrayed me.

282
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,091
I see.

283
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,219
Half of it was for revenge.

284
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,681
I thought if I died…

285
00:23:54,141 --> 00:24:00,021
he'd have to carry
the burden of guilt forever.

286
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,155
But you won't be alive to see that.

287
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:13,410
And what if he didn't feel guilty at all?

288
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:20,584
If so… you'd really regret it, no?

289
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,338
I would.

290
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,263
Oh!

291
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,616
See?

292
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,537
It wants to live with you.

293
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,968
Hey! Look this way.

294
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,726
- Must be when I fell down earlier.
- Oh, no!

295
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,269
Let me pay for the damage!

296
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,856
- Don't worry. I wanted a new one anyway.
- But…

297
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,069
I really want to return the favor.

298
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,992
Well, in that case…

299
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:41,665
Can I ask you to spend the day with me?

300
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,399
My mom loved this song.

301
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,801
Hello?

302
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,136
Yes.

303
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,848
Right now?

304
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,935
Good morning!

305
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,229
Thanks! You will get extra pay!

306
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,984
- Hi!
- Mio! Thank you for helping out!

307
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,986
- Could you put these out?
- Yes!

308
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,571
Unbelievable…

309
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:23,827
Ms. Koizumi called in absent today,
and said she's going on a trip!

310
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,454
It's absurd! It's definitely with a guy!

311
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,333
I now feel foolish
for taking work seriously!

312
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,628
- When did she say she's coming back?
- Huh?

313
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,005
She said tomorrow.

314
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:41,177
- Hey, what time do you get back tomorrow?
- Early evening, I think.

315
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:45,682
Thank you for waiting!
That will be 1,440 yen.

316
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,727
Oh, no. It's raining!

317
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,272
- Mio, can you get the umbrella stand?
- Okay!

318
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,940
1,500 yen…

319
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,693
- It's pouring down!
- Do you have an umbrella?

320
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,695
No. I'll just run!

321
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:47,035
- Get home safe!
- Thank you. See you!

322
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,841
Mio!

323
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,552
Mio!

324
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,268
Masato?

325
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,606
What… What happened?

326
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:21,611
- My umbrella broke!
- What about your business trip?

327
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,823
- My team members took care of it.
- But…

328
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,367
- Even yesterday, you…
- It's fine.

329
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,453
Hey.

330
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,083
- I need to tell you something.
- Huh?

331
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,463
You were acting a bit strange.

332
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:45,510
So, I checked your search history,
and saw Kyo-Hanada.

333
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,889
I realized I can't hide it anymore.

334
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,477
So…

335
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,481
I'm sorry.

336
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,693
It wasn't a work trip.

337
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,113
But trust me.

338
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,657
I didn't cheat on you.

339
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:16,666
If you can't believe me,
the conversation ends here.

340
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,301
I believe you.

341
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,808
I…

342
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,187
I’m starting a business
with my friends from work.

343
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,064
What?

344
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:45,778
Don't tell anyone!
No one's even told their family yet.

345
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:52,493
If the company finds out,
they'll definitely try to intercept, so…

346
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,371
Are you serious?

347
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,417
I am. Trust me.

348
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:05,006
I've been collecting funds,
meeting potential customers.

349
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:09,385
The last few days, we were at a hotel,
having meetings.

350
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,850
I had no time to eat at restaurants
to be honest.

351
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,604
However…

352
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,273
I promise.

353
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:29,697
Once everything's set up
I will take you to Kyo-Hanada.

354
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,580
I can't wait.

355
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,369
Wow.

356
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,163
- That's a nice piece of meat!
- That's so expensive!

357
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,248
Huh?

358
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:26,087
It's my treat. An apology gift
for making you feel lonely.

359
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,632
Look at this rump steak!

360
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,135
- Wow!
- Wow, so expensive!

361
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,848
It's fine! I'll work twice as hard!

362
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,948
Nice to meet you,
I'm Ishiguro. I just moved in.

363
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,702
I'm Kamishiro. Nice to meet you.

364
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:12,967
Hey…

365
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,594
Huh?

366
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,056
I know that guy.

367
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:19,807
What?

368
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:24,645
<i>He was outside the shop window,</i>
<i>staring inside a few days ago.</i>

369
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,356
He left when our eyes met.

370
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,693
That sounds dangerous.

371
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:43,206
Don't go near him, okay?
Don't even get on the same elevator.

372
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,959
- No need to say hello to him, either.
- Ah… okay.

373
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:51,089
Don't forget, the murderer
hasn't been caught yet!

374
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,049
That's true.

375
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,228
How about going to Saiko Lake
for our anniversary?

376
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,021
- Saiko Lake?
- Yeah.

377
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,149
It's one of the lakes
that surrounds Mount Fuji.

378
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,735
Mount Fuji…

379
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,946
I've only seen it from the train!

380
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:18,199
Amazing views,
especially from the Yamanashi side.

381
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,285
I want to show you that view.

382
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,914
- I want to see it!
- It's decided then!

383
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:32,713
We can also go bird watching.

384
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,173
Sounds good!

385
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:49,689
I don't want any more secrets between us.

386
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,482
Huh?

387
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,527
I never told you…

388
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,655
how I got this burn.

389
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,952
I was in elementary school

390
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:07,707
when we moved from Tokyo to Kobe
because of my dad's work.

391
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:13,337
I was there when the earthquake happened.

392
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,840
The earthquake?

393
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,219
The Great Hanshin earthquake.

394
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,312
It was so cold that day.

395
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:34,859
<i>I was asleep in my futon,</i>
<i>but got woken up by a huge tremor.</i>

396
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,945
<i>I heard a moan,</i>

397
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,490
<i>and I realized that my mom</i>
<i>was dead under a chest of drawers</i>

398
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:45,745
<i>and my dad's bottom half</i>
<i>was crushed under the rubble.</i>

399
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,834
<i>I was so young</i>
<i>and had no strength to help him.</i>

400
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:58,549
The fire spread and my dad told me, "Run!"

401
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,676
"Save yourself!"

402
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,888
That was when…

403
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,266
my arm caught fire.

404
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:12,563
I suddenly got scared,
left my dad behind and ran.

405
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,607
Masato, you don't have to tell me.

406
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,568
I left my dad to die.

407
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,493
The burn on my arm is a reminder.

408
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,788
Which is why…

409
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,292
I couldn't let you kill yourself.

410
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,465
I had to save you.

411
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,520
Thank you.

412
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:11,247
<i>"From the reddish,</i>
<i>horrifyingly gloomy clouds,</i>

413
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,875
<i>the thick sleet comes down relentlessly.</i>

414
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,171
<i>'Please bring me some sleet.'</i>

415
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,760
<i>To collect the sleet for you,</i>

416
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:32,351
<i>I took two chipped ceramic bowls</i>
<i>with blue water-shield patterns on them,</i>

417
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:37,732
<i>and ran outside like a stray bullet.</i>

418
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,902
<i>Into the dark. Into the icy rain.</i>

419
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,367
<i>'Please bring me some sleet.'"</i>

420
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,601
Hi.

421
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,200
<i>- </i>She came to interview us.
<i>- Strange, huh?</i>

422
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,911
Was it to ask Oyamada
about something else?

423
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:35,164
<i>Or was it to approach</i>
<i>Mio Kamishiro for something.</i>

424
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,459
You believe him over me?

425
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,836
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

426
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,047
You're always so upbeat.

427
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,591
<i>It's fun to destroy people's happiness!</i>

428
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,802
