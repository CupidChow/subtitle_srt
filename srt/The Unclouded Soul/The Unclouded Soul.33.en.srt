[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,870
[Episode 33]

3
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,610
Time-Reversal Array.

4
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,530
What are you doing?

5
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:52,410
With our combined power,

6
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,550
we can send you back 10,000 years

7
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,180
to see with your own eyes

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,660
what really happened then

9
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,430
and make your choice again.

10
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,490
Stop this.

11
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,920
Even if I choose 1,000 or 10,000 times,

12
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,310
I would still choose Hong Ye.

13
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,070
Sister,

14
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,490
even if

15
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,100
you don't like me,

16
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,810
you absolutely cannot
make the wrong choice.

17
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,600
Don't worry,

18
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,370
with our three people's power,

19
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,100
we can ensure your safe return.

20
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,780
Once you understand the truth of the past,

21
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,640
you will understand our actions.

22
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,390
Absolutely not!

23
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,730
The last time Xiao Yao
entered time reversal,

24
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,570
even going back a mere 100 years

25
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,900
was extremely dangerous,

26
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,060
and she barely made it back.

27
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,190
We cannot let her take this risk again.

28
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,740
Hong Ye,

29
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,300
if the three of us
joined forces to kill you,

30
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,630
it would be effortless.

31
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,870
But the truth from 10,000 years ago

32
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,110
must not remain hidden.

33
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,530
Xiao Yao,

34
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,940
if you learn the truth of the past

35
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,600
and still want to protect him,

36
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,740
you can use the method
from 10,000 years ago

37
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,020
to seal me again.

38
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,300
I will respect your choice.

39
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,130
We'll stake our lives

40
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,200
to grant you clarity.

41
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,130
Do you dare?

42
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,460
How can I

43
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,900
trust your words?

44
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:15,970
Hong Ye!

45
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:31,490
Teng She.

46
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,940
Sister,

47
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,620
I've always

48
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,680
been the most obedient to you.

49
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,740
Today, I'm begging you.

50
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,290
Go back 10,000 years and see.

51
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,940
I just made a blood oath.

52
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,180
Heaven and earth bear witness.

53
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,620
If there's even a hint of falsehood,

54
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,550
if I have any intention to harm you,

55
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,670
may I, Teng She,

56
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,850
be utterly annihilated.

57
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,470
Seeing your attitude,

58
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,180
if we don't resolve these past grudges,

59
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,420
you won't let this go.

60
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,200
Since this is a personal grudge,

61
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,260
I have a condition.

62
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,660
Go ahead.

63
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:33,860
Before I return,

64
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,210
you must ensure

65
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,370
Hong Ye and Demons' Valley remain safe.

66
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,730
If humans attack,

67
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,659
protecting Demons' Valley
must be your priority.

68
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,450
Okay.

69
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:48,659
Okay.

70
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:50,940
Okay.

71
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,300
In that case,

72
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,520
I'll go seek a resolution.

73
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,860
Otherwise, this constant trouble

74
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,260
will never give us peace.

75
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,430
I only ask that you return safely.

76
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,230
Don't worry,

77
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,500
I still want to eat
the noodles you make every day.

78
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,500
Xiao Yao,

79
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,240
no matter what you see,

80
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,500
my love for you

81
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,330
will never change.

82
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,450
Xiao Yao, why did you come here?

83
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,690
Go back.

84
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,830
Go back now.

85
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,340
What exactly happened
10,000 years ago?

86
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,980
The truth is more than you can bear.

87
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,460
You'll regret seeing it.

88
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,460
If I'm powerless,

89
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,700
I'll pray to the gods.

90
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,100
If I'm powerful,

91
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,909
I'll slay all demons in my path!

92
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,510
[10,000 years ago]

93
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,740
Where am I?

94
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,540
Real gold.

95
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,570
What was I 10,000 years ago?

96
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,140
At least I was wealthy in this life.

97
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,070
Xiao Yao, why have you gotten poorer?

98
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,300
This...

99
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,060
Looks quite impressive.

100
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,810
I wonder what my power is like.

101
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,300
I'm so powerful!

102
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:40,850
Hong Ye?

103
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:43,539
Hong Ye!

104
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,520
What's wrong with you?

105
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:46,580
You...

106
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,300
Hong Ye, wake up.

107
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,420
Hong Ye!

108
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,260
Hong Ye!

109
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,460
You're awake.

110
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,850
Hong Ye.

111
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,610
Demon.

112
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,090
Demon.

113
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,740
I'm Xiao Yao.

114
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,780
Stay back.

115
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,390
Don't come closer.

116
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,180
Stay away!

117
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,180
Why are you acting like this?

118
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,580
I just saved your life.

119
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:23,870
Listen carefully,

120
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,970
I would rather die

121
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,270
than surrender!

122
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,060
If you want to eat a corpse,

123
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,420
then come at me!

124
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:32,570
Put the sword...

125
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,060
Don't move!

126
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,850
I won't move.

127
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,520
Why would I want to eat you?

128
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,870
Because you're a demon!

129
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,540
We humans have been repeatedly

130
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,780
enslaved and bullied by
you demons in this chaotic world.

131
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,070
You've lost count of

132
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,900
how many you've eaten yourself,
haven't you?

133
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,810
How could everything have been reversed?

134
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,320
If Hong Ye was human,

135
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,530
how did he become the Demon King?

136
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,890
And where did

137
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,240
his power come from?

138
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,570
I won't hurt you.

139
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,540
If I wanted to eat you,

140
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,140
I would have done so already.

141
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,550
Did you really save me?

142
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,020
Yes.

143
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,550
If that's the case,

144
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,570
may I leave now?

145
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,730
Fine.

146
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,580
Wait.

147
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,220
Could you tell me

148
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,730
your name

149
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,960
and where you live?

150
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,420
So you want to use me as bait

151
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,300
to find more people.

152
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,120
Why do you think of me as so wicked?

153
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,780
Fine.

154
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,610
Come closer,

155
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,330
and I'll tell you.

156
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,900
You just resemble someone I once knew,

157
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,180
so I wanted to talk with you a bit more.

158
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,270
I never intended to harm you.

159
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,160
[Long Zhi]

160
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,530
Hong Ye!

161
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,490
Xiao Yao!

162
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,660
-Dragon Lord.
-Dragon Lord.

163
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,390
Dragon Lord.

164
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,850
Xiao Yao.

165
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,330
You've successfully
passed the tribulation.

166
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,390
That's wonderful!

167
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,180
You've attained the true form
of the Azure Dragon.

168
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,850
From now on, our dragon clan shall
stand proudly among the universe.

169
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,180
So Azure Dragons really do exist.

170
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,900
Yes, indeed.

171
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,430
Xiao Yao,

172
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,020
you're truly a role model
for our dragon clan.

173
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,690
Xiao Yao,

174
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,090
that skill you just showed

175
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,150
was truly amazing.

176
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,140
Yes.

177
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,570
Dragon clan?

178
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,320
Then who are you?

179
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,690
I'm Long Zhi.

180
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,140
What are you talking about?

181
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,540
My head hurts a bit.

182
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,490
Apart from my name,

183
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,290
I can't remember anything else.

184
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,820
You don't remember?

185
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,060
Well, some get injured, maimed,

186
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,020
or even die
passing the heavenly tribulation,

187
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,880
but this is the first time
I've heard of memory loss.

188
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,430
Do you have any other discomfort?

189
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,380
No, no.

190
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,260
I see.

191
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,570
The heavenly tribulation is perilous.

192
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,540
Some mishaps

193
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,830
are inevitable.

194
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,940
After we finish our business,

195
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,140
whatever you want to know,

196
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,470
I'll tell you everything when we get back.

197
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,610
Congratulations, Dragon Lord,
on overcoming your heavenly tribulation.

198
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,180
attaining the true form of
the Azure Dragon,

199
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,810
and achieving longevity
equal to heaven and earth.

200
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:31,010
Congratulations, Dragon Lord,
on overcoming your heavenly tribulation!

201
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,330
Each demon clan has its own leader.

202
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,260
The dragon clan's cultivation
is the most arduous and lengthy,

203
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,060
making true dragons
extremely rare and precious.

204
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,350
The lowest are snakes.

205
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,610
A snake cultivates for 100 years
to become a python,

206
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,330
a python for 500 years
to become a serpent,

207
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,180
a serpent for 500 years
to transform into a scaled dragon,

208
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,940
and a scaled dragon needs 1,000 years
to become a true dragon.

209
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,850
A dragon cultivates for 500 years
to become a horned dragon,

210
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,570
and another 1,000 years
to become a winged dragon.

211
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,260
The winged dragon was originally
the highest rank in the dragon clan.

212
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,780
But since you're exceptionally talented,

213
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,210
intelligent and diligent,

214
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,810
even if we cultivated together,

215
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,900
I remain stuck at the horned dragon rank,
unable to break through,

216
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,570
while you have successfully
passed another tribulation.

217
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,180
This is

218
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,490
unprecedented for an Azure Dragon.

219
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,140
Is there anything above the Azure Dragon?

220
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,260
You may not remember your past,

221
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,090
but your personality hasn't changed a bit.

222
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,970
Legend has it that above the Azure Dragon
is the Holy Dragon.

223
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,660
If you truly become a Holy Dragon,

224
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,140
you can join the ranks of immortals

225
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,020
and

226
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,020
no longer walk in this mortal world.

227
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,900
Would you really be willing to leave?

228
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,090
So you're saying I'm now the top.

229
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,320
Of course.

230
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,480
Under heaven,

231
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,200
there's probably no demon
who can match you now.

232
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,700
Besides you,

233
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,180
there's probably no one

234
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,580
who could take
the position of Dragon Lord.

235
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,110
Who is the current Demon King?

236
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,560
There are many demon tribes,

237
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,630
ruled separately

238
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,610
with little connection to each other.

239
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,140
Whoever claims to be king

240
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,540
will surely face attacks
from other clans.

241
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,580
This is why

242
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,850
the more powerful the demons become,

243
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,310
the more conflicts arise.

244
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,020
The demons are too strong.

245
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,440
Even if some clans
call someone Demon King,

246
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,260
deep down

247
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,950
they don't truly accept it.

248
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,020
The supreme position

249
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,350
is not easy to maintain.

250
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,780
If you truly wish
to become the Demon King,

251
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,210
it would take considerable effort.

252
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,090
No, no, no.

253
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,090
That's not what I meant.

254
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:33,570
I was

255
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,540
just asking.

256
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,810
Now that you've
successfully passed the tribulation,

257
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,380
tell me

258
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,780
what gift you'd like.

259
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,010
Mortal.

260
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,050
Mortal?

261
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,570
A human.

262
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,300
So you want a slave?

263
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,170
That's easy.

264
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:48,940
If you want one,

265
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,670
not just one,

266
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,850
I can get you hundreds or thousands.

267
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,810
Everyone, look!

268
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,330
Is this...

269
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,190
Is this an annular solar eclipse?

270
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,810
I've only heard about it,

271
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,160
so it really does exist.

272
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,490
I've only heard about it before.

273
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,110
That makes sense.

274
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,090
This celestial phenomenon

275
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,420
marks the emergence of
a divine guardian beast.

276
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,970
It signifies that your identity
as the Azure Dragon

277
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,630
is recognized by the heavens.

278
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,780
This eclipse happened because of me?

279
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,380
Yes.

280
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,810
After successfully
passing the tribulation,

281
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,570
special celestial phenomena occur.

282
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,300
Before, we've seen
landslides and tsunamis.

283
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,330
This annular solar eclipse

284
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,860
has never been seen before.

285
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,270
And shooting stars!

286
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,920
That's the Ao Hen Clan.

287
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,180
With the solar eclipse,

288
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,140
many demons
who rely on sunlight for cultivation

289
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,940
will have their power weakened.

290
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,330
It seems Ao Hen

291
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,750
is taking advantage of this opportunity.

292
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,540
What's the relationship
between Ao Hen and the dragon clan?

293
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,420
Ao Hen usually keeps to themselves,

294
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,380
having no interaction

295
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,710
with other demon clans.

296
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,820
I'll go check it out.

297
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,369
Sun God!

298
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,869
We serve you with devotion!

299
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:18,020
Please bless us, Sun God!

300
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,540
The sunlight dims,

301
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,260
and the Qiong Qi Clan will soon perish!

302
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,450
A great calamity approaches!

303
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,610
Please bless us, Sun God!

304
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,690
Please bless us, Sun God!

305
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,650
Please bless us, Sun God!

306
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,580
Please bless us, Sun God!

307
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,150
With such a disaster today,

308
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,220
why are you still kowtowing?

309
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,660
Our clan is exceptional,

310
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,850
envied by many.

311
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,590
Today we must guard against
demons taking advantage of our weakness.

312
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,570
So it's you.

313
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,100
I won't disappoint you
at a time like this.

314
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,180
You like to challenge others, don't you?

315
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,980
Then accept my challenge today,

316
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,110
and let fate decide who lives or dies.

317
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,950
You treacherous villain!

318
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,190
Even with the sun obscured,

319
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,420
I'll still beat you to a pulp!

320
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,010
The annular solar eclipse is fleeting.

321
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,470
A once-in-a-millennium opportunity

322
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,400
can't be missed.

323
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,250
So even 10,000 years ago,

324
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,910
Ao Hen was just as detestable.

325
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,900
It's time to teach you a proper lesson.

326
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,210
Taking advantage of others' weakness,

327
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,540
have you no shame at all?

328
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,820
The dragon clan actually
has an Azure Dragon now.

329
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,880
Congratulations.

330
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,970
It seems this eclipse is happening
because of you.

331
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,970
I should thank you

332
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,510
for creating this opportunity for me.

333
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,450
Since it's because of me,

334
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,660
I must correct

335
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,390
your bad habit
of plundering in times of trouble.

336
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,530
I've heard that dragons

337
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,730
never meddle in other clans' disputes.

338
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,380
If today the Qiong Qi Clan is destroyed,

339
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,770
I'm just following heaven's will.

340
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,740
Bullshit!

341
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,480
This is the power of the Azure Dragon?

342
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,180
The feeling of defeating
an ancient great demon

343
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,960
is incredibly satisfying.

344
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,520
Blessed by Sun God,

345
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,300
today's grudge

346
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,950
will be avenged today!

347
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,910
Back and forth,

348
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,110
your revenge has already been taken.

349
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,530
I stopped you once

350
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,960
and stopped him once too.

351
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,310
If you don't leave now,

352
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,330
I can only follow heaven's will.

353
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:56,860
Qiong Qi,

354
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,730
you won't always be

355
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,730
as lucky as today.

356
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:04,820
Come back!

357
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,350
Alright.

358
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,690
He's already failed,
going for wool and coming home shorn.

359
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,690
Stop chasing him.

360
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,140
What's the point of all this fighting?

361
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,060
How can I, Qiong Qi, be compared to wool?

362
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,380
Yes.

363
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,010
You're powerful, not wool.

364
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,170
You're a great demon.

365
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,830
Great demon.

366
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,440
I never expected the Azure Dragon's power

367
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,700
to be so overwhelming.

368
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,470
From now on, this world

369
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,710
will likely belong to the dragon clan.

370
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,860
Thank you, Azure Dragon, for saving us!

371
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,590
It was nothing.

372
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,730
Besides, this solar eclipse

373
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:50,900
was caused by me.

374
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,100
Everyone, get up.

375
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,510
Every tribulation

376
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,420
comes with natural disasters.

377
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,750
Fortune or misfortune,

378
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,180
heaven decides each fate.

379
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,710
Xiao Yao,

380
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,580
although you've transformed
into the Azure Dragon,

381
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,770
you shouldn't take

382
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,660
all responsibilities upon yourself.

383
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,320
Otherwise,

384
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,660
wouldn't you be needlessly

385
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,190
bearing many karmic debts?

386
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,890
Everyone, disperse.

387
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,660
Xiao Yao,

388
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,180
I've watched
your daily cultivation progress,

389
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,800
and now

390
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,690
you've finally
transformed into the Azure Dragon.

391
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,150
This...

392
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,290
is truly moving.

393
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,080
Have we known each other for long?

394
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,290
I watched you grow up!

395
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,750
You're like a big brother.

396
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,330
I've forgotten many things
after my tribulation.

397
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,980
Could you tell me about them?

398
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,660
Sure.

399
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,810
What did you just sa? Bull...

400
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,110
Bullshit.

401
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,040
Bull...

402
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,870
That's vulgar language!

403
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,530
You never used to speak like that.

404
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,930
Who did you learn it from?

405
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,480
Do I need to learn it?

406
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,520
Before was one thing,

407
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,620
but now you've become the Azure Dragon,

408
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,750
the greatest Demon King under heaven.

409
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,120
The words may be crude,

410
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,170
but saying them makes me feel good.

411
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,580
But you still need
to consider your status.

412
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,940
Look at your power.

413
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,860
You now surpass all other demons.

414
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,820
If you can't reason with someone,

415
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,350
just defeat them directly.

416
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,950
Why use such crude language

417
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,600
-to degrade...
-Fine.

418
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,410
I won't say it in front of you anymore.

419
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,670
I have matters to attend to. I'm leaving.

420
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,830
Didn't you want to hear about the past?

421
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,290
Let me tell you.

422
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,290
Our Qiong Qi Clan,

423
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,620
though born with
great strength and courage,

424
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,150
also has fatal weaknesses.

425
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,470
So I issued challenges everywhere

426
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,400
to keep others from disturbing us.

427
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,050
But I never expected

428
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,340
that my fighting nature

429
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,800
would be exploited by you.

430
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,490
Back then

431
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,460
you were just a Water Dragon,

432
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,420
-always...
-About... this big?

433
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,680
About this big.

434
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,770
Always meddling in injustices.

435
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,860
If there was nothing to meddle with,

436
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,660
you'd create trouble yourself.

437
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,440
Remember that time

438
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,620
you stole from
the Treasure Swallower's Treasury?

439
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,250
Then the little Treasure Swallower
discovered you

440
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,570
and chased after you.

441
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,890
You ran straight to me

442
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:11,680
and told me

443
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,770
that the little Treasure Swallower

444
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,690
wanted to lock you up in their Treasury.

445
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,100
Then you told
the little Treasure Swallower

446
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,500
that I had sent you there.

447
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,290
Ended up with me
and that Treasure Swallower

448
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,590
fighting fiercely,

449
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,580
while you

450
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,490
ran off to sunbathe by the sea.

451
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,090
Right here.

452
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,110
Right here.

453
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,190
I kicked him all the way
over there with one foot.

454
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,150
Xiao Yao.

455
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,140
Let's fight.

456
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:52,940
Among us demons,

457
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,460
the strong command respect.

458
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,750
If I win,

459
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,700
you belong to me.

460
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,440
If I lose,

461
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,000
I belong to you.

462
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,200
Why?

463
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,690
That's a win-win for you.

464
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,890
Besides,

465
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,250
I'm the Azure Dragon now.

466
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,660
Aren't I the most powerful?

467
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,110
Can you even defeat me?

468
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,620
Your power may be great,

469
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,770
but your experience is far less than mine.

470
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,590
But I don't want to beat you.

471
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,470
And I definitely
don't want to lose to you.

472
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,430
For thousands of years,

473
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,930
my feelings for you have never changed.

474
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,910
But you always call me Brother.

475
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,220
I couldn't express
my true feelings to you.

476
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,110
No need.

477
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,140
So I made resolutions again and again.

478
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,600
I remember the first time.

479
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,340
I wanted to wait
until you became a horned dragon.

480
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,390
But when I saw you,

481
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,540
I couldn't say a word.

482
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:50,900
Later I thought,

483
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,580
I'd wait until you became a winged dragon.

484
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:53,980
But...

485
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,530
But I still held back.

486
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,090
Keep holding back then.

487
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,550
I can't hold back anymore!

488
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,150
You're now an Azure Dragon.

489
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,970
I'm afraid if I don't tell you now,

490
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,770
I'll never have another chance!

491
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,900
I don't even know

492
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,620
what resolution to make anymore!

493
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,270
Xiao Yao,

494
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,210
I just want to stay by your side forever.

495
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:13,860
I just...

496
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,420
Isn't the Azure Dragon
supposed to protect all living beings?

497
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,760
How could I fight?

498
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,660
Right?

499
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,830
Think about when you were little.

500
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,210
I...

501
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,180
When you were little,

502
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,050
didn't you have many

503
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:31,900
questions you didn't understand

504
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,900
and came to ask me?

505
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,350
You can't remember anything now.

506
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,100
Protecting all living beings
is a heavy responsibility.

507
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,820
You need a demon like me by your side

508
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,620
to advise you.

509
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,250
I...

510
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,620
Let's just fight.

511
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,180
But I'll set the rules.

512
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,250
If you win,

513
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,770
I'll fight with you once a month.

514
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,660
If you lose,

515
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,860
I'll pretend I didn't hear anything today,

516
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,390
and don't bring it up again.

517
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,450
No?

518
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:56,860
I'm leaving.

519
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,390
Xiao Yao!

520
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,390
I'll fight.

521
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,780
I never thought
the gap between us was so great.

522
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,380
It's only right that you look down on me.

523
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,080
I didn't mean it that way.

524
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,130
That fight just now

525
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,310
made me realize

526
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,510
what my next resolution should be.

527
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,670
Before,

528
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,330
I was arrogant.

529
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,660
The only one worthy of the Azure Dragon

530
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,030
is the Demon King.

531
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,960
From now on,
I'll challenge you every year.

532
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,100
When I defeat you,

533
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:05,950
I believe

534
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,290
that the demons

535
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,580
will acknowledge
my position as Demon King.

536
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,700
Only the Demon King

537
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,290
is worthy of the Azure Dragon.

538
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:16,620
This guy might be the real tribulation
I have to overcome.

539
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,140
Hong Ye...

540
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,450
When will you ever become the Demon King?

541
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,040
Will I even live to see that day?

542
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,340
Only the Demon King.

543
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,010
Only the Demon King.

544
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,280
We weren't finished talking.

545
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,050
Tell me,

546
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,220
what connection do I have with humans?

547
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,020
You are a dragon.

548
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,350
How could you have
any connection with servants?

549
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,290
Humans have extremely short lives

550
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,770
and barely any power or cultivation.

551
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:45,900
They are the most

552
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,580
lowly clan under heaven.

553
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,580
Even capturing them
as servants is a bother

554
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,980
because they're so dull.

555
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,110
They're hardly worth mentioning.

556
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,340
Sister?

557
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,080
Did you guess it was me?

558
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,450
Of course.

559
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,110
I'm back!

560
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,610
What magnificent golden armor.

561
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,690
I knew you'd succeed in your tribulation,

562
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,430
just didn't expect it so soon.

563
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,250
Xiao Yao is now an Azure Dragon.

564
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,000
Stop calling her Sister.

565
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,790
At least call her Dragon Lord.

566
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,290
You're so

567
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,640
rigid and boring.

568
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,250
No wonder Sister
always wants to avoid you.

569
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,390
I'm not like that.

570
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,750
I like Sister,

571
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,860
and I don't care if she's an Azure Dragon

572
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,720
or Dragon Lord.

573
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:30,050
You...

574
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:30,910
Right, Sister?

575
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,400
Sister,

576
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,360
did you get any

577
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,350
congratulatory gifts
for passing the tribulation?

578
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,590
No gifts prepared?

579
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,790
I was worried I'd be late.

580
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:47,490
Unexpectedly,

581
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,980
the timing is perfect.

582
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,670
Freshly out of the tribulation!

583
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,430
She can't remember anything!

584
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,190
Probably doesn't recall
your childish tricks.

585
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,100
That's...

586
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,270
even better.

587
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,730
Even though it's the same trick,

588
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,290
you will still find it fresh.

589
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,120
The same thing

590
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,970
can make you happy over and over again.

591
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:11,830
How wonderful.

592
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,960
Right, Sister?

593
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,900
That makes sense.

594
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,090
But, Sister,

595
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,180
do you really remember nothing?

596
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,970
Not a single thing?

597
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,520
Watch this!

598
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:37,820
See?

599
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,480
You remember this, don't you?

600
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,400
Isn't this...

601
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,340
something we're born knowing?

602
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,890
I can do this up to 20

603
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:45,720
or more.

604
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:46,900
20?

605
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:49,220
Never mind that.

606
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,820
Come with me to see your gift.

607
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,950
I've been preparing it for a long time.

608
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,620
Let's go together.

609
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,770
I still need to cultivate.

610
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:58,770
Right.

611
00:31:58,770 --> 00:31:59,620
Let's go, Sister.

612
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,900
Don't disturb his cultivation.

613
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,430
Let's go.

614
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,430
Let's go.

615
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:02,950
Xiao...

616
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,520
Protect...

617
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,350
Protect all living beings!

618
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:09,850
That time,

619
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,560
I encountered the Chaos Clan.

620
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,340
My power wasn't strong enough then,

621
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,670
so I could only run away.

622
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,190
When I was beaten,

623
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,970
I would silently count in my head.

624
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:18,970
I thought to myself,

625
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,140
if I could survive 500 strikes,

626
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,940
that would be quite remarkable.

627
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,620
Just then,

628
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,600
I heard someone else counting too,

629
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,210
shouting while counting,

630
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,690
"I dare you to beat me to death!

631
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,520
Once I take 500 strikes,

632
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,770
I'll transform into a winged dragon

633
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,780
and fight you all!"

634
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,290
I was out of strength,

635
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,530
but hearing that voice,

636
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,130
I was suddenly full of energy

637
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,380
and escaped immediately.

638
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,730
That person

639
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,860
was...

640
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,580
Me?

641
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,450
Yes.

642
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,460
Since then,

643
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,100
you've always been by my side,

644
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,820
eating, drinking, and having fun together.

645
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,690
No matter how strange my ideas were,

646
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,490
you could always understand me.

647
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,950
For thousands of years,

648
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,510
in all heaven and earth,

649
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,760
you're my only true friend,

650
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,890
the only one I can share

651
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,010
my heart with.

652
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,150
This

653
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,340
is the gift.

654
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,530
This is Lantern Grass from Mount Kunlun.

655
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,050
It blooms once every thousand years,

656
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:25,620
and

657
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,240
only for an instant.

658
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,050
I had to use all my persuasive powers

659
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,900
to convince it to come down with me.

660
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,410
Sister,

661
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,820
don't blink.

662
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,330
Wake up.

663
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,520
The sister I told you about is here.

664
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,110
It's time to bloom.

665
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:17,790
Xiao Yao.

666
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,739
I've called you sister for 1,000 years,

667
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:22,600
afraid that you

668
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,480
truly only see yourself as my sister.

669
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,380
Tonight,

670
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,850
I bare my heart to you.

671
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,350
Would you be willing

672
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,250
to become my partner?

673
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:40,150
Teng She,

674
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,780
I cannot accept.

675
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,760
My heart already belongs to someone.

676
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:50,860
This is

677
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,900
the

678
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,389
999th time you've rejected me.

679
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:58,780
I thought you forgot everything
after the tribulation.

680
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,570
I'm sorry.

681
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,070
I wasn't being serious.

682
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,100
Why are you taking it so seriously?

683
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,060
Confirmed.

684
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:14,820
You're

685
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,890
still the same as before.

686
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,270
It's just that before,

687
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,380
you never mentioned liking anyone.

688
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,110
From now on,

689
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,530
we can still be friends, right?

690
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,970
If I find more

691
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,260
rare, delicious, or interesting things,

692
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,010
can I still

693
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,340
share it with you?

694
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:38,820
Call me.

695
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,490
Sister.

696
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:47,710
Good.

697
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,780
If you have anything
tasty or fun in the future,

698
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,180
don't you hide it from me.

699
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,220
Mm.

700
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:56,570
It's just

701
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,900
a shame about this gift.

702
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,540
I spent so long preparing it.

703
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,050
This Azure Dragon

704
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,450
is really hard to please.

705
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,500
Never mind.

706
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,420
The person who won your heart

707
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:13,030
must be someone
far more impressive than me.

708
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,150
Don't tell me who he is.

709
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,050
I...

710
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,550
don't want to know.

711
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,090
You want to go home?

712
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,050
Sister,

713
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,420
I need to

714
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,480
take it back to Mount Kunlun quickly.

715
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,380
Goodbye, Sister.

716
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,740
I gave you a chance to run.

717
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,000
Why are you still here?

718
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,850
Haven't you been beaten enough?

719
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,480
The Azure Dragon is truly remarkable.

720
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,600
Impressive how well
you've hidden your breath.

721
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,740
You may fool Teng She,

722
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,940
but you can't fool me.

723
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,780
Let me warn you on behalf of Teng She.

724
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,340
If you tell anyone about
what happened today,

725
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,340
you'll regret it.

726
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,860
Qiong Qi and Teng She are so lucky

727
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,300
to have a good friend

728
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,160
and to have backed the right side.

729
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,900
You're now the Azure Dragon.

730
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,370
Why don't you kill me?

731
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,970
Why should I kill you?

732
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,490
All demon clans

733
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,090
have been fighting each other
for 1,000 years.

734
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,190
Especially for great demons like us,

735
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,220
cultivation is extremely difficult.

736
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,590
Even without grudges,

737
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,900
demons still fight to steal others' power

738
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,240
for their own gain.

739
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,530
My power didn't come from stealing.

740
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,040
But now you have this ability.

741
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,130
Why not take this shortcut?

742
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,790
What kind of shortcut is that?

743
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,160
You steal from him,

744
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,860
then another great demon steals from you.

745
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,040
If no one focuses on cultivation

746
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,490
and everyone just
keeps stealing from each other,

747
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,490
what happens when

748
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,860
there's nothing left to steal?

749
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,060
What will you do then?

750
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,900
Without inner peace,

751
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,450
nothing can be achieved.

752
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,180
I know a powerful great demon.

753
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,900
He protects the demons in Demons' Valley,

754
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,380
which is a heavy responsibility,

755
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,170
yet he still practices cultivation
diligently every day.

756
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,090
For him,

757
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,420
cultivation

758
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,780
is also about cultivating the mind.

759
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,600
Where is Demons' Valley?

760
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:23,970
Demons' Valley

761
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,650
is a land of peace

762
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,480
where the demons

763
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,900
live together in peace.

764
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,220
Relying solely on self-cultivation,

765
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,550
when will one
become the best in the world?

766
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,450
I am the Azure Dragon.

767
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,960
I am the best in the world.

768
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,530
With me around,
you'll never be number one.

769
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,860
What can you do about it?

770
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,820
Cultivation is about balance and change.

771
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,790
No one should boast about forever.

772
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,340
I just love seeing you unable

773
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,000
to out-argue or out-fight me.

774
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:22,860
It's getting late.

775
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,700
Get some rest.

776
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,620
Cultivation is a lifelong journey.

777
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,080
You probably won't
figure it out right away.

778
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:30,780
Just

779
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,930
don't stray onto the wrong path.

780
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,490
Xiao Yao,

781
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,870
are you still there?

782
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,220
Hide your breath first.

783
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,550
Come out after we leave.

784
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:40,970
Mm.

785
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,010
I'm here!

786
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,420
Xiao Yao.

787
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:47,940
Teng She has had enough fun,

788
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,140
and I let him go ahead.

789
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:49,820
Hurry.

790
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,860
-I have something to ask you.
-Back then, I...

791
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,740
Come on. Let's go.

792
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,700
-I just...
-Go.

793
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,120
Go, keep going.

794
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,260
Come on.

795
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:55,820
Don't trip me up.

796
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,020
Hurry, move forward.

797
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,450
Since the Azure Dragon's emergence,

798
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,530
the weather has become favorable,

799
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,090
and the land has been peaceful.

800
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,340
There have been fewer conflicts
among the demons as well.

801
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,090
Everyone seems to settle down
and focus on their cultivation.

802
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,620
We should really thank you.

803
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,300
If the world could remain like this,

804
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,260
I would be content.

805
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,740
You will live as long as heaven and earth,

806
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,940
so things will naturally stay this way.

807
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:36,220
Dragon Lord!

808
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:37,860
Dragon Lord.

809
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,530
Greetings, Dragon Lord.

810
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:44,970
Little dragon, why are you so reckless?

811
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:46,630
My name is Long Yu.

812
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,260
[Long Yu]

813
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,170
Don't call me little dragon.

814
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,900
You're clearly just a scaled dragon,

815
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,420
not yet transformed into a true dragon.

816
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,860
How can you use the surname "Long"?

817
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,560
I'm only half a level away.

818
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,340
With the Dragon Lord as my guiding light,

819
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,800
it's just a matter of time.

820
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,450
With that ambition of yours,

821
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,510
I don't mind you using the name early.

822
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,540
Tell me quickly,

823
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,700
what's the matter?

824
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,100
The Dragon Lord's birthday is coming soon.

825
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,420
My birthday?

826
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,010
Yes.

827
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:09,900
This is

828
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,220
your first birthday
since becoming the Azure Dragon.

829
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,340
We must celebrate it grandly.

830
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,470
A grand celebration isn't necessary.

831
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,960
If there must be something special,

832
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,070
I'd like to have a bowl of noodle soup.

833
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,530
What is noodle soup?

834
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,030
So in this era,

835
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,130
noodles haven't been invented yet.

836
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,330
My wish is

837
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,490
to see Hong Ye again.
