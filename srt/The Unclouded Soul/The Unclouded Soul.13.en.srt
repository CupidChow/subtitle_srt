[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,729
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,950
This flower sea
has been the final resting place

4
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,350
for women of the Realm of Mist and Void
for thousands of years.

5
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,200
You and I will eventually
become part of this soil.

6
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,090
It's just a matter of sooner or later.

7
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,300
Watering like this,

8
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,150
when will I ever finish?

9
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,210
It's like a bottomless pit.

10
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,470
Today is the day of the trial.

11
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,630
Why are you still here watering flowers?

12
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,480
I didn't know.

13
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,340
No one told me.

14
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:46,980
How dare they defy
Immortal Lord's wishes?

15
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,870
Come with me.

00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,470
[Harmony of the Five Flavors]

17
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,040
What are all these?

18
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,960
What are these things?

19
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,490
They don't even look tasty.

20
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,400
How can anyone swallow these?

21
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,240
Follow me.

22
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,680
I can't eat these.

23
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,670
So many ingredients.

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,910
Could it be that Immortal Lord
is preparing a welcome feast for us?

25
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,640
These dishes are too ordinary.

26
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,470
Not as exquisite
as what my family's cook prepares.

27
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,280
Indeed.

28
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,690
You young ladies from official families,

29
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,700
fed with the finest delicacies
since childhood,

30
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,120
yet all talk and no skill.

31
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,030
I explained to everyone yesterday.

32
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,470
The immortal realm protects women,

33
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,720
but it's not a place
where you get something for nothing.

34
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,590
Before you arrived,

35
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,110
the women in the immortal realm

36
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,300
had all experienced abandonment

37
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,870
or suffered abuse in the human realm.

38
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,670
Immortal Lord is kind-hearted,

39
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,440
so she allowed them all to stay.

40
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,530
They all managed households
to some extent in the past,

41
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,140
so they're quite skilled in cooking.

42
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,040
The only difference is,

43
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,280
they did it for unworthy men before,

44
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,470
but now,

45
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,580
they do it all for themselves.

46
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,260
Today's trial is cooking.

47
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,020
If you don't put in the effort,

48
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,160
you won't have a chance to stay.

49
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,510
But at home,

50
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,480
our parents never taught us how to cook.

51
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,440
That's right.

52
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,510
Cooking?

53
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,310
Isn't that what servants do?

54
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,750
Exactly.

55
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,510
That's right.

56
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,770
Then you'll have to fend for yourselves.

57
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,700
If you really can't cook,

58
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,810
you can give up now.

59
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,400
We're doomed.

60
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,740
This has just begun,

61
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,030
and you're out.

62
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,750
What's wrong with you?

63
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,070
Don't get discouraged before I even start.

64
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,130
It's true, though.

65
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,240
You only know how to eat,

66
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,920
not how to cook.

67
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,720
You talk too much.

68
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,190
We'll find out

69
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,409
once I try.

70
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,870
I mean everyone should do their best.

71
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,400
If you don't know how,
you'll learn by trying.

72
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,390
Easier said than done.

73
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,010
Exactly.

74
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,250
What if

75
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,550
we fail to pass the trial?

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,060
What happens then?

77
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,630
If you fail,

78
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,670
you'll find out naturally.

79
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
Now, I'll announce the trial rules.

80
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,630
First,

81
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,960
everyone must announce
the dish they want to make.

82
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,270
Once a dish is claimed,

83
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,120
others can't repeat it.

84
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,550
Second, as you can all see,

85
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,720
all ingredients are already on the table.

86
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,160
Those who announce their dishes first
get to choose first.

87
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,620
First come, first served.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,130
When the measuring scale fully rises,

89
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,920
those who haven't completed their dishes

90
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,720
or have failed during the process

91
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,050
will all be eliminated.

92
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,070
Dishes completed within the time limit

93
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,370
will be judged by Linghua Palace.

94
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,210
Now announce your dishes.

95
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,350
One dish per person,

96
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,680
no repetitions allowed.

97
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,610
-I'll make flower pastry.
-I'll make flower pastry.

98
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,340
Dali, it's really delicious.

99
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,780
It smells wonderful.

100
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,630
This is Xiao Yao's flower pastry

101
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,820
made with withered petals.

102
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,270
How does it taste?

103
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,120
Delicious.

104
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,750
Tasty.

105
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,120
Ms. Fairy,

106
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,190
I said it first

107
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,480
just now.

108
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,360
I heard you.

109
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,000
You said it first.

110
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,000
Go get your ingredients.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,510
Okay.

112
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,270
Ms. Fairy,

113
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,480
I need osmanthus sugar, black sesame,

114
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,810
and some flower petals.

115
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,360
Take them yourself.

116
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,960
Thank you.

117
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,630
Next.

118
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,700
I want to make Egg Custard.

119
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,930
I want to make Scrambled Eggs with Shrimp.

120
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,120
I'm sorry. I accidentally spilled the egg.

121
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,240
Please forgive me.

122
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,400
Go away.

123
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,010
I want to make
Braised Chicken with Bamboo Shoots.

124
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,570
That's enough.

125
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,170
If you leave others with no way out,

126
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,630
you're also heading
toward your own destruction.

127
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,240
Go away.

128
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,200
Yes.

129
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,120
I was the first
to claim the Sweet and Sour Carp.

130
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,870
Everything is mine!

131
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,800
Can't you let me have this for once?

132
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,310
What are you doing?

133
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,310
Our fathers have the same official rank.

134
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,190
Why should I give it to you?

135
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,390
I got to choose first!

136
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,040
You're being unreasonable!

137
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,840
Ms. Fairy, can I make fried rice?

138
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,120
Pei, I want to make stir-fried cabbage.

139
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,750
Vinegar cabbage.

140
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,920
You've killed this fish!

141
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,160
You were the one
who pressed too hard first!

142
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,480
This is my cabbage!

143
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,310
This is mine! Give it to me!

144
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,430
I got it first!

145
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,810
Give me back my cabbage!

146
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,850
Everyone, go to your assigned stoves.

147
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,720
If you use the wrong stove,

148
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,990
the credit will go to someone else.

149
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,760
You, have you decided what to make?

150
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,270
I...

151
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,390
Topping Noodles. Topping Noodles.

152
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,920
I don't know how to make it.

153
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,360
I do.

154
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,890
Hurry up and say it,

155
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,280
or we'll be eliminated.

156
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,360
I'll make Topping Noodles.

157

Eel.

158
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,560
I need eel.

159

Fresh shrimp.

Fresh shrimp.

And flour.

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,180
And flour.

163
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,310
You're lucky.

164
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,600
We have all the ingredients you asked for.

165
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,420

and I'll give you a gold bracelet later.

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,030
You know, without ginger,

171
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,030
it just won't have the right flavor.

172
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,000
Meat tastes better. I'll make a meat dish.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,260
Should I stir-fry everything together?

174
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,010
Don't blame me.

175
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,670
Don't blame me.

You...

00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,010
A bunch of useless people.

178
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,840
Get out of here, all of you!

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,030
but we have never

191
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,360
been treated as equals.

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,860
After you came to Demons' Valley,

193
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,240
in just a few days,

194
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,320
you made all the minor demons adore you.

195
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
Even His Lordship

196
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,320
has opened his heart to you completely.

197
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,030
But me?

198
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,770
As a peony that should have reigned
supreme among all flowers,

199
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,870
I've never been seen by anyone.

200
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,200
You call me and Luoluo your friends,

201
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,720
only because we're not as clever as you,

202
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,920
not as cunning as you.

203
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,930
Does our existence

204
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,790
serve only to satisfy
your sense of superiority?

205
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,600
Why?

206
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,750
Why do humans and demons pamper you?

207
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,410
Why can everyone only see you?

208
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,440
We're not friends anymore.

209
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,480
Immortal Lord only likes flowers
without green leaves.

210
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,270
So do I.

211
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,750
No one is willing to be just a leaf.

212
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,400
Xiao Yao,

213
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,430
no time for sentimentality now.

214
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,480
I have Hong Ye's memories
of learning to make Topping Noodles.

215
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,740
Open your eyes wide and watch carefully.

216
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,320
Are you ready?

217
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,080
I'm ready. What's next?

218
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,280
Slice the eel.

219
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,360
The eel.

220
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,320
How do I cut it?

221
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,540
Hold down the head.

222
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,920
Put it on the cutting board.

223
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,000
Use the knife

224
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,750
to split its body.

225
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,390
Like this.

226
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,100
Use a smaller one.

227
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,440
And then?

228
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,670
Slice it up.

229
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,080
Good. That's enough.

230
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,630
Heat the wok and add oil.

231
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,960
Heat the wok and add oil.

232
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,510
Oil.

233
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,800
Coat the eel in batter.

234
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,500
What does that mean?

235
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,810
It means putting the eel

236
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,030
into the batter.

237
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,790
Eel.

238
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,270
Batter.

239
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,640
Add some batter.

240
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,480
Add some water.

241
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,400
Too much water. Add more batter.

242
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,550
If you don't add the eel soon,

243
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,550
the wok will burn.

244
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,250
Right away. Right away.

245
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,480
Fry the eel
until the batter forms a crust.

246
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,540
Crust? What does that mean?

247
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,830
It means it gets hard.

248
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,170
When it hardens, that's the crust.

249
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,240
It's hardened now.

250
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,910
What next?

251
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,750
Take it out.

252
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,440
It actually looks pretty good.

253
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,200
Are the side ingredients ready?

254
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,000
Shrimp.

255
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,440
Only shrimp?

256
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,910
No green onions?

257
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,160
Put in the eel and shrimp.

258
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,230
When do I add this ginger?

259
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,440
Did you forget?

260
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,060
Well...

261
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,150
It's up to you.

262
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,240
Then I will

263
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,320
add 2 pieces.

264
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,430
Is the sauce ready?

265
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,530
Coming right up.

266
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,550
Sauce.

267
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,700
Who are you talking to?

268
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,150
Soy sauce, cooking wine.

269
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,850
Two spoonfuls.

270
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,630
Sugar.

271
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,600
Pepper.

272
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,080
Salt.

273
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,360
The wok is about to burn.

274
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,890
Don't rush me. Coming right away.

275
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,550
Water.

276
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,250
Don't add water! It will splatter!

277
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,450
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

278
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,080
What should we do, Little Leaf?

279
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,080
Even if Hong Ye were here,

280
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,830
he couldn't help now.

281
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,630
I have an idea.

282
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,870
What idea?

283
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,920
I'll make them

284
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,790
something different.

285
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,270
Here's a bracelet.

286
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,130
Please, let's switch our dishes.

287
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,720
Time's up.

288
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,560
My hands are burning red!

289
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,589
Stop now.

290
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,550
Such humble food.

291
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,170
I can't believe you came up with this.

292
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,510
Immortal masters

293
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,160
are used to all kinds of delicacies.

294
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,490
But ordinary people
often have only a bowl of plain noodles.

295
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,070
Immortal Lord has great compassion

296
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,160
and created the Realm of Mist and Void
for suffering women.

297
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,030
Surely she's always cherished a heart
that stands for equality for all,

298
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,610
frugality in governance,
and love for the people.

299
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,720
And this bowl of noodles

300
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,200
is exactly what you would find

301
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,730
on every commoner's table.

302
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,680
Sharp-tongued.

303
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,400
Let's see if that silver tongue of yours

304
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
can really save your life.

[Harmony of the Five Flavors]

306
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,110
The tasting results are out.

307
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,650
Those whose dishes are called,

308
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,030
please step forward.

309
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,370

All of you,

[Harmony of the Five Flavors]

323
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,000
follow me to Linghua Palace.

324
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,750
Ms. Fairy,

325
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,510
please give me one more chance.

326
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,350
Ms. Fairy,

327
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,160
I made Sweet and Sour Carp.

328
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,110
Ms. Fairy, please take me in.

329
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,830
I would die for Dreamshard Immortal.

330
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,830
Are you that desperate
to stay in the Realm of Mist and Void?

331
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,490
-Yes.
-Yes.

332
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,640
But the Realm of Mist and Void
never keeps idle people.

333
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,310
Since you're so eager to stay,

334
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,150
I'll grant you the fate
of becoming flowers.

335
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,220
Flowers?

336
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,240
Women

337
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,250
are meant to be cherished like flowers.

338
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,360
Among today's dishes,

339
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,640
the Yangchun Noodles
stand out as the best.

340
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,750
Who made them?

341
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,970
Who made the Yangchun Noodles?

342
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,400
Step forward to answer.

343
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,550
Immortal Lord, I made them.

344
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,990
Where did you learn

345
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,900
to make noodles like this?

346
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,900
More than 10 years ago,

347
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,480
my father suddenly fell very ill.

348
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,920
He was bedridden for days.

349
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,270
So I tried to cook like he usually did

350
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,750
and made a bowl of noodles.

351
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,340
He said wild green onions
enhance the flavor,

352
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,550
so I sprinkled some in the noodles.

353
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,880
After he finished eating,

354
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,410
he was already much better.

355
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,920
Years later, he would still say

356
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,130
it was the best thing he had ever eaten,

357
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,400
because it was filled with sincerity.

358
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,240
Today,

359
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,640
I bring the same sincerity
as I did back then

360
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,790
to make this bowl of noodles for you.

361
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,260
Not only are your noodles excellent,

362
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,380
but you also tell a good story.

363
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,040
No wonder Hong Ye

364
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,160
cherishes you so much.

365
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,170
Then who made these flower pastries?

366
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,920
Immortal Lord, I made them.

367
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,750
Flower Demon,

368
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,110
I didn't expect you to have real skills.

369
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,640
You weren't exaggerating.

370
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,310
Thank you for your recognition.

371
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,640
With your talents,

372
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,000
you may continue to stay
in the Realm of Mist and Void.

373
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,350
However,

374
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,080
if you wish to cultivate
the art of eternal youth,

375
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
you must undergo the next trial.

376
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,310
Zhirui,

377
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,430
take them downstairs first.

378
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,110
For the next trial,

379
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,950
you can devise something interesting.

380
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,330
Yes, Immortal Lord.

381
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,620
This Heart-Devouring Poison

382
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,810
was refined
by Immortal Lord over 100 years.

383
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,420
Be it humans or demons,

384
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,400
within 7 days of being poisoned,

385
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,200
all will lose their minds
and become like puppets.

386
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,860
But you've endured it for a month.

387
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,690
That's truly unprecedented.

388
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,540
What's wrong with being a puppet?

389
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,000
No heart,

390
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,110
no pain.

391
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,550
Fighting against Immortal Lord

392
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,790
won't change the final outcome anyway.

393
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,980
I once gathered all the fragments
of the Kunlun Mirror,

394
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,400
but I gave them to humans,

395
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,650
causing demons to be slaughtered

396
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,200
and bringing calamity for centuries.

397
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,160
I deserve this torment.

398
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,400
But if you want me to abandon my mind

399
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,270
and live without emotions or love,

400
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,830
even if I'm shattered to pieces,

401
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,000
I will never submit.

402
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,630
You've lived in this world
for thousands of years.

403
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,070
You should know
how fickle humans are

404
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,270
and how unpredictable human nature is.

405
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,510
Only by letting go of desires

406
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,480
and focusing on cultivation
can you achieve true enlightenment.

407
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,310
Yet you keep giving your
devoted heart to humans.

408
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,710
Haven't you been betrayed enough already?

409
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,240
If it's true love,

410
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,400
it's worth starting over.

411
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,920
I can see

412
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,880
you truly care for Xiao Yao.

413
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,300
But in this Realm of Mist and Void,

414
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,830
you must do some things
for Immortal Lord,

415
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,950
so that Xiao Yao can have an easier time.

416
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,830
What do you want me to do?

417
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,520
Immortal Lord's demonic power

418
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,160
requires large amounts of human essence.

419
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,960
You can help Immortal Lord

420
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,960
by bringing more mortal women here.

421
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,940
She would be pleased then.

422
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,200
I promised Xiao Yao

423
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,640
I wouldn't harm innocent people.

424
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,880
Then do you know

425
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,060
what humans are thinking,

426
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,610
who are desperately seeking
the celestial mountain

427
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,640
on the ships in this sea?

428
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,490
Find the celestial mountain,

429
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,080
drink from the Yuli Spring,

430
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,120
and finally kill you
and your demon people.

431
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,970
Their hearts have been consumed by greed.

432
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,030
You can just let them
fulfill their dreams here.

433
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,560
And what's wrong with that?

434
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,310
You don't know, do you?

435
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,920
The ones who led these people
into the Realm of Mist and Void

436
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,070
were themselves.

437
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,920
The reason Immortal Lord sets up

438
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,680
trials in the Realm of Mist and Void

439
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,920
is to give these humans

440
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,180
a chance for survival.

441
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,000
She hopes they can understand
the preciousness of life

442
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,060
and no longer be controlled by greed.

443
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
Unfortunately,

444
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,750
they all chose to stay.

445
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,510
I won't force you.

446
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,850
If you change your mind,

447
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,770
I'll open this dungeon barrier

448
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,750
and let you out.

449
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,080
So you can see those

450
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,270
who are controlled by greed.

451
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,000
But if they insist on coming here,

452
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,110
I ask you

453
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,170
to guide them a little.

454
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,040
What's wrong?

455
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:15,870
I'm freezing.

456
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,540
I'm freezing to death.

457
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,420
The sun is so bright right now.

458
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,750
How can you be cold?

459
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,690
I don't know.

460
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:25,780
I just feel cold.

461
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,270
Could Hong Ye be suffering
from extreme cold right now?

462
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,440
How would I know?

463
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,910
Come here.

464
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,830
Let me warm you up.

465
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,510
How's that?

466
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,720
For plants,

467
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,110
as long as their roots are healthy,

468
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,160
they will be fine.

469
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,490
You know quite a lot.

470
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,480
Dali told me this before.

471
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,720
May the heavens take pity on us

472
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,910
and guide us
to find the celestial mountain!

473
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,590
The heavens take pity on you?

474
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,440
Your desires
will only harm you in the end.

475
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,240
Get out of here now.

476
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,880
Steady your minds!

477
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,720
This is test

478
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,830
from the immortal!

479
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,030
Northeast position!

480
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,640
We offer our sincerity to the vast sea!

481
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,350
Immortal, please

482
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,940
show us the direction!

483
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,350
The celestial mountain
is not meant for mortal eyes.

484
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,480
Our fellow disciple

485
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,610
gave her life to help us on our journey.

486
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,370
We can't let her life be in vain.

487
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,960
For immortality,

488
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,480
you would actually
sacrifice your companion.

489
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,620
We beg you to show us the way!

490
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,060
If you drink from the Yuli Spring,

491
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,860
you will no longer have emotions

492
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,560
and no longer have a true heart.

493
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,270
Do you still want that?

494
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,110
We offer our blood to the vast sea!

495
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,550
We beg you to guide us to Penglang!

496
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,200
If only one person

497
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,550
can survive to follow me
to the celestial mountain,

498
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,770
do you still want that?

499
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,720
Your greed is bottomless.

500
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,220
Stop it, all of you!

501
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,490
Today, I will grant your wish.

502
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,000
Why are you always so fresh and dewy

503
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,600
without being watered?

504
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,270
Where did you get the dew?

505
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,280
This must be the celestial mountain.

506
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,880
Celestial mountain.

507
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,320
Yuli Spring.

508
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,230
Where is the Yuli Spring?

509
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,200
Thank you, Exalted Immortal,
for your favor.

510
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,550
To reach the celestial mountain
in this lifetime,

511
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,320
any suffering is worth it.

512
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,010
You must be an immortal.

513
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,030
But looking at you,

514
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,190
you don't seem much different
from us mortals.

515
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,480
Do not be disrespectful
to the immortal maiden.

516
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,080
Yes.

517
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,420
May I ask, where is the Yuli Spring?

518
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,160
After you drink from the Yuli Spring,

519
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,590
you will no longer have feelings

520
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,680
or a true heart.

521
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,160
Do you still want that?

522
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,790
Why are you saying the same things
as the immortal we met earlier?

523
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,270
For the sake of immortality,

524
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,600
everything in the world can be abandoned.

525
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,440
Yes.

526
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,830
We hope you will help us.

527
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,320
Which immortal did you just mention?

528
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,360
He wore red and white robes,

529
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,940
handsome and elegant,

530
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,560
clearly someone from an immortal sect.

531
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,240
Did he bring you here?

532
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,450
Yes, indeed.

533
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,650
Sect Leader.

534
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,250
Look at her attire.

535
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,000
She's just a servant at most.

536
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,490
It's pointless to ask her.

537
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,800
The true immortals are coming!

538
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:15,920
They are indeed immortals.

539
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,050
They are immortals.

540
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,900
Immortals!

541
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,460
-Immortals!
-Immortals!

542
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,790
Welcome everyone
to the Realm of Mist and Void.

543
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,440
Is this Realm of Mist and Void
the same as Penglang?

544
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,970
So you are immortal ladies?

545
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,450
We are merely disciples
of Dreamshard Immortal.

546
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,440
If you are fated to stay,

547
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,280
we shall all address
each other as sisters.

548
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,160
Sisters.

549
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,310
Follow me.

550
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,720
-Great.
-Let's go.

551
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,120
Hurry.

552
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,440
Go.

553
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:40,750
Go.

554
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,720
Go. Go.

555
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,600
Let's go.

556
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,310
This situation

557
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,610
repeats in the Realm of Mist and Void.

558
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,590
This place was once just
a small flower bed.

559
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,160
But now,

560
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,290
it has transformed into a vast flower sea.

561
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,610
And within the roots of each flower

562
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,200
lies buried the desires of each person.

563
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,320
Generation after generation,

564
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,280
they come one after another.

565
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,750
You want to stop it,

566
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,680
but are you capable?

00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,990

[Lovely and intelligent]

588
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,030
Xiao Yao performed excellently

589
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,590
in her first trial.

590
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,790
Immortal Lord
is quite impressed with her.

591
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,400
If you stop being stubborn,

592
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,910
she won't need to participate
in the second trial.

593
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,590
She can accompany Immortal Lord

594
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,350
and share immortality with her.

595
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,750
This second trial

596
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,170
is different from the previous one

597
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,840
and much more dangerous.

598
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,590
I know.

599
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,469
You refuse to let the poison
control your mind

600
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,320
because you still care for Xiao Yao.

601
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,199
But if you insist on
defying Immortal Lord,

602
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,260
causing her
to take her anger out on Xiao Yao,

603
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,730
wouldn't that go against
your true intentions?

604
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,760
Don't you want

605
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,190
to protect the one you love?

606
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,590
Right now, you can move freely,

607
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,040
only because Immortal Lord
hasn't activated the poison.

608
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,630
The agony of the poison

609
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,590
is something
you've already experienced deeply.

610
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,989
Why not join with Xiao Yao

611
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,630
and willingly become part
of my Realm of Mist and Void?

612
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,480
Let me go back.

613
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,110
Hong Ye is truly stubborn.

614
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,150
And Xiao Yao has such a sharp tongue.

615
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,690
If they really stay
by Immortal Lord's side,

616
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,640
it will be trouble for everyone.

617
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,800
We might as well
take advantage of the trial

618
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,200
and get rid of them early.

619
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,130
You're telling me all this

620
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,320
because you want me
to report to Immortal Lord?

621
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,250
I wouldn't dare.

622
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,400
But seeing how ambitious Xiao Yao is,

623
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,510
aren't you afraid that if she stays,

624
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,560
she'll usurp your position?

625
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,320
Pei.

626
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,550
Your tone now

627
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,950
is becoming
more and more like Ying Ning's.

628
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,000
Please don't talk nonsense.

629
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,550
What I just said

630
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,830
was for everyone's benefit.

631
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,680
It was for yourself.

632
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,920
That's the truth.

633
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,550
Congratulations to you.

634
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,840
What is there to congratulate?

635
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,510
You've worked so hard
for the Realm of Mist and Void,

636
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,440
and your loyalty
to Immortal Lord is evident.

637
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,920
Immortal Lord is considerate

638
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,780
and ordered me
to give this immortal dew balm to you.

639
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,490
Apply it day and night,

640
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,920
and the scars on your face will disappear.

641
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,000
Then

642
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,880
I must thank you, Zhirui.

643
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,770
With Immortal Lord's immortal dew,

644
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,100
your beauty will surpass what it once was.

645
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,580
I will thank

646
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,110
Immortal Lord in person.

647
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,070
Immortal Lord
is protecting her so much.

648
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,130
Won't she walk all over us from now on?

649
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,970
We'll see about that.

650
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,740
Are you angry with Hong Ye?

651
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,380
He didn't talk to you today

652
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,100
because Dreamshard's confidant
was right beside him.

653
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,710
He did this

654
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,070
to protect you.

655
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,150
Can you sense

656
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,090
what Hong Ye is doing right now?

657
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,760
I don't know.

658
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,840
Then what can you do?

659
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,960
I can summon Hong Ye's true self

660
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,420
to be with you for a moment.

661
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,110
Don't believe me?

662
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,450
But my spiritual power
can only sustain it briefly.

663
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,480
His true form can't come here.

664
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,940
Only his primordial spirit
can be summoned.

665
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,360
Then cast your spell.

666
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,690
Cast it now. Cast it now.

667
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,630
Watch carefully.

668
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,150
Xiao Yao.

669
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,550
Hong Ye.

670
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,380
I've disappointed you.

671
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,580
This is my primordial spirit.

672
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
Do you blame me?

673
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,010
What would I blame you for?

674
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,990
Should I blame you

675
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,180
for leading humans to this island

676
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,510
or blame you

677
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,140
for looking so haggard

678
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,710
for suffering the pain
of Heart-Devouring Poison alone?

679
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,840
The poison hasn't been activated yet,

680
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,420
so I'm fine for now.

681
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,320
I didn't speak to you during the day,

682
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,980
but that wasn't my intention.

683
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,570
If I show you any extra attention,

684
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,940
it gives them reason to cause trouble.

685
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,010
I don't want you to be harmed in any way.

686
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,630
Dreamshard Immortal

687
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,280
keeps claiming
that human nature is greedy.

688
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,610
I went to the sea

689
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,840
to stop humans from coming to the island.

690
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,970
But their obsession with immortality

691
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,530
made them stubborn.

692
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,790
I couldn't change anything.

693
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,240
I understand.

694
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,920
I understand you have many constraints.

695
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,300
You've been through a lot.

696
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,290
You spend your days

697
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,860
watering flowers in this flower sea,

698
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,590
working hard and getting tired.

699
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,360
Though I can't always be with you,

700
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,890
at least Little Leaf is here

701
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,430
to take care of you for me,

702
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,200
which gives me peace of mind.

703
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,660
Stretch out your hand.

704
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,510
The second trial

705
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,060
is extremely dangerous.

706
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,550
If you participate,

707
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,410
you must be careful at every step.

708
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,360
Hong Ye.

709
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:56,760
Hong Ye!
