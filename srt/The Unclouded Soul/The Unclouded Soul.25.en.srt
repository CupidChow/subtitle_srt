[The Unclouded Soul]

2
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,670
[Episode 25]

3
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,950
So back then, the Heavenly Mother

4
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,400
used the Heart-Burning Incantation

5
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,600
and activated an array to reverse time.

6
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,340
It was to bring herself back
to the beginning of time

7
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,890
to find her younger self

8
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,140
to retrieve her primordial spirit
and restore her power.

9
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,590
Did she succeed?

10
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,410
I don't know.

11
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,630
This stone only

12
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,800
shows the Heavenly Mother
entering the array,

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,390
but nothing after that.

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,960
So

15
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,870
we don't know if she returned

16
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,690
or if she recovered her power.

17
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,360
We don't know.

18
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,820
Gosh...

19
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,720
The Time-Reversal Technique

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,630
is the only technique
no one dares to use lightly

21
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,090
despite it
not being a forbidden technique.

22
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
Once you use this technique,

23
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,770
those who enter

24
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,070
will return to their fetal state

25
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,890
without their memories or power
when traveling to the past.

26
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,450
In the Six Realms,

27
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,410
both humans and demons are no exception.

28
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,560
Only an extraordinary being
like the Heavenly Mother

29
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,690
can enter the array.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,130
And even so, the outcome is uncertain.

31
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,850
Never mind.

32
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,160
It was just a desperate attempt anyway.

33
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,310
I'm a human and also a demon.

34
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,370
Which of the six realms do I belong to?

35
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:16,960
Right!

36
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,710
Xiao Yao is half human and half demon,

37
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,510
not belonging to any of the six realms.

38
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,800
She could enter the array
and return to the past

39
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,200
without her physical form being affected.

40
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,190
That's great!

41
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,280
If I go back,

42
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,680
how far back can I travel?

43
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,910
His Lordship's primordial spirit
was injured a hundred years ago.

44
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,000
If you want to retrieve the
true primordial spirit,

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,660
you must go back even further.

46
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,500
Then wouldn't I

47
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,060
be able to see His Lordship
as he was back then?

48
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,800
I wonder if he was more handsome then

49
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,400
or if he's more handsome now.

50
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,800
He was and is handsome at both times.

51
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,000
Stop fooling around.

52
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,500
How can I retrieve the primordial spirit?

53
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,800
Would I also be able to see

54
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,900
Princess Ning'an?

55
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,080
This is hardly the time

56
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,210
to be joking around.

57
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,350
I'm just curious.

58
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's forget about
retrieving the primordial spirit.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,840
Look at you,

60
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,750
bringing up exactly what you shouldn't.

61
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,470
My Lord!

62
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,600
Don't be angry!

63
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,680
Why is he angry?

64
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,190
My Lord.

65
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,280
Sending Xiao Yao back in time

66
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,700
might be the only way
to restore her spiritual power.

67
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,920
Even if that were the only way,

68
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,800
she can't go back, no matter what.

69
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,370
But we have to at least try.

70
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,280
What if she never comes back?

71
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,310
My Lord.

72
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,540
So what
if I never recover my power?

73
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,620
Don't mention this again.

74
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,610
My Lord, are you afraid
of facing the past,

75
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,400
or afraid of facing Xiao Yao

76
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,460
once she learns the truth about it?

77
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,000
Or perhaps

78
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,640
you fear that if Xiao Yao goes,

79
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,760
she may never return to this world.

80
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,590
[Residence of the Bulwark Duke]

81
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,860
The imperial decree has been issued.

82
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,160
War between the two races is inevitable.

83
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,420
This isn't about giving you a choice,

84
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,940
but offering you
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

85
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,010
But now is not the right time for war.

86
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,940
Hong Ye has returned to Demons' Valley

87
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,870
with the ancient mirror fragment.

88
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,530
He also drove away Heiwu.

89
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,860
The demons must all be united now.

90
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,610
Meanwhile, the Feiyu Guard

91
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,480
has divided loyalties

92
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,240
and scattered minds.

93
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,560
Didn't you vow to eliminate all demons?

94
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,120
Why?

95
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,990
Now you have a legitimate reason to act,

96
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,240
yet you hesitate.

97
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,330
But not all demons

98
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,800
deserve to die.

99
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,670
You're afraid of hurting Xiao Yao,
aren't you?

100
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,460
Xiao Yao only has Hong Ye in her heart,

101
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,840
never you, not even a little.

102
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,360
You should face reality.

103
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,159
It's not just about Xiao Yao.

104
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,540
I, Bingzhu, have a heart and eyes.

105
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,710
I can see that

106
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,700
not every demon is evil.

107
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,990
You have a heart.

108
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,920
So you can connect
with those who have hearts.

109
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,530
I have no heart,

110
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,690
so I can only hide in this tiny space
day after day,

111
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,930
making you avoid me

112
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,680
as if I were a plague.

113
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,410
That's not what I meant.
How could you think that—

114
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,000
It's all my fault.

115
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,510
Why don't

116
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,909
you ask Tan'er what to do?

117
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,960
I've given you more than one chance
to get rid of me

118
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,020
to keep the Lu Pianpian you once knew.

119
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,370
But you can neither take action
nor let go.

120
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
Now there's no chance left.

121
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Lu Pianpian doesn't exist anymore.

122
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,630
Only the Dreamshard Immortal does.

123
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,059
The situation now forces you

124
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,940
to lead the Feiyu Guard
into battle against the demons.

125
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,010
And you must win.

126
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,460
The Feiyu Guard

127
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
would like to see the Immortal Lord!

128
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,970
Hide yourself.

129
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,260
I'll hold them off.

130
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,410
Why have you come here?

131
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,610
Speak up.

132
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,850
The Feiyu Guard would like to ask
the Immortal Lord to replace our hearts.

133
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,480
We will serve the Immortal Lord.

134
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,810
-Go back!
-And spare no effort,

135
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,140
with absolute loyalty!

136
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,080
Spare no effort,

137
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,470
with absolute loyalty.

138
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,330
Spare no effort,

139
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,760
with absolute loyalty.

140
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,550
Spare no effort,

141
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,880
with absolute loyalty.

142
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,630
Spare no effort,

143
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,000
with absolute loyalty.

144
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,560
If your hearts are replaced,

145
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,430
you'll become demons.

146
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,510
Have you all

147
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,140
made up your minds?

148
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,500
I checked the Feiyu Guard records.

149
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,550
A colleague once received
a heart transplant from the Immortal Lord

150
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,720
and gained immense power,
able to fight a hundred enemies alone.

151
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,240
Now the Emperor has given us
a one-month deadline.

152
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,790
If we don't eliminate the demons,

153
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,120
all Feiyu Guards will be executed

154
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,850
and our families will also die.

155
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,520
Rather than waiting for death,

156
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,770
we might as well become demons ourselves.

157
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,950
We beg you to help us,

158
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,290
and save our lives.

159
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,180
Thank you, Immortal Lord.

[Cloud-Reaching Loyalty]

161

[Yunmeng Lake]

162
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,200
Demon Lord?

163
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,720
Sea Turtle Demon Lord?

164
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,000
Sea Turtle Demon Lord?

165
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,990
Sea Turtle Demon Lord, are you there?

166
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,460
Demon Lord, are you slacking off?

167
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,780
Neglecting your duties, Demon Lord?

168
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,570
Demon Lord?

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,060
Demon Lord?

170
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,170
Demon Lord, over here!

171
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:35,960
Here!

172
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,820
I haven't been disturbed
for a thousand years.

173
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,960
Who are you?

174
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,490
I'm Heiwu.

175
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,580
I didn't mean to disturb
your peaceful rest.

176
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,120
What?

177
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,130
Peaceful rest?

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,600
[Sea Turtle]

179
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,120
Are you implying that I'm being lazy?

180
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,030
Please don't be angry,
Demon Lord!

181
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,750
It's just that the Demon King
is concerned for all demons.

182
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,820
Lately, he's been feeling anxious.

183
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,030
He fears a calamity might befall us.

184
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,030
And since Yunmeng Lake

185
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,500
is the most crucial demon seal,

186
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,080
he specifically sent me here

187
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,080
to check if the seal remains intact.

188
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,060
Should we go up and talk?

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,130
If there were any issues with the seal,

190
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,670
I would be the first to know.

191
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,590
Why would I need you to tell me?

192
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,400
I understand
the Demon King worries too much.

193
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,620
Demon Lord,

194
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,520
could you give me a hand?

195
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,640
Fine, fine.

196
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,170
Since you're just following orders.

197
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,270
He sank.

198
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,750
He sank!

199
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,720
Let's go.

200
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,150
Yes.

201
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,770
Come on, class is over.

202
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,290
All demons have

203
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,160
their subjects and characteristics listed,

204
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,750
so why doesn't Hong Ye have any?

205
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,390
He's a mighty Demon King...

206
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,600
Xiao Yao, let's go.

207
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,120
What are you doing?

208
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,010
Let me ask you something.

209
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,610
Have any of you been in human form
for over one hundred years?

210
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,420
The older ones

211
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,110
were mostly slaughtered.

212
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,270
What are you trying to find out
from a hundred years ago?

213
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:16,730
Well...

214
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,970
If the demon books don't have it,

215
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,320
human books might.

216
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,870
That's right!

217
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,290
I'll go check in the human realm.

218
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,300
Keep this a secret.

219
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,010
Mm-hmm.

220
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:28,900
Mm-hmm.

221
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,320
Did I say something wrong?

222
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,840
No.

223
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:34,790
Right?

224
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,240
Yeah.

225
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,930
These creatures

226
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,960
are all suppressed by seals.

227
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,320
Look,

228
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,320
those ripples

229
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,460
and bubbles coming up

230
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,460
are caused by their breath.

231
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,570
The seals are very secure.

232
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,610
With me here,

233
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,030
even if sealed
for ten thousand more years,

234
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,650
nothing will go wrong.

235
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,700
Under what circumstances

236
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,140
would the seal loosen?

237
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,300
The seal is secure

238
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,870
and has never loosened.

239
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,570
Didn't you come to check
if the seal was secure?

240
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,540
Now that you've confirmed it's fine,

241
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,570
you may go back and report.

242
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,840
Please wait, Demon Lord.

243
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,670
His Lordship is too busy
to visit you in person,

244
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,830
so he specifically sent me

245
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:25,930
to bring you a gift.

246
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,100
[Ming] [Qing]

247
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,860
Qing Ming.

248
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,180
[Qing] [Ming]

249
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:30,710
Ming Qing.

250
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,660
[Qing] [Ming]

251
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,360
Ming Qing.

252
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,280
This is truly excellent wine.

253
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,890
I brought this wine specifically

254
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,390
as it matches your namesake festival.

255
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,080
I've never tasted

256
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,290
wine with such a flavor before.

257
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,030
I wonder

258
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
how it was brewed?

259
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,260
Do you know about toad venom, Demon Lord?

260
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,030
Toad venom?

261
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,550
Yeah.

262
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,820
You're testing me?

263
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,550
Toad venom,

264
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,480
it clouds the mind

265
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,350
and causes hallucinations.

266
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,720
You're trying to poison me?

267
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,810
Wine is a poison that penetrates the gut,

268
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,890
but only drunkenness
can solve a thousand worries.

269
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,320
Ordinary wine

270
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,770
could never ease the troubles
of a Demon Lord like you.

271
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,450
Only this toad venom brew can.

272
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,080
I like it.

273
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,270
Good wine.

274
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,640
A toast to you, Demon Lord.

275
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:04,910
Cheers.

276
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,200
May I ask,

277
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,510
in this world,
is it only you

278
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,840
who can break this seal?

279
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,120
Actually,

280
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,510
I'm not the only one who can break it.

281
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,810
The Celestial Dragon,

282
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,310
Earth Emperor,

283
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,240
heart blood,

284
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,780
and also

285
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,940
the most important...

286
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,500
The most...

287
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,710
What is the most important, Demon Lord?

288
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,900
What is the Celestial Dragon?

289
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,980
And what is the Earth Emperor?

290
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,810
Why are you asking

291
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,430
such specific questions?

292
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,910
With this!

293
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,450
Along with Celestial Dragon,

294
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,730
which is Celestial Water.

295
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,349
The Earth Emperor

296
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,790
is Underground Fire.

297
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,160
Along with heart blood,

298
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,080
all flowing into this array.

299
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,070
May I ask...

300
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,250
Demon Lord?

301
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,540
Would you like another drink?

302
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,650
Demon Lord.

303
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,190
Demon Lord.

304
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,030
Demon Lord.

305
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
Celestial Water.

306
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,220
Underground Fire.

307
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,480
Heart blood.

308
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,610
Thank you, Demon Lord.

309
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,470
Celestial Water.

310
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,440
Celestial Water.

311
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,210
Underground Fire.

312
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,840
Underground Fire.

313
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,500
[Tianwei Gate]

314
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:39,680
[Tianwei Gate]

315
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,260
The demons
have plagued our world for too long.

316
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,960
I bear the weight
of seven ancestral temples,

317
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,640
to safeguard peace throughout the realm.

318
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,040
I must do more than
merely preserve the imperial succession.

319
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,510
The late emperor established
the Feiyu Guard

320
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,440
to eliminate demons and monsters.

321
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,220
But our old methods of capturing demons

322
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,370
are no longer sufficient for the task.

323
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,640
A campaign against the demon realm

324
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,190
is now imperative!

325
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,740
Today,

326
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,240
the nine provinces are filled with vigor,

327
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,830
and the heavens stand ready.

328
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,000
I offer fine wine

329
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,560
to send off all our warriors.

330
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,200
May you all

331
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,450
be victorious in every battle

332
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,050
and return in triumph!

333
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,700
[Tianwei Gate]

334
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,710
Greetings, Exalted Immortal.

335
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,530
Greetings, Exalted Immortal.

336
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,650
Greetings, Exalted Immortal.

337
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,140
No, no!

338
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,720
If the Evil Demon appears,

339
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,220
it'll be a catastrophe!

340
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,510
This wine is perfect for today's occasion:

341
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,840
the Qingming Festival.

342
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,550
Demon Lord,

343
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,630
farewell.

344
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,830
Destroy the old world,

345
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,490
and establish a new order!

346
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,720
The demons

347
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,310
will be all mine now!

348
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,710
The world has fallen into chaos,

349
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:33,950
[Tianwei Gate]

350
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,610
and catastrophe is imminent.

351
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,550
If you can seize this opportunity
to eliminate the demons,

352
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,040
and establish extraordinary merit,

353
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,900
the immortals
will naturally grant you longevity.

354
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,100
I am willing to lead the charge

355
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,900
with all the might of Tiansheng Kingdom

356
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,440
to eliminate the demons!

357
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,130
As ruler of the kingdom,

358
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,430
you must not leave the imperial city.

359
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,590
If you move,
the realm will fall into chaos.

360
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,110
Then...

361
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
please guide us, Exalted Immortal,

362
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,860
how can we ensure victory for humanity?

363
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,400
Though immortals
cannot meddle in mortal affairs,

364
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,660
your sincerity is rare and commendable.

365
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,530
Give the military tally

366
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,930
to Bingzhu.

367
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,680
The army shall follow his commands,

368
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,310
and I have my ways to ensure victory.

369
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,680
Everything shall be
as the Exalted Immortal commands!

370
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,610
With the Exalted Immortal's assistance,

371
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,950
[Tianwei Gate]

372
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,280
you must seize this opportunity to settle

373
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,960
the thousand-year conflict
between humans and demons

374
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,050
with this final battle!

375
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,290
We will obey the royal command
and eliminate the demons!

376
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,350
We will obey the royal command
and eliminate the demons!

377
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,790
Eliminate the demons!

378
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,160
Eliminate the demons!

379
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,770
Eliminate the demons!

380
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,270
Eliminate the demons!

381
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,720
Eliminate the demons!

382
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,210
Eliminate the demons!

383
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,330
[History Record]

384
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,380
[In the 248th year of the Tiansheng Era,]

385
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,830
[History Record]

386
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,830
[the great demon Hong Ye
brought calamity upon the mortal realm.]

387
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:12,960
[History Record]

388
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,090
In the 248th year of the Tiansheng Era,

389
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,790
the great demon Hong Ye

390
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,680
brought calamity upon the mortal realm.

391
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,070
He once attacked the imperial city,

392
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,670
injuring countless people.

393
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,200
Fortunately, Princess Ning'an

394
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,340
devised a strategy

395
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,410
to trap the demon
within an array.

396
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,990
Hong Ye fought desperately,

397
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,750
but Princess Ning'an,
with her noble heart,

398
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,960
sacrificed herself along with the demon,

399
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,090
ensuring peace for all living beings.

400
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,530
[Princess Ning'an]

401
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,780
What is this?

402
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,200
It's an auspicious sign from heaven,

403
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,530
with Buddha's light shining everywhere!

404
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,140
What nonsense are you talking about?

405
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,940
This is clearly an omen of disaster!

406
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,630
Nonsense!

407
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,240
The purple aura fills the sky,

408
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,040
it must be a sign of good fortune!

409
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,040
The true dragon appears and
the great demon emerges.

410
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,290
All living beings will suffer!

411
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,880
Suffering...

412
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,080
Suffering is upon us!

413
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,800
What do we do now?

414
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,550
My Lord.

415
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,140
The Demon Lord's token is broken.

416
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,600
Something terrible has happened
at Yunmeng Lake.

417
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,790
Legend says great demons
are sealed in Yunmeng Lake.

418
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,720
Could it be true?

419
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,000
Yes.

420
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,830
But in the ancient demon texts,

421
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,410
why is there no record of this?

422
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,720
The ancient great demons' power
is too strong.

423
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,480
They feared it might be

424
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,550
exploited
by ill-intentioned humans or demons.

425
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,440
So it was guarded by

426
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,040
Sea Turtle,
the longest-living of the demons.

427
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,240
Is their power

428
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,520
more powerful than My Lord?

429
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,750
Even if I had my power,

430
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,170
I may not be their match.

431
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,440
They?

432
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,320
There are three great demons

433
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,050
sealed in Yunmeng Lake.

434
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,210
It's really like the omen.

435
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,250
The tribulation of demons has come.

436
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,270
My Lord,

437
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,940
at such a critical moment,

438
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,120
are you still not going to use
the Time-Reversal Array?

439
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,580
Even if you can't retrieve
your primordial spirit,

440
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,040
at least

441
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,840
you can send Xiao Yao away

442
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,140
and protect her.

443
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,650
I am the one who broke the seal

444
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,960
and allowed you to see daylight again.

445
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,720
From now on, you must obey my commands

446
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,800
and help me become

447
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,960
the Monarch of All Demons.

448
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,680
With me, Qiong Qi, around,

449
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,350
[Qiong Qi]

450
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,810
who dares claim to be king?

451
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,540
Don't pollute my ears.

452
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,150
Are all demons dead?

453
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,300
[Ao Hen]

454
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,240
You're nothing but a stray beast,

455
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,410
yet you dare to claim kingship?

456
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,170
Ao Hen.

457
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,100
You're asking for death.

458
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,540
I'm afraid the one

459
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,940
who will die is you!

460
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,600
I've been asleep for so long,

461
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:31,920
[Teng She]

462
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,380
why all this talk of death
as soon as I wake up?

463
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,010
Put it out.

464
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,100
Be good.

465
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,800
Is there nothing else to do?

466
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,340
Don't stoop to his level.

467
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,270
Little bat?

468
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,460
Let me ask you.

469
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,200
You

470
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,620
released the three of us from the seal?

471
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,640
This kid isn't very old,

472
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,940
but his ambition is not small.

473
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,400
He wants to be the Monarch of All Demons.

474
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,830
Whoever dares to claim to be Demon King

475
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,220
will die quickly!

476
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,240
Did your clan's leader

477
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,440
never teach you this?

478
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,110
Little beast.

479
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,520
Let me ask you,

480
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,500
do you know how many years we were sealed?

481
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,720
You were sealed for a thousand years.

482
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,180
It was ten thousand years!

483
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,750
Ten thousand! Yes, ten thousand years!

484
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,580
I broke the seal

485
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,000
intending to give the world—

486
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,590
Kneel!

487
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,980
Back to you three.

488
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,720
You'd better be honest.

489
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,260
Don't use those bewitching words

490
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,280
to use us

491
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,930
to conquer the world for yourself.

492
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,760
I, Aohen, do know how to repay kindness.

493
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,480
If you know what's good for you,

494
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,920
we may help you a little.

495
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,720
Otherwise,

496
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,970
we'll first destroy your clan

497
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,060
then devour your primordial spirit.

498
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,250
Understand?

499
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,240
Yes, I understand.

500
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,300
Yes, I understand.

501
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,280
I am useless.

502
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,120
The demons

503
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,900
are facing an unprecedented catastrophe.

504
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,800
I had no choice but to release—

505
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,580
To release...

506
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,780
the three of you

507
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,440
to eliminate the rebellious Demon King

508
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,900
and slaughter all humans.

509
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
Is there

510
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,900
a Demon King now?

511
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,270
Yes.

512
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,590
Who?

513
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,070
Hong Ye.

514
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,810
Hong Ye colluded with humans,

515
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,120
offering demons to humans for alchemy.

516
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,850
If you three don't intervene,

517
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,150
our demon race

518
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,210
is about to be slaughtered.

519
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,310
Where is Hong Ye?

520
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,550
I'll lead the way.

521
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,160
My goodness, you're finally back.

522
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,320
Quick, come with me.

523
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,240
What happened?

524
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,400
His Lordship has agreed to use
the Time-Reversal Technique.

525
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,060
Hurry, we'll be too late soon.

526
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,560
Is Princess Ning'an more powerful
than the Dreamshard Immortal?

527
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,850
Otherwise how could she have hurt Hong Ye?

528
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,220
Is Ning'an a bad person?

529
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,070
You all say I look like her.

530
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,970
Someone who looks like this
shouldn't be bad, right?

531
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:14,590
But...

532
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,510
I don't know the answer

533
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,970
to these questions
you're asking me either.

534
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,160
The Time-Reversal array

535
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,000
has never been activated before.

536
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,130
Besides, I've never gone back either.

537
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,790
Moreover,

538
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,800
with my power,

539
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,270
I can only activate the array

540
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,470
to send you in.

541
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,910
But as for when and where you'll end up,

542
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,220
I have no idea.

543
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,570
It's up to your own fate.

544
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,590
What if I'm sent to

545
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,720
an ancient volcanic crater?

546
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,050
That's unpredictable.

547
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,320
So do you still want to go?

548
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:44,910
Yes,

549
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,310
I'll go even if
there's only a glimmer of hope.

550
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,730
Then let's hurry.

551
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,880
Xiao Yao.

552
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,340
Remember this.

553
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,050
Fortune and misfortune are predestined.

554
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,900
If you face danger,

555
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:14,929
don't push yourself.

556
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:17,960
Yes.

557
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,880
Come here.

558
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,650
Let's begin.

559
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,360
Yes.

560
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,750
I will bring your primordial spirit back.

561
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:17,760
Yes.

562
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,370
My Lord.

563
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:39,890
Don't lose focus.

564
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:41,370
Yes.

565
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:55,640
Xiao Yao,

566
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,190
come back safely.

567
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,270
Wait for me.

568
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,440
Xiao Ming.

569
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:23,650
Gather the demons

570
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,910
and go to Youning Cave.

571
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,550
Seal the entrance with a barrier.

572
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,010
My Lord.

573
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,510
Hurry!

574
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,510
My Lord!

575
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,710
Hong Ye?

576
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,840
We meet again.

577
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,440
It's been 10,000 years.

578
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,510
Today,

579
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,420
it's time to put an end to this.

580
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,030
Xiao Yao.

581
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,960
Xiao Yao.

582
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,490
Who's there?

583
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,210
Since the Sky Stone guided you here,

584
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,060
it means you have a destiny to fulfill.

585
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,270
You are the Heavenly Mother?

586
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,330
How can I obtain
Hong Ye's primordial spirit?

587
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,580
All primordial spirits

588
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,670
are shaped by love and hate.

589
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,680
Only love and hate can hurt them.

590
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,270
To restore Hong Ye's spiritual power,

591
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,610
you need only collect a single drop
of his tear-essence.

592
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:23,050
How do I return after I get it?

593
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,980
To go is to return.

594
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,920
To come is to depart.

595
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,590
Xiao Yao.

596
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,630
Just remember—

597
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,380
you are, and will always be, yourself.

598
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:53,010
[100 years ago]

599
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,360
Where am I?

600
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,350
Is anyone there?

601
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,880
Is anyone there?

602
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,360
Is anyone there?

603
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,190
So beautiful.

604
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,440
Xiao Yao,

605
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,920
is that you?

606
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,320
A beauty that outshines the moon

607
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,880
and puts the flowers to shame—

608
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,880
it's you they talk about.

609
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,400
Then who am I now?

610
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,110
Who?

611
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,090
Your Highness.

612
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,410
It's time for lunch.

613
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,880
Your Highness...
