We meet again.

I spared your lives before.

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,770
Can't believe you sneaked in here.

00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,710
Are you in a hurry to die?

21
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,350
Has Hong Ye been here?

22
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,840
Of course he has.

23
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,630
Where is he now?

24
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,750
In the flower sea you just walked through.

25
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,550
Didn't you see him?

26
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,680
No.

27
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,890
He's probably already been composted

This proves you ladies are human,

not demons.

35
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,650
I believe you've merely strayed
from the right path.

36

If you're willing to turn back now,

37
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,490
there may still be hope.

everything you've seen

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,700
is nothing but an illusion?

All this is created by that spirit,

The one who used tricks

59
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,020
was your Dreamshard Immortal.

But none of us saw him.

64
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,750
Immortal Lord dealt with him personally.

After that,

00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,160
Leading Bingzhu to Linghua Palace,

380
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,030
deep down, you were hoping he would win,

381
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,730
weren't you?

382
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,480
I wouldn't dare.

383
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,940
The punishment on your face

384
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,280
is because your beauty and abilities

385
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,480
are exceptional,

386
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,150
and I've protected you too well.

387
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,540
You've never seen
the filth of the mortal world.

388
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,300
Over time,

389
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,480
others will become jealous.

390
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,840
I understand your intentions.

391
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,520
This punishment

392
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,440
is what I deserve.

393
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,540
In this Realm of Mist and Void,

394
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,160
you and I are most compatible.

395
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,000
As long as you truly commit yourself,

396
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,580
I will give you the divine dew

397
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,400
to restore your beauty.

398
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,700
Thank you, Immortal Lord.

399
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,810
This feels so nice.

400
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,550
Stop looking.

401
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,590
It's me.

402
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,550
Why are you not moving?

403
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,000
You've been watering flowers all day.

404
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,660
Don't you know to water me too?

405
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,340
Who are you?

406
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,920
You don't recognize me?

407
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,450
While I'm still conscious,

408
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,400
I'll attach my consciousness

409
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,930
to this straw bracelet.

410
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,400
It will protect you.

411
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,810
You're Hong Ye's primordial spirit?

412
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,350
Yes.

413
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,400
I'm a primordial spirit—

414
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,720
the Demon Lord's.

415
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,950
How dare you address me as "you"?

416
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,130
What powers do you have?

417
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,720
My six senses are one with my true self.

418
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,720
Whatever he can do, I can too.

419
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,910
Then conjure some silver for me.

420
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:17,840
What?

421
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,600
Conjure some silver?

422
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,860
I'm your lifeline in times of danger.

423
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,680
How could I waste my power so casually?

424
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,640

You must water me every day.

448
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,390
Every day,

449
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,470
you must ensure

450
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,270
I get at least two hours of sunlight.

451
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,880
But not direct intense sunlight.

452
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,540
And I can't be exposed to cold.

453
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,800
Of course,

454
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,890
I shouldn't be overheated either.

455
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,930
Also,

456
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,310
when I want to talk,

457
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,640
you need to chat with me

458
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
and make me happy.

459
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,350
And when I don't want to talk,

460
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,480
you mustn't make a sound

461
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,610
or disturb my peace.

462
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,210
Are you Hong Ye's primordial spirit?

463
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,550
He doesn't have all these annoying habits
like you.

464
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,480
Hey, you!

465
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,270
I—

466
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,680
I'll show you—

467
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,790
What?

468
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,880
I shall call you Little Leaf.

469
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,320
No, no.

470
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,350
That sounds like a girl's name.

471
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,400
How could that suit me?

472
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,110
But you're in my hands now,

473
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,440
so you have to do as I say.

474
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,590
Little Leaf.

475
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,680
Little Leaf.

476
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,650
Little Leaf.

477
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,250
Do you agree?

478
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,110
Do you agree?

479
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,350
If you don't agree,

480
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,720
I'll keep tickling you.

481
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,960
Do you agree? Do you agree?

482
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,620
Fine, fine.

483
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,850
I agree, I agree.

484
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,310
I am Little Leaf,

485
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,040
happy now?

486
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,120
Come back, Little Leaf.

487
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,200
This tea is cool and sweet.

488
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,990
If you drink it,

489
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,880
all your pain will disappear.

490
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,970
If you continue suffering like this,

491
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,570
your sister will suffer too.

492
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,300
Why not let yourself off

493
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,240
and let your sister off too?

494
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,550
Survive first.

495
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,800
I would rather die

496
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,240
than surrender my principles.

497
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,510
Tan'er and I

498
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,480
are surely of one mind.

499
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,230
Tan'er transformed into a blade

500
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,380
just so you could live.

501
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,260
What about you?

502
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,520
Your brother Lu Tong

503
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,460
was a man of integrity.

504
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,840
How could you willingly

505
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,830
bow and scrape

506
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,120
to serve a spirit?

507
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,960
But my brother is already dead!

508
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,280
I guessed right.

509
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,450
When you mentioned my brother,

510
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,040
I was still hoping...

511
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,110
hoping I might see him again.

512
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,420
Your brother

513
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,480
died a hero.

514
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,350
You were there?

515
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,200
Yes.

516
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,080
Then why are you still alive?

517
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,220
His dying wish

518
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,960
was for me to find you.

519
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,750
Now you've found me,

520
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,910
what can you even do?

521
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,070
Save you...

522
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,310
from this misery.

523
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,460
You?

524
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,230
You can barely save yourself.

525
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,130
Dreamshard

526
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,420
is only powerful in illusions.

527
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,650
But she never dares
to reveal her true form.

528
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,440
If we can find her weakness

529
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,900
and capture her true form,

530
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,510
we can defeat her.

531
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,510
I'll go back and report

532
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,710
everything you said to the Immortal Lord.

533
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,230
I'm your only chance
to escape her control!

534
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,360
Quickly tell me everything
about Dreamshard,

535
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,190
I might find a way to break her magic.

536
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,920
I previously

537
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,800
heard from Xiao Yao

538
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,480
that Dreamshard was trapped by love,

539
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,060
abandoned her immortal path,

540
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,000
and became a spirit.

541
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:08,840
Is that true?

542
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:20,360
Immortal Lord was an immortal
of the Realm of Exalted Immortal.

543
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,810
A thousand years ago,

544
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,510
she admired the human realm's
hustle and bustle

545
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,980
and descended to earth,

546
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,710
falling in love with a human man.

547
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,090
Originally,

548
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,880
she was willing to give up her immortality

549
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,350
for a few decades of happiness with him
in the human realm.

550
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,800
But that man was frail.

551
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,280
Before long,

552
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,520
he fell ill with a strange disease.

553
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,050
No matter how Immortal Lord
tried to heal him, nothing worked.

554
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,290
The physician they consulted said

555
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,790
unless they obtained the Kunlun Mirror

556
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,670
and went to the celestial mountain

557
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,000
to find the Yuli Spring,

558
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,630
even gods couldn't save him.

559
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,540
Immortal Lord
went through countless hardships

560
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,630
and actually assembled the Kunlun Mirror.

561
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,820
But when she returned to the man's home
with the mirror,

562
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,920
she was trapped
by an immortal-binding formation.

563
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,580
The Kunlun Mirror was stolen,

564
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,760
and the man never appeared again.

565
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,110
It turned out

566
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,910
the strange disease was just a trap.

567
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,190
The purpose was to make
Immortal Lord work tirelessly

568
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,190
to assemble the Kunlun Mirror,

569
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,280
so they could the mirror
to gain favor with the human emperor

570
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,140
to become the imperial son-in-law
and gain wealth.

571
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:44,330
Immortal Lord's powers were dispersed
by the binding formation.

572
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,550
In desperation,

573
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,300
she recited the Heart-Burning Incantation,

574
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,160
transforming her original heart

575
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,000
into a crystal heart.

576
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,490
She abandoned her immortal identity—

577
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,090
changing from an immortal

578
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,200
into a spirit.

579
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:09,270
The immortal-binding formation
could no longer trap her.

580
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,800
She broke through the formation,

581
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,070
and ripped out the hearts...

582
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,080
of that man's entire family.

583
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:27,920
From then on,

584
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,560
there was no place for her
in the Three Realms.

585
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,290
She had to find this otherworldly island

586
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,810
beyond the Three Realms

587
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,130
and outside the five elements.

588
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,250
But spirits

589
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,630
need large amounts of human essence

590
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,630
to maintain their demonic powers
and appearance.

591
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,960
For thousands of years,

592
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,880
countless humans

593
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,760
have come seeking immortality.

594
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,510
In reality, they were just

595
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,770
fertilizer for Immortal Lord's garden.

596
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,120
Penglang Celestial Island

597
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,920
is nothing but Dreamshard's scheme

598
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,590
to bewitch humans.

599
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,590
Penglang and the Yuli Spring
do truly exist.

600
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,250
Yet finding the Kunlun Mirror

601
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,080
is an exceedingly difficult task.

602
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,000
After becoming a spirit,

603
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,770
Immortal Lord can only maintain her power
in the Realm of Mist and Void.

604
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,620
Once the physical body leaves,

605
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,800
it will quickly wither.

606
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,070
Unless one drinks
from the true Yuli Spring,

607
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,200
one cannot return to immortal status.

608
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,400
For thousands of years,

609
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,070
she has sent batch after batch
of disciples

610
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,190
to find the Kunlun Mirror fragments,
all without success.

611
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,050
Unexpectedly,

612
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:50,550
the Demon King Hong Ye,
a hundred years ago,

613
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,110
assembled the complete Kunlun Mirror,

614
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,640
shocking the Three Realms.

615
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,150
But to win a human princess's favor,

616
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,680
he handed it over to humans.

617
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,320
And lost his life too.

618
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,490
A hundred years later,

619
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,570
Hong Ye is about to awaken.

620
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,710
Immortal Lord cast a spell
to enter the human emperor's dreams,

621
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:11,190
ensuring continued conflict
between humans and demons.

622
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,830
She also created a phantom

623
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,990
to lure Hong Ye
to the Realm of Mist and Void.

624
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,710
However,

625
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,960
Hong Ye's karmic ties with humans
remained unresolved.

626
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,490
Immortal Lord had no choice

627
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,800
but to send us to bring Hong Ye here.

628
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,880
So the story's so complicated.

629
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,800
I've told you the entire truth

630
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,070
so you'll give up this futile quest.

631
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,690
For thousands of years,

632
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,590
countless humans and demons

633
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,440
have challenged Immortal Lord
in the Realm of Mist and Void,

634
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,100
but none have ever succeeded.

635
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,550
Don't blame Immortal Lord
for being ruthless either.

636
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,080
The flowers in
the Realm of Mist and Void today

637
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,150
are all nourished

638
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,950
by human selfishness and greed.

639
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,320
You keep talking about humans,

640
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,960
humans...

641
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,460
But what about you?

642
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,190
Are you a human,

643
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,510
a demon,

644
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,760
or a spirit?

645
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,760
I suffered greatly in the human realm.

646
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,710
Fortunately, Immortal Lord took me in,

647
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,400
allowing me to serve here.

648
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,360
Is that really true?

649
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,280
I've said all I can say.

650
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,280
I'll beg Immortal Lord to give you
three more days.

651
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,260
If you still insist on your course
after three days,

652
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,330
I'll take it as
you volunteer to be a fertilizer.

653
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,410
Tan'er will also be melted into a hoe,

654
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,630
serving Immortal Lord in the flower fields
for eternity.
