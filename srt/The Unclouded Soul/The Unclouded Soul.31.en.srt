[Episode 31]

3
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,570
Hong Ye,

4
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,950
you thought sealing us away
for 10,000 years

5
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,840
would allow you to seize power alone?

6
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,640
Today, I'll show you what it feels like

7
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,820
to die 1,000 deaths.

8
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,180
I'd like to peel off his skin,

9
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,890
stuff it with his hair,

10
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,479
and make it a ball to play with.
Sounds good?

11
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,680
That's too merciful.

12
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,370
I want to strip the flesh from his body

13
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,280
piece by piece,

14
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,130
each slice as thin as a cicada's wing.

15
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,890
Both of you, stand down.

16
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,710
Just watch.

17
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,510
Ao Hen!

18
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,400
We all suffered the seal for 10,000 years.

19
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,680
What right do you have to act alone?

20
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,190
Shut up.

21
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,750
Redirect the formation

22
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,430
to focus the attack 15 miles southwest.

23
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,690
Change the formation!

24
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,730
Die in battle,

25
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,600
and at least your family will
receive compensation to live off.

26
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,290
But desertion is
defying His Majesty's orders.

27
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,060
You will be killed with no mercy.

28
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,780
Ao Hen,

29
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,630
here's the thing.

30
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,760
You hit way too hard.

31
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,600
A move of yours

32
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,710
will reduce him to ashes, right?

33
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,370
Let go of me!

34
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,590
We'd better...

35
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,560
I'll be gentler.

Let me go first!

37
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,160

You couldn't be Teng She, could you?

139

Sister remembers me! She remembers me!

140

141
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,130
she only remembers me.

142
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,440
Hold on, hold on.

143
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,750
I

144
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,030
have a poor memory.

145
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,220
I really don't remember

146
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,750
how we met.

147
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,530
Xiao Yao,

148
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,170
it's been 10,000 years.

149
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,080
Who knows how many times
of reincarnation you've had?

150
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,790
It's just normal
that you don't remember clearly.

151
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,590
But she still remembers Hong Ye.

152
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,450
Three great demons,

153
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,670
our demon kind is teetering
on the brink of destruction.

154
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,360
Whatever grievances or grudges you have,

155
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,910
please cast them aside for now.

156
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,250
For nearly 10,000 years,

157
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,420
our demon kind
has been through countless catastrophes,

158
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,820
with few of us remaining.

159
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,220
How dare you say that?

160
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,550
You 3,

161
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,890
you possess such immense power

162
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,750
just to harm your own kind?

163
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,720
Yes.

164
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,390
Of course.

165
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,720
The Demons' Valley beneath your feet is

166
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,960
the only place in this world

167
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,300
for demons to inhabit.

168
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,830
It's in danger now.

169
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,570
It's fine if you don't help us.

170
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,150
But please, at least let us out
to defend it.

171
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,790
Whatever issues you have,
we can discuss them when we return.

172
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,520
Is that okay?

173
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,150
Can't believe demons have become so weak,

174
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,790
being cornered by humans to this extent.

175
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,120
Just some minor humans.

176
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,770
Xiao Yao,

177
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,600
I'll help you solve this.

178
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,200
As long as you ask, Sister,

179
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,840
I'll do anything for you.

180
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,280
Don't worry,

181
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,350
I'm here, too.

182
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,820
Deer!

183
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,790
Bamboo!

184
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,580
Please don't let me be a broom
in my next life!

185
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,010
Don't be afraid.

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,910
What are you doing?

187
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,390
Attack!

188
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,520
Such a soft little kitty like you

189
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,920
should be playing with yarn balls

190
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,380
instead of fighting here.

191
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,570
Leave this to me.

192
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,880
Can believe you've been
beaten so badly by humans.

193
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,750
How useless.

194
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,090
Now that's more like it.

195
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,150
Human tactics

196
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,350
have indeed improved quite a bit.

197
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:24,840
My Lord!

198
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,650
We can't win!

199
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,510
Let's retreat!

200
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,310
If we don't, they'll kill us all!

201
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:32,870
Fall back.

202
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,200
Go!

203
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,430
Run!

204
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,480
Tan'er,

205
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,420
protect your brother and leave!

206
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,550
Come on!

207
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,750
Don't pursue a cornered enemy.

208
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,950
The humans have grown stronger,

209
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,930
but they're not unbeatable yet.

210
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,580
He was scared off?

211
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,600
But Hong Ye is

212
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,690
really something now

213
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,820
after 10,000 years.

214
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,480
Shut your mouth!

215
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,390
How dare you speak so carelessly
about His Lordship?

216
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,320
Little cat demon,
you're quite protective of your master.

217
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,050
The humans have retreated now.

218
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,270
Take everyone

219
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,320
to a safe place.

220
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,440
Let's go.

221
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,480
Follow me to the Moon-Gazing Terrace.

222
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:20,910
Mm.

223
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,610
Fortunately, I reacted quickly.

224
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,750
Otherwise, I would've been done for.

225
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,690
Had I not been injured,

226
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,690
this would have been
a piece of cake for me.

227
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,420
Are you okay?

228
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,670
I'm okay. Just some minor wounds.

229
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,270
You doing alright?

230
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,010
Yeah.

231
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,670
How's your injury here?

232
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,220
Come on.

233
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,080
It doesn't hurt anymore.

234
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,830
Thank you.

235
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,440
-Don't worry. I'm fine.
-His Lordship is back.

236
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,840
-My Lord.
-And Xiao Yao is back, too.

237
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,470
Xiao Yao.

238
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,100
My Lord.

239
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,640
My Lord.

240
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,880
My Lord.

241
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,570
-My Lord.
-Xiao Ming.

242
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,950
You've got your power back, My Lord?

243
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,960
His Lordship has restored his power!

244
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,440
Really?

245
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,270
That's great!

246
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,230
Sorry,

247
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,030
everyone, I've come too late.

248
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,170
Thank you
for your tremendous help, seniors.

249
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,490
As expected of great senior demons.

250
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,550
You can tell the difference

251
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,960
when senior demons strike.

252
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,270
You've truly opened our eyes.

253
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,880
Xiao Yao,

254
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,280
I told you before

255
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,020
that even without Hong Ye,

256
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,819
we could still repel the humans.

257
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,349
Hong Ye,

258
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,410
the humans have retreated.

259
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,200
Now,

260
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,180
it's time to settle our score.

261
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,870
Regardless of our past grudges,

262
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,810
I, Hong Ye, really appreciate

263
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,410
your tremendous help.

264
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,160
Xiao Ming.

265
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,590
Yes.

266
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,200
Take everyone back to Youning Cave.

267
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,400
I need to discuss important matters

268
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,260
with these 3 seniors.

269
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,830
But...

270
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,400
Follow my order.

271
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,220
Yes.

272
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,240
Everyone, follow me back to Youning Cave!

273
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,850
Let's go.

274
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,200
Come on, let me help you.

275
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,770
I'm not leaving.

276
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,220
Xiao Yao.

277
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,580
Step aside.

278
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,740
This is between Hong Ye

279
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,550
and the 3 of us.

280
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,040
Xiao Yao,

281
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,540
he's right.

282
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,000
Though I don't know
what happened in the past,

283
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,780
today,

284
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,500
I must settle things with these 3.

285
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,170
Let me do it.

286
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,460
You!

287
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,920
What are you looking at?

288
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,110
I'm talking to you.

289
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,080
What did I do?

290
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,400
I won't talk
about past grievances for now.

291
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,550
You just held me hostage,

292
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,640
nearly ruining my reputation.

293
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,900
How do we settle this immediate offense?

294
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,380
When did I ever hold you hostage?

295
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,110
You took advantage of the chaos,

296
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,400
and your methods weren't
any better than humans'.

297
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,750
You weren't really trying
to ruin my sister's reputation, were you?

298
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,430
Nonsense!

299
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,790
I was afraid you two would hurt her.

300
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,510
That's right.

301
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,590
You almost hurt her.

302
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,790
When did I ever hurt her?

303
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,320
He's mad,

304
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,110
getting defensive!

305
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,110
Why so mad?

306
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,960
Who's mad?

307
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,380
And you two...

308
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,490
Sister,

309
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,420
I always listen to you.

310
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,160
Me, too...

311
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,790
Shut up.

312
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,080
What did you just call me?

313
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,540
Sister, of course.

314
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,490
I've missed you so much.

315
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,530
Shameless.

316
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,270
Since you call me sister,

317
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,400
why are you irritating me here

318
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,530
just like these two?

319
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,040
There's indeed something wrong

320
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,000
with you two.

321
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,930
Hong Ye!

322
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,800
How dare you hide behind Xiao Yao?

323
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,350
Today, I challenge you
to a fight to the death.

324
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,550
Do you dare accept it?

325
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,480
I'll say yes.

326
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,660
I challenge you to a fight.

327
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,310
Do you dare accept it?

328
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,300
Come on.

329
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
Fight me first.

330
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,350
Then you can go fight Hong Ye.

331
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,140
Well...

332
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,160
"Well"?

333
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,110
Are you dumb?

334
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:11,910
What?

335
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,590
Are you scared?

336
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:12,990
Why...

337
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,440
Why wouldn't I be scared?

338
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,840
So, will you fight or not?

339
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,310
I was just released
from a 10,000-year seal.

340
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,190
My body is

341
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:25,790
weak.

342
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,570
Let me recover first before we fight.

343
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,930
What do you say?

344
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,750
Fine!

345
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,330
What about you then?

346
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,100
Need some time to recover?

347
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,710
Our Demons' Valley has been destroyed.

348
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,150
We need to rebuild our home.

349
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,600
There are a whole lot of things
to attend to.

350
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,330
So we'll have to take our leave.

351
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:51,830
Let's go.

352
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,710
Xiao...

353
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,200
To...

354
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,470
To kill Hong Ye,

355
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,430
we must first fight Xiao Yao.

356
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,120
Isn't it unsolvable?

357
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,790
The Qiong Qi Clan has robust limbs

358
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,790
but simple minds.

359
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,020
The reputation is well-deserved.

360
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,380
Enough!

361
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,900
You still don't get it?

362
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,240
Even without her memory,

363
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,510
Sister is still protecting Hong Ye.

364
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,240
That means

365
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,010
even if we kill Hong Ye,

366
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,270
Sister will only resent us.

367
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,890
We need to figure out another way.

368
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,720
What's most frustrating now is

369
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,250
that even Hong Ye
doesn't remember anything.

370
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,480
Even if I kill him,

371
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,600
it still won't
ease the hatred in my heart!

372
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,430
How did those 3 show up
out of nowhere again?

373
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,690
These 3 great demons are powerful

374
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,750
and harbor intense resentment

375
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,480
toward both humans and demons.

376
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,920
They were sealed in Yunmeng Lake years ago

377
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,400
for fear that they would bring disaster
to the world.

378
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
But this matter is

379
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,890
a secret of the demon race,

380
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,180
known only to successive Demon Kings.

381
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,640
Yet somehow Heiwu

382
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,360
learned about this secret

383
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,260
and broke their seal.

384
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,910
They actually are quite adorable, though.

385
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,050
Who knows if they're just pretending?

386
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,010
Why are they so hostile toward you?

387
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,140
I wonder what grudges

388
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,210
existed 10,000 years ago.

389
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,970
So we knew each other 10,000 years ago.

390
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,660
I'm so curious

391
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,890
about how we first met 10,000 years ago.

392
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,260
Exalted Immortal.

393
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,650
We've heard that you consume wind and dew

394
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,620
and gather the essence of flowers.

395
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,110
So we have prepared
these humble offerings,

396
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,950
hoping they might

397
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,680
please you, Exalted Immortal.

398
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,300
You dare speak of sincerity?

399
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,890
I guess it was your unsatisfied greed

400
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,060
that caused you this retribution!

401
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,220
Exalted Immortal,

402
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,010
why do you say so?

403
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,510
The Emperor trusted shameless sorcerers,

404
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,100
misused pills,

405
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,740
and consumed way too many demons,

406
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,310
leading to the emergence
of the ancient great demons

407
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,640
who had been sealed for 10,000 years.

408
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,550
How could humans stand a chance to win?

409
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:37,970
Well...

410
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,240
How could this happen?

411
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,400
Please calm down, Exalted Immortal.

412
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
I'm going to petition His Majesty

413
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,710
to send reinforcements immediately.

414
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,250
All hell broke loose.

415
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,130
No matter how many troops you send,

416
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,050
they won't satisfy
the demons' bloodthirst.

417
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,140
Please save us, Exalted Immortal!

418
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,660
Is there

419
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,530
a Mountain and Sea Map

420
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,770
drawn by ancient demons
in the imperial palace?

421
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,960
Go check
the imperial treasury immediately.

422
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,710
If it's there,

423
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,310
bring it
to the Exalted Immortal immediately!

424
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,710
Hurry!

425
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,060
-Yes.
-Yes.

426
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,190
Hurry up!

427
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,740
Get up.

428
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,670
Leave now.

429
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,920
Dreamshard Immortal,

430
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,030
I ended up becoming you.

431
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:42,090
No!

432
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,900
I am not you.

433
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,640
I will never become you!

434
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,510
You may all leave.

435
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,490
-Yes.
-Yes.

436
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,290
[Misty Forest] [Mount Qingyuan]
[Mount Qingyun] [Pingjiang Prefecture]

437
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:32,300
[Hong Ye] [Qiong Qi] [Ao Hen] [Teng She]

438
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,400
[Hong Ye] [Qiong Qi] [Ao Hen] [Teng She]

439
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,000
There are actually 3 of them.

440
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,720
No wonder we lost.

441
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,220
We were originally prepared
to deal with Hong Ye alone,

442
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,630
but now there are 3 more.

443
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,870
Each of them is
even more powerful than Hong Ye.

444
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,530
How can we continue fighting?

445
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,070
The Bulwark Duke is working on a plan.

446
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,200
We just

447
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,880
need to follow orders.

448
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,310
Mm.

449
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,350
Sir,

450
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,480
we've lost everything we had.

451
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,540
What plan could we possibly work out?

452
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,170
Let's count our casualties first.

453
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,000
Yes.

454
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,140
You bold demon!

455
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,700
How dare you sneak into our camp at night?

456
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,960
Why so nervous, Mr. Ji?

457
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,240
You and I are now of the same kind.

458
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,990
Why should I hold past grudges
against you?

459
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,190
What happened before wasn't

460
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,070
solely your responsibility.

461
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,270
I was foolish,

462
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,720
choosing someone whose word meant nothing

463
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,590
to join me for the great cause!

464
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,650
If you go back now,

465
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,920
humans will surely despise you.

466
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,580
If I'm not mistaken,

467
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,730
you won't even be allowed
to survive, right?

468
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,110
And since Demons' Valley
cannot be conquered at the moment,

469
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,140
you're truly caught
between a rock and a hard place.

470
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,110
But we're in the same situation.

471
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,460
Neither humans nor demons accept us.

472
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,680
Only by joining forces

473
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:46,060
can we gain freedom of movement.

474
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,240
You need me.

475
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,190
Because I know demons the best.

476
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,530
Come into the tent to talk.

477
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,640
My Lord,

478
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,240
Heiwu was previously

479
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,350
my informant

480
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,960
planted among the demons.

481
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,390
Informant?

482
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,420
Is he an informant

483
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,000
or just a loser?

484
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,770
I've offended you a lot before,
Bulwark Duke.

485
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,630
I'd like to apologize for it.

486
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,790
Hope you

487
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,600
can let it go, Bulwark Duke.

488
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,300
This defeat

489
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,680
has caused humans heavy losses.

490
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,270
Aren't you curious, Bulwark Duke,

491
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:46,400
about the 3 great demons
that suddenly appeared in Demons' Valley

492
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,830
and their origins?

493
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,340
There used to be

494
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,450
a Sea Turtle guarding this place,

495
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,120
so the seal never weakened.

496
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,900
To release
those 3 ancient fierce beasts,

497
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,510
Hong Ye used any means necessary

498
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,890
and cruelly murdered
the only Demon Lord Sea Turtle

499
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,370
of our demons.

500
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,210
Sea Turtle above in heaven,

501
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,480
I, Heiwu,

502
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,870
will surely avenge your death!

503
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,720
Those 3 great demons

504
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,880
in yesterday's battle all have power

505
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,240
greater than Hong Ye's.

506
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,800
Even if Hong Ye removed the seal

507
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,730
to bring disaster to the world,

508
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,480
how could he possibly

509
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,140
control 3 ancient fierce beasts
at the same time

510
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,460
to work for him?

511
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,480
Xiao Yao.

512
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,080
Xiao Yao?

513
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,210
I saw it with my own eyes yesterday

514
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:59,030
that those 3 great demons were all
devoted to Xiao Yao.

515
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,540
Xiao Yao said a few words,

516
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,960
yet they took them as gospel

517
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,290
and obeyed completely.

518
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,160
I guess

519
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,470
Hong Ye exploited this

520
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,790
to trick them

521
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,970
into fighting for him.

522
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,480
When Tan'er fought those 3 great demons,

523
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,000
I could sense their power, too.

524
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,200
They truly boast tremendous strength.

525
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,970
With these 3 ancient great demons
joining the demon side,

526
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,300
humans are now greatly outmatched.

527
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,770
You cannot hope to win by strength alone.

528
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,530
You must find their weakness

529
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,190
and defeat them one by one.

530
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,550
Heiwu's selfish intentions are obvious.

531
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,350
He simply wants to use human power
for his own ends.

532
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,560
Be it humans or demons,

533
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,170
everyone has selfish motives.

534
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,570
Since you know his true intentions,

535
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,640
you should realize

536
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,950
that what he says is true.

537
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,300
The 3 ancient great demons

538
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,080
plus Hong Ye.

539
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,030
They've got

540
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,660
only one weakness.

541
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,770
What on earth happened?

542
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,500
Exalted Immortal,

543
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,430
are you alright?

544
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,400
Blood essence...

545
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,420
Spiritual essence...

546
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,260
Exalted Immortal,

547
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,300
drink this.

548
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,090
Get lost now.

549
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,640
Yes.

550
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,430
Immortal Lord...

551
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,400
I will never become you.

552
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,790
Never!

553
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,640
Bulwark Duke.

554
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,110
What happened, Bulwark Duke?

555
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,680
There's an emergency happening
in the capital.

556
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,000
I must hurry back immediately.

557
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,720
Bulwark Duke,

558
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,590
you can't do it.

559
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,240
The war
between the 2 clans is ever-changing.

560
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,440
Any delay could lead to disaster.

561
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,370
I said I must return to the capital!

562
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,050
What on earth happened?

563
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,270
Are you hurt?

564
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:08,960
I'm fine.

565
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,350
The war is important.

566
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,360
Do not be distracted.

567
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,630
You're alone in the capital.

568
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,190
Everyone is keeping an eye on you.

569
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,489
How can I not worry?

570
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,370
I am the Exalted Immortal
in the Emperor's eyes.

571
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,710
Who would dare harm me?

572
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,389
Even if I die,

573
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,590
I will never consume
other people's essence

574
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,000
or do things
that would make you look down on me.

575
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,440
Everything will be fine

576
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,230
once I find the Yuli Spring.

577
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,920
It's just that lately,

578
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,070
I often feel...

579
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,320
I feel
that Dreamshard Immortal is still alive.

580
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,980
She's in my body,

581
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,710
trying to consume me,

582
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,690
to enslave me,

583
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,810
until she completely devours me.

584
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,000
Bingzhu,

585
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,150
do you remember

586
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,000
when you first met me?

587
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,960
As if it were yesterday.

588
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,750
Great.

589
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,390
I thought

590
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,890
it had been
hundreds or thousands of years.

591
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,810
Because even I
can barely remember it myself.

592
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,280
This is all my fault.

593
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,810
Everything I've done wasn't
to make you feel guilty.

594
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,710
I know.

595
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,670
You once said...

596
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,960
You would take care of me for my brother.

597
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,580
Does that still stand?

598
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,190
Yes, of course.

599
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,320
If you help me fulfill 3 more wishes,

600
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,050
that will be enough.

601
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:23,710
Okay.

602
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,070
Go ahead.

603
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,960
You said that you raised Tan'er.

604
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,880
When she was little,
you couldn't afford toys,

605
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,550
so you used your knife

606
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,830
to carve wooden and bamboo dolls

607
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,920
to make her happy

608
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,000
and help her sleep.

609
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,400
Could you...

610
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,670
carve one for me, too?

611
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,320
Of course.

612
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,680
What kind of wooden doll would you like?

613
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,230
Just make one

614
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,030
that looks like me

615
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,790
when we first met.

616
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,590
Do you still remember?

617
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,000
Of course I do.

618
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,750
And what about your second wish?

619
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,080
What's it?

620
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:31,960
I...

621
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,710
I can't think of it right now.

622
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,760
When I think of something,

623
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,670
I'll let you know.

624
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,760
Orioles,

625
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,550
Parrot,

626
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,800
I can't bring you back to life,

627
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,550
but together, we can

628
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,590
save these dying flowers.

629
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,690
You're quite good at deceiving yourself.

630
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,050
Why are you still here?

631
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,040
I just won a battle for you guys,

632
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,070
and now you want to cut me loose?

633
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,170
If these birds were still alive,

634
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,290
would they agree to what you did?

635
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,510
You turned their original bodies

636
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,050
into rotten fertilizers

637
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,960
to nourish a useless flower.

638
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,400
All things in the world are one.

639
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,480
As one wanes, another waxes.

640
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,400
They nourish each other

641
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,660
to achieve longevity.

642
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,110
This is the law of nature.

643
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,280
How can you call it rotten and useless?

644
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,320
What a fine talk of wane and wax.

645
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,710
Then, if Hong Ye's death

646
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,840
could bring prosperity to demons,

647
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,710
would you do it?

648
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,520
Only with Hong Ye here

649
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,760
will demons prosper.

650
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,680
Were it not for Hong Ye,

651
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,480
humans would have already been wiped out.

652
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,230
And demons

653
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,970
wouldn't be in such a miserable state.

654
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
I'm afraid Hong Ye has never told you

655
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,710
how he became the Demon King, right?

656
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,670
Does that matter?

657
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,000
You don't need to sow discord here.

658
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,230
He's entirely devoted
to protecting demons,

659
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,230
exhausting himself for their sake.

660
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,340
That's enough.

661
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,760
You don't remember,

662
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,620
so it doesn't matter anymore?

663
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:47,890
Never mind.

664
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,460
I've waited for 10,000 years.

665
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,120
A few more days won't make a difference.

666
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,940
But you'd better remember

667
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,740
that I, Ao Hen, always get my revenge.

668
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,010
You can protect him for now,

669
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,070
but not forever.

670
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,670
Sister!

671
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,960
Sister,

672
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,630
look!

673
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,220
See what I brought you.

674
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,860
Why did you bring
the Zhuyu herbs' home here?

675
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,550
I thought
these little things were quite cute,

676
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,630
and you might like...

677
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,360
Put it back!

678
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,030
That's what you get
for flattering her recklessly!

679
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,360
You irritated her, huh?

680
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,000
Alright, alright.

681
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,480
I'm not really mad.

682
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,800
You're actually quite adorable.

683
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,480
Much better than

684
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,150
that sarcastic Ao Hen.

685
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,440
Xiao Yao,

686
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,540
has Ao Hen provoked you again?

687
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,400
No, no, no.

688
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,000
Well,

689
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,190
it's because of my weak power.

690
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,800
It has nothing to do with the senior.

691
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,670
It doesn't matter.

692
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,800
As long as we're here,

693
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,400
you're still the strongest in this world.

694
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:58,880
Mm.

695
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,590
I appreciate your kindness,

696
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:04,120
but I think it's better
to cultivate on my own.

697
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,030
Well, then,

698
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,920
let me teach you, Sister.

699
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,110
Um,

700
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,850
could you please stop calling me Sister?

701
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,400
You said it for real?

702
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,280
So,

703
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,820
if I don't call you Sister,

704
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,880
does that mean...

705
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,630
Does that mean I can like you now?

706
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,670
What nonsense are you talking about?
