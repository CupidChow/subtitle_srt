[Episode 30]

3
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,039
Of course I do.

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,000
Good.

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,930
If the Demon King

6
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,039
were to marry a human princess,

7
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,789
peace between the two races

8
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,509
would begin

9
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,750
with the royal families.

10
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,590
Wouldn't that be far better

11
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,000
than your painstaking,

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,560
gradual attempts to fix things?

13
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,970
Father, you know what we are thinking?

14
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,710
That is exactly what I want.

15
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,750
However,

16
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,710
I have one request.

17
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,030
I'm all ears.

18
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,750
I want you

19
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,750
to find

20
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,120
the ancient Kunlun Mirror.

21
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,360
You want Yuli Spring?

22
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,870
Yes.

23
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,030
Let both races share Yuli Spring

24
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,520
and enjoy eternal life.

25
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,010
Even if you didn't ask,

26
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,680
I would find

27
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,430
Yuli Spring for Ning'an anyway.

28
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,750
But finding it

29
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,030
is no easy task.

30
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,520
No, it isn't.

31
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,270
Yet for the greater good,

32
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,030
if the Demon King
is to marry a human princess,

33
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,710
there must be something

34
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,190
to convince everyone of his sincerity.

35
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,050
How about this?

36
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,590

never again harming innocent demons.

43

On a personal level,

humans live far shorter lives than demons,

45
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,400
while demon cultivation
is long and arduous.

to remain with you forever,

not be a fleeting passerby
in your endless years.

If you love each other,

50

with neighboring tribes,

113
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,630
enduring countless wars,

defeating each opponent one by one,

and finally unifying into
today's Tiansheng Kingdom.

117

But compared

118

122
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,240
only because these 17 ancestors

123

and hundreds of royal clansmen
sacrificed their lives.

124
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,000
They all fell in wars against the demons.

125

To lead humans
in completely eradicating the demons

How could I face our ancestors?

139

by the demons?

141

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,120
She was a demoness!

144
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,890
She was sent by the demons
to disrupt the human court!

145

Fortunately, I saw through her.

146

After she gave birth to you,

147
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,620
I killed her with my own hands,

148
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,790
which only then secured my ascension
to the throne

149
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,830
and ushered in a new era.

[Emperor Guangwu of the Tiansheng Kingdom]

151
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,910
Then why

152

didn't you kill me as well?

153
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,080
You are my own flesh and blood after all.

154
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,240
I could not bear
to let you be implicated by that demon.

155
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,670
I ordered that no one
speak of your origins.

156
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,960
That is why there have been

157
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,290
so many rumors in the palace
about your birth.

158
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,120
It's just that...

159
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,670
I never expected that,

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,670
despite all precautions,

161
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,650
you would still become entangled
with the Demon King.

162
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,390
Ning'an,

163
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,980
now is the time for you to choose.

164
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,910
To completely cleanse your tainted blood,

165
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,080
you must kill the Demon King for me

166
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,820
and wipe out
the demon race for the human race.

167
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,750
Only then can you prove yourself

168
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,550
worthy of the title of princess
I bestowed upon you

169
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,030
and worthy of our royal bloodline.

170
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,460
I want you to swear before our ancestors

171
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,890
that you and the demons

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,320
are mortal enemies.

173
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,300
What if I refuse?

174
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,240
You have been close with the demons
for a long time.

175
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,200
If Wang Hong hadn't told me

176
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,000
that you are very familiar
with the demon realm

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,150
and that you led the Demon King

178
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,880
into the Feiyu Guard's ambush,

179
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,870
your collusion with him
in and out of the imperial palace

180
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,330
would have earned you death
many times over.

181
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,910
You should be thanking the Demon King
for sending you back,

182
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,640
or you wouldn't be alive today.

183
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,130
So

184
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,350
if I had returned alone that day,

185
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,320
I would have certainly died.

186
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,360
But if Hong Ye came back with me,

187
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,280
it meant I still had value to you.

188
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,180
You were counting
on Hong Ye's feelings for me,

189
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,910
staging a touching act

190
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,630
just to deceive him into

191
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,510
finding the Kunlun Mirror for you,

192
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,970
so you could claim
Yuli Spring for yourself.

193
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,460
Having a father like you

194
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,630
is my greatest curse.

195
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,000
You...

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,840
I advise you

197
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,320
to abandon your scheme

198
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,100
and keep your promises to Hong Ye.

199
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,820
Otherwise,

200
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,750
he will surely raze your imperial palace
to the ground.

201
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,960
I also advise you

202
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,910
to kill the Demon King for me

203
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,040
and draw the map of the Demons' Valley!

204
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,110
I'm giving you one last chance!

205
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,000
Guards.

206
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,150
Your Majesty, you are wise.

207
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,630
You know Princess Ning'an
has been unruly since childhood

208
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,030
and lacks any sense of duty or honor,

209
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,960
so you ordered the Master to spend over
a month creating this puppet talisman.

210
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,000
With this,

211
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,510
everything can proceed according to plan

212
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,550
without delaying Your Majesty's
grand design.

213
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,200
How could I entrust such a task

214
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,230
to the bastard of a lowly beast-tamer?

215
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,960
Once I kill the Demon King

216
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,610
and obtain the ancient Kunlun Mirror,

217
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,120
whether you want to continue being
a princess in the Cold Palace

218
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,150
or follow that demon in death

219
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,790
is all up to you.

220
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,320
My Lord,

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,260
can that human emperor

222
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,270
be trusted?

223
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,290
I remain wary of the human emperor,

224
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,040
but I trust Ning'an.

225
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:30,960
My Lord,

226
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,030
how about...

227
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,870
I accompany you

228
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,070
to welcome the bride?

229
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,030
You stay here
and guard the Demons' Valley.

230
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,350
Even if the humans try to do something,

231
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
they can't do anything to me.

232
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,430
Stop sleeping.

233
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,010
Come out and talk to me.

234
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,330
Why did you call me out?

235
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,030
Didn't you hear what His Lordship said?

236
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,120
He told us to stay put
in the Demons' Valley,

237
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,600
so let's just stay here.

238
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,650
Otherwise, he'll get angry again.

239
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,150
But

240
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,000
I still can't shake

241
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,390
this uneasy feeling.

242
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,810
I feel that this trip

243
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,750
will be dangerous for His Lordship.

244
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,900
Look at you,

245
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,360
overthinking again.

246
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,200
Who in this world could put His Lordship

247
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,880
in danger?

248
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,140
Why dwell on such pointless worries?

249
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,890
I just can't stop worrying.

250
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,900
Stop talking nonsense.

251
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,100
Are you coming or not?

252
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,530
Fine, fine.

253
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,000
I can't argue with you.

254
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,870
Go by yourself if you want to go,

255
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,200
but don't drag me along.

256
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,530
Remember to keep your distance.

257
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,060
If His Lordship finds out,
he'll be angry again.

258
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,580
[Yong'an Palace]

259
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,250
[Wedding]

260
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,080
How exactly can I break
this puppet talisman?

261
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
Time is running out.

262
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,090
What should I do?

263
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

264
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,450
Congratulations on your wedding day.

265
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,730
Mocui,

266
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,870
isn't Her Highness already dressed?

267
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,480
Don't miss the auspicious time.

268
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,360
It's done.

269
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,440
Auspicious clouds surround the halls,

270
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,070
and joy fills the courtyard.

271
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,810
Your Highness, please rise.

272
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,360
No.

273
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,890
Hong Ye, please don't come.

274
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,290
[Wedding]

275
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,510
Why isn't Ning'an here yet?

276
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,240
She should have arrived by now.

277
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,980
I've already sent someone to fetch her.

278
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,030
Hurry her up again.

279
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,550
Yes.

280
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,870
Go fetch her quickly.

281
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,630
Yes.

282
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,240
I hope the Master
hasn't made any mistakes.

283
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,200
The Demon King has arrived!

284
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,260
Thank you for coming, Demon King.

285
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,069
So this is...

286
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,260
the ancient Kunlun Mirror?

287
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,130
Indeed it is.

288
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,310
Your Majesty,

289
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,110
where is Ning'an?

290
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,580
Ning'an...

291
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,110
is still getting ready.

292
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,410
She wants to be the most beautiful bride
in the world.

293
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,160
My dear son-in-law,

294
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,760
this ancient Kunlun Mirror—

295
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,790
may I...

296
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,500
take a look at it first?

297
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,440
This mirror

298
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,870
represents my love for Ning'an.

299
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,850
When she's here,

300
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,040
I will give it to her personally.

301
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,190
Very well.

302
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,480
Very well.

303
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,690
Your Highness,

304
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,200
it's time.

305
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,260
Your Highness,

306
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,520
if we miss the auspicious time,

307
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,750
we servants

308
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,920
will be severely punished.

309
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I can't go.

310
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,060
As long as I don't go,

311
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,960
Hong Ye will be safe.

312
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,590
Where is Ning'an?

313
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,260
I'm asking you.

314
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,410
Where is Ning'an?

315
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,920
Protect His Majesty!

316
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,980
Her Highness

317
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,520
has already sworn before the ancestors

318
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,310
of the Tiansheng Kingdom

319
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,910
to eradicate all the demons.

320
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,270
I kept my promise,

321
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,770
but you humans
have gone back on your word.

322
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,920
Tell me

323
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,620
where Ning'an is,

324
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,790
and I'll spare your lives.

325
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,460
Attack!

326
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,720
Hurry!

327
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,310
Put on the bridal veil for Her Highness.

328
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,000
If anything happens to Ning'an,

329
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,680
I will destroy this capital.

330
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,240
Ning'an!

331
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,370
Are you alright?

332
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,270
I have found the ancient Kunlun Mirror
for you.

333
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,920
I also promised

334
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,610
to help humans achieve immortality.

335
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,200
And I'll keep my word.

336
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,030
Ning'an,

337
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,830
what exactly happened?

338
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,180
Hong Ye,

339
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,310
look at me carefully.

340
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,440
My body doesn't belong to me now.

341
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,780
Look into my eyes.

342
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,310
Demons

343
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,610
are a scourge
that all are duty-bound to eradicate.

344
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,960
Demons

345
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,450
are a scourge
that all are duty-bound to eradicate.

346
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,120
Everything in the past

347
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,630
was merely to disturb your mind.

348
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,310
Don't come any closer.

349
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,790
No.

350
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,430
Eight Yang Formation!

351
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,360
[Wedding]

352
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,510
Demon!

353
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,270
I have sealed your power
with the Eight Yang Formation!

354
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,580
Surrender at once!

355
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Hong Ye,

356
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,920
go!

357
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,620
Don't come any closer!

358
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,690
You claim to love me truly.

359
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,970
If you do,

360
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,180
then for my sake,

361
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,940
give up your power!

362
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,570
I can't say that.

363
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,900
Absolutely not.

364
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,790
Kill him! Kill him!

365
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,760
Get the ancient Kunlun Mirror back for me!

366
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,110
Hong Ye!

367
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
Go now.

368
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,790
Just leave me behind.

369
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,320
Why aren't you leaving?

370
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,440
Pipa Hook!

371
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,550
Hong Ye,

372
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,480
I brought this to you.

373
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,580
♪ Fear that the red thread that bound us,
the vows we engraved ♪

374
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:07,970
♪ The "forever" we swore are
meant to miss their mark ♪

375
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,800
♪ Afraid of the exchanged life and death,
the arrows blocking the way ♪

The demons are cunning.

533
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,880
They must have

542
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,050
This battle must be won in one strike.

There is no second chance.

544
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,770
Every moment you delay

545
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,250
gives the demons more time to prepare.

546
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,540
Do not hesitate for even a second.

547
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,140

Do we need it now?

554
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,960
Since we can't find the entrance
to this barrier,

555
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,440
we'll use the Lotus Array

556
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,400

557
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,240
My Lord.

00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,920
The Lotus Array

559
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,460
is powered by the essence
of the Feiyu Guard.

560
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,840
If we force it

561
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,340
to smash open the barrier,

562
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,440
I fear that by the time
the great demon shows himself,

563
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,630
our brothers' essence

564
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,070
will already be exhausted.

565
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,200
The Feiyu Guards have been blessed
by the Immortal Lord.

566
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,710
Shouldn't every one of you now

567
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,330
be able to take on a hundred?

568
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,000
Yes.

569
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,760
Bring the magical weapon!

570
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,310
Yes!

571
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:16,960
Sir!

572
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,710
Sir!

573
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,360
Stop!

574
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,180
Sir!

575
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:19,840
Stop!

576
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:20,840
Stop!

577
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,280
Don't cause trouble!

578
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:24,630
Step back!

579
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,830
Don't cause trouble!

580
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,110
Please spare us, sir!

581
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,630
Our whole family is doomed!

582
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,320
Step back!

583
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,280
Sir!

584
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,560
Sir!

585
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,720
Ask yourself—

586
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,790
if we lose this battle,

587
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,130
will the price
really be just a few households

588
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,130
and a few hundred acres of farmland?

589
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,480
Go!

590
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,800
Hurry!

591
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,280
Go!

592
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,190
Go!

593
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,840
You will pay for this!

594
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,700
Hurry up and go!

595
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,570
Hong Ye,

596
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,870
do you think that by sealing us away
for 10,000 years,

597
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,800
you could claim the world for yourself?

598
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,250
Today I will show you

599
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,280
what true endless death means.

600
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,040
I'd like to skin him alive,

601
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,000
stuff his skin with his own hair,

602
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,360
and make a football to play with.

603
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,290
That would be too merciful for him.

604
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,090
I want to carve the flesh from his body

605
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,260
slice by slice,

606
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,640
each piece paper-thin.

607
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,250
You two, stand down.

608
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,400
Just watch.

609
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,740
Ao Hen!

610
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,230
All of us were sealed away
for 10,000 years.

611
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,480
What gives you the right to act alone?

612
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,130
Shut up!
