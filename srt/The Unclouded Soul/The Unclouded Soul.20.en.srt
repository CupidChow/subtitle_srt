[The Unclouded Soul]

2
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,660
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,600
After extensive inquiries,
the Feiyu Guards

4
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,640
have obtained the spring water
from Mount Tianyu.

5
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,509
His Majesty is currently taking it
to recuperate.

6
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,490
He has no time to care about your excuses.

7
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,800
The Kunlun Mirror is not yet complete.

8
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,670
How could you have obtained
the Yuli Spring water?

9
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,480
You dare to present fake spring water
as a tribute?

10
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,820
Ji Yan,

11
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,650
you are deceiving His Majesty!

12
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,310
Deceiving me?

13
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,000
It seems to me the one deceiving me
is you, Bingzhu.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,800
Your Majesty!

15
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,850
Do you recognize this person?

16
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,560
Of course we do.

17
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:23,910
Your Majesty,

18
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,240
the one who harmed us

19
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,440
is this man, Bingzhu.

20
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,840
On the celestial mountain,

21
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,650
we served the immortals
with all our hearts,

22
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,579
and only then did they
grant us the Yuli Spring water.

23
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,800
But to our surprise, he actually planned
to keep it for himself

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,280
and even tried to silence us.

25
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

26
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,710
We escaped through countless hardships,

27
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,030
all to see Your Majesty

28
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,290
and seek justice for our fallen sisters.

29
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,320
Your Majesty,

30
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,630
they are clearly framing me!

31
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,560
I beg Your Majesty
to see through this deceit!

32
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,890
For thousands of years,

33
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,680
our ancestors endured countless hardships,

34
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,520
and yet the first to drink
the Yuli Spring water

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,870
turns out to be you rat.

36
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,000
At 3 quarters past noon tomorrow,
outside the Meridian Gate,

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,590
Bingzhu will be executed.

38
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,210
At that time,

39
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,800
I'll bring all court officials to witness

40
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,750
just how effective
the Yuli Spring truly is.

41
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,760
Hong Ye, look at this!

42
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,540
Miss, you have excellent taste.

43
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,920
You're already so beautiful, Miss,

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,360
and with my lantern,

45
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,590
you'd truly be one of a kind.

46
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,130
Well, I'm just looking.

47
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,070
How much silver for this lantern, Boss?

48
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,160
Six coins.

49
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,430
Sir.

50
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,070
It's the Lantern Festival today.

51
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,430
Now that you're out with your sweetheart,

52
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,230
be generous with your spending.

53
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,160
We don't want it.

54
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,890
Hong Ye, let's look elsewhere.

55
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,850
Please don't go!

56
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,490
Wish-Fulfilling Rings!

57
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,830
If you land a ring,
get the prize for free!

58
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,360
If you miss, it's one tael of silver
for 10 rings.

59
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,830
First come, first served!

60
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,160
It's all about luck!

61
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,240
You two.

62
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,310
Want to try it out?

63
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,640
It's wish-fulfilling.

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,750
Give me 5 rings.

65
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,409
Sure thing!

66
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,560
Xiao Yao,

67
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,320
we don't have any money on us.

68
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,880
Don't worry. We're here to make money.

69
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,400
Come on, you go first.

70
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,940
Which one?

71
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,340
Whichever you like.

72
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,470
Let's watch them play first.

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,630
He landed it!

74
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,159
He landed it!

75
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:55,950
He won!

76
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,720
You're so good!

77
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,510
Try again.

78
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,320
-Sir, you're really lucky.
-Again. Again.

79
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,210
He landed another one!

80
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,600
Go for the silver ingot.

81
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,180
You won!

82
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,310
Great!

83
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,900
How can you call that a win?

84
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,880
Why isn't that a win?

85
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,950
Yeah, why doesn't it count?

86
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,070
For the game of ring toss,

87
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,159
you have to land the ring in the center
to win.

88
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,510
But you didn't mention

89
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,840
this rule earlier.

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,800
Boss, you can't cheat like this.

91
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,830
Miss,

92
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,350
that's quite offensive.

93
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,120
How can you call this cheating?

94
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,870
I did say

95
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,920
I won't charge a penny
if you land the ring.

96
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,460
But shouldn't you follow some basic rules?

97
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,190
If everyone were like you, sir,

98
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,190
casually throwing rings

99
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,560
and counting near misses as wins,

100
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,000
wouldn't I become

101
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,920
some fool who loses all his money?

102
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,580
Fine, fine.

103
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,350
We'll follow your rules.

104
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,360
He landed it!

105
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,310
This must count now, right?

106
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,770
-That's right.
-Exactly.

107
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,120
What do you have to say now?

108
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,560
Exactly.

109
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,630
This must count now, right?

110
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,290
Indeed.

111
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,850
Still doesn't count.

112
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,480
Why doesn't it count?

113
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,270
It clearly landed according to your rules.

114
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,750
You were the one throwing rings before,

115
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,240
and now, suddenly this lady
is throwing them.

116
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,640
What's the logic in that?

117
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,870
So what?

118
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,200
We're a family.

119
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,420
Just because you claim you're a family,
that makes it so?

120
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,240
What if these two say they're a family

121
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,050
and want to play as one team,

122
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,630
and those 5 also want to form a team?

123
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,940
How am I supposed to run my business then?

124
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,880
Alright, fine.

125
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,480
Today, I'll see it to the very end.

126
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,610
Give me 5 more rings.

127
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,140
Come on.

128
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,820
Come on,

129
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,120
give us 5 more rings.

130
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,600
Sure,

131
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,210
but pay for these 10 rings first.

132
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,190
Why?

133
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,890
We'll pay for it altogether
after this round.

134
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,210
Seems like you two

135
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,710
don't have any money.

136
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,600
I could tell from the start.

137
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,510
Since you've got no money,

138
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,160
-I'll stop him. You go first.
-you wanted to use

139
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,310
some underhanded tricks...

140
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:09,800
No need.

141
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,270
To scam me out of my money.

142
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,840
Everyone here,

143
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,180
you're all witnesses.

144
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,510
I'm just trying to
run an honest business here.

145
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,520
I've seen many people like this before.

146
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,630
I can spot people like them

147
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,160
at a glance.

148
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,680
In a moment, just do

149
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,080
whatever I tell you to do.

150
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,310
Let me tell you,

151
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,240
you're not leaving today.

152
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,700
Either pay up properly,

153
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,400
or

154
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,880
hand over all those

155
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,429
tricks and gadgets you're hiding.

156
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,390
Otherwise,

157
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,580
don't blame me for getting rough.

158
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,960
Everyone, look!

159
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,150
This man is making dirty money

160
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,440
and falsely accusing innocent people!

161
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,240
Is there no justice anymore?

162
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,909
Exactly.

163
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,000
-I'll let you know...
-Fall!

164
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,130
What justice means!

165
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,640
Honey.

166
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,840
Honey!

167
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,480
Honey, what's wrong?

168
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,000
Stop pretending.

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,320
How could you hit him?

170
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,630
This is extortion!

171
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,840
I didn't touch him at all!

172
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,720
I... You all saw it!

173
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,790
I truly didn't touch him!

174
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,960
You were already sick...

175
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,720
He fell down by himself!

176
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,750
Close your eyes.

177
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,630
You all saw it!

178
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,320
What am I supposed to do from here on out?

179
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,740
-I didn't touch him at all!
-What's going on here?

180
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,390
What happened?

181
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,240
I didn't touch him.

182
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,170
What's going on?

183
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,980
Officer!

184
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,010
It's him!

185
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,440
He's running a dishonest business!

186
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,390
He set us up

187
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,510
and punched my husband.

188
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,440
My husband was already ill.

189
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,270
Now

190
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,550
he's not going to survive.

191
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,440
What should I do after he's gone?

192
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,840
Please seek justice for me, Officer!

193
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,120
It's not like that, Your Honor!

194
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,960
D-Don't listen to
this wicked woman's lies!

195
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,150
I didn't touch him at all!

196
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,390
I might have bumped him slightly
with my elbow,

197
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,630
-but I didn’t…
-You call that "bumping him slightly"?

198
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,600
You punched him so hard

199
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,150
-that he's still unconscious even now!
-I didn't. I…

200
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,210
Please seek justice for us, Officer!

201
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,480
Officer!

202
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,270
Why did you play along so well just now?

203
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,770
You said we were a family.

204
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,960
If I hadn't gone along with it,

205
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,760
wouldn't that have put you
in an awkward position?

206
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,000
Let's go eat. Come on.

These are your orders, right?

00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,030
Please sit and wait for a while.

210
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,550
Please.

211
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,290
I want

212
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,720
this, this,

213
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:05,810

Xiao Dadan said

217
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,880
these are all excellent tonics.

218
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,390
Your body has just suffered
a serious injury.

219
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,790
You need to eat more of these
to nourish yourself and recover.

220
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,920
What's wrong?

Because you're handsome.

This young lady really knows
how to order for her husband.

I'm not used to this food.

I'll wait for you outside.

242
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,150
Not used to it?

243
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,570
Why didn't you say so earlier?

244
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,910
It's not bad.

245
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,610
Yes, and it smells good too.

246
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,360
This young gentleman has such rosy cheeks.

247
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,420
Is it because he also used your rouge?

248
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,560
Yes, he used our rouge.

249
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,080
No wonder!

250
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,860
His skin is amazing too.

251
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,200
Miss, please restrain yourself.

252
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,870
It's even more flawless and delicate

253
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,280

What do you normally use
to wash your face, sir?

255
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,480
-Do you have any secret methods?
-So nice.

256
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,630
Of course it's because
our rouge is excellent.

257
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,360
When did I ever...

258
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,150
Really?

259
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,200
All from your shop?

260
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,300
All your products?

261
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,680
I don't really have any secret method.

262
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,510
But I often select the best rouge

263
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,010
for my wife at home,

264
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,510
and I happened to try
their rouge and face powder.

265
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,750
Which one did you use?

266
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,240
Right.

267
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:16,870
Tell us.

268
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,150
I used...

269
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,220
Boss.

270
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,760
Here comes our business opportunity.

50-50. I can't do more.

274
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,600
Boss,

275
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,240
which one did he actually use?

276
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,840
Yes, which one exactly?

277
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,440
Fine.

278
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,080
-Which one?
-Which one?

279
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,410
The one you're holding,

280
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,090
this one, and this one too.

281
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,870
Yes. That's right.

282
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,870
It's this one.

283
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,790
This one makes your skin look fair.

284
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,190
I'll take this one, Boss.

285
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,370
He used this one too?

286
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,190
Where have you been?

287
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,240
I didn't see you when I came out
after I finished eating.

288
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
I was so worried.

289
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,750
I looked everywhere for you.

290
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,750
You just left me there all alone?

291
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,080
I...

292
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,610
What are you smiling about?

293
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,440
This...

294
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,770
Did you steal this?

295
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,630
I earned it.

296
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,840
I didn't expect

297
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,480
you to use your looks to earn money,
My Lord.

298
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,710
How is that "using my looks"?

299
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,740
In the martial world,
everyone relies on their own skills.

300
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,140
That was your own saying.

301
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,680
You're catching on.

302
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,370
One takes on the color of one's company.

303
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,980
Why don't we release a lantern?

304
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,570
Release a lantern?

305
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,590
You mean this?

306
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,050
This can't be released.

307
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,610
I mean this one.

308
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,150
A sky lantern?

309
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,550
Yes.

310
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,150
You can make a wish with a sky lantern.

311
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,510
When it reaches a certain height,

312
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,630
you say your wish out loud,

313
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,830
and it will come true.

314
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,990
Shall we give it a try?

315
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,500
I hope Hong Ye

316
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,330
can restore his spiritual power soon

317
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,520
and won't get hurt ever again.

318
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,260
I wish time

319
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,260

You've got your power back, right?

You were over there just now,

and now you've moved over here.

349

Not really.

If lighting a lantern

00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,840
could make wishes come true,

00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,960
then the world wouldn't need
Yuli Spring anymore.

353

So it hasn't been restored.

Of course...

360
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,000
Of course not.

361
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,480
Hong Ye, you've learned to be naughty now.

362
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,790
Are you plotting something?

363
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,550
What wish did you make?

364
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,069
I'm not.

365
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:27,829
Tell me.

366
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,790
-I'm really not.
-You are!

367
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,200
Stop asking.

368
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,150
You can't hide it from me.

369
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,320
[Qingfeng Inn]

370
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,960
Boss, two rooms please.

371
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,030
No rooms available. We're fully booked.

372
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,890
Why is this inn also fully booked?

373
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,480
Today is the Lantern Festival.

374
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,880
Young couples coming for the lantern show

375
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,360
have all booked the rooms in advance.

376
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,020
There are no vacancies at all.

377
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,490
There is! We have a room!

378
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,030
You two are so lucky.

379
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,510
A young couple

380
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,480
just had a fight

381
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,790
and canceled their room.

382
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,650
So we have one room available now.

383
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,920
But we need two rooms.

384
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What kind of married couple
sleeps in separate rooms?

385
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,720
I...

386
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,750
We...

387
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,730
We're not...

388
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,640
Having a tiff?

389
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,750
Yeah.

390
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,790
Couples are all like this,

391
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,590
fighting at dusk but making up by dawn.

392
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,750
By morning, they'll definitely be fine,

393
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,200
right?

394
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,350
That's right.

395
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,750
So, do you want it or not?

396
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,960
Yes, we'll take it.

397
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,110
Great. Come on then.

398
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,310
Alright, excellent.

399
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,410
Come along.

400
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,840
It's not like we haven't
shared a room before.

401
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,810
You take the bed,

402
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,360
and I'll sleep on the floor.

403
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,960
You take the bed.

404
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,260
I'll meditate.

405
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,550
You're a mortal now.

406
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,340
Staying up late isn't good for
your health.

407
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,340
Alright, come on.

408
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,240
I'm still a bit hungry.
I didn't have my fill earlier.

409
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,240
I'll go have some late-night snacks

410
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,240
and be right back.

411
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,860
I'll bring you something tasty
if I find any.

412
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,720
I hope by the time I get back,

413
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,320
he'll be asleep.

414
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,370
But how could he possibly sleep
while I'm out alone?

415
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,040
Forget it.

416
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,310
I'll take this one. And this one.

417
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,940
Two of these, please.

418
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,870
-Alright.
-Today, we captured a boar demon

419
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,070
and are delivering it
to the magistrate's office

420
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,930
to eliminate this evil creature.

421
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,830
This evil demon
has harmed countless people.

422
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,000
At daybreak tomorrow,

423
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,350
it'll be skinned alive
and have its tendons pulled,

424
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,880
its flesh cut and bones stripped,
then braised and deep-fried.

425
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,530
Flesh cut and bones stripped,
then braised and deep-fried.

426
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,160
Flesh cut and bones stripped,
then braised and deep-fried.

427
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,310
This evil demon has harmed
countless people.

428
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,680
At daybreak tomorrow,

429
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,240
it'll be skinned alive
and have its tendons pulled,

430
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,770
its flesh cut and bones stripped,
then braised and deep-fried.

431
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,550
Flesh cut and bones stripped...

432
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,000
Luoluo!

433
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,660
Then braised and deep-fried.

434
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,110
Great News on the Lantern Festival:

435
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,540
Today, we captured

436
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
a boar demon...

437
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,590
Bro.

438
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,060
Don't eat too much.

439
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,720
We'll slaughter the pig tomorrow,
remember?

440
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,160
Right.

441
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,270
I should save some room.

442
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,200
We've got a whole day of
pig feast coming up tomorrow.

443
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,550
What's wrong?

444
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,640
Bro, what is that?

445
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,790
You've had too much to drink, haven't you?

446
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,780
Those who have innocent blood
on their hands,

447
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,690
vengeful spirits have come to
claim your lives!

448
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,250
You've harmed too many innocent lives.

449
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,920
Follow me to the underworld today

450
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,520
to pay for your bloody debts!

451
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,500
Xiao Yao's method really works.

452
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,380
I've come to save you.

453
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,580
Come with me quickly.

454
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,260
Are you hurt?

455
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,560
Got you!

456
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,740
You stupid pig, you fell for it!

457
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,470
The Feiyu Guards' method really works.

458
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,630
Another pig.

459
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,820
Birds of a feather
really do flock together.

460
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,460
Let's see what kind of creature
comes next.

461
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,920
Come on, grunt for us.

462
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,340
One, two, three, four.

463
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,440
This is the perfect chance

464
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,030
to see if my skills

465
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,430
have improved recently.

466
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,810
Another demon is here.

467
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,350
Here comes another one.

468
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,120
I'm your demon nightmare!

469
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,810
Xiao Yao!

470
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,480
Xiao Yao!

471
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,160
Xiao Yao!

472
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,220
Let's go. Let's go.

473
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,840
Let's get out of here first.

474
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,980
Tonight's haul is good.

475
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,320
This is already the second one.

476
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,070
If we're really going to be braised,

477
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,160
just leave me behind.

478
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,270
That's not for you to decide.

479
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:40,940
Move aside.

480
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,190
Mere parlor tricks.

481
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,050
Attack!

482
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,130
Run! Come on, run for your life!

483
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,480
Cover your mouths and noses!

484
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,140
A great demon might be coming!

485
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,840
My Lord!

486
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,210
Our Demon King has come to save us!

487
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,060
Since you know who I am,

488
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,800
there's no need to resist further.

489
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,670
Today is the Lantern Festival.

490
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,590
I don't wish to start a massacre.

491
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,660
Let's go.

492
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,030
Your power has really been restored?

493
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,910
Fire! Fire!

494
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,660
-Fire!
-Come on, run!

495
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,070
Fire!

496
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,830
It's lamp oil.

497
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,200
That one just now
wasn't the Demon King at all.

498
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,800
After him!

499
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,880
-Don't let him escape!
-This way!

500
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,550
After him!

501
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,630
Hurry! Keep up! This way!

502
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,380
After them!

503
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,380
After them!

504
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,970
Don't let them get away!

505
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,040
Nothing here!

506
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,410
Where did they go?

507
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,170
Over there!

508
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,300
After them!

509
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,400
Luoluo.

510
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,410
How did you end up here?

511
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,830
What's wrong?

512
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,510
My Lord.

513
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,200
Xiao Yao.

514
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,840
You're finally back.

515
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,920
But why...

516
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:21,680
Why...

517
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,910
Why did it take you so long?

518
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,000
Demons' Valley...

519
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,570
Demons' Valley...

520
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,690
What happened to Demons' Valley?

521
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Xiao Yao, shortly after you left,

522
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,030
Heiwu led Wu Huan

523
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,640
in a surprise attack on
Xiao Ming and Xiao Mu.

524
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,160
Xiao Ming and Xiao Mu were badly injured,

525
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,360
and we still don't know where they went.

526
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,340
Just like that,

527
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,170
Demons' Valley fell under Heiwu's control.

528
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,330
He also claimed that you were dead,
My Lord,

529
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,720
and that all demons
must obey him from then on.

530
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,480
He completely removed
Demons' Valley's barrier

531
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,960
and let the Feiyu Guards in.

532
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,790
On the 1st and 15th of each month
in the human calendar,

533
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,620
he forces us demons to draw lots.

534
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
Those who are chosen

535
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,030
are sent with the Feiyu Guards
as offerings to the human emperor.

536
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,830
Now everyone in the valley
lives in constant fear,

537
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,370
not knowing who will be next.

538
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,160
I was so terrified

539
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,880
that I escaped.

540
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
It's all my fault.

541
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,620
If I had known,
before I left Demons' Valley,

542
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,280
I should have killed Heiwu.

543
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,120
I originally thought he was merely greedy,

544
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,960
but I never imagined

545
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,680
he would dare to collude with
the Feiyu Guards

546
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,790
to harm his own kind

547
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,840
and commit such cruel acts.

548
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,840
Now that you've returned, My Lord,

549
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,310
please stand up for us
and help us reclaim Demons' Valley.

550
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,860
Don't worry.

551
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,530
Now that we're back,

552
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,550
we'll definitely teach
the Feiyu Guards and Heiwu a lesson.

553
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,160
But

554
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,380
we'll need to
think this through carefully.

555
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,750
Tonight is the 15th.

556
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,680
In another 15 days,
it will be the 1st again.

557
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,680
H-How can we possibly have time
to think this through?

558
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,430
Have a drink for courage,

559
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,080
and we'll fight our way back to
Demons' Valley.

560
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,530
I like the sound of that.

561
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,170

you'll have a better life.

587

Let's go.

588
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,230
Let's.

589
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,750
My Lord.

590
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,920
Demons' Valley is
over 1,000 miles from here.

591
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,300
A-Aren't we going to fly there?

592
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,320
I have other important matters
to attend to on the way. Let's go.

593
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,440
B-But yesterday was the 15th.

594
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,920
If we go on foot,

595
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,550
we won't reach Demons' Valley
even in another 15 days.

596
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,410
Then we'll run.

597
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,880
We just need to hurry.

598
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:15,920
What about Xiao Yao?

599
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,980
No more questions.

600
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,970
But how long will it take
if we run there...

601
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,440
Our promised day off is canceled again.

602
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,880
Wasn't the head of the Feiyu Guards

603
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,080
arrested on the spot?

604
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,920
Why didn't they kill him right there?

605
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,920
Would've saved us all this trouble.

606
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,060
Just hang in there.

607
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,350
Once he's executed tomorrow,

608
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,440
things will quiet down.

609
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,200
Good thing he doesn't have
any close family.

610
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,880
Otherwise, for the crime of
deceiving His Majesty,

611
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,590
his entire clan would be executed.

612
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,400
Just the beheadings alone
would take quite a while.

613
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Didn't they say

614
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:57,070
he embezzled His Majesty's
Yuli Spring water?

615
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,540
If this Yuli Spring water
really grants immortality,

616
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,350
will they even be able to

617
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,810
cut his head off tomorrow?

618
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,790
Immortality doesn't mean
he has a head made of iron, okay?

619
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,830
Then do you think

620
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,270
once his head is cut off,

621
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,000
a new one will grow in its place?

622
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,960
You must help me.

623
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,940
The criminal, Bingzhu,

624
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,920
used his position as Demon Slayer
of the Feiyu Guards

625
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,040
to collude with Demon King Hong Ye,

626
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,630
sacrificing innocent lives

627
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,550
in exchange for demonic patronage,

628
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,400
fraudulently obtaining court salary

629
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,030
and royal rewards.

630
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,520
His Majesty received guidance
from the Immortal,

631
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,840
which only fueled Bingzhu's greed

632
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,590
even further—

633
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,640
he embezzled the spring water

634
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,650
and harmed the daughters of
100 high-ranking court officials.

635
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,680
His treasonous intentions
were clear as day.

636
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,550
Today, he entered the palace
to see His Majesty

637
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,000
only to assassinate him.

638
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,750
Fortunately, His Majesty
saw through his plan,

639
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,570
and the Feiyu Guards protected
His Majesty with all their might.

640
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,500
With multiple witnesses present,

641
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,120
he finally confessed

642
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,840
to all these evil deeds.

643
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,180
As former colleagues,

644
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,390
there's not much I can do for you.

645
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,160
This is the best I can do.

646
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,440
As long as you sign these charges

647
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,590
and put your thumbprint on them,

648
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,240
I won't subject you to further torture.

649
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,100
What do you say?

650
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,110
Why should I confess to

651
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,310
things I never did?

652
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,590
Lord Bingzhu.

653
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,110
You've been devoted to
protecting the people,

654
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,110
b-but that should be
His Majesty's concern.

655
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,510
Your colleagues here are human too,
just like the common people.

656
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,240
Have you ever thought about us?

657
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,200
You've protected the people for years,

658
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,000
but do you even know their names?

659
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,750
Look at your colleagues around you,

660
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,310
and your sister Tan'er—

661
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,680
which one of them
have you managed to protect?

662
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,350
This is your only chance

663
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,030
to do something for us.

664
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,350
We'll all remember your great kindness,

665
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,910
and it wouldn't be in vain that we

666
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,590
risked our lives alongside you.

667
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,720
The predecessors of the Feiyu Guards

668
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,970
paved the way with their blood,

669
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,560
yet now you all

670
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,440
greedily take bribes and abuse the law,

671
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,030
persecuting the loyal and upright.

672
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,880
How truly pitiful.

673
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,600
So you refuse to sign, right?

674
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,410
That's fine.

675
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:57,200
His Majesty only said to
keep you alive until execution,

676
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,730
but he didn't say
you had to remain intact.

677
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,900
If I cut off this hand of yours,

678
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,510
I can use it to sign

679
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,190
as many charges as I want.

680
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,120
Someone!

681
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,030
Yes!

682
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,000
Do it.

683
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,070
My Lord,

684
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,920
we also have

685
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,320
no other option.

686
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,760
Someone's attempting a prison break!

687
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,180
Let me go!

688
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,690
Bingzhu risked his life
for the imperial orders,

689
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,610
yet you framed him
and put him in death row.

690
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,510
You Feiyu Guards,

691
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,320
each and every one of you,

692
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,290
have you all lost your conscience?

693
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,020
You insolent demoness.

694
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,760
Form the formation!

695
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,420
My Lord.

696
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,300
She's human.

697
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,570
I'm afraid the formation won't work.

698
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,840
Then why waste words?

699
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,360
Attack together!

700
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:35,750
Yes!

701
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,300
Attack!

702
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,850
Tan'er,

703
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,510
if you don't help now,

704
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,440
we'll all die here today!

705
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,110
Tan'er!

706
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,150
Tan'er, protect Pianpian!

707
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,650
Tan'er!

708
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,440
Everyone, no need to be afraid!

709
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,230
Her demon-slaying blade

710
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,400
can only kill demons.

711
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,300
It can't harm us.

712
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,440
We just need to
block the cell door tightly

713
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,320
so she can't get near Bingzhu.

714
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,580
Tan'er!

715
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,860
Take Pianpian out of here!

716
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,790
Hurry up and leave!

717
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,280
Feiyu Guards!

718
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:32,960
Yes!

719
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,880
No one is allowed to sleep tonight!

720
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,940
Bring all the Feiyu Guards in the city

721
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,920
and spare no effort to hunt down
that demoness who broke into prison!

722
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,030
We must not let her disturb His Majesty

723
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,230
during the execution tomorrow!

724
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,000
Yes!

725
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,030
Hurry!

726
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,880
It's already the fifth watch.

727
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,490
Are there any ways left
to save your brother?

728
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,110
How beautiful.

729
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,400
Without a sincere heart,

730
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,550
one's fate is sealed.

731
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,190
Is that the Exalted Immortal?

732
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,930
You're not destined for immortality.

733
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,590
It's all just a fleeting dream in the end.
