00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,860
[The Unclouded Soul]

2
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,780
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,229
He's gone indeed.

4
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,039
He must've gotten injured when fighting

5
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,500
the Dreamshard Immortal,

6
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,009
which depleted all his power.

7
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,120
Everyone spread out and search carefully.

8
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,870
Capturing the Demon King

9
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,810
brings far greater merit
than catching thousands of minor demons.

10
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,350
Go!

11
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,150
Yes!

12
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,850
Old crow.

13
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,690
You're back.

14
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,300
Why are they still alive?

15
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,420
Didn't you say you would kill them all,

16
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,470
turning them into living corpses

17
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,270
to be delivered to His Lordship?

18
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,010
What nonsense are you talking about?

19
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,910
Fine.
I'll take it as I didn't see anything.

20
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,040
Get to work quickly.

21
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,970
Remember,

22
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,920
don't beat them up too badly.

23
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,950
If their flesh and bones
stick to their clothes,

24
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,280
it'd be hard to sort out.

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,880
Wu Huan,

26
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,050
what's she talking about?

27
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,170
We're on the same side.

28
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,170
That's right. We're on the same side.

29
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,170
Let's take out that official first.

30
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,800
Wu Huan, help out!

31
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,280
You're just waiting to reap the benefits!

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,210
Go! Quick!

33
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,750
You!

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,840
Don't be too brutal!

35
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,870
Don't damage the heart!

36
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,130
Stir-fried human heart tastes the best!

37
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,590
You old demon!

38
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,480
I'm going to make you
into a stew!

39
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,140
Attack!

40
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,280
It was you

41
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,560
who tricked us...

42
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,600
I didn't trick you!

43
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,850
Well done, Wu Huan.

44
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,010
His Lordship will reward you greatly.

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,490
Wu Huan.

46
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,100
Nicely done.

47
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,720
Very well.

48
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,240
You'll all pay for this!

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,870
My Lord.

50
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,130
As for the rest,

51
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,330
let's turn them into barbecue.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,730
Sounds good.

53
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,600
These Feiyu Guards
all have cultivation within them.

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,460
They are indeed
better than ordinary humans

55
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,480
for nourishment.

56
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,950
Without a scratch.

57
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,390
We've won.

58
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,330
My power is completely drained.

59
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,270
I'm starving.

60
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,900
My Lord, could you make something to eat?

61
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,050
Just this once.

62
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,300
You cannot steal them in the future.

63
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,390
Is your life
only worth a few bamboo shoots?

64
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,750
I wouldn't have saved you if I'd known.

65
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,430
You weren't the one who saved me.

66
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,120
It was His Lordship who saved me.

67
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,980
Right, My Lord?

68
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,190
Fine.

69
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,160
What has Heiwu been up to?

70
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,450
His Lordship is dead!

71
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,300
That's what Heiwu said.

72
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,680
The demon clan has no leader!

73
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,980
A new Monarch of All Demons
must be established.

74
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,710
Let's gather all great demons
to Demons' Valley

75
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,530
to select a new Demon King.

76
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,250
He lures all the demons over

77
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,490
to present them as gifts
to the Feiyu Guard, isn't he?

78
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,450
Where are they now?

79
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,580
Some have already been captured.

80
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,030
The rest of them

81
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,090
went into hiding in different places,

82
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,350
scattered all around.

83
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,550
I'll gather everyone right away

84
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,270
to follow My Lord to reclaim Youning Cave.

85
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,310
I'll go too.

86
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,240
I know where Xiaohu
and the Crane are hiding.

87
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,770
Let's go.

88
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,400
Don't be impulsive.

89
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,830
Since My Lord has returned,

90
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,160
there's no need to rush.

91
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:00,800
I-It

92
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,850
is urgent!

93
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,290
Is My Lord in no rush?

94
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,510
Heiwu,

95
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,270
although he betrayed the demons,

96
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,040
he is different from the human Feiyu Guard

97
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,090
and the human demon hunters.

98
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,600
If we fight to the death,

99
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,680
demons killing demons,

100
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,740
wouldn't that just amuse the humans?

101
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,400
So what should we do?

102
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,620
My Lord is back.

103
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,830
It's not our place to come up with plans.

104
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,370
Yes.

105
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,290
You rest and recover first.

106
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,820
I'll figure something out.

107
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:46,950
Go away.

108
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,740
You and an entire squad of Feiyu Guards

109
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,710
couldn't even handle this simple task?

110
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,420
My Lord.

111
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,450
Hong Ye has returned.

112
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,070
His power has increased greatly.

113
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,400
None of us are his match.

114
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,320
Hong Ye?

115
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,280
No wonder.

116
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,680
No wonder.

117
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,330
You've been through a lot.

118
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,580
So how did you make it back?

119
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,250
It was Hong Ye.

120
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,310
He asked me to deliver a message to you.

121
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,060
He said

122
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,060
he's willing to follow your advice

123
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,440
and won't be soft-hearted anymore.

124
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,030
He also said

125
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,420
for what we've done to the demons,

126
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,210
he'll make us pay back a thousandfold.

127
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,530
My Lord.

128
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,030
Should we move out of Youning Cave first

129
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,230
to lie low for a while?

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,520
Are you scared?

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,600
No.

132
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,910
Not with you here, My Lord.

133
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,250
He's already determined to kill.

134
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,840
What's the point of hiding?

135
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,630
Go to Pingjiang

136
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,210
and contact the Feiyu Guard.

137
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,940
Tell them Hong Ye has returned.

138
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,080
Ask them to send more experts immediately

139
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,630
to coordinate with us
from both inside and outside.

140
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,630
Go now!

141
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,840
Yes.

142
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,799
This is my only option

143
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,000
to save the demons.

144
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,070
Heiwu is different from Wu Huan.

145
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,130
He'll likely notice
you've lost your power.

146
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,310
So we need a foolproof plan

147
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,510
before confronting him.

148
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,070
I understand.

149
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,470
Don't even think about it.

150
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,570
Although I've lost my power now,

151
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,620
if I forcibly summon my demonic energy,

152
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,550
perhaps I could still—

153
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,350
No, you can't.

154
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
The most urgent matter now

155
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,750
is to eliminate Heiwu

156
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,680
and save the demons.

157
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,360
This is my only option.

158
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,790
Trust me,

159
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,380
this surely isn't the only way.

160
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,780
Let's wait a bit longer.

161
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
Let's think more.

162
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,550
Let's find Xiao Ming and Xiao Mu first.

163
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,490
Sure.

164
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,130
Heiwu is a coward by nature.

165
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,570
Before he figures out our true situation,

166
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,220
he won't make any rash moves.

167
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,200
He's probably on guard against us.

168
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,220
All right.

169
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,550
Too much worrying will give you wrinkles.

170
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,270
Then you'll truly become an old demon.

171
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,330
I won't allow that.

172
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,510
No.

173
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,140
Xiao Ming fears that there are mice
in Chengxiang Sea.

174
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Luoluo!

175
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,080
Hurry!

176
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,210
Slow down.

177
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,040
It's not for you to eat.

178
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,260
Some are burnt, and some are cold.

179
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,190
Xiao Ming would be more upset than me
if he saw this.

180
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,340
It seems

181
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,550
we have to use our last resort.

182
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,420
That's all, right?

183
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,410
That's all.

184
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,320
All the catnip
from around here is right here.

185
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,940
Stop eating.

186
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,870
My Lord!

187
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:53,600
My...

188
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,360
My Lord.

189
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,390
Xiao Mu.

190
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,920
My Lord!

191
00:12:59,380 --> 00:12:59,750
My...

192
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,550
I'm too ashamed to face My Lord.

193
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,350
You should...

194
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,790
Stand up first.

195
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,390
My Lord,

196
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,990
you're finally back!

197
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,150
We've been longing for your return,
My Lord.

198
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,790
Xiao Ming has missed you so much.

199
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,480
Heiwu told all the minor demons

200
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,550
that you were killed
by the Dreamshard Immortal.

201
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,960
But Xiao Ming didn't believe it.

202
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,960
I kept trying to sense you with my power,

203
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,620
but I couldn't feel anything.

204
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,600
I was completely out of options,

205
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,790
so I had to go to the human realm

206
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,150
and find a deity statue.

207
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,670
I made offerings
and prayed to it every day.

208
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,920
He's so noisy.

209
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,530
But it feels familiar.

210
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,440
My Lord, how are you?

211
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,270
Has the poison in your body been cured?

212
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:34,960
I'm fine.

213
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,720
Call Xiao Mu out.

214
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,320
All right.

215
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,720
My Lord.

216
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,750
Xiao Mu says

217
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,160
he failed to protect Demons' Valley

218
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,140
and was ambushed by Heiwu,

219
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,510
causing Youning Cave to be occupied.

220
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,270
He's too ashamed to face you.

221
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,490
I don't blame him.

222
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,150
I returned too late.

223
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,590
Let me talk with Xiao Mu.

224
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,480
My Lord.

225
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,720
It's all Xiao Mu's fault.

226
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,300
Now that you've returned,

227
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
let's go reclaim Youning Cave immediately.

228
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,080
I'm willing to die for this task.

229
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,200
This matter requires
careful consideration.

230
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,790
Xiao Ming is willing to risk his life too!

231
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,620
My Lord!

232
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,360
My Lord!

233
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,990
Your power...

234
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,670
Huh?

235
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,390
What?

236
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,120
Okay.

237
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,320
She said to clean up all traces here.

238
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,780
We'll meet
at the foot of the mountain later.

239
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,860
She said that much?

240
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,360
She also said you should eat all of these.

241
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
It's good for you.

242
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,490
Keep it up.

243
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,010
It's a lot.

244
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:52,910
Xiao Yao.

245
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,680
You're the jinx!

246
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,270
It's because of you
that My Lord is in this situation.

247
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,660
I've already told you.

248
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,720
I damaged my heart meridian
by using the Heart-Burning Incantation.

249
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,000
What does it have to do with Xiao Yao?

250
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,960
My Lord, stop defending Xiao Yao!

251
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,710
If it weren't for her,

252
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,390
why would you have gone
to the Realm of Mist and Void?

253
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,480
If you hadn't gone
to the Realm of Mist and Void,

254
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,440
how would you have ended up like this?

255
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,710
If you hadn't lost your power, My Lord,

256
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,030
how would I, no matter what,

257
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,890
be unable to sense your presence?

258
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,120
I once thought you had been...

259
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,960
The Dreamshard Immortal was after me
right from the start.

260
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,220
Even without Xiao Yao,

261
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,150
she would have used
other means against me.

262
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
You've been with me for so long.

263
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,460
You should know better than this.

264
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,440
My Lord.

265
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,390
Although the Heart-Burning Incantation
is an ancient spell,

266
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,120
judging by its name,
it only burns the heart,

267
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,510
not your power.

268
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,840
Perhaps your power, My Lord,

269
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,550
is just suppressed within your body.

270
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,410
It's possible!

271
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,000
What are you looking at?

272
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,760
I was just saying that to comfort you,
My Lord.

273
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,400
The ancient demons texts

274
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,570
are all sealed in Youning Cave.

275
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,300
If we reclaim Youning Cave,

276
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,720
we might find a solution.

277
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,960
But...

278
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,180
After you were attacked by Heiwu,

279
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,850
how much of your power remains?

280
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:19,860
Thirty percent.

281
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,740
But if I recover to 60 percent,

282
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,340
I can fight them to the death.

283
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,310
Life is precious.

284
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,100
Don't be so quick to risk your life.

285
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,500
You need to use this more.

286
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,430
Hey!

287
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,790
The technique turning leaves into silver—

288
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,030
can you still perform it?

289
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,360
I only need 10 percent
of my power for that spell.

290
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,030
Besides, at a time like this,

291
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,830
why are you...

292
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,670
why are you

293
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,330
still so obsessed with money?

294
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,540
Can't abandon my old trade after all.

295
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,190
Come take a look!

296
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,900
These are fine goods!

297
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,410
Come take a look!

298
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,350
Come!

299
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,120
This is a divine weapon
for catching demons!

300
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,780
Have a look!

301
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,270
Xiao Yao.

302
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,030
The things they sell here,

303
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,480
as long as no one recites the spells,

304
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,780
we are safe.

305
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,690
Don't worry.

306
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,030
Remember,

307
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,210
you are...

308
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,109
Human.

309
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:18,839
Yes.

310
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:19,640
Let's go.

311
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,510
Sir,

312
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,760
which of your demon-catching items
works best?

313
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,349
Miss,

314
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,640
everything I sell
is of the highest quality.

315
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,790
But as for the best,

316
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,110
it would be
these demon-repelling fireworks.

317
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,370
You just need to pull it gently like this.

318
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,680
These two friends of mine

319
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,920
are afraid of fireworks.

320
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
Please continue.

321
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,410
Are you scared?

322
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,720
-No, I'm not.
-There's colorful poison with peach wood.

323
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,880
What happens if humans
accidentally inhale it?

324
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,790
Don't worry, miss.

325
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,720
This toxin is
our ancestral secret formula.

326
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,960
It only affects demons.

327
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,560
Humans won't be harmed by it.

328
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,000
As they say, it's good
for both offense and defense.

329
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,200
When ordinary demons encounter it,

330
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,350
they definitely can't handle it,
I assure you.

331
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,110
Is that all?

332
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,440
There's more.

333
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,210
But these fireworks are quite expensive.

334
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,400
I have more.

335
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,280
That's enough.

336
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,020
As long as they work well,

337
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,350
we'll take everything.

338
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,210
They work well, absolutely!

339
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:25,960
Miss, please wait a moment.

340
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,220
I'll get them from the warehouse for you.

341
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,070
Miss,

342
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,000
take a look at my treasure.

343
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Have a look.

344
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:33,790
This gentleman.

345
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,000
I have some excellent items here.

346
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,410
Would you like to take a look?

347
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:36,830
Miss.

348
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,160
Miss.

349
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,810
Look at this.

350
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:38,270
Miss.

351
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,200
Look at this one.

352
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,350
This is a genuine peach wood sword.

353
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,000
All right, all right!

354
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,480
I got it!

355
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,010
One by one!

356
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,870
Qiankun Demon Subduing Pestle.

357
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,720
Cloud-Covering Ultimate Pill.

358
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,290
Nine Chain Lock.

359
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,760
Demon-Repelling Talisman.

360
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,110
Underworld Nineteen-Whip.

361
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,570
Body-Shattering Mirror.

362
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,600
So, Xiao Yao,
what exactly are you thinking?

363
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,270
You're planning to have My Lord

364
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,070
use these human demon-catching tools
against...

365
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,750
Heiwu.

366
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,360
Heiwu betrayed demons
and gave them to humans for torturing.

367
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,270
So we should let him have
a taste of human methods.

368
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,790
That makes sense.

369
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,060
My Lord, I won't comment on this for now.

370
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,740
But Xiao Yao, I would like to ask you:

371
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,470
do you think so little of Heiwu?

372
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,000
No matter what,

373
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,640
Heiwu is a great demon with
a thousand years of cultivation.

374
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,000
Do you think these cheap trinkets

375
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,480
can scare him?

376
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,830
Let me ask you.

377
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,640
What is Heiwu's true form?

378
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,400
I don't know.

379
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,700
An eagle, perhaps?

380
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,680
What eagle?

381
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,400
He's a horseshoe bat.

382
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,920
You've cultivated into a great demon,

383
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,440
yet you still love catnip,

384
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,070
don't you?

385
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,970
Heiwu is the same.

386
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,310
Some innate traits can never be changed.

387
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,000
These are specially prepared for him.

388
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,440
How are you going to set it up?

389
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,240
I need a group of friends to help.

390
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,010
A group of friends?

391
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,090
That's what happened.

392
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,140
So

393
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,900
Hong Ye's home
has been occupied by evil demons.

394
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,480
I'd like to ask for your help

395
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,880
to take back his home together.

396
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,680
Will you help?

397
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,150
Are you sure?

398
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,550
Yeah.

399
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,680
Has the message been delivered?

400
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,590
It was sent 7 days ago.

401
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,210
Then why hasn't
the Feiyu Guard responded yet?

402
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,160
How about

403
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,790
I go check on it again?

404
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,490
That's Xiao Ming's voice.

405
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,560
Wasn't that cat severely injured?

406
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,090
How could it return so quickly?

407
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,680
You!

408
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,170
Go have a look quickly.

409
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:07,510
I...

410
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,680
My Lord.

411
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,050
Lord Heiwu.

412
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,310
Lord Heiwu!

413
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,590
My Lord, bad news.

414
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,790
Has Hong Ye returned?

415
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,200
Yes.

416
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,720
No, no.

417
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,110
As soon as I went out,
my eyes were blinded by toxic fog.

418
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,720
They must have ambushed me

419
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,200
and set traps.

420
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,400
I struggled greatly to fight my way out.

421
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,990
This is a human weapon.

422
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,440
Was it Hong Ye or humans who ambushed you?

423
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,120
I didn't see clearly.

424
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,070
My Lord.

425
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:40,970
Let's go.

426
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,690
There's...

427
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,820
There's...

428
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,820
There's...

429
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,380
What is this?

430
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,610
Who's there?

431
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,840
Hong Ye...

432
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,000
I got you.

433
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,590
My Lord,

434
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,680
it's me.

435
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:19,920
Me...

436
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,680
Heiwu.

437
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,480
Come and meet your death.

438
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,840
Come and meet your death.

439
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,720
Come and meet your death.

440
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,480
Heiwu.

441
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,060
Come and meet your death.

442
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,440
Come and

443
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,780
meet your death.

444
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,110
Meet...

445
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,830
Your death...

446
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,270
Death...

447
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,160
Death.

448
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,880
Hong Ye!

449
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,690
It's a new world in Demons' Valley!

450
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,990
You're no longer the Demon King!

451
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,720
I am.

452
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,000
Yes!

453
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,800
Get ready to appear.

454
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,880
Spread out evenly.

455
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,940
Careful!

456
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,450
Don't wobble.

457
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,430
Good, good.

458
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,790
Fly.

459
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,790
Good, good.

460
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,920
Hold steady!

461
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,230
Right here!

462
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,920
Don't move!

463
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,750
Let's go!

464
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,750
Retreat quickly! Go!

465
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,480
Why retreat?

466
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,660
Hong Ye is acting strange.

467
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,280
Go check what's happening.

468
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:25,680
Me?

469
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,160
Yes.

470
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,680
Do you think it should be me?

471
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,220
Go!

472
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,960
Do you know

473
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,590
how many birds die

474
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,350
under my cat claws every day?

475
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:53,950
Hong Ye!

476
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,680
I have the Feiyu Guard with me.

477
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,240
You're just one demon alone.

478
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,280
Stop putting on an act!

479
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,310
Come on!

480
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,590
Come on!

481
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,430
To kill you,

482
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,150
I alone am enough.

483
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,520
Since you've removed yourself
from the demon registry,

484
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,120
then on behalf of all demons,

485
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,400
I'll end you.

486
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:29,880
Go.

487
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,110
Go, go.

488
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,460
Heiwu.

489
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,620
You are over.

490
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,310
It's fake.

491
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,660
You have no power left.

492
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,940
It's just an illusion.

493
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,050
All of it is fake!

494
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,760
I've already sent the Zhuyu herb back.

495
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,310
They'll keep their mouths shut.

496
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,510
Xiao Yao.

497
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,240
So?

498
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,730
Isn't my idea pretty good?

499
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,510
Yes.

500
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,700
Come on, praise me.

501
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,080
My Xiao Yao is so clever

502
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,270
and resourceful.

503
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,950
Oh, right.

504
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,610
I have a gift for you.

505
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,710
Close your eyes.

506
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,510
Close them.

507
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,240
Open them.

508
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,280
Congratulations on
reclaiming Demons' Valley, My Lord.

509
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,920
This is...

510
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,810
My Lord has been overthinking lately.

511
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,010
This jade comb

512
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,640
will refresh your mind and relieve stress.

513
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,310
Don't you like it?

514
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,510
I do.

515
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,750
My Lord.

516
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,440
Are you two discussing marriage now?

517
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,360
Don't talk nonsense.

518
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,110
I'm not talking nonsense.

519
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,750
According to human customs,

520
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,480
a comb is a symbol of marriage.

521
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,310
Don't take me for a fool.

522
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,370
Let's talk about important matters.

523
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,350
My Lord,

524
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,430
everyone knows you're back.

525
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,500
They're waiting outside
the cave entrance to see you.

526
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:24,750
It's all your fault.

527
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,400
It's all your fault.

528
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:25,920
It's all because of you.

529
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,400
You traitor.

530
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,680
Right.

531
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,810
You were the one

532
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,400
who came to Demons' Valley
to capture demons.

533
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,260
Let me tell you,

534
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,030
my father despises traitors like you.

535
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,640
It's all your fault.

536
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,030
You deserve this!

537
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,780
Look what trouble you've caused us.

538
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,780
You're terrible!

539
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,690
My Lord!

540
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,550
My Lord!

541
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,750
My Lord has returned!

542
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,350
You're finally back!

543
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,920
That's wonderful!

544
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,650
You're back.

545
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,160
You've returned.

546
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,960
That's great!

547
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,720
You're finally back!

548
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,240
My Lord.

549
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,270
-We missed you so much.
-We've been waiting for you for so long.

550
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,480
Yes, Wu Huan was terrible!

551
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,680
We missed you so much.

552
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,580
Enough.

553
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,680
My Lord has just returned.

554
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,740
Speak one at a time.

555
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,160
It was my fault.

556
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,070
During this time,

557
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,200
you all suffered because of me.

558
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,960
No, no, My Lord.

559
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,710
No rush.

560
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,440
You go first.

561
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:58,790
My Lord,

562
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,750
I heard your power has increased greatly.

563
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,560
Is that true?

564
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,920
Of course it's true.

565
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,720
My Lord, I heard that
in the Realm of Mist and Void,

566
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,180
you defeated Dreamshard.

567
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,740
Let me tell you all.

568
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,200
My Lord is the person
I admire most in my life.

569
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,000
Yes.

570
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,240
I admire His Lordship too.

571
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,720
Me too.

572
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,680
Exactly.

573
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,720
We all share the same sentiments.

574
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,440
My Lord is the most powerful.

575
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,480
Kitty, come here.

576
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,720
What's wrong?

577
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,180
Is Wu Huan's

578
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,160
true form a crow?

579
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,330
Isn't Wu Huan a crow?

580
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,370
Look at his beak.

581
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,880
And look at those talons.

582
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,960
This is a falcon.

583
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,440
The way you talk,

584
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:34,680
it's like

585
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,760
you're some kind of bird expert.

586
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,650
I come from a family of hunters.

587
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,270
An old bat managed to bewitch a falcon.

588
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,070
How interesting.

589
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,090
Let him down.

590
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,000
What?

591
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,790
Why?

592
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,030
Why should we let him down?

593
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,060
Let him down?

594
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,400
Do you know

595
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,270
how many demons
he has sacrificed to humans?

596
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,110
Those demons

597
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,720
suffered terrible torment.

598
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,510
That's right!

599
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,070
We can't let him go.

600
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,680
Exactly.

601
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,960
We can't let him down.

602
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,720
Right, we can't release him.

603
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,180
My Lord.

604
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,590
My Lord.

605
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,050
My Lord.

606
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,550
Last night, Heiwu abandoned Wu Huan
and fled alone.

607
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,590
Wu Huan now knows
his master's true nature.

608
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,910
Demons' Valley has

609
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,890
suffered repeated massacres.

610
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,190
Killing one more

611
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,150
would only be venting our anger.

612
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,750
Better to let Wu Huan

613
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,810
reflect on his actions.

614
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:27,910
Xiao Ming,

615
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,220
let him down.

616
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,270
My Lord.

617
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,280
Let him down.

618
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,350
Yes.

619
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,890
Listen to me, Wu Huan.

620
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,360
If you dare harbor any

621
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,540
evil thoughts about harming demons,

622
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,270
even if My Lord punishes me,

623
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,680
I will immediately,

624
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,350
at once,

625
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,810
kill you with my own hands.

626
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,030
-My Lord.
-My Lord.

627
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,350
My Lord.

628
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,350
My Lord, please teach us.

629
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,270
-Please teach us.
-We can beat him up.

630
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,270
-Yeah.
-I can beat him up too.

631
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,000
Teach us new techniques.

632
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,060
-Please teach us.
-All right. Quiet.

633
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,060
If you have questions, ask me.

634
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,440
My Lord has taught me many techniques
on our journey.

635
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,130
I know them too.

636
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,480
My Lord worked through the night.

637
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,480
Don't disturb him.

638
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,730
Let him get some rest.

639
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:11,790
My Lord,

640
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,660
although during this time

641
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,750
we've all been running for our lives,

642
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,270
I'm the only one
who's been learning diligently.

643
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,610
The new technique
I've practiced is called Earth Escape.

644
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,420
Once I escape through it,
I travel a thousand miles in an instant.

645
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,420
No one can find me.

646
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,150
That's amazing!

647
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,400
Show it to us.

648
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,350
As for this Earth Escape Technique...

649
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,000
Go ahead.

650
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,510
Show us!

651
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,240
Show us!

652
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,640
Show us!

653
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,100
Show us!

654
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,640
Show us!

655
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,720
Come on!

656
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,270
Well...

657
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,550
Has Wu Huan done it yet?

658
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,140
Wu Huan hasn't done it.

659
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,390
You should do it.

660
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,360
I truly believe now

661
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,290
that reading too many books
isn't all that useful.

662
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,700
My Lord, you've read so extensively,

663
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,480
thinking you might learn something,

664
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,080
some way to deal with humans.

665
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,480
Who would have thought that you

666
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,920
would learn the Heart-Burning Incantation?

667
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,030
Isn't that basically suicide?

668
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,790
Besides,

669
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,880
who in their right mind

670
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,680
would develop such a technique?

671
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,010
We can't find any demons who've used
the Heart-Burning Incantation,

672
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:25,200
[Inside the Red Flame Fruit]

673
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,890
let alone any documented cases.

674
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:26,290
[is a hot liquid that makes it ripen
in a day.]

675
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,690
[Not only the color is bright,
it also has powerful fire.]

676
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,330
Who knows
if we can find a way to break the spell.

677
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,110
But anyway,

678
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,750
even if you're protecting Xiao Yao
in every way,

679
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,730
this has something to do with her.

680
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
My Lord,

681
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,680
where are you going now?

682
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,200
No one's watching over you anyway.

683
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,130
I don't even know

684
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,600
what you're so stubbornly clinging to.

685
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,430
So,

686
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,520
you reap what you sow.

687
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,070
Wh-Wh-What

688
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:03,960
a-a-are

689
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,560
you doing?

690
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,100
Luoluo.

691
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,110
My Lord.

692
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,170
Normally,

693
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,590
you should be feeling drowsy by now.

694
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,860
With My Lord back,

695
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,920
the entire demon realm is energized.

696
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,550
I can't be like before.

697
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,030
I must make myself useful.

698
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,070
You don't need to act like

699
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,230
you're too good to kill me.

700
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,710
Killing me to establish your authority
is inevitable.

701
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,310
Stop this hypocritical act.

702
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,210
I will ask you some questions.

703
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,790
Just answer me truthfully.

704
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,570
I once fell into a human trap,

705
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,840
and my mouth was caught
in a narrow-necked bottle.

706
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,320
Lord Heiwu saved me.

707
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,750
Though I've repaid the debt,

708
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,699
asking me to betray him

709
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,440
is impossible.

710
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,550
You certainly know how to repay kindness,

711
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,080
valuing loyalty above all.

712
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,050
But have you ever thought about

713
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,420
where those minor demons
who once honored you as their teacher,

714
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,020
and respected and loved you,

715
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,030
are now?

716
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,190
What exactly is going on
between Heiwu and the Feiyu Guard?

717
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,790
Stop wasting words, Hong Ye.

718
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,590
If you don't kill me today,

719
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,390
one day, I will kill you.

720
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,570
Do you hate me so much

721
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,760
that you would harm your own kind?

722
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,670
Hate is not the word.

723
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,010
Throughout history,

724
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:41,930
be it humans or demons,

725
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,820
when power shifts,

726
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,510
only when the previous ruler dies,

727
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,920
can the successor secure their position.

728
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,450
What if I lost my power

729
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,760
and posed no threat?

730
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,650
Would you still want to kill me?

731
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,920
Yes.

732
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,280
Why?

733
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,570
As long as you were once the Demon Lord,

734
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,320
you must be eliminated.

735
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,320
Water.

736
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,510
I want some water.

737
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,190
I'm not doing this

738
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,790
because I feel sorry for you.

739
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,180
Luoluo.

740
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,110
Luoluo.

741
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,070
Could you

742
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,930
loosen this a bit?

743
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,030
I

744
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,610
can't breathe.

745
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,510
Just a little bit.

746
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,640
You betrayed our kind.

747
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,130
Why should I trust you?

748
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,900
Now that Hong Ye has returned,

749
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,180
and I'm in this state,

750
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,750
what could I possibly do?

751
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,000
Luoluo.

752
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,470
For the sake of our

753
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,140
teacher-student relationship,

754
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,640
and how we're both demons,

755
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,770
please?

756
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,320
Please, please.

757
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:32,650
Just a little.

758
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,400
Just a tiny bit, okay?

759
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,000
Fine.

760
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,720
I'll tie it back up.

761
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,150
You!

762
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,450
How could you trick me?

763
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,290
You're just too stupid.

764
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,890
Blame your own foolishness.

765
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,590
You think you can stop me?

766
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:03,760
Get out of my way.

767
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,070
You can't leave!

768
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:05,780
Luoluo.

769
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,460
I don't want to hurt you. Step aside.

770
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,150
Otherwise don't blame me for being rude.

771
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,460
My Lord said

772
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,670
demons must stand united.

773
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,150
I cannot let you go.

774
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,090
Another one
of Hong Ye's manipulative speeches.

775
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,350
You pig-headed fool.

776
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,770
My Lord.

777
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,880
It's fine.

778
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,250
You're injured.

779
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,110
As the mighty Demon Lord,

780
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,190
why shield a minor demon?

781
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,150
You once said,

782
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,550
only when the ruler dies,

783
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,050
can the successor become stable.

784
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,000
But in my view,

785
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,440
power

786
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,550
is granted only to those

787
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,850
who treat all beings equally.

788
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,900
Though we dislike humans,

789
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,400
they have a good saying:

790
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,770
"Heaven and Earth are not benevolent,

791
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,440
treating all beings as mutt dogs."

792
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,780
If the ruler

793
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,380
doesn't sincerely

794
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,850
and equally care for all demons,

795
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,400
how could there still be

796
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,260
a sanctuary like Demons' Valley?

797
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,430
How could Heiwu and us

798
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,250
still fight for power here?

799
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,500
You are good by nature.

800
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,260
Don't be misled by Heiwu anymore.

801
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,230
Xiao Yao.

802
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,230
Sit.

803
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,920
Why are you injured again?

804
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,160
I just scratched it by accident.

805
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,030
Where did you get it scratched?

806
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,880
In the bamboo grove.

807
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,520
You look very pale.

808
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
I haven't been

809
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,030
sleeping well these days.
