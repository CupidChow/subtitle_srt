[The Unclouded Soul]

2
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,890
[Episode 23]

3
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,400
Why are you hurt again?

4
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,800
I just accidentally scratched it.

5
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,400
Where did you get scratched?

6
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,450
In the bamboo grove.

7
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,910
You look very pale.

8
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,110
I haven't been

9
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,940
sleeping well these days.

10
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,590
I just met Luoluo.

11
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,960
He told me everything.

12
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,130
Hmm.

13
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,400
If there's nothing else,

14
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,840
get some rest early.

15
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,590
Don't you know your body

16
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,280
can't take
being injured over and over again?

17
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,000
I can handle it.

18
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,740
Why must you be so stubborn?

19
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,960
What choice do I have?

20
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,780
As the Demon Lord,

21
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,090
if I have no power to protect everyone,

22
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,470
and I can't even fulfill
my responsibilities,

23
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,990
I'm just a Demon Lord in name only.

24
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,810
So you know you're the Demon Lord.

25
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,870
Only with you around

26
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,930
do the demons exist

27
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,470
Small injuries accumulate and will
become serious problems.

28
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,070
If something happens to you,

29
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,800
what will happen to them?

30
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,150
But I can't always

31
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,630
let you risk yourself for me.

32
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,470
Why can't we share the burden together?

33
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,730
That would only make me feel more guilty.

34
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,490
So I choose to do things my way.

35
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:57,960
Fine.

36
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,150
Do it your way then.

37
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,910
I'm tired.

38
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,640
You may leave.

39
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,790
Xiao Ming.

40
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,830
M-My Lord.

41
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,260
Please don't be angry.

42
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,560
I'm just really too tired.

43
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,080
I haven't slept for days.

44
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,060
Can we let Xiao Mu
come out to do the search?

45
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,000
Sure.

46
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,560
Rest up.

47
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,780
I'll take over.

48
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,460
My Lord, don't worry.

49
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,530
We'll find a solution eventually.

50
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,750
Xiao Mu.

51
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,740
You've read so many books
and ancient texts,

52
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,780
do you know any good methods
to relieve depression?

53
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,310
But,

54
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,000
depression is something

55
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,870
only humans without power

56
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,040
would have.

57
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,450
Demons don't need to know about this.

58
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,540
No, no.

59
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,870
I mean,

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,810
demons have better solutions.

61
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,960
We can

62
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,040
practice cultivation diligently,

63
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,750
or

64
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,480
go hunting,

65
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,490
or take some magical medicine,

66
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,680
or if all else fails,

67
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,310
even having a fight
to let off steam works.

68
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:23,830
Anyway,

69
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,830
as long as we find

70
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,240
the cause of the depression,

71
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,160
that should solve it.

72
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
What if it's just because

73
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,620
you're trying too hard
to fulfill your duty,

74
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,080
you end up hurting someone you love?

75
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,120
Then it should be the other person

76
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,580
who's feeling depressed.

77
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,880
No, I misspoke.

78
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,700
You're right.

79
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,560
Go on.

80
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,360
Then apologize to her,

81
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,950
or just keep being good to her.

82
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,800
Just make sure she knows how you feel.

83
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,460
So how should I treat her well?

84
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,270
I only know how to treat you well,
My Lord.

85
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,240
As for others...

86
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,659
It's pointless asking you.

87
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,090
Xiao Ming.

88
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,190
Before His Lordship recovers his power,

89
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,390
when he wants someone to talk to,

90
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,600
you should be the one to keep him company.

91
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,060
Making His Lordship happy

92
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,030
is harder than cultivation.

93
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,120
Now you've got my attention.

94
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,390
My Lord.

95
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,590
Loving someone

96
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,430
means sharing with her.

97
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,560
No matter what happens,

98
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,830
you have to bear it together,

99
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,630
instead of enduring it alone.

100
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,420
But what if I just
don't want her to share my burden?

101
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,550
Love

102
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,520
is supporting each other

103
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,520
and sharing responsibilities.

104
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,590
How do you know

105
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,950
she would be upset

106
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,360
if you share your burden?

107
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,600
How do you know

108
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,159
she wouldn't be upset

109
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,960
if you decide to do things alone?

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,390
Xiao Ming, where did you learn

111
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,720
all this nonsense from?

112
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,810
This is nothing.

113
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,080
While looking through ancient texts,

114
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,710
I happened

115
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,480
to read a couple of plays
from the human realm

116
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,880
and picked up a few lines.

117
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,830
So you haven't

118
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,310
been looking for a solution at all,

119
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,840
but reading plays instead?

120
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,090
Xiao Ming is right for that.

121
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,920
Mr. Wu Huan,

122
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,440
do you still hold a grudge?

123
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,610
It's not your place to lecture me.

124
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,760
Let's make a bet.

125
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,679
Let's have a contest.

126
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,419
If you win, I'll let you go.

127
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,669
If you lose,

128
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,960
you'll be at my mercy.

129
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,289
Who do you think you are?

130
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,520
What about it?

131
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,790
Fine.

132
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:47,900
Let's have a try.

133
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,630
You lost.

134
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,400
Your power

135
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,000
has improved so quickly.

136
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,640
Did you train so hard

137
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,520
just to harm your own kind?

138
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,050
Hong Ye became the Demon Lord

139
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,150
because of his protection of demons

140
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,820
and compassion for all beings.

141
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,530
So even if he lost his power,

142
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,080
he would still have everyone's support.

143
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,510
Cultivation is also about the mind.

144
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,800
I hope you let go of your obsession soon.

145
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,460
Don't preach to me.

146
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,780
Do what you want with me—
be it murder or torture.

147
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,790
Hey!

148
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,580
As the Demon Lord,

149
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,360
I have my responsibilities.

150
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,540
Though I've lost my power,

151
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,170
no one knows
Demons' Valley better than I do.

152
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,300
I don't want to hide.

153
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,550
But I can't always let you

154
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,750
risk yourself for me.

155
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,700
That would only make me feel more guilty.

156
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,410
So I choose to do things my way.

157
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,710
Why is this only half written?

158
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,670
Is there

159
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,480
any clue in the book?

160
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,000
Very few records talk about

161
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,840
the Heart-Burning Incantation.

162
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,710
I've only figured out that

163
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,160
My Lord is unable
to use the power in his body

164
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,540
because his heart meridian is damaged,

165
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,910
but his power is still in there.

166
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,520
Really?

167
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,200
Of course.

168
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,750
See for yourself if you don't believe me.

169
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,480
Most of these ancient demon texts
are fragments—

170
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,060
disconnected and incoherent.

171
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,510
I've been piecing them together for days.

172
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,120
I don't even know
if I can piece them together.

173
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,750
You can.

174
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,410
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

175
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,870
Have you seen Hong Ye?

176
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,670
Stop asking me questions.

177
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,720
My head is already a mess.

178
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,790
Okay. I'll leave you alone.

179
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,720
You keep working on it.

180
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,750
You're smart enough to figure it out.

181
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,200
I...

182
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,970
Why don't you do it?

183
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't run away.

184
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,260
You're not getting it!

185
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,960
Where did he go?

186
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,090
Disappearing all over again.

187
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,060
I told you that you can't do it.

188
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,870
Xiao Yao.

189
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I think

190
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,480
my wound

191

You know that.

00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,700
Go change it yourself.

195
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,530
I was wrong

196
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,850
last night.

197
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,960
I made you worry.

198
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,630
I know.

199
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,150
Since I lost my power,

200
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,800
I've been suppressing my anxiety.

201
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,300
I always wanted to do something

202
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,160
but feared you'd bear too much burden.

00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,840

I wanted so badly to protect you,

207

yet feared you getting hurt.

208
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,920

00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,740
Not getting love from the one you cherish,

379
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,130
even if you take your heart out,

380
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,730
the pain is still unbearable.

381
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,320
You can only fill the void
with others' hearts.

382
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,310
Now I also need human hearts.

383
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,240
Many, many hearts.

384
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,480
It's okay.

385
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,240
It's okay.

386
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,800
That's not it.

387
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,340
That's not what I think.

388
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,990
I just wanted to help you.

389
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,730
I failed to take care of you.

390
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,070
But I'm not who I used to be anymore.

391
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,540
I really don't want you
to see me like this.

392
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,030
While I still have my sanity,

393
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,610
please, you and Tan'er end this for me.

394
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,870
I only want you to remember Lu Pianpian,

395
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,160
not some heartless, cold-blooded spirit.

396
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,040
Please.

397
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,600
Why haven't you gone after Hong Ye yet?

398
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,110
You startled me!

399
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,410
This is the capital.

400
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,270
You're too bold!

401
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,630
I've waited too long!

402
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:03,920
His Maj—

403
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,360
It's midnight,

404
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,530
protect your family.

405
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,880
His Majesty wants to attack Hong Ye,

406
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,030
but Bingzhu refuses to deploy troops.

407
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,880
Humans and demons are different.

408
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,960
Court politics

409
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,000
are incredibly complex.

410
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,270
-I need to do it from various—
-Cut the crap.

411
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,550
Isn't the Emperor supreme among humans?

412
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,070
Tell him

413
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,930
to send troops!

414
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,640
If only!

415
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,350
If only the Emperor listens to me,
things would be easier.

416
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,350
I'm trying to find a solution.

417
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,290
I'm thinking!

418
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,070
Then think faster.

419
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:35,870
I'm thinking!

420
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,680
Have you figured it out?

421
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,660
Yes, I have.

422
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,170
That was quick.

423
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,350
Why don't you talk
to the Emperor yourself?

424
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:48,920
Get lost.

425
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,510
Don't go.

426
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,680
You're sending me to my death.

427
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,920
Let me finish.

428
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,170
His Majesty only wants the Yuli Spring.

429
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,150
He doesn't care how we get it,

430
00:30:59,400 --> 00:30:59,830
right?

431
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,000
Since Bingzhu can't fulfill
His Majesty's wishes,

432
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,510
His Majesty is growing impatient.

433
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,250
What does this have to do with me?

434
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,680
If you and I

435
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,160
can convince the Emperor

436
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,080
to recognize you as the only Demon King...

437
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,570
The Demon King.

438
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,460
Go on.

439
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,460
This way,
humans and demons can join forces.

440
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,500
Whether it's eliminating enemies

441
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,720
or obtaining the Yuli Spring,

442
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,780
wouldn't everything become easier?

443
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,070
Humans and demons
have fought for thousands of years.

444
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,470
Would the Emperor agree?

445
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,390
Right now,

446
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,720
eliminating Hong Ye

447
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,320
is the common goal
for both you and His Majesty.

448
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,590
Let's go,

449
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,160
my Demon King.

450
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,290
Keep your head down. Don't look around.

451
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,750
Where is the emperor?

452
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,600
I'll go inform His Majesty right away.

453
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,490
Lord Heiwu,

454
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,580
please wait here

455
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,800
and don't wander off.

456
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,830
So luxurious.

457
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,110
Way too luxurious.

458
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,410
Ji Yan!

459
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,160
Ji Yan!

460
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,790
You lied to me!

461
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,230
You lied to me!

462
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,409
Lord Heiwu,

463
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,940
I told you

464
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:39,199
not to wander off.

465
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,400
I'll kill you!

466
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:48,130
Look.

467
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,449
This is what a great demon is like.

468
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,889
When it burns, it's truly

469
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,199
extraordinary.

470
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,260
Keep burning.

471
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,630
Look.

472
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,070
If you don't save him now,
he'll die.

473
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,040
Why should I care if he dies?

474
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,800
He was going to send me to the Feiyu Guard

475
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,840
to be used as a broom.

476
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,900
I'm not saving him.

477
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,920
He used to be our teacher.

478
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,030
Just one.

479
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,950
I want to kick him.

480
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,080
Go ahead.

481
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,030
After you kick him,

482
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:24,800
give me one.

483
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,480
I've noticed something about you.

484
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,480
You're really...

485
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,320
I...

486
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,520
It fell off by itself.

487
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,000
I...

488
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,620
Just one, okay?

489
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,740
You owe me a kick.

490
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,440
He ate it.

491
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,190
Xiao Yao.

492
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,360
Why are you being so nice to him?

493
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,050
This is called "taming the hawk."

494
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,860
"Taming the hawk"?

495
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,400
Why save me?

496
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,710
Cultivation is difficult.

497
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,370
It would be a waste to let it go.

498
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,080
Even if you save me,

499
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,000
no one will believe me.

500
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,510
I will.

501
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,310
You already knew Heiwu
wasn't a good master,

502
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,280
yet after being captured,
you only wanted to die.

503
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,140
Is it because of guilt?

504
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,110
If you can feel guilt—

505
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,840
so much so you want to make up for it
with your life,

506
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,550
someone like you

507
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,810
cannot be inherently evil.

508
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,060
Besides,

509
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,760
dying is the easiest thing.

510
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,550
But once you're dead,
you can't change anything.

511
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,180
People might even

512
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,590
whip your corpse, dig up your grave,

513
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,710
spit on your grave,

514
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,280
and you won't be able to fight back.

515
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,420
How frustrating would that be?

516
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:54,880
Yeah.

517
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,950
Can you stand such humiliation,

518
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:57,840
Mr. Wu Huan?

519
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,230
That makes sense.

520
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,810
I found it!

521
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,490
I found it!

522
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,360
Xiao Yao!

523
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,670
Quickly call My Lord back!

524
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,680
My Lord, in this ancient demon record,

525
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,080
there's information
about the Heart-Burning Incantation.

526
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,710
The Heavenly Mother

527
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,280
used the Heart-Burning Incantation,

528
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,550
sealed her own power,

529
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,930
and then disappeared without a trace.

530
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,520
The stone she was standing on

531
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,110
witnessed the scene

532
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:32,310
and transformed into the Sky Stone.

533
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
The last time the Sky Stone appeared

534
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,350
was at the West Coast.

535
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,610
The West Coast?

536
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,030
What kind of place is that?

537
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,290
The West Coast

538
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,410
is guarded by an ancient beast
called the Treasure Swallower.

539
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,230
The Treasure Swallower
is greedy by nature.

540
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,800
It collects treasures from the world

541
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,220
and seals them in its treasury,

542
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,710
allowing things in but never out.

543
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,450
My Lord,

544
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,840
there's no need to worry.

545
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,700
I'll go for you.

546
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,000
For my lord,

547
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,400
I would die a thousand deaths.

548
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,800
The Treasure Swallower is no small beast.

549
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,000
Going there rashly
would be extremely dangerous.

550
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,130
The journey is long,

551
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,920
and you'll have
to cross the vast Western Sea.

552
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,840
The Western Sea has storms year-round,

553
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,110
with terrifying waves.

554
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,040
In those waters,

555
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,810
scaled dragons often appear.

556
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,440
I...

557
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,680
I got it.

558
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,980
Wait for me.

559
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,380
I've spoken with Wu Huan.

560
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,840
He's willing
to carry us to the West Coast.

561
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,680
My Lord, I don't believe it!

562
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,280
I don't believe in just these few days,

563
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,510
he has changed his nature.

564
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,230
He must be looking for an excuse

565
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,360
to escape when he gets the chance!

566
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,160
I believe him.

567
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,760
Wu Huan's true form is a falcon.

568
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,650
Like an eagle,

569
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,630
he is able to soar in the highest skies,

570
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,890
with lofty ambitions.

571
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,210
Before,

572
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,170
he was just bewitched by Heiwu.

573
00:38:59,070 --> 00:38:59,760
My Lord...

574
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:02,590
Wu Huan.

575
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,840
Do you know
why I need to go to the West Coast?

576
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,190
In my battle with the Dreamshard Immortal,

577
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,230
I lost my power.

578
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,670
This trip to the West Coast

579
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,000
is to find

580
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
the Sky Stone that will restore my power.

581
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,630
My Lord,

582
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,480
why are you telling him this?

583
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,230
If I spend every day fearing betrayal

584
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,120
and death,

585
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,850
then I might as well
not be the Demon Lord.

586
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,330
Since I have a weakness,

587
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,740
rather than hiding it,

588
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,550
it's better that everyone knows,

589
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,810
so I can find other ways

590
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,810
to fulfill my duties as Demon Lord.

591
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,480
This way,

592
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,650
it's no longer a weakness.

593
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,030
Wu Huan,

594
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,150
this journey is extremely dangerous,

595
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:47,010
and whether I can
restore my power remains unknown.

596
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,560
I'm telling you all this

597
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,300
because I want to be an honest Demon Lord.

598
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,200
The same goes for you.

599
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,760
If you can face your past openly

600
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,440
and let go
of the evil thoughts in your heart,

601
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,550
you will still be

602
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,960
a pure member of the demon race.

603
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,830
I believe in you.

604
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,730
Wu Huan pays respects to My Lord.

605
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,890
I am willing to lay down my life for you,

606
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,280
in life or death.

607
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,590
My Lord,

608
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,610
even if he's willing to sacrifice himself,

609
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,940
with his level of power,

610
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,510
if he meets the Treasure Swallower
at the West Coast,

611
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,650
he'll die.

612
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,550
-It doesn't matter.
-I'm worried.

613
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,000
You stay in Demons' Valley.

614
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,260
We'll go by ourselves.

615
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,100
But...

616
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,250
My Lord!

617
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,210
What are you doing here?

618
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,890
I heard everything.

619
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,070
This time,
on my way back with His Lordship,

620
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,920
though His Lordship was injured,

621
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,520
he still saved me many times.

622
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,610
I brought some food

623
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,550
for Xiao Yao and His Lordship
on their journey.

624
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,000
The West Coast is so far away.

625
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,530
You'll definitely need it.

626
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,590
Thank you.
