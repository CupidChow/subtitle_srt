[The Unclouded Soul]

2
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,870
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,710
Tan'er.

4
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,920
Tan'er?

5
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
Didn't you want to find my true form?

6
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,680
Here I am.

7
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,500
I was confused.

8
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,660
I have failed you, Immortal Lord.

9
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,680
You certainly were confused.

10
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,720
Miss Pianpian.

11
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,210
Lu Pianpian.

12
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,420
The murderer who killed your brother

13
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,880
is right before your eyes.

14
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:06,870
Back then,

15
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,540
he used this demon-slaying blade

16
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,600
to kill your brother with his own hands.

17
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,760
I have wronged you, Immortal Lord.

18
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,630
I willingly accept my death.

19
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,380
I was the one who deceived Miss Pianpian.

20
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,870
Dreamshard,

21
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,990
even if you tear me into pieces

22
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,800
and use me as fertilizer for your flowers,

23
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,310
I won't resist.

24
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,280
I only beg you to let Miss Pianpian go.

25
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,490
Bingzhu,

26
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,829
still so smooth with your words.

27
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,030
Take these two to Biexin Courtyard.

28
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,000
Let everyone see

29
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,310
the consequences of
naively trusting humans.

30
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,080
[Lovely and intelligent]

31
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,610
If it weren't for a man,

32
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,220
Pianpian could have enjoyed

33
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,840
being second only to one

34
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,769
and above all others in privilege.

35
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,510
But she was blind,

36
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,360
choosing to believe the sweet talk
of this Feiyu Guard

37
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,000
and repaid Immortal Lord's kindness
with betrayal.

38
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,860
Immortal Lord cared for Pianpian

39
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,760
and gave her several chances.

40
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,000
But she was bewitched by that wretched man

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,159
and repeatedly tried
to harm Immortal Lord.

42
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:33,870
In the end,

43
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,740
this man

44
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,020
turned out to be her brother's killer.

45
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,350
Such people
who can't tell right from wrong

46
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,560
don't deserve to become an immortal.

47
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,740
Today,

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,260
venomous insects will

49
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,120
turn them into living corpses.

50
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,310
They will stand in Biexin Court
forever after,

51
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,830
as a warning to all.

52
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,730
What's that?

53
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,560
The venomous insect!

54
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,270
The venomous insect.

55
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,080
Master Bingzhu.

56
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,210
Thank you for treating me
to delicious food.

57
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,340
I had no choice either.

58
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,380
I failed to protect all of you.

59
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,490
Pianpian.

60
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,360
At the brink of death,

61
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,800
do you have any last words?

62
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,830
I have followed Immortal Lord
for 16 years,

63
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,190
and have long regarded her
as my only family.

64
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,880
Every command from Immortal Lord,

65
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,810
I have obeyed without exception.

66
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,560
Luring people to the island,

67
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,520
keeping those who submit,

68
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,800
humiliating those who err,

69
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,970
punishing them,

70
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,190
and killing them.

71
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,000
I also extract human essence…

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,780
What is she talking about?

73
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,030
Harm their physical bodies,

74
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,880
and destroy their souls.

75
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,560
Whatever Immortal Lord asked me to do,

76
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,210
I never once refused.

77
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,430
That can't be true.

78
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,630
How is that possible?

79
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,950
She must be talking nonsense.

80
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,000
Immortal Lord isn't that kind of person.

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,720
Exactly.

82
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,430
It's impossible.

83
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,160
Right.

84
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,270
Pianpian,

85
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,930
you brought this on yourself,

86
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,190
yet how dare you
slander Immortal Lord here.

87
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,630
I remember all the kindness
from Immortal Lord,

88
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,050
but what I've done

89
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,409
I can never forget.

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,720
Every day, I'm tormented by inner conflict—

91
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,380
the suffering is unbearable.

92
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,720
So I can only punish myself.

93
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,930
Only when my body hurts enough

94
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,330
can my heart feel somewhat relieved.

95
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,190
When the heart wavers,

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,480
slander finds its way in.

97
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,040
It's your own weak conviction

98
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,370
that made you fall for a man's deception.

99
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,370
I am useless.

100
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,520
Following Immortal Lord every day,

101
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,410
yet making no progress at all.

102
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,400
Immortal Lord wishes to return
to the celestial mountain,

103
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,620
but someone like me

104
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,930
is of no benefit to Immortal Lord.

105
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,840
But my life was given by Immortal Lord.

106
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,920
[Lovely and intelligent]

107
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,000
Now,

108
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,810
I'm willing to give my life

109
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,890
back to Immortal Lord.

110
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,720
What is she trying to do?

111
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,920
Release Lu Pianpian!

112
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,780
Still acting like you're deeply devoted?

113
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,000
As long as you release Lu Pianpian,

114
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,480
I'm willing to help Dreamshard

115
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,510
collect
the fragments of the Kunlun Mirror.

116
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,360
Miss Zhirui.

117
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,160
[Lovely and intelligent]

118
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,220
Has Immortal Lord given any response

119
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,590
about when Hong Ye will be returned to me?

120
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,680
Immortal Lord

121
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,190
is not someone you can
negotiate with as you please.

122
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,850
Then what will it take
for you to release Hong Ye?

123
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,560
You should think about

124
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,600
what else you can do.

125
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,270
Fine.

126
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,580
If you are willing to release Hong Ye,

127
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,049
I am willing to join Master Bingzhu

128
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:37,049
in seeking the fragments
of the Kunlun Mirror for you.

129
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,200
Both of you,

130
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,910
follow me to Linghua Palace.

131
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,520
You two think you can find
the Kunlun Mirror?

132
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,450
Yes,

133
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,440
the two of us can.

134
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,030
If we can truly recover
the mirror fragment,

135
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,480
you must release Tan'er

136
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,270
and Miss Pianpian.

137
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,500
Where do you plan to start looking from?

138
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,800
With determination,

139
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,270
even stones can be split.

140
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,360
Besides,

141
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,960
Immortal Lord will surely
give us some clues,

142
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,560
won't you?

143
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,440
Then I shall give you one clue.

144
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,290
Mount Qiansui.

145
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,220
There's a legend
in both human and demon realms

146
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,630
that a fragment of the Kunlun Mirror
is hidden in Mount Qiansui.

147
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,390
But it's guarded by Taotie,
the extremely ferocious ancient beast.

148
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,870
Neither humans nor demons

149
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,200
can approach it.

150
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,240
The lucky ones get injured,
the unlucky ones die.

151
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,130
Hong Ye.

152
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,560
Wait for me.

153
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,000
I promise I'll get you out of here.

154
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,500
Be careful!

155
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,880
What is this thing?

156
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,170
It's a spirit herb

157
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
that I brought from Demons' Valley.

158
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,030
Perhaps

159
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,020
it hasn't been watered for a while
and is throwing a tantrum.

160
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,080
I'll be right back.

161
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,200
Are you a dog?

162
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,260
Why did you bite me?

163
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:46,840
I...

164
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,750
What are you trying to prove?

165
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,750
Do you think Mount Qiansui
is a place for ordinary people?

166
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,510
You wouldn't even fill
the gaps in Taotie's teeth.

167
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,330
There's a Demon Slayer here, isn't there?

168
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,050
Him?

169
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,200
He's even more dangerous.

170
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,150
Dreamshard Immortal is truly wicked,

171
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,240
sending you alone with a man.

172
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,550
Are you jealous?

173
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,360
I'm not.

174
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,270
During this journey,

175
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,630
when you're with him,

176
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,150
you must be cautious at all times.

177
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,960
Keep your distance

178
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,760
and don't cross any boundaries.

179
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,440
Go back.

180
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,750
I'll tickle you!

181
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,580
It had enough to drink.

182
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,430
Immortal Lord let them leave the island
so easily.

183
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Does she really believe

184
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,770
they can find the Kunlun Mirror fragment?

185
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,700
Mount Qiansui

186
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,150
is guarded by Taotie.

187
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,870
Everyone knows that.

188
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,730
Many have tried to find that fragment

189
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,750
but never returned.

190
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,780
You mean

191
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,680
finding the mirror fragment
is just an excuse,

192
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,600
but she's actually sending them
to their deaths?

193
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,790
It takes Hong Ye

194
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,870
to find the fragments.

195
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,700
Master Bingzhu
and Xiao Yao are mere mortals.

196
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,290
What use could they be?

197
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,550
If they realize they're no match
for Taotie

198
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,290
and flee as soon as they reach shore,

199
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,220
wouldn't that be too easy for them?

200
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,320
That would be even better.

201
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,790
Isn't Hong Ye convinced
their love is unbreakable?

202
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,890
Seeing his beloved run off
with another man

203
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,260
is the only way he'll finally give up.

204
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,120
Lu Pianpian is still waiting eagerly
in prison.

205
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,000
Let her see

206
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
how unreliable

207
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,370
a man's promises can be.

208
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,960
With no one at the helm,

209
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,420
I wonder where the wind
will carry this boat.

210
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,550
The wind comes from
the Realm of Mist and Void.

211
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,950
It will naturally take us
to Mount Qiansui.

212
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,520
Let me ask you something.

213
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,900
Why did you kill Pianpian's brother?

214
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,600
Lu Tong was severely poisoned
at that time.

215
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,370
He had already lost all his humanity.

216
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,850
I had no other choice.

217
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,630
Then why didn't you tell her?

218
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,960
She's suffered enough already.

219
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,900
Knowing that would only add to her sorrow.

220
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,400
Let her keep

221
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,100
the memory of her heroic brother

222
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,700
as something to hold onto.

223
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,450
Isn't that better?

224
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,980
We've arrived at Mount Qiansui.

225
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,300
The quickest way
to find the mirror fragment

226
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,850
is to find Taotie first.

227
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,670
We need to be wary not just of demons,

228
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,930
but also of this place.

229
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,880
If you're ordinary villagers,
come out now!

230
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,860
Otherwise, you'll all be
treated as bandits!

231
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,580
Officer,

232
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,670
forgive my poor eyesight.

233
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,530
Please forgive my poor eyesight.

234
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,550
But that arrow just now

235
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,480
clearly came from that direction.

236
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,270
Li!

237
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,270
Come out now!

238
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,130
The officer has already seen you.

239
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,490
Hurry up.

240
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,650
You shot those three arrows just now?

241
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,670
[Li]

242
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,030
Yes.

243
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,720
Your archery is not bad.

244
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,840
Officer,

245
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,000
he failed to recognize you.

246
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,440
You can't even tell officials
from bandits?

247
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,360
Are you saying

248
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,070
my Feiyu Guard uniform

249
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,460
isn't obvious enough?

250
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,750
No, no, Officer.

251
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,480
I was blind!

252
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,120
We truly have nothing left.

253
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,440
Please spare us.

254
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,870
The village has nothing left
to pay taxes with,

255
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,550
Officer...

256
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,740
I'm not here to collect taxes,

257
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,990
only to exterminate demons.

258
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,440
Good.

259
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,150
Good.

260
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,320
Thank you.

261
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,380
-Thank you, Officer. Thank you, Officer.
-Do you know where the demon is?

262
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,090
That demon

263
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,630
was wreaking havoc
in our village just days ago.

264
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,630
Many houses were destroyed by them.

265
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,450
Lead the way.

266
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,240
Here.

267
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,550
I'll show you.

268
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,770
Li, how many years
have you been an archer?

269
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,510
Your draw strength is sufficient,

270
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,440
but your rear elbow
isn't level when drawing,

271
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,620
you release too quickly,

272
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,080
so your accuracy suffers.

273
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,150
Please don't blame him, Officer.

274
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,990
Li is our village's best hunter.

275
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,390
He wasn't always like this.

276
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,810
Since his wife was devoured by Taotie,

277
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,710
he's become somewhat deranged.

278
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,050
Please don't hold it against him.

279
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:56,850
That's right.

280
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,910
Does Taotie appear often?

281
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,390
Yes.

282
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,720
Taotie has turned

283
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,050
our village into ruins.

284
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,570
It's terrifying.

285
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,920
It has three heads, six arms,

286
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,120
and huge bloody jaws.

287
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,460
It can swallow

288
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,360
a fully grown man whole.

289
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,190
Yes, if you anger it,

290
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,250
it breathes fire from its mouth.

291
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,320
Wherever the flames touch,

292
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,720
nothing grows again.

293
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,450
Officer,

294
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,250
our village is just ahead.

295
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:23,800
Let's go.

296
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,270
I'll show you around the village.

297
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:25,870
Please.

298
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,640
Let's go.

299
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
It's terrifying.

300
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,550
Our village

301
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,290
is in terrible shape now.

302
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,550
Officer,

303
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,880
this is our village.

304
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,510
Take a look.

305
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,890
This is all Taotie's doing.

306
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,790
This house belonged to Ding Laosan.

307
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,790
His family of four couldn't escape.

308
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,040
Officers,

309
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,270
there's another one ahead.

310
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,130
Let me show you.

311
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,460
This monster terrorizes our village daily.

312
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,320
You have no idea.

313
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,750
The villagers are so frightened

314
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,880
they barely dare to leave their homes.

315
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,880
Ya, come to Grandma quickly.

316
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,150
Tribe Leader,

317
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,310
an official is here.

318
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,310
Hurry, leader!

319
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,030
Come welcome our distinguished guests.

320
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,770
Sir.

321
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,080
Greetings to both of you.

322
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,440
Please come inside.

323
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,750
This way, please.

324
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,590
Please.

325
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,000
Leader,

326
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,440
Li just shot an arrow at them
at the village entrance.

327
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,720
He probably made them angry.

328
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,000
[Tribe Leader]

329
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,480
Sheng,

330
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,720
you two should go back.

331
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,520
Alright, we'll head back first.

332
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,890
Sir and Madam,

333
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,030
please sit.

334
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,010
Have a seat.

335
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,090
No need to trouble yourself, Leader.

336
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,350
It's no trouble at all.

337
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,790
Let me pour you some tea.

338
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,680
Sir, as you've seen on your way here,

339
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,830
you must have noticed

340
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,920
how our houses

341
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,310
and lands are completely devastated.

342
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,680
Moreover,

343
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,590
the villagers never know
where their next meal will come from.

344
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,680
They're constantly harmed by Taotie.

345
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,440
Nowadays,

346
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,640
whether farming or hunting,

347
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,920
people must go in groups.

348
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,160
I would like to ask for your forgiveness

349
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,270
for the young men just now

350
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,880
who have offended you.

351
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,160
Leader,

352
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,550
are the claw marks on the wall

353
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,190
all left by Taotie?

354
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,400
Yes,

355
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,790
indeed.

356
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,550
Leader,

357
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,160
are there any other traces left by Taotie?

358
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,090
Would you please

359
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,160
show us?

360
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,750
Yes.

361
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:54,830
Well,

362
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,790
Sir.

363
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:56,880
No...

364
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,880
No matter how skilled you are,

365
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,210
you're still just one person alone.

366
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:01,960
So—

367
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,590
No, no.

368
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,620
You're stronger than him.

369
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,720
But

370
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,240
there are only two of you.

371
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,400
It's better to not disturb that monster.

372
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,240
In the past,

373
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,000
government troops came several times,

374
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,200
-and they were scared away.
-They don't know how to catch demons.

375
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,360
The two of us

376
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,110
will not leave

377
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,030
until we eliminate Taotie.

378
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,490
Mm-hmm.

379
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,730
I just want to see the traces
left by Taotie,

380
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,830
yet you're making various excuses.

381
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,970
Don't tell me you want me

382
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,070
to send a tax collector instead.

383
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,590
If that's the case,

384
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,490
then...

385
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:39,830
Sir,

386
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,330
please follow me.

387
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:44,820
Look.

388
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,710
These large footprints.

389
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,480
Look.

390
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,090
Especially that wall.

391
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,370
The handprints.

392
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,740
Claw marks.

393
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,480
Were all these left by Taotie?

394
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,160
Yes, yes.

395
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,100
This blood too?

396
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,400
That's right.

397
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,070
Taotie's blood?

398
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,350
No,

399
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,110
it's Wang Er's wife's.

400
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,040
Xiao Yao.

401
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,800
Told you it'd scare her off.

402
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,650
What footprints and handprints?

403
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,590
The paint too?

404
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,790
You might fool others,

405
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,550
but not me.

406
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,400
I used to make a living from this.

407
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,470
But this Taotie...

408
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,640
did it ever really appear?

409
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,640
Li, have you decided yet?

410
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,200
Are you going to meet her or not?

411
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,720
It'd be nice

412
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,790
to have a girl marry in this village.

413
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,240
Other families are lining up asking me
to arrange marriages—

414
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,440
but look at you.

415
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,840
If the girl hadn't taken a liking to you,

416
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,660
I wouldn't even bother
wasting my breath on you.

417
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,160
This boy...

418
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,850
Tell them

419
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,160
I already have a wife.

420
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:36,830
[Zixiu]

421
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,490
Are you playing hide and seek?

422
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,590
I want to play too.

423
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,030
If you don't play with me, I'll scream.

424
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,400
Don't scream, don't scream.

425
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
Let's play.

426
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,860
I'll hide and you find me.

427
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,830
What's this?

428
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,620
They made Taotie into an archery target.

429
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,550
This is Taotie?

430
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,440
Actually,
Taotie doesn't look like this at all.

431
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,020
You've seen it?

432
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,700
Mm-hmm.

433
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,350
Where did you see it?

434
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,830
Play hide and seek with me first,

435
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,890
then I'll tell you.

436
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,750
Aren't I playing with you already?

437
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,990
Then close your eyes.

438
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,440
Okay.

439
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,320
I'll count to five.

440
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,830
After five, I'll open my eyes.

441
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,550
Run quickly.

442
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,440
Don't cheat.

443
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,880
I won't cheat.
I play fair.

444
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,310
One.

445
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,640
Two.

446
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,660
Three.

447
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,680
Five.

448
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,440
I'm coming to catch you!

449
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
If I get you,

450
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,570
you have to come back to my cave with me.

451
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
Come find me!

452
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,750
Come on!

453
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,300
I'll catch you!

454
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,170
Did it scare you?

455
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,580
It scared you, didn't it?

456
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,690
Xiao Yao.

457
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,160
Why did you come so far?

458
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,350
I couldn't find you anywhere.

459
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,640
I thought something had happened to you.

460
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,550
It's nothing.
I was just playing with this child.

461
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,550
But I was startled by this painting.

462
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,550
Zixiu.

463
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,750
This isn't a place
you should be running around.

464
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,750
Go home.

465
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,200
I'm not done playing yet.

466
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,790
Stop playing around.

467
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,830
All you think about is playing.

468
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,590
Let me tell you.

469
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,640
If Taotie finds you,
it will cost you your life.

470
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,930
But I still want to play!

471
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:41,790
Go back. Go back.

472
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,390
Back. Now.

473
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,550
I found

474
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,960
this child

475
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,110
when I was hunting in the mountains.

476
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,750
I searched for a long time

477
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,840
but couldn't find his parents.

478
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,020
They probably met with disaster.

479
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,440
This child has had a hard life.

480
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,880
So now

481
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,510
we're letting him stay in the village,

482
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,720
giving him food to eat.

483
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,250
He just offended you, Miss.

484
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,350
Please don't blame him.

485
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,350
-No, no.
-Why is there an arrow hole?

486
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,110
That was drawn by Li.

487
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,510
He uses it as a target.

488
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,300
It's getting late.

489
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,410
We shan't disturb the villagers.

490
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,200
We'll rest here tonight.

491
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,100
Well...

492
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,460
Shall I bring you a charcoal brazier?

493
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,210
Yes, please.

494
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,070
All the traces left by Taotie
in this village

495
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,550
were done by a human.

496
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,020
The footprints

497
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,240
and claw marks

498
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,520
are all created very shabbily.

499
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,620
The blood stains
are the most ridiculous of all.

500
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,270
I suspect

501
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,440
they've never seen a Taotie before.

502
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,900
The Baize Drawings say

503
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,750
a Taotie has a sheep's body
with a human face.

504
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,080
Its eyes are located under its armpits,

505
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,110
completely different from this one.

506
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,680
Regardless of whether this drawing
depicts the real Taotie,

507
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,510
but from what Li did today,

508
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,590
I can tell

509
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,330
he must have seen the real demon before.

510
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:19,710
By the way,

511
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
that kid just now

512
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,400
told me today

513
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,550
he has seen Taotie before.

514
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,030
Him?

515
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,880
I don't know if it's true.

516
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,790
Here's what we'll do.

517
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,960
Tomorrow you go find Li,

518
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,920
and I'll find that child.

519
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,160
We'll investigate further.

520
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,550
Sure.

521
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,320
All right.

522
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:36,970
Xiao Yao!

523
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,920
What?

524
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,270
I need to talk to you about something.

525
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,750
He's a single man
and you're a single woman—

526
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,200
it's inappropriate for you two

527
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,530
to using the same room.

528
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,480
And also,

529
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,830
since you two got on the boat,

530
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,200
this pretty boy—

531
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,440
I've felt that

532
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,920
he has ulterior motives toward you.

533
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,780
Furthermore,

534
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,030
I'd rather

535
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,000
you stayed with Luoluo

536
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,270
than him!

537
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:03,960
Do you get it?

538
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,110
Little mantis, watch your tongue.

539
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,590
Shut up!

540
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,920
Who are you calling little mantis?

541
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,790
You shut up.

542
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,600
What's wrong
with being in the same room as him?

543
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,650
Are we doing anything shameful?

544
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,240
We're discussing important matters.

545
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,400
Yet you're projecting
your own indecent thoughts onto others.

546
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,200
How dare you

547
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,710
blabber on

548
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,160
and on.

549
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,270
Let me tell you,

550
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,570
you two being together is unacceptable!

551
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,770
You like Luoluo, don't you?

552
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,370
I'll let you see him right now.

553
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,810
Luoluo, right?

554
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,240
Luoluo!

555
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,530
Weren't you blabbering on?

556
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,970
What? I can't hear you.

557
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,790
Still can't hear you.

558
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,830
Speak louder!

559
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,480
Aren't you supposed to be tough?

560
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,030
Aren't you tough?

561
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:01,960
That's...

562
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,960
well drawn.

563
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,040
It's alright.

564
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,140
Did it hurt?

565
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,160
Get out!

566
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,750
Taotie is here!

567
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,590
Taotie is here!

568
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,350
Taotie is here!

569
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,750
Taotie is here!

570
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,750
The demon is coming!

571
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,580
Kill it!

572
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,720
Kill it!

573
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,960
Sir, are you alright?

574
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,790
This Taotie

575
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,920
took advantage of the dark

576
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,000
and entered the village.

577
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,110
It was spotted in front of Li's house.

578
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,440
The villagers

579
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,270
have some experience dealing with it.

580
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:06,920
Right, right.

581
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,750
It didn't hurt anyone.

582
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,810
They drove it away.

583
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:09,550
Drove it away.

584
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,160
It ran off.

585
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,350
You drove it away?

586
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,070
Yes, yes.

587
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,670
It's gone.

588
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,280
It ran off.

589
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,000
Well done.

590
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,270
Let's press our advantage.

591
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,270
Give me the blade.

592
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,070
Sir,

593
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:20,700
look,

594
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,930
Li and the young men have already gone,

595
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,200
so there's no need to trouble yourself.

596
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,830
Right, right.

597
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,390
Sheng,

598
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,400
go check it out.

599
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,110
Go, hurry.

600
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,720
Quick, let's go.

601
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,310
Sir and Madam,

602
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,920
get some rest.

603
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,110
So,

604
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,810
does it look familiar?

605
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,960
All too familiar.

606
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,070
There's fresh blood
at the base of these scales,

607
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,800
and the footprints are so even.

608
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,400
This doesn't seem like a human pretending.

609
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,000
It must be a demon at least.

610
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,440
Li!

611
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,110
They're back.

612
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,510
You've returned.

613
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,510
They're back.

614
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,410
How did it go?

615
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,770
Another night wasted.

616
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,430
Still couldn't catch it.

617
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,790
So you all encountered Taotie?

618
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,030
Chased it all night,

619
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,230
but it got away again.

620
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,160
It's fine if it escaped,

621
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,440
as long as everyone is safe.

622
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,370
Have some water.

623
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,550
Here.

624
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,280
Are you alright?

625
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,510
You went that way.

626
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,110
Next time,

627
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,880
we absolutely cannot let it escape again.

628
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,160
Li,

629
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,240
may I see your arrow?

630
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,680
This arrowhead is poisoned,

631
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,420
and bound with charms.

632
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,680
It is indeed

633
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,810
the only way to fight demons right now.

634
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,700
But if it's truly Taotie,

635
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,920
this is far from enough.

636
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,480
I'm willing to help you

637
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,860
slay the demon and avenge.

638
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,430
Li,

639
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,400
I heard your wife

640
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,350
was killed by Taotie.

641
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,430
Did you witness it yourself?

642
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,160
Could you tell me

643
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,200
the details?

644
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,310
Did you see what it looked like?

645
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,920
Sir,

646
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,550
please don't put Li on the spot.

647
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,490
Leader.

648
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,020
As a Feiyu Guard Demon Slayer...

649
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,110
It's my duty to eliminate demons
for the people.

650
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,960
Yes, of course.

651
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,240
If the demon isn't eliminated,

652
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,680
more people will suffer
the pain of losing loved ones.

653
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,540
Are you going to wait for that day?

654
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,350
Follow me.

655
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,880
My wife's name was Ya'er.

656
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,290
We grew up together.

657
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,310
We were betrothed since childhood.

658
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,920
After marriage, life was hard,

659
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,230
but there was sweetness in the bitterness.

660
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,080
But later,

661
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,550
the government taxes kept increasing,

662
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,570
and I happened to fall seriously ill,

663
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,030
so all our money

664
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,210
was spent on treating my illness.

665
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,200
Tax day was approaching.

666
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,020
I insisted on going hunting
in the mountains despite my illness.

667
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,050
But Ya'er wouldn't allow it.

668
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,450
She absolutely refused.

669
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,360
While I was fast asleep,

670
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,000
she took the bow
and went to the mountains herself.

671
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,090
She was gone for many days.

672
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,230
She returned the day
before taxes were due.

673
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,880
Not only did she bring back game,

674
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,240
she also brought back
a bottle of spring water.

675
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,570
She said that on her way,

676
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,810
she met an immortal,

677
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,330
who gave her a bottle of

678
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,420
Yuli Spring water
that grants immortality.

679
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,190
The water smelled foul to me,

680
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,040
so I refused to drink it.

681
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,770
But Ya'er insisted I drink it.

682
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,190
She said I would be cured
after drinking it.

683
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,390
During our argument,

684
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,040
I accidentally pushed her,

685
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,440
and broke the bottle.

686
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,790
The shards also cut her hand.

687
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,680
I deserve to die.

688
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,410
If I had drunk that water then,

689
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,450
none of this would have happened.

690
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:57,980
Go play by yourself.

691
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,590
Do you know how to play jianzi?

692
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,270
No, I don't.

693
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,070
I'll teach you.

694
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,790
Don't mess around.

695
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,390
Jianzi is really fun.

696
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,920
I don't want to play.

697
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,260
Just play with me for a while.

698
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,700
Fine. Give it to me.

699
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,940
What's wrong with you?

700
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,400
No need to throw it away
even if you're not playing with me.

701
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,550
Here.

702
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,270
Thank you.

703
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,920
What's your name?

704
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,070
Zixiu.

705
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,790
Zixiu.

706
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,400
Yes.

707
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,720
Do you remember you promised me yesterday

708
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,310
that if I played hide-and-seek with you,

709
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,910
you would tell me something?

710
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,900
Do you know how to play jianzi?

711
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,520
Of course.

712
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,960
That's amazing!

713
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,720
Teach me!

714
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,460
Want to play something else?

715
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:51,750
Yes.

716
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,280
Let's go.

717
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,640
Later on,

718
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,490
the tax officials came.

719
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,400
They took away our game

720
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,270
and all the valuables in our home.

721
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,680
They still thought it wasn't enough.

722
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,810
Ya'er had to go to the mountains again.

723
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,380
But when she went up this time,

724
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,719
she never came back.

725
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,550
The villagers and I
searched for many days,

726
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,330
but couldn't find her.

727
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,159
We only found her clothes

728
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,360
and...

729
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,610
this half jade pendant.

730
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,929
This is my family heirloom,

731
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,510
our token of love.

732
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,400
At the place
where I found the jade pendant,

733
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,130
I also heard the howl of Taotie,

734
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,550
and saw a pair of eyes.

735
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,550
What kind of eyes?

736
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,320
Blood-red eyes.

737
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,230
Hidden in the forest, staring at me.

738
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,960
If I don't kill it,

739
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,160
I swear I am not human.

740
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,440
Bear with it.

741
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,160
Just cooperate.

742
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,030
You're so nice, Miss,

743
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,710
just like Ya'er.

744
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,030
Who is Ya'er?

745
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,240
She's Li's wife.

746
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,440
Mm-hmm!

747
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,920
Before, only Ya'er would play with me,

748
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,890
sometimes bringing Li along too.

749
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,910
What happened after?

750
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,200
Later, Ya'er disappeared

751
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,230
and Li changed too.

752
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,510
Zixiu.

753
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,110
Was Ya'er

754
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,630
really eaten by Taotie?

755
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,630
No.

756
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,960
But

757
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,840
many people in the village

758
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,310
died in strange ways.

759
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,880
They don't even get coffins—

760
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,070
just wrapped in mats

761
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,670
and thrown in the graveyard.

762
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,510
Follow me if you're not afraid.

763
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,560
Let's go.

764
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,250
We're here.

765
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,440
Li said

766
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,870
at the place where Ya'er disappeared,

767
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,960
he also saw a pair of eyes like these.

768
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,070
Can the dead become a living corpse?

769
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,760
This location is extremely yin,

770
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,820
so it's hard to say.

771
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:34,740
Don't be afraid.

772
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,690
I'll set up a formation

773
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,420
to suppress the evil energy.

774
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:42,930
I'm not afraid.

775
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,000
Go and set it up.

776
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,360
Zixiu, come here.

777
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:15,960
Okay.

778
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,400
Listen,

779
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,800
the rats are gnawing on human bones.

780
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,060
The coins didn't move.

781
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,500
It's likely someone playing tricks.

782
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,710
I have done nothing wrong,

783
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,460
so I'm not afraid of ghosts knocking.

784
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,480
Want to see a magic trick?

785
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:09,840
Yes.

786
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:15,880
Blow on it.

787
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,370
Fire!

788
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,280
Hurry!

789
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,480
Come put out the fire!

790
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:36,840
Leader!

791
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,390
-Leader!
-Leader!

792
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,370
Stomp it out!

793
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,760
That's it!

794
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,840
Quick!

795
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,960
Help!

796
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,440
Harder!

797
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,000
That's it!

798
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,920
Let's go!

799
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,380
Leader.

800
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,090
Are you alright, Leader?

801
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,480
The act fell through.

802
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:55,670
Sir...

803
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,940
S-Sir...

804
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,280
You have such nerve,

805
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,280
daring to trick the Feiyu Guard.

806
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:02,960
No.

807
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,000
Sir, let me explain.

808
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,150
Mount Qiansui has always been barren,

809
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,760
we truly cannot afford the taxes.

810
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:10,510
We had no choice

811
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,630
but to spread rumors
about monsters hurting people

812
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,150
and destroying fields and homes.

813
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:18,590
Our goal was to keep officials
and outsiders away

814
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:21,230
so we could have a moment to breathe.

815
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
We dressed as ghosts to scare people

816
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,160
out of desperation,

817
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,490
with no intention to harm anyone.

818
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,960
Please understand our situation, Sir.

819
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,070
Please be merciful, Sir!

820
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,920
Please be merciful.

821
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,150
Since we entered the village,

822
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,150
we've been telling you

823
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,760
we're not here to collect money

824
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,150
but to capture monsters.

825
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,880
Yet you still try to deceive us.

826
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,230
I... I... I...

827
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,550
I had no choice.

828
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,600
Well... Well...

829
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,030
I was once forced into
doing something like this too.

830
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,630
Though they have deceived us,

831
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,510
they truly haven't hurt anyone.

832
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,280
Get up.

833
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,280
Thank you, Sir.

834
00:40:59,280 --> 00:40:59,760
Thank you, Sir!

835
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,320
Thank you, Sir.

836
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:00,880
Thank you, Sir.

837
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,340
Was Taotie from last night

838
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,160
also something you fabricated?

839
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,030
My Lord,

840
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,400
there really are monsters here.

841
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,760
Strange incidents
have occurred in the village.

842
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,640
Every time officials came,

843
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,320
they claimed
they would eliminate the monsters,

844
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,780
but they would always fail

845
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,000
and only add to the extortion—

846
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,320
Even so—

847
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,850
I'll say this one last time.

848
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,510
The two of us came here

849
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,910
with no ulterior motive.

850
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,320
Only here to eliminate monsters.

851
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:30,710
Yes.

852
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,320
Then we're extremely grateful, Sir.

853
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,110
Thank you, Sir.

854
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:34,800
Thank you, Sir.

855
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,840
But you must tell me everything

856
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,190
that has happened here in detail.

857
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:39,590
Us.

858
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,120
Do not...

859
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,440
hide anything.

860
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,760
I wouldn't dare deceive you at all.
