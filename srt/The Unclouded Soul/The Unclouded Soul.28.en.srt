[The Unclouded Soul]

2
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,900
[Episode 28]

3
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,039
Don't be afraid, my son.

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,680
All of you are chipmunks?

5
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,280
Are you two demon-hunting immortals?

6
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,150
Our family has lived among humans

7
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,640
without harming anyone.

8
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,960
Please be merciful

9
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,000
and spare our lives.

10
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,930
I am Hong Ye, the Monarch of All Demons.

11
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,240
My duty

12
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,150
is to protect all demons.

13
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,600
-Greetings, Demon King.
-Greetings, Demon King.

14
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,820
I saw through your true forms last night.

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,079
But I noticed your son is confused,

16
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,480
unable to tell
whether he's human or demon.

17
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,280
Why has he become like this?

18
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,680
Also,

19
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,960
why aren't you properly cultivating
in the forest?

20
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,810
Instead, you mingle with humans,

21
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,930
deceiving them

22
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,010
and living dishonorably.

23
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
What's your purpose?

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,590
Please allow me to explain, Demon King.

25
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,800
Originally, our family of three

26
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,910
was, as you said,

27
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,720
peacefully cultivating in the mountains.

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,840
Ten years ago,

29
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,910
when my wife and I returned from foraging,

30
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,240
we found our home

31
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,610
invaded by humans.

32
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,630
They destroyed the mountains
and cut down trees.

33
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,470
Unfortunately, our power was too weak

34
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,000
to fight against them.

35
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,760
Not only was our home destroyed,

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,730
but our son was nowhere to be found.

37
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,540
But we firmly believed

38
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,660
that our son was still alive.

39
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,800
So,

40
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,160
we transformed into human form

41
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,079
and came to the human realm

42
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,630
to search for our son.

43
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,470
After many years of searching,

44
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,070
we finally found some clues.

45
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,040
It turned out our son

46
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,829
had been bought by a wealthy family.

47
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,460
Their young master

48
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,320
kept our son as a pet.

49
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,030
[Happiness]

50
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,690
We wanted to rescue our child,

51
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,310
but on their courtyard walls

52
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,170
were demon-repelling talismans

53
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,610
that prevented us from entering.

54
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,079
Therefore,

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,240
we could only wait nearby
for an opportunity.

56
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,030
Three years ago,

57
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,960
that family moved away.

58
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,520
Only then could we enter the courtyard

59
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,470
and find our son.

60
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,430
However,

61
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,190
at that time,

62
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,110
our son had lost his mind.

63
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,470
He not only failed to
recognize his parents

64
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,360
but considered that wealthy family
as his own.

65
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,850
He cried every day,

66
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,700
wanting to find his "family."

67
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,079
We tried many methods,

68
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,390
but our son refused to believe
he was a demon.

69
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,870
He insisted on finding that family.

70
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,510
We had no choice

71
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,850
but to frighten him

72
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,400
by saying his human parents

73
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,050
had been eaten by us.

74
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,420
And if he didn't obey,

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,830
we would eat him too.

76
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,470
Our son, in his confused state,

77
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,870
is attached to the human realm

78
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,070
and refuses to return to the mountains.

79
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,390
But in human territory,

80
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,240
money is a must.

81
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,800
Yes.

82
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,450
It was difficult for us

83
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,040
to raise him.

84
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,750
A couple of years ago,

85
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,760
a family took a liking to my son

86
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,409
and insisted on marrying
their daughter to him.

87
00:04:58,409 --> 00:04:59,700
But we only found out after the marriage

88
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,110
that the girl already had a lover.

89
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,170
Her parents didn't approve of him,

90
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,430
so they used my son
to break up the couple.

91
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
We wanted to help the couple,

92
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,290
so we let the girl elope with her lover.

93
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,350
We gave her family a bloodstained garment

94
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,360
claiming she went to the mountains
to gather herbs

95
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,760
and was eaten by a demon.

96
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,700
The girl was grateful,

97
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,800
so she left her dowry with us.

98
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,300
So when you need money again,

99
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,800
you'll just find another marriage
for your son?

100
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,190
We only seek money,

101
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,190
not lives.

102
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,450
That girl, Cui,

103
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,970
was born to a concubine
of a wealthy family.

104
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,010
She was bullied
by her family since childhood

105
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,790
and had long wanted to leave
and make her own way.

106
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,400
We wanted money,

107
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,130
and she wanted freedom.

108
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,330
Though you're demons,

109
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,540
you place the blame

110
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,820
entirely on demons.

111
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,360
Unsolved human cases

112
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,380
are mostly blamed on demons.

113
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,630
One more or one less

114
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,870
doesn't make a difference.

115
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,870
Why do you only learn the bad things?

116
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,040
What do you plan to do in the future?

117
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,600
Originally, our family of three

118
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,830
lived freely cultivating in the mountains.

119
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,600
We only resent that the humans invaded,

120
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,950
destroyed our home,

121
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,870
and separated our family.

122
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,480
Now,

123
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,680
our home is no longer a home,

124
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,870
and we're neither human nor demon.

125
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,800
We live in constant fear every day,

126
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,670
afraid humans will discover we are demons.

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,120
For us two old ones,

128
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,720
our lives don't matter much.

129
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,180
We only fear that one day when we're gone,

130
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,360
our son will be left alone in this world,

131
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,930
struggling to survive.

132
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,430
[Happiness]

133
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,159
Thank you.

134
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,870
It seems we need to

135
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,070
resolve his trauma as soon as possible.

136
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,330
But my son's obsession runs too deep,

137
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,920
how can we resolve it?

138
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,190
Where did you find him?

139
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,190
Take us there.

140
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,050
Demon King.

141
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,440
This is the Xu Residence.

142
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,600
Tai!

143
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,160
Tai, I'm back!

144
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,310
Tai!

145
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,560
Tai!

146
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,240
Tai!

147
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,750
Tai!

148
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,630
Tai!

149
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,630
Tai!

150
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,510
Jin Jr.

151
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,110
You must be hungry.

152
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,890
Today my father punished me
with a day of fasting,

153
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,470
so you didn't get any food either.

154
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,630
These are rice grains
I picked up from under the table.

155
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,870
Between the two of us,

156
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,440
it can only fill one of us up.

157
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,550
You can have it all.

158
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,620
Today,

159
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,510
Squire Liu
brought his newly purchased bird

160
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,120
to show off to my father.

161
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,480
He said that bird
could speak human language

162
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,470
and cost him ten taels of gold.

163
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,390
In all of Tiansheng Kingdom,

164
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,790
there's only one like it.

165
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,910
I said,

166
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,960
"What's so great
about speaking human language?

167
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,480
My Jin Jr. can do that too."

168
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,960
With that,
Father slapped me across the face,

169
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,000
said I was lying,

170
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,760
and punished me with no food for a day

171
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,890
to teach me a lesson.

172
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,440
Jin Jr.

173
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,680
You need to show some spirit too.

174
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,450
Learn to speak human language

175
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,790
and put Squire Liu's bird in its place.

176
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,720
Jin Jr.

177
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,200
Jin Jr.

178
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,390
Have a candied chestnut.

179
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,950
Jin Jr., let me tell you,

180
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,640
these candied chestnuts

181
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,270
are the finest delicacy
in the human realm.

182
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,090
It's because my teacher gave me

183
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,630
the highest grade,

184
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,490
Mother agreed to buy these for me.

185
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,870
We are brothers.

186
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,150
From now on, if I have a bite,

187
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,410
you'll have a bite too.

188
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,930
From this day forward,

189
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,390
it will always be like this.

190
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,920
Here's another one for you.

191
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,290
My dad beats me every day.

192
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,100
I can't take it anymore.

193
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,690
Tonight,

194
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,320
let's run away from home together.

195
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,240
From now on,

196
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,910
no matter how far,

197
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,430
it'll just be us two brothers

198
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,630
traveling together.

199
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,100
What do you say?

200
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,140
You promised.

201
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,610
I knew it.

202
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,290
Even if everyone else abandons me,

203
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,700
I still have you as my brother.

204
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,150
Tai.

205
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,550
Why aren't you sleeping,

206
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,080
sitting on the wall
in the middle of the night?

207
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,030
Tai...

208
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,670
Where did you go?

209
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,470
Didn't we agree

210
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,480
that no matter how far,

211
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,080
we would travel together?

212
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,030
Demon King, look.

213
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,560
He still remembers the cage,

214
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,390
but doesn't know he's a chipmunk.

215
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,910
I'm afraid

216
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,190
we need to find his former playmate.

217
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,670
But the house
has been empty for three years.

218
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,200
How...

219
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,800
are we supposed to find them?

220
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,110
That's not difficult.

221
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,910
I have a way.

222
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,550
Wait here.

223
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,840
Sir,

224
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,040
how long has your shop been open?

225
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,000
This shop

226
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,340
was passed from my grandfather
to my father,

227
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,510
and then to me.

228
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,170
It's been three generations.

229
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,870
So that means

230
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,080
you know everything
about this town?

231
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,000
Of course.

232
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,320
I'd like to ask about something.

233
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,670
The residence across the street—

234
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,180
where did its owner go?

235
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,890
Why do you want to know?

236
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,840
We noticed the house is empty

237
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,640
and want to rent it to open an inn.

238
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,150
We'll be sure to support your business
when we do.

239
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,630
Sure.

240
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,230
The owner's surname is Xu.

241
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,490
He was originally the prefect of Dengzhou.

242
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,950
Due to political entanglements,

243
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,260
he was demoted and sent here.

244
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,490
After suffering for a few years,

245
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,820
he was reinstated
and returned to Dengzhou.

246
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,190
If you want to find him,

247
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,320
go to Dengzhou
and ask about Xu Residence.

248
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,490
Anyone will know.

249
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,270
Thank you.

250
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,280
Let's go to Dengzhou.

251
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,700
I seriously doubt your claim
that you've never left the palace

252
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,600
is true.

253
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,450
Why would I lie to you?

254
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,300
I have many more talents.

255
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:13,850
Let's go.

256
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,910
[Xu Residence]

257
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,480
Congratulations!

258
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:15,910
Thank you.

259
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,750
Congratulations!

260
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,810
Congratulations!

261
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,220
Please come in.

262
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:21,980
Please.

263
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,770
Please come in.

264
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,060
Congratulations!

265
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,720
Congratulations!

266
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,670
Thank you.

267
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,890
Please come in.

268
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,460
Congratulations!

269
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:30,700
Please come in.

270
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,550
[50 taels of gift cash]

271
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,000
How festive!

272
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,360
Congratulations!

273
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,150
Congratulations.

274
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,750
Thank you.

275
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,200
Uncle Fu!

276
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,150
Uncle Fu!

277
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,690
Is that really you?

278
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,200
I've finally found you.

279
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,440
Is Tai here?

280
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,030
My eyes aren't what they used to be.

281
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,200
May I ask your name, Sir?

282
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,620
I'm

283
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Jin Jr.

284
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,260
Take a good look at me.

285
00:15:59,440 --> 00:15:59,910
Jin Jr.

286
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,630
Jin...

287
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,240
Don't you...

288
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,440
remember me?

289
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,360
Uncle Fu,

290
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,510
I'm looking for Tai.

291
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,600
I've looked for him for three years.

292
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,330
Is he inside?

293
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,390
Sir, sir.

294
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,390
Please wait a moment.

295
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,200
Wu,

296
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,620
please look after him.

297
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,870
Sir.

298
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,030
Just a moment.

299
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,750
Young master,

300
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,300
there's a gentleman looking for you.

301
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,030
Who is it?

302
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,240
He knows my name

303
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,500
and claims to be an old friend of yours.

304
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,840
But I truly can't remember him.

305
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,580
This is the gentleman.

306
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,720
Tai.

307
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,510
Tai!

308
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,030
Tai!

309
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:47,460
[Tai]

310
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,920
I've finally found you.

311
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,000
I missed you so much.

312
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,360
I missed you.

313
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,600
Sir.

314
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,180
Have you

315
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,970
mistaken me for someone else?

316
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,109
It's me, Jin Jr.

317
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,310
Don't you recognize me?

318
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,440
We used to hang out together every day.

319
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,960
We ate candied chestnuts

320
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,270
and climbed trees together.

321
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,880
Once you fell from a tree

322
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,599
and were bedridden for days.

323
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
And another time,

324
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,550
you wanted us to run away from home,

325
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,640
saying no matter how far,

326
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,940
we would travel together.

327
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,240
Sir,

328
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,590
I don't know

329
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,480
how you learned about

330
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,340
these childhood stories of mine.

331
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,790
But my father was very strict.

332
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,480
I grew up alone in our household

333
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,710
and never attended any private school.

334
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,770
I had no playmates,

335
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,240
let alone old friends.

336
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,640
I...

337
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,630
[Xu Residence]

338
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,390
Today is my wedding day.

339
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,200
You're welcome to stay

340
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,510
and have a drink

341
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,590
to share in our joy.

342
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,600
Uncle Fu,

343
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,920
please attend to our guest.

344
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,350
Yes.

345
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,200
Sir.

346
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,200
Please stay for a drink.

347
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,930
Have a drink.

348
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,880
Now that they've met,

349
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,760
he's experienced
the cold selfishness of humans.

350
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,410
His obsession will dissolve

351
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,270
and he'll return.

352
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,170
You have so little faith in humans?

353
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,450
Why don't we make another bet?

354
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,880
You lost the last round

355
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,610
and haven't paid your debt yet.

356
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,790
I found the bride first.

357
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,510
At best it was a tie.

358
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,030
Fine.

359
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,520
Let's make another bet then.

360
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,570
This time, let's bet that

361
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,690
true feelings won't be betrayed.

362
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,310
What's the stake?

363
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,210
Same as before.

364
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,450
You're back.

365
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,640
Yes.

366
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,830
You saw him?

367
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,160
It's good you saw him.

368
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,880
At least your wish is fulfilled.

369
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,510
From now on,

370
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,570
come home with us and live a good life.

371
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,590
Let's go.

372
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,030
All that talk about brotherhood

373
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,310
was just empty words.

374
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,000
In humans' eyes,

375
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,110
I'm just

376
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,130
a pet to pass their boring time.

377
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,680
It's over.

378
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,550
Don't think about it anymore.

379
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,310
Let's go.

380
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:15,840
Let's go.

381
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,070
Come.

382
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,440
Careful.

383
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,580
You wanted us to run away from home,

384
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,780
saying no matter how far,

385
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,490
we would travel together.

386
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,830
Tonight,

387
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,710
we'll escape from this house together.

388
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,720
From now on,

389
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,490
no matter how far,

390
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,470
it'll just be us two brothers
traveling together.

391
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,780
What do you say?

392
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,070
Jin Jr...

393
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,160
Jin Jr.

394
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,680
Your parents, for your sake,

395
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,010
lived in constant fear,

396
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,510
hiding among humans for the past decade,

397
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,610
risking their lives at every moment.

398
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,120
If they hadn't protected you
with all their might,

399
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,270
you wouldn't have survived till today.

400
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,800
These years of protection—

401
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,140
doesn't that deserve a thank you from you?

402
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,870
Dad and Mom,

403
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,950
I've put you in a difficult position.

404
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,990
Thank you.

405
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,140
All right,

406
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,980
let's not be so formal.

407
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,970
It's only natural

408
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,590
that we protect you.

409
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,190
You have such loving parents.

410
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,680
You should treasure them.

411
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,760
From now on,

412
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,480
the Princess will also be well protected.

413
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,560
Protected by whom?

414
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,270
Who?

415
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,510
Where?

416
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,150
If I truly had someone to rely on,

417
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,030
I might become quite spoiled.

418
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,030
That person better not regret it later.

419
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,800
If I am to be your protector,

420
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,740
I can handle it,

421
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,200
and I will excel at it.

422
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,400
Jin Jr.!

423
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,310
Jin Jr.!

424
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,920
Jin Jr.!

425
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,070
Jin Jr.!

426
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,070
Jin Jr.!

427
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,930
Jin Jr.!

428
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,890
Jin Jr.!

429
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,760
Quick, follow the young master.

430
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,050
Wait up, young master.

431
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,130
I remember now!

432
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,790
I haven't forgotten you, Jin Jr.!

433
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,390
I've always remembered you!

434
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,950
Jin Jr.!

435
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,240
Thank you!

436
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,700
For accompanying me through my youth.

437
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,370
The day I went home,

438
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,380
I opened the cage to set you free.

439
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,220
No matter how I tried to shoo you away,

440
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,210
you refused to leave.

441
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,730
My father wouldn't let me bring you.

442
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,500
I had no choice but to fill your cage

443
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
with nuts and chestnuts.

444
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,370
I hoped that after finishing them,

445
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,290
you would venture out
to find food yourself.

446
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,070
But I never expected

447
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,780
that after all these years,

448
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,510
you'd still be searching for me.

449
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
Jin Jr.,

450
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,230
you will always be my best brother!

451
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,830
No matter how far,

452
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,700
I am willing

453
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,720
to travel with you!

454
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,230
No matter how far,

455
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,900
I will never forget you.

456
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,850
Their ending was decided long ago.

457
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,050
The human and demon realms

458
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,110
living in peace

459
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,530
is the best ending for them.

460
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,550
So who wins this round?

461
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,640
You win.

462
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,000
Tell me,

463
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,680
what do you want me to do?

464
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,070
I haven't decided yet.

465
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,720
I'll tell you when I figure it out.

466
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,580
Take your time.

467
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,240
Jin Jr.

468
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,540
Do you have any attachments left?

469
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,410
My wish has been fulfilled.

470
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,640
In this life,

471
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,890
I only wish to serve my parents.

472
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,980
If that's the case,

473
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,240
shall I take you to Demons' Valley?

474
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,170
Demons' Valley?

475
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,650
The legendary Demons' Valley?

476
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,480
Does such a place really exist?

477
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,520
You'll find out when you get there.

478
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,770
The mountains and lakes here

479
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,440
are all protected by barriers.

480
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,570
Humans aren't able to find this place.

481
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,550
Demons from all regions

482
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,610
have gathered here

483
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,440
and live in peace with each other.

484
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,960
You can find a quiet place

485
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,530
for your cultivation.

486
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,680
If you need anything,

487
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,280
come find me at Youning Cave.

488
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,850
Thank you, Demon King.

489
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,830
Let's go.

490
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,320
Ning'an.

491
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,470
A hundred years ago...

492
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,110
Except for those two bridges,

493
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,080
nothing changed here.

494
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,060
Your development is too slow.

495
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,190
You recognize them?

496
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,680
The Zhuyu herb.

497
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,720
You know quite a lot.

498
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,790
They are spirit herbs from Mount Zhaoyao

499
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,650
that have achieved cultivation.

500
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,920
These spirit herbs
have miraculous effects.

501
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,190
If humans eat them,

502
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,350
they can go without food for seven days.

503
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,960
That's why in human territories,

504
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,290
they've been eaten almost to extinction.

505
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,070
Fortunately, the Demon King was generous

506
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,030
and helped relocate them
to Demons' Valley,

507
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,570
allowing them to survive until today.

508
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,480
Am I right, My Lord?

509
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,190
How did you know all this?

510
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,130
From my dreams.

511
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,310
Tell me,

512
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,200
how many times have you dreamed about me?

513
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,720
Many times.

514
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,510
For a demon, the path of cultivation
is exceptionally difficult.

515
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,110
One must possess innate wisdom,

516
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,240
draw upon the essence
of heaven and earth,

517
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,240
follow the laws of nature's cycles,

518
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,810
and endure countless seasons and moons—

519
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,690
only then may one take human form.

520
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,530
Meanwhile,

521
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,390
they must also evade pursuit

522
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,440
from both humans and their own kind.

523
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,790
How do bamboos fare here?

524
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,250
Bamboos?

525
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,070
Yes.

526
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,310
Didn't you say

527
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,510
all things possess innate wisdom

528
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,220
and can achieve human form?

529
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,750
I have lived for thousands of years,

530
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,750
but have never seen a bamboo
successfully cultivate.

531
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,680
So you're the first

532
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,340
bamboo to achieve human form.

533
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,480
No wonder you're so proud.

534
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,750
Cultivation is difficult,

535
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,680
so I'll be generous

536
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,540
and not eat you.

537
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,030
Those three

538
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,160
were mythical beasts from ancient times.

539
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,310
They died in the war against humans.

540
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,310
To commemorate them,

541
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,120
the demons carved

542
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,970
their images on the mountain.

543
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,720
Teng She, Ao Hen, and Qiong Qi.

544
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,090
Is there anything else you haven't seen?

545
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,110
Yes,

546
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,240
quite a lot.

547
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,790
Take me to meet your demon subjects.

548
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,160
Bi Fang

549
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,850
is shaped like a crane
with a single foot;

550
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,350
it has a red-patterned teal body

551
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,880
-with a white beak.
-Through the water curtain

552
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,160
is the Demons' Valley Academy.

553
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,360
-It's called...
-It's called the Moon-Gazing Terrace.

554
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,550
Bi Fang.

555
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,160
Its call is its own name.

556
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,200
Who among you knows

557
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:47,070
what Bi Fang's true form is?

558
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,510
Xiao Yao,

559
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,360
you answer.

560
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,830
Wait, wait.

561
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,730
Sir, let me think.

562
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,540
It looks like a crane with one foot.

563
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,750
It looks like a crane with one foot!

564
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,070
And...

565
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,000
Wait a moment, wait a moment.

566
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,060
Delicious.

567
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,270
Wait, wait.

568
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,720
What's going on? I can't find it.

569
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,440
Dali!

570
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,880
Dali!

571
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:22,260
-Wait.
-Red-patterned teal body with white beak.

572
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,880
Red—

573
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,110
If there's a next time,

574
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,920
I will banish you
from Moon-Gazing Terrace.

575
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,150
Recite it 30 times together,

576
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,890
then I'll continue the lesson.

577
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,310
I used to hate the Master's nagging,

578
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,830
but after being away
from class for so long,

579
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,240
I actually miss it.

580
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,400
The academy in Demons' Valley

581
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,660
is quite different from those of humans.

582
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,980
Quickly raise the water curtain

583
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,580
and take me closer for a look.

584
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,000
Then stay behind me

585
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,490
and don't let them discover you're human.

586
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,220
I'm a little snake.

587
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,110
I just shed my skin.

588
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,200
His Lordship discovered me

589
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,370
and brought me back to Demons' Valley

590
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,960
to learn demon knowledge.

591
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,750
My Lord,

592
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,880
have you forgotten?

593
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,640
No.

594
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,160
Do you understand?

595
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,440
My Lord.

596
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,440
Greetings, My Lord.

597
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,080
This is the academy's teacher,

598
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,560
King of Eight Plates.

599
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,010
Hello, Sir.

600
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,110
I really want to hear your lessons again.

601
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,910
I promise I won't get distracted

602
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,360
or daydream anymore.

603
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,060
If you want to learn,

604
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,480
you can start anytime.

605
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,890
Having a student like you

606
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,310
makes me very pleased.

607
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,310
This is her first time
in Demons' Valley today.

608
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,840
I'll show her around first.

609
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,930
Please continue with your class.

610
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,860
Your coming to Demons' Valley

611
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,540
is as if you're returning home—

612
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,470
you're familiar with everything.

613
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,750
Where did this come from?

614
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,160
I weaved it for fun.

615
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,560
Xiao Ming.

616
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,760
Don't be rude.

617
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,030
Don't be afraid.

618
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,510
He's a little cat I adopted.

619
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,000
Okay.

620
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,040
Xiao Ming.

621
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,870
Let me ask her first.

622
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,000
Who are you?

623
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,880
She...

624
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,910
She wandered in the human realm
for many years

625
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,640
and I just happened to find her.

626
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,020
Are you a demon too?

627
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,210
I'm a little snake.

628
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,409
That's right.

629
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,560
Then where are your scales?

630
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,250
I shed them.

631
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,400
Shed?

632
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,760
Yeah.

633
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,070
Snakes eat mice.

634
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,560
Eat one to prove it to me.

635
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,480
Why should I?

636
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,400
That's not necessary.

637
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:21,920
But...

638
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,000
But...

639
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,260
But My Lord, her scent is strange.

640
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,800
What scent could she possibly have?

641
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,280
Are you always this rude?

642
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,800
When was I ever rude?

643
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
-My Lord.
-You're the one who's odd.

644
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,320
Do you see...

645
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:33,800
Back up.

646
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,710
Don't be afraid.

647
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,070
Come.

648
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,630
Okay.

649
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,120
This is where
I usually cultivate.

650
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,840
You can rest here for now.

651
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,400
Let me tell you something.

652
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,110
You'd better not make me angry.

653
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,000
My Lord.

654
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:55,790
Xiao Mu.

655
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,110
Why are you being so disrespectful today?

656
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,960
My Lord.

657
00:34:59,230 --> 00:34:59,670
I...

658
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:02,920
Xiao Mu.

659
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,370
Let me have a close look at her.

660
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,360
My Lord.

661
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,190
Xiao Mu is actually looking out
for your best interests.

662
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,190
You've been away from Demons' Valley
for so long.

663
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,110
Heiwu has been spreading rumors
about you everywhere,

664
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,550
saying your going to the human realm
to search for demon treasures

665
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,680
is just an excuse.

666
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,110
The truth is, you have
an intimate relationship with humans,

667
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,070
and that you keep showing goodwill
to humans.

668
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,210
It's been making everyone anxious.

669
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,630
We just hope

670
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,800
that you'll be more careful.

671
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,590
Don't give him any ammunition against you.

672
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,120
Huh?

673
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,890
Heiwu has been like that
since centuries ago?

674
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,150
-You know Heiwu?
-You know Heiwu?

675
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,150
He's a nightmare.

676
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,890
Never mind about nightmares.

677
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,230
Humans are hunting demons everywhere now.

678
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,110
Heiwu led some demons

679
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,480
and killed quite a few humans too.

680
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:52,940
Just now

681
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,710
he brought a pile of "trophies."

682
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,710
Now he's in front
of the elders at Youning Cave

683
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,920
seeking credit for his deeds.

684
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,070
Whenever he gets a chance,

685
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,530
he tries to discredit you.

686
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,840
What we mean is,

687
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,250
since you've returned, My Lord,

688
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,280
you should quickly go to Youning Cave
and show yourself

689
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,630
to prove your innocence.

690
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,840
Why didn't you say that earlier?

691
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,800
What do you mean?

692
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,360
-I've said so much—
-Forget it.

693
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,630
I happen to have important matters

694
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,110
to discuss with the elders.

695
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,670
I shall meet with Heiwu while I'm there.

696
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,030
Yes.

697
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,600
Wait for me here.

698
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,480
Don't wander off.

699
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,080
Not every demon
in Demons' Valley is friendly.

700
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:22,370
Xiao Ming.

701
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,260
Take good care of Ning'an.

702
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,250
Wait for my return.

703
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:27,920
Okay.

704
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,710
Don't worry, My Lord.

705
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,240
I'll keep a close eye on her.

706
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,880
I'll watch her.

707
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,320
I'll take care of her.

708
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,190
My Lord!

709
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,530
Don't worry, it's fine.

710
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,740
This is for you.

711
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,250
It's a welcome gift.

712
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:00,760
Hey!

713
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,630
Let me tell you.

714
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,630
Don't try to fool me with things

715
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,670
that only work on minor demons.

716
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,640
You're clearly cunning.

717
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,030
Acting all sweet in front of His Lordship.

718
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,560
I can see right through you.

719
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,900
You can be really annoying sometimes.

720
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,280
I...

721
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,920
But

722
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,380
you're also the most loyal

723
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,970
and devoted to His Lordship
among all demons.

724
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,440
So

725
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,200
I do like you a little bit.

726
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,230
Of course.

727
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,180
Let me tell you,

728
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,280
in the whole of Demons' Valley,

729
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,440
when it comes to loyalty to His Lordship,

730
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,760
I, Xiao Ming, rank first,

731
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,820
and Xiao Mu only dares to rank second.

732
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,150
If you don't believe me,

733
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,670
I'll let Xiao Mu come out and tell you.

734
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,480
No, no.

735
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,210
Don't fight.

736
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,360
I believe you.

737
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,400
Why do you share one body?

738
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,760
Which one of you is older

739
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,960
and which is younger?

740
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,350
I'm not quite sure about that either.

741
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,800
All I know is that

742
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,840
including us,

743
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,170
we were nine siblings.

744
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,000
We all cultivated together originally.

745
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,230
But by the end,

746
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,920
only Xiao Mu and I remained.

747
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,320
And before we achieved human form,

748
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,920
we went through
a major heavenly tribulation.

749
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,030
Xiao Mu lost his life protecting me.

750
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,590
I barely managed to catch Xiao Mu's soul

751
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,990
to share my body with him.

752
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,930
But as you know,

753
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,600
having two souls in one body

754
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,670
always causes power disturbances.

755
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,110
We nearly lost our lives.

756
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,280
Fortunately, His Lordship appeared in time

757
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,760
and brought us back to Demons' Valley.

758
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,580
He taught us methods of cultivation,

759
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,320
allowing us to stabilize our minds

760
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,320
up until today.

761
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,040
So ever since then,

762
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,440
Xiao Ming is Xiao Mu,

763
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,920
and Xiao Mu is Xiao Ming.

764
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,230
We are inseparable.

765
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,480
No wonder you're so loyal and devoted.

766
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,800
Of course.

767
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:55,610
Have a seat.

768
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,840
But there's one thing

769
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,180
I must admit.

770
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,490
The truth is,

771
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:05,000
Xiao Mu and I had very weak powers.

772
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:05,760
And

773
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:10,140
Xiao Mu can be quite sharp-tongued.

774
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,870
So many great demons

775
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,110
disliked us both

776
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,630
and bullied us constantly.

777
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,730
Only His Lordship

778
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,150
never abandoned us

779
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,150
and treated us with such favor.

780
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,440
So since then,

781
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,580
Xiao Mu and I decided

782
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,710
to cultivate day and night

783
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,520
to make our powers stronger,

784
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,510
even stronger.

785
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:28,550
Only this way

786
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,110
can we be helpful to His Lordship

787
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,440
and not bring him shame.

788
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,140
You are His Lordship's best companions.

789
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,520
One day,

790
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,630
when His Lordship faces hardships,

791
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,430
only you will protect him.

792
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,920
Are you serious?

793
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,760
It's His Lordship.

794
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,190
No one among demons
or humans is his match.

795
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,850
How could it possibly
be our turn to protect him?

796
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,080
That's right.

797
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,510
I hope that day never comes.

798
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,550
Duh.

799
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,360
Elders, you have to believe me.

800
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,360
This is exactly what Hong Ye is like.

801
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,470
My Lord has returned.

802
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,670
My Lord, who has been working tirelessly
for the demons,

803
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,930
has finally returned.

804
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,320
This time,

805
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,960
what sacred demon relic have you

806
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,920
brought back for us?
