[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,850
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,950
Go!

4
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,789
All leave!

5
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,550
You all never listen to me,

6
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,480
insisting on going to the West Coast
to get yourselves killed!

7
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,400
I said I would go for you,

8
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,600
but you didn't let me!

9
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,280
You insisted on bringing Wu Huan with you.

10
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,880
Fine then!

11
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,860
Let that traitor Wu Huan
betray you once more!

12
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,590
If you don't make it back,

13
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,570
I won't take care
of the Demons' Valley anymore!

14
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:28,890
Hong Ye.

15
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,110
Are you afraid?

16
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,120
No matter how hard it is,

17
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,810
with you by my side,

18
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,020
I'm not afraid.

19
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,340
What about you?

20
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,920
Same.

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,120
I am afraid.

22
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,790
There's a storm ahead.

23
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,290
Hold on to me.

24
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,350
Hold tight!

25
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,579
Don't be afraid.

26
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,970
I'm not afraid.

27
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,500
My Lord,

28
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,490
down there is the West Coast.

29
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,390
Let's go.

30
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,070
Don't go down yet.

31
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,360
The Treasure Swallower
guards the Treasury all day.

32
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,560
We'll wait until it's fast asleep,

33
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,220
then seize the chance to move.

34
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,610
Mm.

35
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,570
If you're tired, you can get some rest.

36
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,170
Honestly, I am a bit sleepy.

37
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,900
Wake up.

38
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,000
Judging from the sound,

39
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,310
it's a giant behemoth.

40
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,470
Following the sound,

41
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,940
we can find the entrance.

42
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,710
Wu Huan,

43
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,850
wait for us here.

44
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,400
If something goes wrong,

45
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,630
take Xiao Yao away first.

46
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:57,950
Mm.

47
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,220
Don't be so negative.

48
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,080
I mean, "if."

49
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,160
There's no "if."

50
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,090
Let's go.

51
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,210
Look!

52
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,800
I'll conjure up

53
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,860
as many as you want.

54
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:21,910
Let's hurry.

55
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,200
Oh, my goodness!

56
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,130
Let's go.

57
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,830
There are so many of them.

58
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,270
Where do we even start?

59
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,290
So many.

60
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,060
It doesn't seem to be here.

61
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,730
Let's look somewhere else.

62
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,960
There's more over there.

63
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,510
Come on. Let's go.

64
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,960
These stones do look like it,

65
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,870
but they don't seem
to be the spiritual stone.

66
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,530
Never mind.

67
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,910
Just take all the ones that look like it.

68
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,440
You check this side,
and I'll check that side.

69
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,550
Xiao Yao,

70
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,420
stop looking.

71
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,260
There's something.

72
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,850
What is it? Bring it here.

73
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,960
Don't shout.

74
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,220
I can't take it.

75
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,909
[Treasure Swallower]

76
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,190
No... Don't come over!

77
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,030
I just wanted to take a look.

78
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,630
I-I'll give them back to you.

79
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,910
Don't eat us!

80
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,510
Don't be afraid.

81
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,440
Wait a moment.

82
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,960
I...

83
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,420
Let me show you something.

84
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,200
This one.

85
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:11,810
I have more.

86
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,830
This tastes even better than that one.

87
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,670
Delicious!

88
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,030
I want more! More!

89
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,290
I have more! There's more!

90
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,240
Hurry!

91
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,160
It's so sweet.

92
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,360
These are your provisions
for the journey back.

93
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,830
Stop talking.

94
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,120
Why did you bring so little?

95
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,770
You two little things,

96
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,920
how dare you come to steal my treasures?

97
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,680
This is unforgivable!

98
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,840
Stop!

99
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,990
You've eaten our food,

100
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,440
and we've returned all your treasures.

101
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,900
If you have any problem,
come at me, the lord.

102
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,430
How dare you call yourself "lord"
in my presence?

103
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,950
Sir, he is Hong Ye,
the Monarch of All Demons.

104
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,120
Hong Ye?

105
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,790
Yes.

106
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,950
I've heard of him.

107
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,350
However,

108
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,380
I only care about treasures here,

109
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,200
not about lords or monarchs.

110
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,510
I just

111
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,910
caught a falcon outside.
A really nice one.

112
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,510
This Little Lord can stay

113
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,120
to tend to my bird

114
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,650
-and join me to have fun with it.
-How dare you!

115
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,670
You old jerk.

116
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,530
Little thing, you are so boring

117
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,810
and utterly dull.

118
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,380
I'll swallow you in one go!

119
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,030
No, no, sir!

120
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,240
H-He's not edible.

121
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,000
He stinks!

122
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,510
He stinks?

123
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,270
Mm!

124
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,570
I stink.

125
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,410
Worse than stinky tofu?

126
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,700
Yeah, worse than that.

127
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,900
No, please!

128
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,150
Please spare him!

129
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,960
We're not here to steal anything.

130
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,670
We

131
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,480
heard that you have
many interesting things here.

132
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:36,960
We...

133
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,510
We came to visit you and have fun.

134
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,270
Have fun?

135
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,030
Mm.

136
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,200
Wonderful! Great!

137
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,000
I-I love having fun.

138
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,710
Look.

139
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,270
I have so, so many treasures here,

140
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,930
but I don't know how to play with them.

141
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,840
Tell me quickly!

142
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,210
You can play with this one.

143
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,150
Watch carefully.

144
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,370
Nice! This is good!

145
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,120
-I want to play with it, too!
-Have a try.

146
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,760
Come on.

147
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,840
Let me do it.

148
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,630
He doesn't look like he would eat people.

149
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,140
We just need to humor him a bit.

150
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,670
Mm.

151
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,100
Oh, my...

152
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,580
What is this thing called?

153
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,320
This is called pitch-pot.

154
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,380
Based on how the arrows are thrown,

155
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,270
it's divided into

156
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:39,800
rim shot,

157
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,650
direct handle shot,

158
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,390
backside handle shot,

159
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,080
double shots,

160
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,840
and all-in.

161
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,320
Sir, try again.

162
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,000
You go

163
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,090
pick up all those arrows for me.

164
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,700
A real man knows when to bend
and when to stand firm.

165
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,840
I'll go.

166
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,670
Good boy.

167
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,400
Hurry up.

168
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,890
This is so much fun.

169
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,600
This is really fun.

170
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,380
How about this one?

171
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,790
Be gentle.

172
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,010
What about this?

173
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,640
B-Be gentle!

174
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,840
These are all treasures.

175
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,440
Legend has it

176
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,940
that the Treasure Swallower has been
collecting treasures since ancient times,

177
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,240
but I never expected them
to be such worthless junk.

178
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,910
Well...

179
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,420
You shouldn't say that.

180
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,940
These things are all precious treasures
of the human realm.

181
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,640
Yeah, yeah.

182
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,030
But they're only treasures
if they can be played with.

183
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,390
Then hurry and teach me

184
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,140
how to play with them.

185
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,120
Forgive me for being blunt,

186
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,630
but these things are way too old.

187
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,890
They're missing parts

188
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,670
and need to be repaired first.

189
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,240
Then fix them quickly.

190
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:35,870
You...

191
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,120
Oh...

192
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,000
Come and help!

193
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,480
He can't make it either.

194
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,240
Repairing these requires tools

195
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,840
that we can only buy outside.

196
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,350
That won't do.

197
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,300
You cannot leave.

198
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,000
You are now my greatest treasure.

199
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,480
Once you're in, you're never getting out.

200
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,210
You old jerk!

201
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,630
Don't push your luck.

202
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,360
Do you know who you're talking to?

203
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,150
Sir, sir!

204
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,500
Don't be mad. Calm down.

205
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Think about it.

206
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,480
If we don't go outside,

207
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,670
then you won't be able to play
with any of your treasures,

208
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,960
and they truly won't count
as treasures anymore.

209
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,720
Besides,

210
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,080
there are many more things outside,

211
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,220
even more than in this Treasury.

212
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,800
Don't you want them?

213
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:31,880
Girl,

214
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,460
is he your greatest treasure?

215
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,160
If he is,

216
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,560
I'll keep him here

217
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,670
while you go out buying things.

218
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,790
If he isn't,

219
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,680
I've disliked him for a while.

220
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,040
I'll treat him like stinky tofu

221
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,960
and swallow him in one go...

222
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,390
Yes!

223
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,130
He is.

224
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,180
What do you mean?

225
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,000
My treasure.

226
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,960
The restaurant
we dined in last time was quite good.

227
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,600
Yes, I'd like to go there again.

228
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,450
Today's...

229
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,060
What is that thing?

230
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,050
How weird.

231
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,480
The Treasure Swallower only
takes things in, never gives them back.

232
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,550
I've never heard

233
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,620
of anyone taking anything from him.

234
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,360
But it's His Lordship who will suffer,

235
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,330
having to be a hostage there.

236
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,900
It's okay.

237
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,630
Spending money is what I'm best at.

238
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,250
We just need to hurry up
and go back early.

239
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:57,810
Let's go.

240
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,500
I just can't understand

241
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,650
why that girl would
consider you a treasure.

242
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,720
Keeping you here

243
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,220
will really make her come back?

244
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,240
I hope she doesn't come back,

245
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,980
so she won't be coveted
by an old jerk like you.

246
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,910
So you like her, too?

247
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,270
"Too"?

248
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,240
You dare fight me for treasure?

249
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,630
You want to die?

250
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:54,450
You...

251
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,650
Want a fight?

252
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,160
Then tell me.

253
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,110
Do you have more gold and jewels
than I do,

254
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,120
or is your power greater than mine?

255
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,210
I don't need to compare myself with you.

256
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,370
If she's in danger,

257
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,090
I would sacrifice my life to protect her.

258
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:19,910
How touching.

259
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,280
It's so touching.

260
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,660
After all, you've lost your power,

261
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,020
so sacrificing your life is
all you can do.

262
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,790
However...

263
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,640
Have you told

264
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,860
all this to that girl clearly?

265
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,820
Would she be willing to accept it?

266
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,130
If I'm going to act,

267
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,640
why waste words?

268
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,060
S-So you haven't told her yet.

269
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,470
If you haven't said it, it doesn't count.

270
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,830
Nonsense.

271
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,350
I don't need to explain myself

272
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,750
to you, a Treasure Swallower
who only guards treasures.

273
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,830
I've lived for so long

274
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,160
that there's nothing I don't understand.

275
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,580
You know what?

276
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,400
That girl knows value

277
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,420
and understands what true treasure is.

278
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
Collecting treasures with me

279
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,830
and enjoying life
would be the best for her.

280
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,360
Dream on!

281
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,730
I don't allow you
to set your sights on Xiao Yao.

282
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,140
I hold sway over here.

283
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,690
She's already my treasure,

284
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,640
not for you to covet.

285
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,030
Not for you to covet.

286
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,310
Forget it! Forget it!

287
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,270
Screw you.

288
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,110
Try this.

289
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,030
This one.

290
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,830
This one. This one. And this one.

291
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,680
We'll take them all.

292
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,950
Thank you. Thank you.

293
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,510
Hurry.

294
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,750
We want all of them.

295
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,080
Okay.

296
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,820
Take a look.

297
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,920
Come take a look!

298
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,650
And one more.

299
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,810
This is really important.

300
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,410
Sir.

301
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,290
Yes.

302
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,060
We can't buy any more.

303
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,170
If we buy more, I won't be able to fly.

304
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,690
Let's go.

305
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,640
Xiao Yao,

306
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,660
you must be tired. Have a seat.

307
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,880
Old jerk.

308
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:14,390
You traded one nugget of gold
for all these treasures.

309
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,020
You're the real master here.

310
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,300
I should have let you take more gold.

311
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,760
That was enough.

312
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,880
All these vessels here are rare treasures,

313
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,220
but the food inside them is

314
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,500
the real source of power and spirit.

315
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,520
Without these delicious foods,

316
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,350
these plates would be useless.

317
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,360
Right.

318
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,200
Otherwise, they'd be useless like him,

319
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
a complete waste.

320
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,480
Just the smell is refreshing.

321
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,680
This eating...

322
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,530
Eat, eat, eat,

323
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,750
eat, eat, eat!

324
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,350
Eating, drinking, and playing

325
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,900
must be combined

326
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,880
to create maximum pleasure.

327
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,880
I'll listen to you.

328
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:01,560
Well,

329
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,790
then, tell me

330
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,840
how to combine them for maximum pleasure?

331
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,760
You're awesome!

332
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,600
Check this out.

333
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,720
How could this be?

334
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,680
Xiao Yao, teach me.

335
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,760
You're a real master!

336
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,220
He's cheating! Cheating!

337
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,320
Want to learn?

338
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,030
I'll teach you, sir.

339
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,190
Who allowed you to take food
from Xiao Yao?

340
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,220
Spit it out!

341
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,600
I won this fair and square.

342
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,200
Who allowed you to win?

343
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,820
Did Xiao Yao agree to this?

344
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,950
Disrespect toward Xiao Yao is

345
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,470
disrespect toward me!

346
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,960
After all,

347
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,230
you're still after Xiao Yao, aren't you?

348
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,640
It's you who covets my treasure.

349
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,610
From then on,

350
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,310
Master Ye no longer kept a cold face

351
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,750
and could laugh heartily.

352
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,600
Miss Yao also became a true heroine.

353
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,240
After that,
the two of them traveled together

354
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,030
through mountains and rivers,

355
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,290
enjoying their lives in the human realm.

356
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,080
That's so touching!

357
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,070
I've never heard

358
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,790
such a moving story before.

359
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,510
So that's how the arms and legs move!

360
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,840
Wonderful! Bravo!

361
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,130
This is so interesting!

362
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,380
So fascinating!

363
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,420
I want to learn this! I want to learn!

364
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,400
Well,

365
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,160
it requires finesse,

366
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,460
but your power is too strong.

367
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,500
If you break it,

368
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,930
I'll have to fix it again.

369
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,000
I have so many treasures

370
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,550
that have been sitting here for years.

371
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,510
If I don't take them out
to play with them,

372
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,640
won't they all become
useless waste in the end?

373
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,210
But...

374
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,760
Just teach me.

375
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,350
I...

376
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,170
I'm willing to trade other treasures
for it with you.

377
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,460
You can choose any treasure I have here.

378
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,340
I have so many treasures.

379
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,640
Isn't there

380
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,280
anything you want among them?

381
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
Think carefully.

382
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,880
I do want to ask you for a favor,

383
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,000
but I don't want to use this
as a bargaining chip.

384
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,100
Never mind.

385
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,110
I'll teach you

386
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,310
for free.

387
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,270
But whether you can learn it

388
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,750
depends on you.

389
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,470
Alright then.

390
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,480
You need to maintain its balance,

391
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,680
keep this side
facing yourself all the time,

392
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,720
apply force with your arm,

393
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,920
and don't let it fall.

394
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,980
I'm letting go now.

395
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,830
Good, good!

396
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,680
Well done!

397
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,270
Xiao Yao.

398
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,500
If you agree to trade with him,

399
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,530
it won't be as simple as teaching him.

400
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,100
He surely wants you to stay.

401
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,250
I don't want the Sky Stone anymore.

402
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,720
You should find a chance

403
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,090
to escape from this place quickly.

404
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,880
H-How did it get tangled?

405
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,140
You could untangle it.

406
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,070
No rush.

407
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,730
If he sees these things as treasures,

408
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,260
then he can't be a greedy person.

409
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,200
I want to give it a try
with sincerity first.

410
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,680
No.

411
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,360
I can't risk your safety no matter what.

412
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,960
What are you two talking about?

413
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,800
Nothing.

414
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,280
Just complimenting your skills.

415
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,110
Pick one.

416
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,920
One more!

417
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,590
Brilliant.

418
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,030
Impressive!

419
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,930
Let me try!

420
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,760
You need to go from here to here,

421
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,000
aiming at that bell,

422
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,860
drawing the bow steadily.

423
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,470
Three.

424
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,400
Two.

425
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,110
One.

426
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:34,830
Release!

427
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,890
Hong Ye, watch out!

428
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,800
No! Don't aim at people.

429
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,180
You need to aim at that bell.

430
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,310
Give it another try.

431
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,720
Should I close my left eye or right eye?

432
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,830
Either is fine.

433
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,160
Aim at the bell, okay?

434
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,110
One.

435
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:48,790
Two.

436
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,480
Three.

437
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,090
Good, not bad.

438
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,070
What's wrong?

439
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,970
Why is there a smell?

440
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,210
The smell of jealousy.

441
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,960
I know

442
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,350
My Lord has suffered
some grievances lately.

443
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,160
If this were back in the old days,
you would have

444
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,960
totally wrecked this Treasury.

445
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,640
But just because of this,

446
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,630
I admire you even more, My Lord.

447
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,450
You're enduring
what others cannot put up with.

448
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,550
On a personal level,

449
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,550
this is how a real man should behave.

450
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,020
On a greater scale,

451
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,770
you're concerned
about the lives of all demons,

452
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,920
using every last one of your faculties.

453
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,810
My Lord,
you know you carry the fate of demons.

454
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,750
Sure enough, you would do anything

455
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,150
to recover your power...

456
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,830
Who told you

457
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,290
that I would do anything
to recover my power?

458
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,740
If it means sacrificing you

459
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,910
and leaving you here forever
to entertain him,

460
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,240
I'd rather not
have this power back at all.

461
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,840
I want to protect you,

462
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,760
not just to keep you alive.

463
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,380
I don't want you

464
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,910
to be constrained by anything
or lose your freedom

465
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,910
because of me.

466
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,070
Xiao Yao,

467
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,190
he's so boring.

468
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,360
Why don't you

469
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,050
join me
and play with this luminous pearl instead?

470
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,000
Sir,

471
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,960
you have plenty of luminous pearls here.

472
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,160
How about
I show you something else to play with?

473
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,200
Nice! Okay!

474
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,610
Come on!

475
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,470
Run faster!

476
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,150
Faster! Faster!

477
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,390
It's flying!

478
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,860
Come on, faster.

479
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,920
Great! Amazing!

480
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,680
Not bad, old man!

481
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,200
Your eagle flies so high.

482
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:25,860
Take it.

483
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,920
I'm exhausted.

484
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:48,710
I

485
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,070
haven't seen

486
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,200
such beautiful scenery in a long time.

487
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,180
Since you like it so much,

488
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,250
are you going to take this beautiful view
to your Treasury as well?

489
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,930
You're such a quick-witted,
interesting girl.

490
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,880
However,

491
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,760
you have

492
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,200
a bright future ahead.

493
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,240
Hong Ye is just lucky to have you.

494
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,680
That guy

495
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,000
doesn't treat you well,

496
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,560
still putting on airs like some lord

497
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,270
and acting grumpy.

498
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,380
He may look grumpy,

499
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,080
but he's actually quite sweet.

500
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,600
He treats me very well.

501
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,650
Besides, you've already
taught him quite a few lessons.

502
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,240
Since you defend him so much,

503
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,550
I won't be too hard on him.

504
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,880
In this world,

505
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,820
there are comings and goings,

506
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,790
gatherings and partings.

507
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,320
It is my duty

508
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,560
to guard the West Coast.

509
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,420
I cannot leave,

510
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,010
but I shouldn't
keep you trapped here either.

511
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,160
That boy has lost all his power,

512
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,890
yet with no external injuries.

513
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,520
I guess

514
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,280
it was caused
by the Heart-Burning Incantation.

515
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,240
You came here looking for the Sky Stone

516
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,490
just in order

517
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:19,750
to find a way to remove
the Heart-Burning Incantation, right?

518
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,300
You knew it?

519
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,660
I thought you would

520
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,410
try to steal it

521
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,680
or fool me around

522
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,730
to make off with some treasures.

523
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,840
But unexpectedly,

524
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,670
I deliberately gave you
a chance to make requests,

525
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,190
hinted at it, and tried to inspire you,

526
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,560
yet you didn't say a word about it.

527
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,410
I

528
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,720
haven't had

529
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,680
such joyful days in a long time.

530
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,000
I really hate to see you go.

531
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,380
I wish I could keep you here longer.

532
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,500
Girl,

533
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,880
what are you doing?

534
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,910
Get up. Come on.

535
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,400
Sir.

536
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,090
I'm not trying to exploit your kindness.

537
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,250
But the Sky Stone really is

538
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,030
Hong Ye's last glimmer of hope.

539
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,000
I know you don't like Hong Ye,

540
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,040
but he did lose his power because of me.

541
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,640
He's also the one all demons look up to.

542
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,920
I, Xiao Yao, sincerely hope you

543
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,320
can lend us the Sky Stone.

544
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,510
I swear,

545
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,490
when his power is restored,

546
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,450
we will return the treasure to you.

547
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,680
Seems like

548
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,530
he truly is
the greatest treasure in your heart.

549
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:22,560
Thank...

550
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,489
I can't bear to see you go.

551
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,449
Don't worry, sir.

552
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,280
When we return this treasure,

553
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,080
we'll meet again.

554
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,630
You're the first one to take a treasure

555
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,290
from the Treasure Swallower.

556
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,650
Little Lord,

557
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,560
take good care of Xiao Yao.

558
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,380
-Otherwise, I...
-There's no "otherwise."

559
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,760
I will certainly treat her well.

560
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,140
I won't give you any chance to intervene.

561
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,480
I've asked him for you.

562
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,170
He said he'd risk his life to protect you.

563
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,210
It seems

564
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,060
that he truly cares for you.

565
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,860
Next time you visit,

566
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,290
remember to bring me your wedding candies.

567
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,920
Sir!

568
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,600
What are you talking about?

569
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,080
I'm not telling you.

570
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,660
Thank you, sir.

571
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,820
I'll take my leave now.

572
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,430
Get going now!

573
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,230
Or I might change my mind.

574
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,370
What did that old jerk say to you
at the end?

575
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,730
Take a guess.

576
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,670
Okay.

577
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,530
Give me a hint then.

578
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:23,920
Come here.

579
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,280
What?

580
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,490
Come closer.

581
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,800
There were still cries
from this furnace the other day.

582
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,730
But today, there's no sound at all.

583
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,010
Could it be that the pill is
already complete?

584
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,150
It's said that this time,

585
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,090
they're refining
a great demon from ancient times.

586
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,370
If the pill is successfully made,

587
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:27,230
it could ensure
His Majesty's health for 100 years.

588
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,250
I wonder what makes this pill
so different.

589
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,760
Can you see clearly?

590
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,590
It's all just flames.

591
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,100
Humans!

592
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,880
I will make you

593
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,560
suffer eternal damnation!

594
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,160
You good-for-nothings.

595
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,880
How incompetent.

596
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,170
Useless wretches!

597
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,240
You can't find the Yuli Spring,

598
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,480
and you let the captured demon escape.

599
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,940
What are you, the Feiyu Guards,
even good at?

600
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,760
Please punish us, Your Majesty.

601
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,550
Heed my decree.

602
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,590
All officers, heed the decree!

603
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:18,420
The Feiyu Guards must eliminate

604
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,940
all demon threats in Tiansheng Kingdom
within 1 month.

605
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,550
If after 1 month,

606
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,290
there are still demons causing trouble,

607
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,670
the Feiyu Guards will be disbanded,

608
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,490
and all of you...

609
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:34,390
I promise I will do my utmost

610
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,890
and not fail your command, Your Majesty.

611
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:38,630
Otherwise, you'll face

612
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,760
deaths by 1,000 cuts

613
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,880
and execution of your entire clans.

614
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,500
So back then, the Heavenly Mother
used the Heart-Burning Incantation

615
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,670
and activated an array to reverse time,

616
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,580
allowing herself to return
to the beginning of creation.

617
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,230
She needed to find her younger self

618
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,320
to retrieve her primordial spirit

619
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,980
in order to restore her power.

620
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,670
Did she succeed then?
