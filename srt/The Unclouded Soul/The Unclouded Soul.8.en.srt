[Episode 8]

3
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,130
Don't move.

4
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,560
Can I move now?

5
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,150
How much money would it take

6
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,600
to buy your smile?

7
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,800
To smile only for me?

8
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,530
I got it.

9
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,060
What filth is this?

10
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,640
What filthy thing is this?

11
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,010
What I need is

12
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,660
human blood.

13
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,150
I need virgin blood.

14
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,290
Go find it for me!

15
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,240
You!

16
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,580
Did you hear me?

17
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,980
The city gates are sealed now.

18
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,880
The Feiyu Guard
is keeping watch there every day.

19
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,870
Let me tell you.

20
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,990
If I weren't waiting for Yunyi to return,

21
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,140
I couldn't hold on anymore, you know?

22
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,760
Do you hear me?

23
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,190
Honey.

24
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,490
Our Qionghua Sect still needs me now.

25
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,430
We must eliminate evil spirits

26
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,680
and uphold justice,

27
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,280
have you forgotten all that?

28
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,160
Eliminate evil spirits...

29
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,630
Yeah.

30
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,860
Then what do I see before me?

31
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,659
[Yunlai Inn]

32
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,680
What are you thinking about?

33
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:41,870
Madam Jin?

34
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,190
Miss Xiao Yao,
I know I'm being presumptuous,

35
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,240
but I'm desperate about my daughter,

36
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,900
and I hope you can understand.

37
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,640
Could I ask you to guide me?

38
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,290
I want to find Yunyi and bring her back.

39
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,310
Please come in.

40
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,240
Sit.

41
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,840
All right.

42
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,600
Thank you.

43
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,840
Madam, you must still not trust me yet.

44
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
Please don't misunderstand, miss.

45
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,160
I've always trusted you.

46
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,070
It's just that

47
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,310
our Qionghua Sect

48
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,720
has many matters to attend to,

49
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,480
and we plan to leave Pingjiang soon.

50
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,410
Even though
Yunyi's eyes are being treated,

51
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,090
you can't wait any longer?

52
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,120
Yunyi has been blind since childhood.

53
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,000
Her father and I

54
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,950
sought famous doctors everywhere
to treat her,

55
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,280
but saw no improvement.

56
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,990
Perhaps it's not an illness,

57
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,680
but fate.

58
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,180
Madam, what happened here?

59
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,440
Perhaps it was the cat.

60
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,020
Yes, it was the cat.

61
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,670
You look haggard today.

62
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,780
Did you not rest well last night?

63
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,190
I heard that Qionghua Sect disciples

64
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,320
were patrolling with the Feiyu Guard,

65
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,190
and encountered a great demon last night,

66
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,120
disturbing you.

67
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,920
Last night,

68
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,610
there was nothing unusual.

69
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,750
Perhaps

70
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,159
I was too worried about my daughter
and didn't sleep well.

71
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,669
Indeed.

72
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,600
Without seeing Yunyi with your own eyes,

73
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,400
as her mother,
naturally you can't sleep soundly.

74
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,730
I might as well—

75
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,330
so I won't be accused
of being an accomplice.

76
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,910
I'll take you to see her later.

77
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,100
-Okay.
-But Madam,

78
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,550
I drank too much last night.

79
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,080
I need some time to prepare.

80
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,510
Why don't you go back and rest first?

81
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,630
In an hour,

82
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,720
let's meet at the entrance of the inn.

83
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,380
No problem.

84
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,150
It seems Flower Lady misses Yunyi too.

85
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,500
Look, she's so anxious she's scratching.

86
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,320
Stay here, miss. See you later.

87
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,920
All right.

88
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,710
Good morning.

89
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,690
I was just about to look for you.

90
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,220
What's wrong with you?

91
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,650
I'm smiling.

92
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,920
Why are you smiling?

93
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,230
How much money would it take

94
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,870
to buy your smile?

95
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,870
To smile only for me?

96
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,350
It's nothing.

97
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,280
What did you want to see me about?

98
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,410
The real culprit is likely to appear soon.

99
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,750
Li.

100
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,670
Li.

101
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,550
I think I can see you now,

102
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,320
but I still can't see you clearly.

103
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,610
With more time,

104
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,160
you'll see clearly.

105
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,130
Mm-hmm.

106
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,510
I'm not in a hurry.

107
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,580
I've waited so many years already.

108
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,510
Li,

109
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,870
when I can

110
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,120
finally see clearly,

111
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,680
will I be shocked?

112
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,350
Will Dad and Mom

113
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,370
be different from what I imagined?

114
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,970
But

115
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,800
you must be exactly

116
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,070
like what I've imagined—

117
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,330
incredibly handsome.

118
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,430
I'm very ugly.

119
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,240
You're so good to me.

120
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,990
Even if you're truly ugly,
it doesn't matter.

121
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,910
My disciples.

122
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,740
-Yes!
-Yes!

123
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,510
It's time again for us disciples
of Qionghua Sect

124
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,710
to eliminate evil for the people.

125
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,110
Miss Xiao Yao.

126
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,140
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,480
I originally thought

128
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,510
just the two of us

129
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,360
could quietly bring Yunyi back.

130
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,160
But unexpectedly,

131
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,040
my husband found out about it

132
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,180
and now it has become

133
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,120
this grand spectacle.

134
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,670
It's all right.

135
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,790
If Yunyi knew so many people
were going to get her,

136
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,120
she would be very happy.

137
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,020
We must eliminate all demons!

138
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,150
We are

139
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,050
duty-bound to do so!

140
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,870
-Yes!
-Yes!

141
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,910
Yunyi,

142
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,670
your parents are here to see you.

143
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,310
Yunyi, it's Mother!

144
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,660
If you hear my voice, please come out.

145
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,330
Lead the way.

146
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,410
I would like to kindly remind you

147
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,070
this fog can affect your mind.

148
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,610
If your willpower is weak,

149
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,140
you might even take your own life.

150
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,120
Sect Leader and I will go in first.

151
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,290
The rest of you wait here.

152
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,690
We'll call if we need you.

153
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,390
Master, Mistress, be careful!

154
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,850
Please lead the way, miss.

155
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,520
Miss Xiao Yao.

156
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,270
Miss Xiao Yao.

157
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:03,720
Muqing!

158
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,950
Why have you trapped my soul?

159
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,560
You demon...

160
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,240
You hypocritical murderer.

161
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,370
Give me back my life!

162
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,600
Why have you trapped my soul?

163
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,370
You demon.

164
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,000
You hypocritical murderer!

165
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,200
Give me back my life!

166
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,020
Why have you trapped my soul?

167
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,740
You demon!

168
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,690
You hypocritical murderer!

169
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,090
Give me back my life!

170
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,080
Give me back my life!

171
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,820
Murderer!

172
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,730
Give me back my life!

173
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,600
You hypocritical murderer!

174
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,760
Give me back my life!

175
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,030
Give me back my life!

176
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Give me back my life!

177
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,290
Give me back my life!

178
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,480
Give me back my life!

179
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,240
Give me back my life!

180
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,760
Murderer!

181
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,120
Give me back my life!

182
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,270
Give me back my life!

183
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,210
Impossible!

184
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,650
Impossible...

185
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,170
Impossible!

186
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,300
You're all already dead.

187
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,160
These are just my illusions!

188
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,000
Impossible!

189
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,190
Give me back my life!
Give me back my life!

190
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,360
Give my life back!

191
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,750
Return my life now!

192
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,050
Demon!

193
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,280
Your true colors are revealed.

194
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,960
You pose as a celestial cultivator,

195
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,590
yet blame all your evil deeds

196
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,870
on demons.

197
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,920
Today, I, a demon,

198
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,710
am ridding humans of a menace.

199
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,460
Wait!

200
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,810
Let's tie him up
and hand him over to the Feiyu Guard.

201
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,210
Must I follow human rules

202
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,830
when upholding justice?

203
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,310
Please show mercy!

204
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,240
Madam Jin?

205
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,910
He acts righteous by day,

206
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,320
but kills and drinks blood by night.

207
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,150
With such evil deeds,

208
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,410
you still protect him?

209
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,600
Muqing became like this

210
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,750
because of me.

211
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,360
When Muqing first joined Qionghua Sect,

212
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,090
his talent wasn't remarkable.

213
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,200
His cultivation

214
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,920
was rather slow too.

215
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,180
But among all disciples,

216
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,510
he was the most diligent

217
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,550
and kindest to me.

218
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,440
I had a heart condition since childhood.

219
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,970
He often practiced with me,

220
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,510
helped ease my pain,

221
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,400
and even transferred his energy to me.

222
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,850
Under his attentive care,

223
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,170
my health gradually improved.

224
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,500
My father saw his sincerity toward me

225
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,370
and gave me to him in marriage.

226
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,470
On our wedding night,

227
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,960
I finally learned the truth.

228
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,790
Hubby?

229
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,740
Hubby?

230
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,560
Honey, be quiet.

231
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,620
Don't be afraid. It's me.

232
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,680
Don't be scared!

233
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,150
Honey.

234
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,600
Don't come any closer!

235
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,120
Honey.

236
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,860
Stay back!

237
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:18,860
Don't be afraid.

238
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,910
Honey, don't scream.

239
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,420
Listen to me.

240
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,390
It's me.

241
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,670
Don't be afraid.

242
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,410
Don't be afraid.

243
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,080
I lost control of my cultivation

244
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,520
and my mind...

245
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,390
my mind went astray

246
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,910
to find a cure for you.

247
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,320
Believe me.

248
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,370
I never wanted to kill people
and drink blood.

249
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,980
Honey, I have a Soul-binding Spell.

250
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,590
I have a Soul-binding Spell!

251
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,750
You...

252
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,200
just stay there and talk.

253
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
All right.

254
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,140
Lower your voice.

255
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:50,960
Honey.

256
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,320
Once I use the Soul-binding Spell,

257
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,710
they won't find the bodies, Honey.

258
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,480
Trust me.

259
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Qionghua Sect

260
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,349
is an orthodox immortal sect

261
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,680
meant to eliminate evil spirits

262
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,260
and protect the people.

263
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,790
Look at what you've become.

264
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,550
How will you

265
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,480
reconcile with yourself in the future?

266
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,000
Are you suggesting

267
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,660
I should turn myself in to the authorities

268
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,160
or lose all my powers

269
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,030
and die in agony?

270
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,750
Honey.

271
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,360
I truly don't want to kill anyone.

272
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,900
I promise you,

273
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,030
unless absolutely necessary,

274
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,400
I won't kill

275
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,020
or drink blood!

276
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,070
Honey.

277
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,700
I truly wanted to save your life.

278
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,440
Rest assured,

279
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,590
I will help these souls find peace

280
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,850
and reenter the cycle of reincarnation.

281
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,590
Believe me.

282
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,330
I didn't mean to do it.

283
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,020
I didn't mean to do it.

284
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,040
I never meant for this to happen.

285
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,490
After that,

286
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,000
we traveled everywhere with our disciples.

287
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,640
We claimed to be hunting demons,

288
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,370
but in truth,

289
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,750
we were searching for the Yuli Spring.

290
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,510
I know my sins are grave.

291
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,080
I've thought
about ending my life with him.

292
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:26,880
But then

293
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,780
Yunyi came into our lives,

294
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,860
and I couldn't let go anymore.

295
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,510
Yunyi was born blind.

296
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,450
Isn't that a form of retribution?

297
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,750
But what fault is it of Yunyi's?

298
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,160
So all these years,

299
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,660
wherever we went,

300
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
I prayed at every temple.

301
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,050
I just wanted to pray...

302
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,490
pray...

303
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,730
for my sins to be lightened.

304
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,350
[Temple of Eternal Life]

305
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,720
I am burdened with sin.

306
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,830
I beg the Bodhisattva for forgiveness.

307
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,640
I vow to be vegetarian for life,

308
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,510
to guide and save others,

309
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,980
only asking to help the deceased
find peace

310
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,780
and receive their forgiveness.

311
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,870
May my daughter grow up safely

312
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,210
and not bear the burden
of her parents' sins.

313
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,310
Have you ever saved a man with a scar

314
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,540
in a Bodhisattva Temple
on Qingyuan Mountain?

315
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,040
I didn't save him.

316
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,920
He ate the offerings

317
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,050
and thus planted good karma.

318
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,920
A mountain elf that is
neither human nor demon

319
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,790
practices medicine to help others,

320
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,250
yet is despised by people.

321
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
The Sect Leader of Qionghua Sect

322
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,650
has gone astray in cultivation,

323
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,250
yet is revered by all.

324
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,210
That's what the human realm is like.

325
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,070
Go to sleep.

326
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,590
When you wake up,

327
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,430
your eyes will be able to see.

328
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,590
I can't fall asleep.

329
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,540
Why don't you tell me another story?

330
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,480
I only have a few stories

331
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,070
and I've told them all already.

332
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,040
I don't care.

333
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,620
Tell me another one.

334
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,410
You can make up a new one.

335
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,850
Once upon a time,

336
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,920
there was a butcher and a monk

337
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,200
who were good friends.

338
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,450
They woke each other up every morning.

339
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,900
But after they died,

340
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,200
the butcher went to heaven

341
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,360
while the monk went to hell.

342
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,380
Because the butcher
did good deeds every day

343
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,310
by waking the monk to chant sutras.

344
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,510
While the monk woke the butcher every day

345
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,440
only for him to take lives.

346
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,240
Master.

347
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,310
Master.

348
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,910
Have you found Junior?

349
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,510
Master.

350
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,510
Master!

351
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,960
Master!

352
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,100
Master!

353
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,200
It's over.

354
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,570
It has finally come.

355
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,370
I beg the Demon King not to interfere.

356
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,010
I will end this myself.

357
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,700
Leave my Qionghua Sect

358
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,950
with its last bit of dignity.

359
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Miss Xiao Yao.

360
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,630
In the future,

361
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,000
if you...

362
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,350
ever see Yunyi again,

363
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,350
please tell her

364
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,030
that her parents

365
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,720
died hunting demons.

366
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,550
I'm sorry

367
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,110
you were

368
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,440
wrongfully accused.

369
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,880
Please.

370
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,610
Don't worry, Madam.

371
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,760
Keep your voice down.

372
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,930
Yunyi is asleep.

373
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,920
We found the killer.

374
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,260
It was Yunyi's father,

375
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,310
Jin Muqing.

376
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,160
Yunyi's mother

377
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,310
once at

378
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,550
the Bodhisattva Temple
on Qingyuan Mountain

379
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,150
helped guide a fated person.

380
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,970
She guided many others too.

381
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,760
But she could never redeem
her husband's sins.

382
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,170
Your sins have been redeemed.

383
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,200
That was their own karma—

384
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,930
It was Jin Muqing's evil deeds.

385
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,190
Madam should never have had
to pay for them.

386
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,860
When Yunyi's eyes open again,

387
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,510
please give her

388
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,980
a clear world.

389
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,070
Don't let her see

390
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,090
the suffering of the human realm again.

391
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,470
Let him go.

392
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,900
He wants to protect the person
he cares about most.

393
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,680
Qionghua Sect
has betrayed its own principles

394
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,720
and harmed innocent people.

395
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,450
The truth has now come to light.

396
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,910
Surrender now!

397
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,620
Senior.

398
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,070
Senior.

399
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,270
Honey.

400
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,000
Tell them

401
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,920
I didn't kill anyone.

402
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,860
I'm innocent.

403
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,890
I didn't commit those murders.

404
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,720
I didn't kill anyone!

405
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,070
You didn't kill them.

406
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,220
Tell them quickly.

407
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,680
Quick...

408
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,680
I'm sorry.

409
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,750
I

410
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,500
am truly exhausted.

411
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,820
Senior, do you remember

412
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,580
when we got married,

413
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,390
we promised Father

414
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,730
to uphold justice for life

415
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,420
and restore our sect's glory?

416
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,400
I remember you once said

417
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,000
you wanted to find a place
with beautiful nature with me

418
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,530
where we could
live like immortals together.

419
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,170
Don't be afraid.

420
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,860
Our wish is about to come true.

421
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,510
Madam Jin!

422
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,610
Why?

423
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,900
Have you kept the promise

424
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,820
you made to me all these years?

425
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,610
I haven't harmed anyone since.

426
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,160
Very good.

427
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:04,880

Congratulations, My Lord,

467
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,350
for leading the Feiyu Guard
to eliminate this great demon.

468
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,880
The court will surely
reward you generously.

469
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,110
The Qionghua Master
was severely poisoned,

470
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,030
and both he and his wife have perished.

471
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,160
If there's a reward,

472
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,480
we should get the lion's share,
shouldn't we?

473
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,310
Yes, indeed.

474
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,340
You...

475
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,000
You Qionghua Sect members
are completely twisting the facts

476
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,110
and have no shame!

477
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,110
You're the ones
who forgo honor for profit.

478
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,070
The credit belongs to us Feiyu Guards.

479
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,670
Isn't that right, brothers?

480
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,630
Li?

481
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,160
Li?

482
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,290
Li?

483
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,270
This is what happens
when you don't cultivate properly.

484
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,000
You end up in human hands,

485
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,930
becoming nothing but a plaything.

486
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,910
I think it looks quite happy though.

487
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,510
Yes,

488
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,200
I think so too.

489
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,920
Master, I'd like to ask...

490
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,790
In this world,

491
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,590
there are many more girls like you

492
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,250
who need Li's healing.

493
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,080
If you miss him,

494
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,020
use the eyes he gave you

495
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,710
to see all things in this world.

496
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,110
He would surely be happy.

497
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,390
But we agreed to see it together.

498
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,030
How could he break his promise?

499
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,640
Because

500
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,240
he had a more important vow

501
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,600
to keep.

502
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,460
Can someone keep Flower Lady in check?

503
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,270
What are you doing,

504
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,000
hugging and biting me all over?

505
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,040
Coming.

506
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,750
She was quite obedient.

507
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,790
Obedient?

508
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,100
Let me tell you something.

509
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,880
When we cultivate...

510
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,280
What is this?

511
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,120
This is a fragment of the Kunlun Mirror.

512
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,310
When all eight pieces are gathered,

513
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,610
it will open the path
to Penglang Celestial Mountain

514
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,140
and lead to the Yuli Spring.

515
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,700
How did it end up here?

516
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,080
The fragments of the Kunlun Mirror

517
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,340
are formed from emotional attachments.

518
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,820
The eight pieces represent
life's eight sufferings.

519
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,620
This particular piece is called

520
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,530
"Lasting Resentment."

521
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,150
Birth, aging, sickness, death.

522
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,830
Separation from the beloved.

523
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,030
Lasting resentment.

524
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,660
Unfulfilled desires.

525
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,400
Inability to let go.

526
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,510
Mortals

527
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:10,010
always chase elusive immortality,

528
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,040
yet overlook the happiness
right before them.

529
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,320
Come in.

530
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,159
Why are you here?

531
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,900
This jade pendant,

532
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,730
take it with you.

533
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,780
Whenever you call,

534
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,400
I will surely appear.

535
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,070
Thank you.

536
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:06,850
But no need.

537
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,120
I've been through a lot recently

538
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,760
and my mind has become much clearer.

539
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
I've realized

540
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,820
that I must rely on myself

541
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,720
and not always depend on others.

542
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,000
Even if it's me?

543
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,810
Even you.

544
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,040
To others,

545
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,470
I am the Monarch of All Demons,

546
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,920
but to you,

547
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,590
I am just your Hong Ye,

548
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,500
your eternal support.

549
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,490
Before,

550
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,890
I was wrong.

551
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,350
Let's not mention the past anymore.

552
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,920
What I want is

553
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,800
to have at least the same level of magic

554
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,130
as Xiao Ming and Xiao Mu.

555
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,760
Though not as powerful as you—
the strongest in the world—

556
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,160
but when facing threats,

557
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,920
I could at least defend myself.

558
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,710
Strong enough to survive

559
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,070
Hei Wu and Bingzhu,

560
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,670
while protecting
Dali, Luoluo and the others.

561
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:20,960
Also,

562
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,230
I don't want

563
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,380
you to be in danger
because of me in the future.

564
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,130
I don't mind,

565
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:29,960
no matter how difficult it gets.

566
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,890
All right, I need to go to class now.

567
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,710
That's not right.

568
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,280
What's going on?

569
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,800
Let me do it.

570
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,510
You do it.

571
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,110
You didn't recite the incantation.

572
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:53,920
Didn't I?

573
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,630
Let's do it together. Let's charge at it.

574
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,430
Ready, begin.

575
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,660
Transform!

576
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,460
It's not working. Could it be the leaf?

577
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,360
This one looks like it.

578
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,030
Let's try this one.

579
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:04,550
No.

580
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,150
To have survived
the Demons' Valley disaster—

581
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,360
you owe your lives

582
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,280
to the protection

583
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,070
of countless ancestors.

584
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,360
The humans have retreated for now,

585
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,760
but if they attack again,

586
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,630
with your current power and skills,

587
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,830
will you be able to protect yourselves?

588
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,680
From today onwards,

589
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,270
classes in Demons' Valley will resume.

590
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,340
The assessments
will also become extremely rigorous.

591
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,200
Everyone must remember:

592
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,840
you must master lethal techniques,

593
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,460
and know sly tricks

594
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,480
as well.

595
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:48,590
He looks exactly like him!

596
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,960
Even the clothes are the same.

597
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,230
To subdue humans,

598
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,450
besides absolute power,

599
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,940
you must also manipulate their desires.

600
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,360
And human desires

601
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,630
are nothing but money,

602
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,760
power,

603
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,280
and appearances.

604
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,850
Humans are driven by their desires.

605
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,070
Humans

606
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,230
are nothing but slaves

607
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,230
to their desires.

608
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,440
It's fake.

609
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,730
If you want humans to obey,

610
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:29,090
just give them what they want.

611
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,840
The more they want,

612
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,960
the more willingly

613
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,450
they'll put their lives in your hands.

614
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,690
Don't be afraid.

615
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,430
Pair up.

616
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,330
Use the hair collected

617
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,150
during your human realm test for practice.

618
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:53,590
This is good.

619
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:56,430
Those who fail to transform today

620
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,810
will stay after class.

621
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,280
Detention again.

622
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,360
So annoying.

623
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:06,970
Actually,

624
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,860
humans don't live

625
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,190
solely for power, money,

626
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,180
and appearances.

627
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,790
For many humans,

628
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,320
these things are far less important
than family and friends.

629
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,940
Yeah.

630
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,320
If we want to understand humans,

631
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,780
we shouldn't generalize.

632
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,470
Actually, humans are like demons,

633
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,570
they also have emotions and love.

634
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,270
Emotions and love?

635
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,590
Those are just the most despicable means

636
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,720
humans use to disrupt our demon realm.

637
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,930
Among the humans we've met,

638
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,040
how many showed genuine feelings?

639
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:41,480
Right.

640
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,470
Is it the hypocritical Qionghua Sect,

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,530
or the Feiyu Guard
who plundered Demons' Valley?

642
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,440
Only enemies

643
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,900
can see their enemies' weaknesses clearly.

644
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,320
-Xiao Yao...
-Stop talking about this.

645
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,070
She has stayed
in the human realm for too long

646
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,930
and has been bewitched by humans.

647
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,000
She is punished to copy

648
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,880
the "Records of Despicable Human Tactics"
10 times after class

649
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,960
to wake herself up.

650
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,510
But...

651
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,480
Pair up.

652
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,750
Come get hair samples from me,

653
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,480
and start practicing immediately.

654
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,640
I'll go first.

655
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,030
Here I come.

656
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:28,710
Luoluo!

657
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,370
Your nose is completely gone.

658
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,710
My turn.

659
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,230
I look quite handsome, don't I?

660
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:47,900
Yes! You're still attractive as a man.

661
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,240
Poor.

662
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,030
Why?

663
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,590
I transformed quite well.

664
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,480
-Yeah.
-How can we be Poor?

665
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,940
-It was good.
-Next group.

666
00:40:59,360 --> 00:40:59,960
Let me try!

667
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,360
Wasn't it pretty good?

668
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,840
It was.

669
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,550
This didn't disappear.

670
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,950
Why did you get Poor then?

671
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,960
I couldn't speak.

672
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,190
The Prefect's daughter.

673
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,480
So this is what it feels like
to be fleshy.

674
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,340
I did it!

675
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,910
Tiger, you're so good.

676
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,380
Tiger's tail.

677
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,320
Very Poor.

678
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,190
Keep practicing.

679
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,290
Why didn't you hide yourself?

680
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,180
This kind of
Feiyu Guard isn't scary at all.

681
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,590
I'm dying of laughter.

682
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,320
Is it funny?

683
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,460
Yes, it is.

684
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,290
Transform.

685
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,470
Come on!

686
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,070
Looks exactly like him.

687
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:15,940
Amazing!
