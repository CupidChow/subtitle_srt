[The Unclouded Soul]

2
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,710
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,170
These clothes are so trashy.

4
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,120
I got hangnails.

5
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,640
What's all this stuff?

6
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,509
It's filthy.

7
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,790
The food is so awful.

8
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,350
Even my servants wouldn't eat this.

9
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,410
Exactly.

10
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,430
Wasn't our life in the celestial mountain
supposed to be enjoyable?

11
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,840
We became laborers instead.

12
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,640
We were promised eternal youth.

13
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,120
But my skin is visibly getting worse.

14
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,040
Are you still eating?

15
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,920
If not, I'll take it all.

16
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,840
Go ahead.

17
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,220
What do you think

18
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,960
the next trial is about?

19
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,079
The first one was already so difficult.

20
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,120
I heard it's about needlework.

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,710
It's to see whose clothes

22
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,190
can satisfy Dreamshard Immortal.

23
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,960
I heard it's a test of skills.

24
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,840
We have to master
etiquette, music, riding, and archery.

25
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,550
Oh, no.

26
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,590
I'm not proficient in any of these arts.

27
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,079
It doesn't matter
if you're not proficient in them.

28
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,410
Didn't the immortal say

29
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,630
that anyone who passed the first trial

30
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,590
could already stay in
the Realm of Mist and Void

31
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,390
and do chores?

32
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,400
What?

33
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,280
What?

34
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,800
I've come a long way to be here.

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,870
Instead of enjoying life at home,

36
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,470
I came here just to do chores?

37
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,280
Exactly.

38
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,900
How can I do chores?

39
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,560
It's dirty and exhausting.

40
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,430
I...

41
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,470
Whatever the second trial involves,

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,750
it demands both physical strength
and mental effort.

43
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,210
Make sure you're well-fed

44
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,280
and well-rested.

45
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,480
That's better than useless speculation.

46
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,310
Look.

47
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,240
It looks worse.

48
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,530
What's wrong?

49
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,680
The scar on Pianpian's face
is much more inflamed.

50
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,280
This is your doing, isn't it?

51
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,630
Don't talk nonsense.

52
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,079
That was the immortal dew
bestowed by Immortal Lord.

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,280
Even though it was bestowed
by Immortal Lord,

54
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,280
you must have added something to it.

55
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,720
Tell me. What did you add?

56
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,930
Don't tell anyone else.

57
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,280
Say it.

58
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,470
I just

59
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,460
added some oleander sap

60
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,240
and datura nectar.

61
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,890
The worst of her suffering

62
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,360
is yet to come.

63
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,000
Even if she's in agony,

64
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,570
she wouldn't dare ask Immortal Lord.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,930
She could only express gratitude.

66
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,570
What's wrong with you?

67
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,630
What happened to your face?

68
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,290
It looks like it was poisoned.

69
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,360
I'm fine.

70
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,190
If this wound isn't cleaned promptly,

71
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,790
the scar will become deeper.

72
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,560
What does it matter
if it's deep or shallow?

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,720
It's just an outer covering.

74
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,690
A woman should cherish her appearance.

75
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,500
Have you made up your mind?

76
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,140
Serve Immortal Lord.

77
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,920
Bearing the vengeance
for my family and country,

78
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,580
I slew demons for the human realm.

79
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,680
But now, I'm being asked

80
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,430
to help demons hurt humans.

81
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,150
How could I possibly agree?

82
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,980
There's no real difference, actually.

83
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,090
In the human realm, you slay demons

84
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,480
to earn the Emperor's favor

85
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,060
for promotion and titles.

86
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,600
Even with bad luck,

87
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,840
you could still rely on
the Feiyu Guard's name

88
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,680
to make life easier.

89
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,670
In the Realm of Mist and Void,

90
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,750
as long as you please Immortal Lord,

91
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,600
you can also earn favor.

92
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,070
If not,

93
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,680
you can just obey orders and survive.

94
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,920
As long as you avoid disobedience,

95
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,750
mistakes,

96
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,530
and affections,

97
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,330
you can still keep your miserable life.

98
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,010
Different positions,

99
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,580
but the same point.

100
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,310
But I slay demons

101
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,190
for righteousness

102
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
and the people.

103
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,180
All these years
in the Realm of Mist and Void,

104
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,170
the people I've seen

105
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,680
have been enough
to make me lose faith in human nature.

106
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,310
In the human realm, you must have faced

107
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,750
far more than I have.

108
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,510
How can you still be so naive?

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,870
Human nature

110
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,270
has its greed and depravity,

111
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,920
but there's also ultimate sacrifice.

112
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,130
I've seen both the utmost wickedness

113
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,680
and the purest kindness.

114
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,240
It seems

115
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,600
that you've been confined too long
in the Realm of Mist and Void.

116
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,650
If one day

117
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,250
you have the chance,

118
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,680
you should go out

119
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,200
and see the vast world.

120
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,289
You can't even save yourself,

121
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,990
yet you still worry about me?

122
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,510
This is Lu's wish.

123
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,130
From the moment I entered
the Realm of Mist and Void,

124
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,630
I never expected to leave alive.

125
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,640
I've told you all I needed to say to you.

126
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,110
I'll try my best to buy you more time.

127
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,740
But if Immortal Lord loses patience,

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,960
you and Tan'er

129
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,340
will have no chance of regret.

130
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,960
The wound on your face

131
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,910
looks more inflamed than it did last time.

132
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,800
Were you poisoned?

133
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,680
Take some petals

134
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,680
of roses and trumpet vines,

135
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,680
crush them, and apply them to the wound.

136
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,440
It'll reduce swelling and remove toxins.

137
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,680
I've seen

138
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
both types of flowers on the island.

139
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,150
Thank you.

140
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,380
I was just about to look for you.

141
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,180
This is for you.

142
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:10,980
This...

143
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,090
What's this?

144
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,720
It's ointment made from

145
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,670
5 types of flower petals.

146
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,440
It promotes blood circulation,
removes blood stasis

147
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,750
clears heat, and removes toxins.

148
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,950
Apply it to your face,

149
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,800
and your wound will heal faster.

150
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,720
Why are you

151
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,480
being so nice to me?

152
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,940
Although you're from
the Realm of Mist and Void,

153
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,100
I can see

154
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,160
that you still have a kind heart.

155
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,210
Besides, I picked these flowers here.

156
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,450
It's no bother at all.

157
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,930
No wonder Hong Ye cares for you so deeply.

158
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,990
You truly deserve it.

159
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,350
Hurry up and apply it.

160
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,640
These dishes again.

161
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,860
I'm so sick of it.

162
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,670
When is the second trial going to begin?

163
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,960
Yes.

164
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,510
It's like a knife hanging above our necks,

165
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,480
never falling,

166
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,070
yet terrifying enough
to scare us to death.

167
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,870
Dali.

168
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,750
In the second trial,

169
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,790
can I follow you?

170
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,590
I think you'll definitely pass.

171
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,280
Why do you think I'll definitely pass?

172
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,440
If only one of us

173
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,840
can pass,

174
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,270
it must be you.

175
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,510
Can I follow you?

176
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:43,320
Sure.

177
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,040
Xiao Yao.

178
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,840
If only one person

179
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,300
can pass the second trial,

180
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,240
that must be me.

181
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,390
Good luck.

182
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,620
Immortal Lord, I pray for your blessing.

183
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,120
If I can successfully pass the trial,

184
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,280
I'll devote myself completely,

185
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,200
being your most outstanding disciple.

186
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,000
Little Leaf.

187
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,000
In the second trial,

188
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,670
you must protect Xiao Yao.

189
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,560
Among thousands of flowers
in the flower sea,

190
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,160
why are you the most special one?

191
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,120
How do you have so much water?

192
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,080
When you were a human being,

193
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,680
you must have been a crybaby.

194
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,150
Xiao Yao.

195
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,240
The wound on your face looks much better.

196
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,630
Yes.

197
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,370
Thank you for your ointment.

198
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,110
I came to tell you

199
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,510
that the second trial
begins tomorrow at 9 p.m.

200
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,110
in the east courtyard
of the Biexin Courtyard.

201
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,340
The second trial

202
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,670
is full of mechanisms.

203
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,510
No one has ever passed it before.

204
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,270
Consider carefully
whether you want to participate.

205
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:35,870
Thank you.

206
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,920
What's that sound?

207
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,440
It's so creepy.

208
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,100
This place is called
the Courtyard of Summoned Mysteries.

209
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,030
It's normally closed to everyone.

210
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,270
Previously,

211
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,720
a woman

212
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,240
was betrayed by her companion

213
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,770
and died in this courtyard.

214
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,870
Because her resentment was so deep,

215
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,790
her vengeful spirit never dispersed.

216
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,630
This place

217
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,200
is like a stubborn miasma
of the Realm of Mist and Void.

218
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,240
Your trial

219
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,800
is to find a way to dispel
the vengeful spirit's resentment.

220
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,910
Once the trial begins,

221
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,630
the gate of the Courtyard of Mysteries
will only open again

222
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,790
when the vengeful spirit disperses.

223
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,550
If the resentment isn't dispelled,

224
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,610
will the door remain closed forever?

225
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,270
Not necessarily.

226
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,370
If you all die,

227
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,250
the gate will open as well.

228
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,480
-What should we do? Let's go home.
-It's okay. This wall isn't high.

229
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,080
At worst,

230
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,210
we can climb over it.

231
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,810
You can try.

232
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,630
You should think carefully.

233
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,390
If you give up now,

234
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,300
you can still be a kitchen maid
on the island.

235
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,380
However,

236
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,310
you won't have the honor
of serving Immortal Lord at her side.

237
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:00,790
This…

238
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,270
This…

239
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,990
If someone is late,

240
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,960
does it count as giving up?

241
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:16,560
I'll give you 30 minutes to consider.

242
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,240
Once the trial begins,

243
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,400
no one

244
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,750
will be able to enter or leave
the Courtyard of Mysteries.

245
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,200
She's stalling for time,

246
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,000
clearly waiting for Xiao Yao.

247
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:27,550
Dali.

248
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,680
I'd never left my chamber before.

249
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,960
I'm as weak as a kitten.

250
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,600
Can I follow you this time?

251
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,100
Dali.

252
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,720
This bracelet was bestowed on me
by the Empress.

253
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,320
It's the only one of its kind.

254
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,750
I'd like to give it to you

255
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,810
as a token of our sworn sisterhood.
Would you accept it?

256
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,610
If it doesn't fit, then forget it.

257
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,520
It fits well.

258
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,000
This bracelet suits you well.

259
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,510
Dali.

260
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,440
Dali.

261
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,030
Dali, you're so clever.

262
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,000
You'll definitely find a way.

263
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,720
Dali.

264
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,840
Exactly.

265
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,200
Then

266
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,550
you'll have to listen to me later.

267
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:58,880
Okay.

268
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,720
-Okay.
-Okay.

269
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,400
I'm not late, am I?

270
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,790
I thought you didn't want
to participate in the trial.

271
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,790
How could that be?

272
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,490
I believe in myself, my friends,

273
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,020
but not in fate.

274
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,170
Someone claimed that I would lose.

275
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,830
So I'm determined to prove her wrong.

276
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,340
It's time.

277
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,370
All of you are in the courtyard,

278
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,240
so you've all decided
to participate in the trial?

279
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,960
Very good.

280
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,070
Each of you has already
distinguished yourself among a hundred.

281
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,440
However, in this trial,

282
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,830
rewards will be given based on merit.

283
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,630
Only one with the greatest merit

284
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,650
will earn Immortal Lord's favor.

285
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,750
The trial begins now.

286
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,340
Before this candle burns out,

287
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,750
if you still can't
put the vengeful spirit to rest,

288
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,070
you'll remain here with her forever.

289
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,400
This...

290
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,030
This...

291
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,400
Take care, everyone.

292
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,440
The candle!

293
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,730
Hurry up. Come and protect the candle.

294
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,200
You cover this side.

295
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,900
Just guarding it like this
isn't a solution.

296
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,310
What do you want to do?

297
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,890
What are you doing?

298
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,960
Put it back.

299
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,750
If the candle goes out,
the task will also be count a failure.

300
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,270
Exactly.

301
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:06,790
Exactly.

302
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,850
You... Why are you taking the candle?

303
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,680
Put the candle down.

304
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,200
Or you'll get us all killed.

305
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,800
Come back!

306
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,560
Xiao Yao!

307
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,640
Come back!

308
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,880
Come back quickly!

309
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,790
Xiao Yao!

310
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,580
Hurry back!

311
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,860
Come back now!

312
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,000
The candle must not go out.

313
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,330
What is she trying to do?

314
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,200
What's she doing?

315
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,750
Xiao Yao!

316
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,350
Xiao Yao!

317
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:24,920
Xiao Yao!

318
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,520
There's clearly a door here.

319
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,540
What should we do, Dali?

320
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,520
Let's see what she's going to do.

321
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,920
What is she trying to do?

322
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,570
Right.

323
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,750
Xiao Yao, be careful!

324
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,220
It's so scary.

325
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,020
There's a door here. Come over.

326
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,000
There's a door. Look!

327
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,800
That's great!

328
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,670
Slow down.

329
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,560
Take it slow.

330
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,080
-Be careful.
-Watch your step.

331
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,110
Dali!

332
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,900
Dali. I'm scared.

333
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,590
Let's all hold hands.

334
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,860
Don't get separated.

335
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,240
Dali.

336
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,250
Dali.

337
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,000
What's wrong?

338
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,880
What's wrong, Dali?

339
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,540
Dali.

340
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,480
Dali.

341
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,270
All of you come in.

342
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,940
Let's go.

343
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,170
Have them hold hands.

344
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,920
Hold hands.

345
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
Give me your hand.

346
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,110
Be careful.

347
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,710
Slow down.

348
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,660
Easy.

349
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,330
Watch out for the steps.

350
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,090
There are steps.

351
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,440
Careful.

352
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,430
Stay closer.

353
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,680
Seems like the trap was set too easy.

354
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,500
It doesn't matter.

355
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,490
This is just the beginning.

356
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,880
Move.

357
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,030
Why aren't you moving?

358
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,030
I want to move.

359
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,120
But I can't!

360
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,080
Why are your hands so sweaty?

361
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,110
It's disgusting.

362
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,790
I'm sorry.

363
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,880
Hurry up.

364
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,510
Move quickly!

365
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,660
Come on!

366
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,590
Hurry!

367
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,490
Quick!

368
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,410
If you want to get out, shut up.

369
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,590
Girl, don't panic.

370
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,310
First, lean against the wall.

371
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,400
Take a deep breath.

372
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,930
Turn sideways and come slowly.

373
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,000
Go.

374
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:02,990
Come on.

375
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,000
Careful.

376
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,640
Slowly.

377
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,400
Watch out!

378
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,930
Be careful.

379
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,550
They're lit.

380
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,350
It's working!

381
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,960
They lit up!

382
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,690
It's bright!

383
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,930
It's bright!

384
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,760
Great!

385
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,620
Let's go.

386
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,960
Don't block the way.

387
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,550
I'm sorry.

388
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,370
You look unfamiliar.

389
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
What's your name?

390
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,750
My name is Huang Ying.

391
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,350
Such a vulgar name.

392
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,400
You must be from a humble family.

393
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,640
As a woman,

394
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,830
how did you let yourself get so fat?

395
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,350
You have no regard for your appearance.

396
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,790
What rank is your father?

397
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,090
Where does he serve?

398
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,480
My father is highly
favored by His Majesty,

399
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,800
but

400
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,550
I'm born of a concubine.

401
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,430
It was my mother...

402
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,110
My mother raised me all by herself.

403
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,770
No wonder you look so unsophisticated.

404
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,680
My father holds a second-rank position.

405
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,000
I've seen plenty of children like you—

406
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,310
born to lowborn women.

407
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,500
Your mother must be just a lowly servant.

408
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,400
Your mouth

409
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,110
is filthier than a latrine.

410
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,960
Say that again.

411
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,690
I'll say it again just the same.

412
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,960
You pride yourself on your noble birth,

413
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,880
yet your view
of the world is painfully narrow.

414
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,480
Every day you just flaunt
your family status

415
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,400
and throw your weight around.

416
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,590
In reality, you're just a parasite,
living off others.

417
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,480
You lowborn trash,

418
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,830
how dare you speak to me disrespectfully!

419
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,030
Just try to touch me.

420
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,110
I know demonic arts.

421
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,850
It's all your fault!

422
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,160
Your stupidity is holding everyone back.

423
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,840
Are you okay?

424
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,750
Why didn't you dodge?

425
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,660
I'm fine.

426
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,200
I'm used to it.

427
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,480
Hit back.

428
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,670
If Huang Ying hits back,

429
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,800
it would be one slap.

430
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,000
If I do it for her,

431
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,590
who knows how many hits it would be?

432
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,720
Which do you choose?

433
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,200
Do you want to hit back yourself

434
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,530
or should I do it for you?

435
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,630
I'm fine.

436
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,920
Really, I'm fine.

437
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,350
You don't need to stand up for me.

438
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,770
Apologize now.

439
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,580
I'm sorry.

440
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,500
What's that sound?

441
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,790
The cry

442
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,970
comes from this zither.

443
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,430
[Wu]

444
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,290
[Gong]

445
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,330
Everyone be careful!
Don't get hit by the light beams!

446
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,270
[Wu]

447
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,310
The Realm of Mist and Void

448
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,270
hasn't been this lively for a long time.

449
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,000
The way to solve this mechanism

450
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,160
is within this deadly formation.

451
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,810
If they remain agitated,

452
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,380
it will be hard to discover.

453
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,280
[Jue]

454
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,490
[Zhi]

455
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,000
Watch out!

456
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,770
Xiao Yao!

457
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,290
Help me, please!

458
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,710
Come on. Listen to me now.

459
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,790
Put your foot here.

460
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,060
You can place your hand here.

461
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,130
Give me that hand.

462
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:34,930
Duck your head.

463
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:35,790
Lean sideways.

464
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,740
One, two, three.

465
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:41,810
Good. Let's go.

466
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,500
This zither needs to drink blood.

467
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,970
How do you know that?

468
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
When the light beam
was absorbing blood just now,

469
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,800
strings appeared on the zither.

470
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,820
So this zither must be the key.

471
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,960
It needs to drink blood to be complete.

472
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,590
However,

473
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,660
the blood it absorbed earlier
was too little

474
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,440
to produce new strings.

475
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,450
Xiao Yao,

476
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,170
the two missing strings on the zither

477
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,480
must be found among these light beams.

478
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,030
I've been sickly since childhood

479
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,350
with a lack of energy and blood.

480
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,030
She who donates some

481
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,200
can have all my silver and gold.

482
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,850
What's the use of wealth when one's dead?

483
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,030
We must break this deadlock.

484
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,860
Since we all came here together,

485
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,290
why don't we each contribute some blood?

486
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,640
Sounds about right.

487
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,820
Who goes first?

488
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Let's go by
our fathers' or brothers' official ranks,

489
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,600
from lowest to highest,

490
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,640
starting with those
related to low-level officials.

491
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,540
What if the blood from the first few
is enough?

492
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,200
Then those who haven't donated

493
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
will profit without making an effort,
right?

494
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,890
The Immortal Lord will assess us
based on our merits.

495
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,550
Have you forgotten that rule?

496
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,250
But...

497
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,930
You go first!

498
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,670
My face!

499
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,470
I must've been disfigured!

500
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,510
No, it's not true.

501
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,940
Your face is fine.

502
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,710
Are you even human?

503
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,920
Her brother rose to power

504
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,380
with my father's support.

505
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,930
Let's say her blood

506
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,440
is a token of gratitude.

507
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,880
More blood is needed.

508
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,410
You're next!

509
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,270
I'm not going!

510
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,000
But you must!

511
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:44,830
No!

512
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,410
Just go!

513
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,310
Enough!

514
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:46,910
Off you go!

515
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,920
This place is already haunted
by a vengeful spirit.

516
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,620
Don't you want a few more around?

517
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,680
We must figure out
how these mechanisms work,

518
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,920
or we'll all end up dead here.

519
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,450
That doesn't justify
taking a person's life!

520
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,410
Let's think of something else.

521
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,130
I don't want to die.

522
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,590
Dali, what should we do?

523
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,030
These light beams are coming the mirrors.

524
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,300
There must be something special
about these mirrors.

525
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,180
[Zhi]

526
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,530
[Jue]

527
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,340
Dali, please think of something!

528
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
What should we do?

529
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,500
I want to go home.

530
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,350
Gong.

531
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,070
Shang.

532
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,830
Jue.

533
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,590
Zhi.

534
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,110
Wu.

535
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:39,920
Wen.

536
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,200
Yu.

537
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,420
These 7 characters
are related to the guqin.

538
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,170
You're quite knowledgeable.

539
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,310
You bet I am.

540
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,090
Let me check it out.

541
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,720
Be careful, Xiao Yao.

542
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,550
Think of something!

543
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,160
What should we do?

544
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,750
Yeah, Dali.

545
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,960
It's so scary here.

546
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,060
[Gong]

547
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,170
Can someone

548
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,550
look at the characters on those mirrors?

549
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,580
Those mirrors?

550
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,240
I'll go!

551
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,440
Let's go.

552
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,650
Come help me.

553
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,310
Look.

554
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,160
It looks like the character "Shang,"
the second note of the Pentatonic scale.

555
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,550
The second one appears to be Jue,
the third note.

556
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,280
The one after that seems like Zhi,
the fifth note.

557
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,110
Indeed,

558
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,400
the mirror corresponds
to the seven zither strings:

559
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,000
Gong, Shang, Jue, Zhi, Yu, Wen, Wu...

560
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,750
[Gong]

561
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,350
Watch out!

562
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,480
What are you trying to do?

563
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,790
You'll get us all killed!

564
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,930
This mechanism is treacherous—

565
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,940
if you match mirrors
with the same character,

566
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,030
but with one of them flipped
to its other side,

567
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,350
it will shift

568
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,330
all the mirrors

569
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,930
and change the light beams.

570
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,480
Moving the mirrors requires two people
working together.

571
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,790
Now, who among you
is willing to step up,

572
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,510
turn that "Gong" mirror

573
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,610
to face my side,

574
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,340
and gamble with me on this?

575
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,720
This mechanism

576
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,740
can only be solved
only if everyone works together.

577
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,490
No matter how clever
and capable Xiao Yao is,

578
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,440
it's useless

579
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,700
if she's held back by them.

580
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,510
They've always been
suspicious and exclusive,

581
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,780
each lost in their own calculations—

582
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,230
scattered and divided.

583
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,090
No wonder they're trapped in this array.

584
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,000
I'll do it!

585
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,530
Xiao Yao,

586
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,880
if it hadn't been for you earlier,

587
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,280
I'd be dead already.

588
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,520
I'll take this gamble with you.

589
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:08,920
Be careful.

590
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,409
Xiao Yao.

591
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:26,590
[Gong]

592
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,110
[Gong]

593
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,520
[Gong]

594
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,900
It worked!

595
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,929
The light beams are gone.

596
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:46,880
Next one.

597
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,330
[Shang]

598
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,530
I can't reach it, Xiao Yao.

599
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,510
This…

600
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,510
Dali,

601
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,120
what should we do?

602
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:28,080
[Shang]

603
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,040
[Shang]

604
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:46,940
Great!

605
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,080
[Jue]

606
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:58,590
[Jue]

607
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,180
[Yu]

608
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,950
[Wen]

609
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,340
[Wu]

610
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,340
They cleared it this fast?

611
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,690
In previous trials,

612
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,710
71% couldn't get past this point.

613
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,110
Who said they cleared it?

614
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,630
If it were just the same old routine,

615
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,240
wouldn't that be boring?

616
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,220
We added some new twists—

617
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,320
just wait for what comes next.

618
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,440
All human hearts are scheming,

619
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,110
rife with deceit

620
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,000
and selfish gain—

621
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,960
who pities the souls
that died wronged?

622
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,820
They yearn to break their chains,

623
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,680
to find in a song's final note
their lasting peace.

624
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,680
She wants to hear a melody
that can soothe her resentment.

625
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,230
What's so hard about that?

626
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,230
I used to listen
to the birds sing every day—

627
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,090
I know plenty of lovely melodies.

628
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,880
But the zither strings
aren't all gathered yet—

629
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,070
how can we play anything good?

630
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,070
Wait!

631
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,920
Stop, Dali!

632
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,220
I can't stop!

633
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,500
Oh no,

634
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,360
the candles are about to go out!

635
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
Mind the candles!

636
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,770
Be careful!

637
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,360
Xiao Yao!

638
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,840
Watch out!

639
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,550
Look out!

640
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,110
Make Dali stop now!

641
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,710
It hurts!

642
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,440
Help her!

643
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,330
Slow down!

644
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,400
Are you okay?

645
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,990
Dali!

646
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Time to serve

647
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,590
the extra course.

648
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:55,840
Xiao Yao!

649
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,250
Xiao Yao!

650
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,650
Xiao Yao!

651
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,660
What do we do, Xiao Yao?

652
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,280
Dali!
