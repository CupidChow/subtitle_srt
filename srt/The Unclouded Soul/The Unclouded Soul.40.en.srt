[The Unclouded Soul]

2
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,870
[Episode 40]

3
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,280
Demon King,

4
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,200
our two duels

5
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:58,310
were both interrupted halfway.

6
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,350
This time,

7
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,910
no one will be able to stop us.

8
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,190
Those three strikes just now

9
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,910
were for Ao Hen,

10
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,800
Qiong Qi,

11
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,840
and Teng She.

12
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,450
Back in the Realm of Mist and Void,

13
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,760
if it weren't for you

14
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,800
and Xiao Yao,

15
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,800
Pianpian, Tan'er, and I

16
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,990
wouldn't have made it out alive.

17
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,970
Consider those three strikes

18
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,380
as repayment for that debt of gratitude.

19
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,120
Now that the debt is settled

20
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,230
and the mirror fragments are complete,

21
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,970
it's time for me to take everything back.

22
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,079
Dream on.

23
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,880
I'm alive again?

24
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,480
I've regained my physical form.

25
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,920
Bingzhu!

26
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,920
I'm Tan'er!

27
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,680
I'm Tan'er!

28
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,600
Bingzhu!

29
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,560
I'm Tan'er!

30
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,390
Bingzhu!

31
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,830
Bingzhu!

32
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,430
Stop fighting!

33
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Stop it, now!

34
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,870
Pianpian?

35
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,430
Pianpian!

36
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,360
Xiao Yao!

37
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:45,920
Xiao Yao.

38
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,159
I'm Tan'er.

39
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,830
I'm in Pianpian's body!

40
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,040
I really am Tan'er!

41
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,480
The demon-slaying blade!

42
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,940
The demon-slaying blade!

43
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,240
Xiao Yao,

44
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,270
we've got to make them stop fighting.

45
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,730
Let's stop them together.

46
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,070
Watch out behind you!

47
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,790
Who would've thought that
after the Immortal Lord and Tan'er

48
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,830
merged into one, you'd actually be
less formidable than before?

49
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,600
Trading you for the Kunlun Mirror

50
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,130
isn't too much to ask, is it?

51
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,430
Xiao Yao!

52
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,270
Xiao Yao.

53
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,800
Xiao Mu.

54
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,430
Xiao Mu!

55
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,190
Xiao Mu.

56
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,630
Xiao Mu!

57
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,390
You two, stop it now!

58
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,000
Stop fighting!

59
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,600
Bingzhu!

60
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,600
Please stop!

61
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,800
Stop fighting!

62
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,070
Xiao Yao?

63
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Pianpian?

64
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,030
Pianpian.

65
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,840
Xiao Yao.

66
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,440
Hong Ye.

67
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,670
Xiao Mu!

68
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,570
Don't move.

69
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,150
-Stay still!
-My Lord...

70
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,120
My Lord.

71
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,120
Please don't be sad, My Lord.

72
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,080
Even if I, Xiao Mu, am gone,

73
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,910
Xiao Ming will still be by your side.

74
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,440
Xiao Ming,

75
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,720
we've only got one life left.

76
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,320
Use it wisely, will you?

77
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,150
Xiao Mu!

78
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,450
Don't move.

79
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,120
My Lord.

80
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,510
Xiao Ming

81
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,480
is in your care now.

82
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,500
You'll be alright.

83
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,270
Xiao Mu!

84
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,150
Xiao Mu?

85
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,480
Xiao Mu.

86
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,960
My Lord,

87
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,600
Xiao Mu is gone.

88
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,240
My Lord,

89
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,030
from now on,

90
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,630
it'll be just me, Xiao Ming,
staying by your side.

91
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,360
My Lord...

92
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,080
My Lord!

93
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,600
Pianpian.

94
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,200
What exactly...

95
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,150
I am Tan'er.

96
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:43,750
You...

97
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,350
Bingzhu, I really am Tan'er.

98
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,800
What are you talking about?

99
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,240
General.

100
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,700
I don't want fine clothes,

101
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,370
I don't want a house,

102
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,010
and I don't want a husband.

103
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,440
All I want is for you to become

104
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,500
that happy, carefree Bingzhu again.

105
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,400
Bingzhu,

106
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,270
with your martial skills,

107
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:07,870
after you join the army,

108
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,870
you'll surely become a great general.

109
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,910
Consider this money

110
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,120
a loan from me.

111
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,750
When you become a general,

112
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,550
you'd better pay me back double.

113
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,630
Once I become a general,

114
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
I'll buy you the finest clothes, Tan'er.

115
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,080
Mm!

116
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,810
We'll live in the finest house.

117
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,880
And when the time comes,

118
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,440
I'll also find you

119
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,970
the most virtuous husband.

120
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,390
Bingzhu.

121
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,630
I don't want a husband.

122
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,830
Having you is enough.

123
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:38,910
You...

124
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,390
So you're really Tan'er?

125
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,510
In truth, many times
when I do not leave my sheath,

126
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,310
it isn't entirely out of my will.

127
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
It's because you yourself also know

128
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,290
that the demon before us

129
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,120
is not truly wicked—

130
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,720
you just don't want to admit it.

131
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,000
Tan'er.

132
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,120
So what about Pianpian?

133
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,320
Where is she?

134
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,200
When I woke up,

135
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,080
I was already in Pianpian's body,

136
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
and my soul had been fully restored.

137
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,100
But I couldn't sense her presence at all.

138
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,270
My last wish

139
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,800
is for you and Tan'er

140
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,030
to be

141
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,960
reunited

142
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,620
as brother and sister.

143
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,720
I want

144
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,870
to see Tan'er one more time.

145
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,320
As long as I find the Yuli Spring,

146
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,000
everything will be alright.

147
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,790
Just wait for me.

148
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,080
I cannot...

149
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,510
Wait any longer...

150
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,320
Bingzhu.

151
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,750
It was Pianpian who saved me.

152
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,910
Bingzhu.

153
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,960
Let's go home.

154
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,040
Let's go home.

155
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,630
Tan'er...

156
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,360
Let's go home.

157
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,160
Let's go home.

158
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,480
Aging,

159
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,040
sickness,

160
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,200
and death

161
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,020
—the three mirror fragments,

162
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,750
as well as

163
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,860
the fate of both demons

164
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,550
and humans alike—

165
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,750
I'll leave it all to you.

166
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,120
In this life,

167
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,670
I will atone for my sins

168
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,120
in my own way.

169
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,030
Neither the wealth and splendor
of the human realm

170
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,690
nor the blissful immortality
of the Yuli Spring

171
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,560
has anything to do with us anymore.

172
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,040
I hope you'll keep your word.

173
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,600
Xiao Yao.

174
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,200

♪ Moon shifts stars, wind stirs

206
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,270
Join me.

207
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,440
It's been 10,000 years,

208
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,580
yet nothing has changed here.

209
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,930
I remember everything now.

210
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,920
Ten thousand years ago,

211
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,850
I lived one lifetime as a human prince.

212
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,320
Drifting on a boat at sea,

213
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,410
the noodles in that fishing village,

214
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,970
the bone flute you gave me,

215
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,000
and our wedding in the desert...

216
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,110
Xiao Yao,

217
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,510
I took advantage of you.

218
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,110
I'm sorry.

219
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,400
After 10,000 years,

220
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,980
the debt between us

221
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,190
has already been repaid.

222
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,070
You're too naive.

223
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,530
The Kunlun Mirror can never be destroyed.

224
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,750
Whether human or demon,

225
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,160
there's always desire—

226
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,240
coveting what's not meant to be theirs.

227
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,480
Desire stirs conflict in the world,

228
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,350
keeping it in perpetual turmoil.

229
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,720
A world ruled by desire

230
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,920
is easier to control.

231
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,490
The Yuli Spring is an ocean
where the deities gather desire,

232
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,020
and the Kunlun Mirror is the conduit
through which that desire flows.

233
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,820
Since it cannot be destroyed,

234
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,270
we can co-exist with it.

235
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,640
If I seal the Kunlun Mirror
within my body

236
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,110
and then seal myself away—

237
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,470
neither living nor dead,

238
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,170
never dispersing, never perishing—

239
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,480
the Yuli Spring will cease to exist
in this world.

240
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,060
You cannot.

241
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,030
All of this began because of me.

242
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,010
Now, it can only be repaid by me as well.

243
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,920
Hong Ye!

244
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,830

we're testing transformation techniques.

279
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,440
Those who fail

280
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,100
will have to stay after class.

281
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,850
Little Dragon Girl.

282
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,280
You go first.

283
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,440
Did you collect hair

284
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,100
from teachers and friends
you're familiar with

285
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,000
as I asked?

286
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,290
My bed collapsed again.

287
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,040
Betroth your second cousin to me
as my new bed.

288
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,880
Such impudence.

289
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,840
No respect for elders at all!

290
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But your imitation of that fool

291
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,460
was remarkably accurate.

292
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,590
Remember—

293
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,440
practice diligently,

294
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,960
and never grow arrogant or complacent.

295
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,310
Mm.

296
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,320
You may go.

297
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,640
Little Dragon Girl:

298
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,920
top grade.

299
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,310
Teacher,

300
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,920
you've eaten so much again.

301
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,520
Please tell us more stories.

302
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,350
Sure.

303
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,110
Where did I leave off last time?

304
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,400
-Last time...
-Last time,

305
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,160
you were telling us about
destroying the Qionghua Sect.

306
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,550
That's right.

307
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,030
Where?

308
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,160
-Destroying the Qionghua Sect.
-Yes.

309
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,920
Teacher, what's wrong?

310
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,590
Teacher?

311
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,880
Teacher?

312
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,750
What's wrong?

313
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:46,770
This...

314
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,000
Teacher

315
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,240
must have been reminded of

316
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,310
that tragic love story.

317
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,510
Let's not talk about it.
Let's skip this part.

318
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,480
The Realm of Mist and Void.
The Realm of Mist and Void instead.

319
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,000
Let's not talk about that.

320
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,310
You want to know about
the Realm of Mist and Void?

321
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,000
Yes.

322
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,860
That Realm of Mist and Void

323
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,200
is a small island in the sea

324
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,850
guarded by spirits.

325
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Normally, neither humans nor demons

326
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,030
can find the entrance to that realm.

327
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,420
It was only because of my good luck
that I,

328
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,280
along with Dali, the most beautiful
goddess of Demons' Valley,

329
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,000
obtained a painting together

330
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,800
and finally found the entrance.

331
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,750
Teacher, so who is Dali?

332
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:35,840
Teacher?

333
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,960
Teacher?

334
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,000
Teacher?

335
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,160
Let's focus on the Realm of Mist and Void.

336
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,240
Only the Realm of Mist and Void.

337
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
-Teacher.
-Teacher.

338
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,030
Let's not talk about that.

339
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,750
Let's focus on the Realm of Mist and Void.

340
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,480
Please stop crying, Teacher.

341
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,070
Teacher.

342
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,530
Just tell us about
the Realm of Mist and Void.

343
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,830
Teacher.

344
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,570
Where were we just now?

345
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,560
Xiao Ming.

346
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,310
Look.

347
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,520
While I was gone,

348
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,760
you let the Demons' Valley
turn into this mess.

349
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,680
The minor demons aren't focusing on
their cultivation

350
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,480
and only know how to play around.

351
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,510
The way Bamboo and Luoluo teach

352
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,030
is also terrible.

353
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,740
It's really unbearable to watch.

354
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,030
Enough!

355
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,350
Stop nagging.

356
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,270
What can I do about it?

357
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,550
Each generation of demons
has their own ideas.

358
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,480
Just let them be.

359
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
We can't just let things drift.

360
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,890
You need to supervise them properly.

361
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,530
The minor demons
who just achieved human form

362
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,190
only admire the prosperity of
the human realm.

363
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,930
Well, you're wrong about that.

364
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,550
The human realm today

365
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,550
is very different from the past.

366
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,000
It's not as dangerous as before.

367
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,440
Going there to gain some experience

368
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,700
wouldn't be a bad idea.

369
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,830
Going there to gain some experience

370
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,480
wouldn't be a bad idea...

371
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,590
Xiao Mu.

372
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,270
It's been so long,

373
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,350
yet I still haven't learned to speak

00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,340
I can't do that.

555
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,480
It's too dangerous.

556
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,080
Xiao Ming.

557
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,150
I found a special technique

558
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,320
in an ancient scroll

559
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,550
which, when combined with
the Time-Reversal Technique,

560
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,030
can take me back to any moment
in my memory.

561
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,030
I've practiced this technique
for three years,

562
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,030
and I've finally mastered it today.

563
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,230
So,

564
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,480
please help me one more time.

565
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,400
But...

566
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,060
Which moment do you want to go back to?

567
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,010
Xiao Yao.

568
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,360
I've prepared something for you.

569
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:46,920
Sorry.

570
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,790
I must've got the wrong room.

571
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,400
This seems to be my room.

572
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,700
I've prepared something for you.

573
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,570
Last night, you said

574
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,200
the bed was a bit hard.

575
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,550
Maybe it'll be better
if you lay these on it.

576
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,360
These are all negotiable.

577
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,440
Then I have another request.

578
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,630
Go ahead.

579
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,960
[Everything has started anew]
[Everything is only just beginning]
