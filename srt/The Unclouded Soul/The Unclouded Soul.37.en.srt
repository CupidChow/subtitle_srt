[The Unclouded Soul]

2
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,830
[Episode 37]

3
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,590
Qiong Qi Clan is actually

4
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,150
so weak and lame without the sun.

5
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,479
Check out on the inside.

6
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:11,870
It's an ambush!

7
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,400
Retreat!

8
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,530
I've waited so long for you.

9
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,200
These weapons

10
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,890
are mostly ordinary

11
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,800
and mixed with items stolen from

12
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,060
mountain demons and the Lightning Clan.

13
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,240
Based on these alone,

14
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,810
it's difficult to determine

15
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,410
the attackers' identities.

16
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,670
Why are you looking at me?

17
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,240
What?

18
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,690
Is that not allowed?

19
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,360
Ao Hen's very presence at this moment

20
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,150
proves he has nothing to do with this,

21
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,750
and that he's ready to help us
find the culprit.

22
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,370
That's right.

23
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,190
If the attack had been Ao Hen's doing,

24
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,850
he would've

25
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,590
either completely concealed himself,

26
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,079
or

27
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,590
shown his face instead of

28
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,630
bothering wearing this mask,
given his temperament.

29
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,840
By putting on this mask,

30
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,290
the culprit was basically doing this...

31
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,390
Hey!

32
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,740
Attention!

33
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,310
I'm definitely not Teng She!

34
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,240
I'm not Teng She.

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,840
You can't see me.

36
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,560
I'm invisible.

37
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,760
You just can't see me.

38
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
You can't see...

39
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,220
Why are you all defending him?

40
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,470
Because when your clan was attacked
yesterday,

41
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,040
the three of us were together.

42
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,190
Ao Hen never left.

43
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,240
What were you guys doing?

44
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,830
We were... drinking!

45
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,350
Slaughter has happened to every clan.

46
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,780
It's known to all demons.

47
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,120
If Ao Hen were innocent,

48
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,159
he should've come forward to explain.

49
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,990
Don't tell me

50
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,880
you never knew those atrocities!

51
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,950
I don't owe anyone any explanation

52
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,950
for whatever I do.

53
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,750
You...

54
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,800
Ao Hen was concentrating
on his cultivation previously,

55
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,950
so he really didn't know those incidents.

56
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,600
Thank you.

57
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,380
No worries.

58
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,850
How very polite of you guys.

59
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,560
I have some dragon bells here.

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,660
When one of them is rung,

61
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,900
all the others,

62
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,310
however far apart they are,

63
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,160
will sound and resonate promptly.

64
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,090
Should anyone encounter an enemy,

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,950
just ring the dragon bell,

66
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,720
and the rest of us will come help.

67
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,240
Agreed?

68
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,310
Agreed.

69
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,760
Agreed.

70
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,520
During our wedding,

71
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,400
we will need to

72
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,520
honor our ancestors

73
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,820
and bow to heaven and earth

74
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,620
while dressed in proper attire.

75
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,210
I invited you over today

76
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,930
so you could try on your wedding gown.

77
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,070
If there's any problem,

78
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,730
we'll have it altered in time.

79
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:40,740
Hong Ye!

80
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,560
I showed up uninvited.

81
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,810
Would you mind?

82
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,750
Of course not.

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,140
He insisted on tagging along

84
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,200
upon learning that I was coming here.

85
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,020
That said,

86
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,190
Long Yu did contribute significantly

87
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,680
to persuading all branches

88
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,740
of the Dragon Clan.

89
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,560
Then I owe

90
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,900
many thanks to Long Yu.

91
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,510
The Dragon Lord is delighted
just at the sight of you.

92
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,310
So I realized I must help the two of you
get married.

93
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,870
People don't seem afraid anymore

94
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,930
when they see me and Long Yu this time.

95
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,990
They've all thought it through.

96
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,270
Just like humans,

97
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,070
there are good and bad demons.

98
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,200
Go try on the dress.

99
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,659
We'll be waiting outside.

100
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,260
Sure.

101
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,430
Let's go.

102
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,830
Yes.

103
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,990
I was the architect of your romance.

104
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,040
How are you going to thank me?

105
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,180
This way, please.

106
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,620
Please try on the dress, Dragon Lord.

107
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,120
I've noticed that Xiao Yao looks

108
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,310
a bit unwell today.

109
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,130
Is she still bothered by the hunt

110
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:25,990
for Ao Hen Clan?

111
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,880
Ao Hen isn't the culprit.

112
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,610
Then who is?

113
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,950
It's not clear yet.

114
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,400
But don't worry.

115
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,000
Before your wedding,

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,860
the Dragon Lord will surely catch
the real culprit.

117
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,240
Your Majesty,

118
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,070
the Dragon Lord has put on the dress.

119
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,870
You may leave.

120
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll go take a look.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,430
Enjoy the feast.

122
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,750
Yes.

123
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,690
Why stare at me?

124
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,970
I just can't take my eyes off

125
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,850
the most beautiful bride in the world.

126
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,140
What did you do to Xiao Yao?

127
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,670
I only had the illusion beast

128
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,600
record her appearance and breath.

129
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,120
Whoever wears this wedding dress
in the future

130
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,100
will morph into the Dragon Lord.

131
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,750
After Xiao Yao marries me,

132
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,390
she'll protect humans with all her might.

133
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,990
I genuinely want to marry her

134
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,150
only for who she is

135
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,400
and nothing else.

136
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,630
We've already benefited

137
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,960
tremendously from her.

138
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,680
How can we despicably use her again?

139
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,480
Your Majesty,

140
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,910
I beg to disagree.

141
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,360
She is the Dragon Lord.

142
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,580
If she knows what we've done,

143
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,120
will she still marry you?

144
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,450
Will she let us gather
all the demon pearls?

145
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,400
That Water Dragon also said

146
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,200
before the wedding,

147
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,860
the Azure Dragon would definitely
end the current chaotic world.

148
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,880
Your Majesty,

149
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,030
we must act now,

150
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,080
or all our efforts will be in vain.

151
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,000
What's worse,
catastrophes will befall us humans.

152
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,150
But if we find Yuli Spring
before the wedding,

153
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,370
the world order will undergo
a fundamental change.

154
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,370
Then everything will be different.

155
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,540
If the human realm falls,

156
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,790
will Your Majesty still get a chance

157
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,680
to be on equal footing

158
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,660
with the Dragon Lord, let alone marry her?

159
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,500
Our only hope is pinned on
her wedding dress.

160
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,920
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

161
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,790
Xiao Yao?

162
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,480
You...

163
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,390
I can't believe you'd come meet me
on your own accord.

164
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,850
Aren't you happy about it?

165
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,800
Of course I'm happy.

166
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,170
It just seems...

167
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,740
that something's off.

168
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,200
Your dress...

169
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,480
I'm here to tell you something.

170
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,250
What is it?

171
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,600
I'm getting married.

172
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,630
You are?

173
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,510
On the day of the next new moon,

174
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,150
namely the first day of the eighth month
in human calendar,

175
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,120
I hope to see you

176
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,640
at my wedding

177
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,190
with the Primordial Pearl

178
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,370
and to receive your blessings.

179
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,770
Who's the groom?

180
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,460
Hong Ye, the human emperor.

181
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,280
Hong Ye?

182
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,780
You're serious about him?

183
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,300
He's a human,

184
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,480
and humans are the lowliest of creatures,

185
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,480
while you are an Azure Dragon.

186
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
-How can that inferior...
-Shut up!

187
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,790
Qiong Qi,

188
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,950
we've known each other since childhood.

189
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,860
In my heart,

190
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,870
I consider you my family.

191
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,030
I know

192
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,130
you care for me

193
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,120
and protect me

194
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,630
like an older brother.

195
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,140
Hong Ye and I are genuinely in love.

196
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,870
I understand

197
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,390
lots of demons will oppose
my union with him.

198
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,090
Qiong Qi Clan is highly revered.

199
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,450
I believe your presence

200
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,670
will subdue many voices of dissent.

201
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,630
But if even you don't come to support me,

202
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,730
then I'll be truly alone and helpless.

203
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,720
Fine.

204
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,360
Anyway, as a human, Hong Ye won't live

205
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,690
for more than 100 years.

206
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,750
I'll pretend

207
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,810
that you're just off on a trip,

208
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
and wait 100 years

209
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,590
till you make a new choice.

210
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,670
Then it's settled.

211
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,890
Remember

212
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,720
to attend my wedding with...

213
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,980
The Primordial Pearl.

214
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,390
I'll just take a peek.

215
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,760
Only one glance.

216
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,530
This is inappropriate.

217
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,490
Avert my eyes.

218
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,650
Avert my eyes.

219
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,210
Yao.

220
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,590
I...

221
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,540
I'm sorry.

222
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,050
I didn't mean to do that.

223
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,630
Actually...

224
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,000
I didn't see anything.

225
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,130
I was just wondering

226
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,480
if I could do anything

227
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,880
to ease the heavy burden
on your shoulders.

228
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,030
Please don't look at me that way.

229
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,830
I'm scared.

230
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,040
I was really just trying to help.

231
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,980
However,

232
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,760
what can you help me with?

233
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,370
Take it for your use.

234
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,150
Don't you only come to me

235
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,270
when you need to borrow the Mist Pearl?

236
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,550
Who are you looking for this time?

237
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,280
Is it Hong Ye?

238
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,120
Ao Hen?

239
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,890
Or...

240
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,080
Whoever is fine!

241
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,020
Use it then.

242
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,840
This time, I'm looking for nobody,

243
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,010
but you.

244
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,910
Me?

245
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,430
This has never happened before.

246
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,460
Just tell me

247
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,080
what you need me to do.

248
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,410
I promise to get it done.

249
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,830
I'd like to invite you

250
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,720
to my wedding in the human realm

251
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,380
on the day of the next new moon.

252
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,480
You're getting married so soon?

253
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,520
Didn't you say

254
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,750
you sincerely wished me

255
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,480
all the best and sheer joy?

256
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,360
Yes, I did.

257
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,790
As long as

258
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,070
Hong Ye treats you right,

259
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,010
I'll do as you say, Yao.

260
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,240
Hong Ye and I have been

261
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,630
through a lot to get to
the point of marriage.

262
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,960
The sacred relic of each clan

263
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,420
can offer protection and bestow blessings.

264
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,610
Would you bring the Mist Pearl

265
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,100
to my wedding
on behalf of all vine serpents,

266
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,440
so it can confer blessings upon me?

267
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,599
Sure.

268
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:09,790
I knew

269
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,599
you had my best interests at heart.

270
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,849
Then it's settled.

271
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,130
By the way,

272
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,520
would you please tell Ao Hen in my stead

273
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,089
that

274
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,550
he's also cordially invited to my wedding?

275
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,680
Ask him to bring along the sacred relic

276
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,760
of Ao Hen Clan,
if he still values my friendship with him.

277
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,750
On my wedding day,

278
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,550
I'd like to have a drink with him.

279
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,750
Got it.

280
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,590
I need to be somewhere else now.

281
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,250
Thank you for doing me a favor.

282
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,070
Don't forget the date

283
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,440
is the first day of the eighth month

284
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,500
in human calendar.

285
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,760
Both Qiong Qi

286
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,060
and Teng She

287
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,500
have agreed to bring

288
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,730
their pearls to my wedding.

289
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,110
I guess...

290
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,240
Ao Hen will come too.

291
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,350
Great.

292
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,070
We've already got the Earth Pearl
from the Mountain Demon Clan,

293
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,270
the Thunder Pearl from the Lightning Clan,

294
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,240
the Celestial Pearl from the Fox Clan,

295
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,550
and the Wind Calming Pearl from Bi Fang.

296
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,830
When we attain
Qiong Qi's Primordial Pearl,

297
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,030
Teng She's Mist Pearl,

298
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,830
and Ao Hen's Universe Pearl,

299
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,910
Your Majesty,

300
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,830
we'll need nothing more but—

301
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,050
the Dragon Essence Pearl.

302
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,870
Your Majesty,

303
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,850
our long quest of pearls
is finally coming to an end.

304
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:37,450
[Happiness]

305
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,620
Under no circumstances...

306
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,840
should any harm be caused to Xiao Yao.

307
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,230
Got it.

308
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,300
I was just wondering about
this familiar smell.

309
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,720
It turns out you're really around.

310
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,510
Given how much you enjoyed the food
last time,

311
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,370
I thought I'd bring you some more.

312
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,720
I'm beginning to understand

313
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,680
why the Dragon Lord

314
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,210
is determined to marry you.

315
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,070
You...

316
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,870
came from afar

317
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,680
not just to bring me food, right?

318
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,220
Do you need my help?

319
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,510
I can't stop thinking

320
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,600
that Xiao Yao must be making

321
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,690
a big sacrifice by marrying me,

322
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,590
though she never mentions it.

323
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,260
Maybe I can somewhat make up for it

324
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,560
with considerate gestures.

325
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,400
The Dragon Lord certainly deserves

326
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,270
the best and the most

327
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,670
thoughtful gifts of all.

328
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,920
You know what?

329
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,120
After getting married,

330
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,920
human women usually take

331
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,480
their husbands' last names.

332
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,250
But Xiao Yao will be an exception.

333
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,450
After she marries me,

334
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,450
I hope both demons and humans will still

335
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,480
respect her as the Dragon Lord,

336
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,160
instead of the human empress
bound by ties of affection.

337
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,090
That's for sure.

338
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,510
Therefore,

339
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,590
I'm planning to make her

340
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,920
a unique empress crown.

341
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,920
I intend to search worldwide

342
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,420
for treasures to craft

343
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,190
a piece of jewelry similar to
the precious Dragon Essence Pearl

344
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,920
and place it on top of the crown.

345
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,210
It will not only

346
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,110
demonstrate her eminence,

347
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,340
but also show

348
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,110
my sincerity to the dragon clan.

349
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,170
That's a good idea.

350
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,020
But no human

351
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,790
has ever seen

352
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,470
the Dragon Essence Pearl.

353
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,320
How's that a problem?

354
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,550
You can just ask the Dragon Lord

355
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,750
to show you the pearl.

356
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,720
But the crown won't be a surprise for her

357
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
if she knows about it so soon, right?

358
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,110
You're right.

359
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,160
How about

360
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,550
you sneak me into the Dragon Palace

361
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,680
for a peek at the Dragon Essence Pearl?

362
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,110
I'll just take one glance.

363
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,110
Then I'll be gone.

364
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,000
I swear not to cause you trouble.

365
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,740
I suppose I can do that.

366
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,200
Six chests of pearls.

367
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,590
Twelve bolts of fine silk.

368
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,790
Twenty-four boxes of garments
and twenty-four sets of jewelry.

369
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,960
Conduct a thorough check.

370
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,220
Yes.

371
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,680
Yes.

372
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,550
The coral doesn't look good enough.

373
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,510
Replace it with a better piece.

374
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:26,790
Yes.

375
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,240
Everyone, be careful.

376
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,790
No mistake is allowed

377
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,030
in such trivial preparation work
for the Dragon Lord's wedding.

378
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,720
Yes.

379
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,050
I need to keep a closer eye on everything.

380
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,510
Jade...

381
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,590
You'll undergo a tribulation soon.

382
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,750
Focus on your cultivation now.

383
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,610
You shouldn't be bothered

384
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,210
with these trivial matters.

385
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,070
I just feel obligated to make

386
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,350
everything perfect for you, Dragon Lord.

387
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,440
To me, perfection is

388
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,640
when you survive the tribulation
and attend my wedding

389
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,830
as a winged dragon.

390
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,870
Dragon Lord,

391
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,270
if I make it through the tribulation,

392
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,260
will you forgive me

393
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,070
for all my wrongdoing?

394
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,510
What kind of silly talk is that?

395
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,440
Do you think I'd really be mad at you

396
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,210
for our occasional bickering?

397
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,370
Am I that petty

398
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,620
in your eyes?

399
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,570
No.

400
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,140
I was overthinking it.

401
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,240
I've prepared something for you.

402
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:21,970
Come with me.

403
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,790
This golden armor has been altered

404
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,640
according to your measurements.

405
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,590
You should wear it

406
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,720
for your tribulation,

407
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,980
as it'll ease the pain.

408
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,050
No, I can't.

409
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,480
This is a one-of-a-kind suit of armor

410
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,510
exclusive to you, an Azure Dragon.

411
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,440
How can I wear it?

412
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,770
Why not?

413
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,320
I'm waiting for the day

414
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,960
when you become an Azure Dragon

415
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,620
and take over my responsibility
of protecting all living beings.

416
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,830
The Dragon Lord ordered

417
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,200
to bring more spirit herbs
and shells for humans.

418
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,580
Yes.

419
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,070
Yes.

420
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,270
Send the items to storage.

421
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:10,550
Yes.

422
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,090
Such premium luminous pearls.

423
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,640
Where are they from?

424
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,680
They're a tribute
from the Tiger Shark Clan

425
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,310
for the Dragon Lord's wedding.

426
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,650
Are they being sent to the Treasure House?

427
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,310
Exactly.

428
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:24,920
Let me do it for you.

429
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,880
Go attend to other things.

430
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,550
Hold them tight.

431
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,410
Don't drop any.

432
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,980
Sure thing. Off you go.

433
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,400
Come over!

434
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:43,500
Hold these.

435
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,170
Follow me.

436
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,170
Which is the Dragon Essence Pearl?

437
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,240
Right here.

438
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,700
Come on.

439
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,520
Over here.

440
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,710
This is...

441
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,880
The sacred relic of the dragon clan.

442
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,480
Only when it senses a dragon's breath

443
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,740
will it reveal itself.

444
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,090
Have you got a good look?

445
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,870
Yes, I have.

446
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,390
Great.

447
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,620
Then let's leave.

448
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:41,980
I'm sorry.

449
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,500
What did you just do?

450
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,860
Nothing.

451
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,940
Alright, let's go.

452
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,030
Wait.

453
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:58,920
Hurry up.

454
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,400
Go with me.

455
00:24:59,400 --> 00:24:59,980
Let's go.

456
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,200
Someone's trying to steal
the Dragon Essence Pearl.

457
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,020
How very bold.

458
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,260
They won't be able to leave alive.

459
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,470
All of you, exit the room.

460
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,050
Nothing is missing.

461
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,270
This is odd.

462
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,640
Dragon Lord,

463
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,960
Ao Hen and Teng She
are waiting in the hall.

464
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,480
Yao,

465
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,200
how is the Dragon Essence Pearl?

466
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,140
It's safe and intact.

467
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,610
Where is the thief?

468
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,750
Where is he?

469
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:56,750
Where?

470
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,520
Where is the thief?

471
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,170
The thief already ran away.

472
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,170
Has your dowry been prepared yet?

473
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,310
Yes.

474
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,910
Quite a lot of treasures indeed.

475
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,290
Could it be that your dowry

476
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,120
has become someone's target?

477
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
A false alarm though it was,

478
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,130
you've all been brought here by it.

479
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,460
Let me make this clear:

480
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,720
all of you

481
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,390
must attend my wedding.

482
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,380
Otherwise,

483
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,590
I won't be friends with you anymore.

484
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,650
If I were a better fighter than you,

485
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,990
I would definitely take you away
from your wedding.

486
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,160
Don't worry, Yao.

487
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,750
I...

488
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,600
will surely be there.

489
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,770
I'll also be there
with what you asked for.

490
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,570
All I ask is for you to have a good time
at my wedding.

491
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,430
Don't cause any trouble.

492
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,040
If you do consider me a friend and family,

493
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,080
then give me your blessings.

494
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,790
That was a close call.

495
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,440
Fortunately, they didn't spot us.

496
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,030
Thank you

497
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,870
for fulfilling my wish.

498
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,660
To return my favor,

499
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,400
just treat the Dragon Lord right.

500
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,260
I look forward to seeing

501
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,120
the empress crown

502
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,920
of you own making at the wedding.

503
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:22,960
Sure.

504
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,050
[Next day of the new moon]

505
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,690
[First day of the eighth month
in human calendar]

506
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,270
Teng She,

507
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,670
you're quite enthusiastic
about everything.

508
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,920
I would definitely attend Yao's wedding,

509
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,450
since I gave her my promise,

510
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,260
unlike a certain demon

511
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,630
who had no choice but to

512
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,830
show up in the end

513
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,440
after claiming he'd rather

514
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,590
be beaten to death by Yao

515
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,190
than let Hong Ye off the hook.

516
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,040
If you hadn't stood in my way,

517
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,110
Hong Ye wouldn't have lived
to see this day.

518
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,570
Fine.

519
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,260
Go catch him again now.

520
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,070
But don't act crazy

521
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,550
in front of me again when things blow up.

522
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,650
Teng She, shut up.

523
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,240
He wasted so much of my wine.

524
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,300
With me being here,

525
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,030
nobody will have the guts or the chance

526
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,830
to force Xiao Yao to do anything!

527
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,200
I just haven't criticized you, alright?

528
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,600
You are the one who always

529
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,480
pushes Yao into a fight with you.

530
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,200
What a shabby wedding.

531
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,510
If I had foreseen Xiao Yao had to make
such a big compromise,

532
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,550
I would've told her

533
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,200
my feelings for her a thousand years ago,

534
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,330
so as to spare her from such suffering.

535
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,800
You should be glad

536
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,200
that you didn't do it.

537
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,980
Otherwise, you would've lost her
a thousand years ago.

538
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,630
Who are you to comment on my matters?

539
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,920
Xiao Yao had nothing to do with you
in the first place.

540
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,960
You were just delusional

541
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,680
and pursuing her relentlessly.

542
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,400
You silly

543
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,680
simpleton.

544
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,330
The chances for two

545
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,880
to start a romance decrease with time.

546
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,160
You've been around Yao the longest,

547
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,880
which means you stand the least chance
of winning her over.

548
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,270
You have a death wish or what?

549
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:28,830
Enough!

550
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,430
Anyway,

551
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,720
Yao will be single again
in a hundred years.

552
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,310
Let's have a fair competition

553
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,970
for her a hundred years later.

554
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,550
May the best man win.

555
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,830
Agreed.

556
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,230
After cultivating for a thousand years,

557
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,630
I'm about to undergo another tribulation.

558
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,830
I pray to you, all dragon ancestors,
for the luck

559
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,310
to go through the tribulation

560
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,970
and to become a winged dragon.

561
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,790
May the heavens grant

562
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,880
Long Zhi

563
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,510
success in passing the tribulation

564
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,170
and becoming a winged dragon.

565
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,240
Grant her success
in passing the tribulation

566
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,900
and becoming a winged dragon.

567
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,000
How do you feel?

568
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,830
With the support of the seniors' spirits,

569
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,760
aren't you feeling energized now?

570
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,850
Don't be afraid.

571
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,720
We've prepared so long for this.

572
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,440
I'm sure you'll survive the tribulation.

573
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,080
I hope so.

574
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:20,170
[Happiness]

575
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,830
This is only a human wedding,

576
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,290
yet it looks like a ceremony
to worship gods.

577
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,000
You truly are my real friends.

578
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:40,950
I knew

579
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,260
you would all come.

580
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,230
We all...

581
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,930
want you to be happy, Yao.

582
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,720
In the future,

583
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,830
if Hong Ye ever upsets you,

584
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,170
I'll cut him into a million pieces.

585
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,570
Oh, right.

586
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,720
Where is Hong Ye?

587
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,250
How come he hasn't shown up?

588
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,110
Humans observe their own customs.

589
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,200
Women are respected, and men are honored.

590
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,700
The groom will not appear

591
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,640
until everything is ready.

592
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,260
Let me be clear.

593
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,740
I did promise you not to cause trouble,

594
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,510
but only provided

595
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,640
that Hong Ye wouldn't go out of bounds.

596
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,450
We're already here.

597
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,270
Let's all follow

598
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,840
the human customs today.

599
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,600
Let's go.

600
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,190
Come on.

601
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,400
Hong Ye and I are deeply grateful

602
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,700
to be graced

603
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,960
with your presence.

604
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,080
Please give us your blessings.

605
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,680
This is not demonic power at all.

606
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,840
Xiao Yao,

607
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,770
did you lay this ambush for us?

608
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,190
Did you plan for all this?

609
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,250
Did you also disguise

610
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,840
as Ao Hen to slaughter

611
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,090
other demon clans?

612
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,770
You told me

613
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,590
you would protect all living beings.

614
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,909
Is that how you do it?

615
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,630
Yao,

616
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,320
does a thousand years of companionship

617
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,120
really mean less
than the marriage to that human male?

618
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,920
Xiao Yao,

619
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,370
are you going to destroy all demons

620
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,130
just in order to marry a human?

621
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,960
The Dragon Essence Pearl
of the dragon clan,

622
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,000
formed by primordial dragon spirits,

623
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,060
possesses earth-shattering power.

624
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,280
The Universe Pearl of Ao Hen Clan

625
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,840
carries the power to overturn and reverse.

626
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,230
The Primordial Pearl of Qiong Qi Clan

627
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,159
has the power of primordial chaos.

628
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,840
The Mist Pearl of vine serpents

629
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,969
contains the power to track and trace.

630
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,150
The Earth Pearl of the Mountain Demon Clan

631
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:58,120
has the natural power to nurture lives.

632
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,880
The Thunder Pearl of the Lightning Clan

633
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,480
can release power of suppression.

634
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,150
The Wind Calming Pearl of Bi Fang Clan

635
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,360
possesses the power
to dissipate fog and haze.

636
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,960
The Celestial Pearl of the Fox Clan

637
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,630
consists of the power of yin and yang.

638
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,760
All the eight pearls are gathered now.

639
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,360
We humans' aspiration to gain strength
is manifested to heaven and earth.

640
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,190
Humans should not be exterminated.

641
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,070
We beseech you, deities, to reveal

642
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,330
the celestial mountain and Yuli Spring!

643
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,340
This...

644
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,230
What's going on?

645
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,030
It's an unusual phenomenon.

646
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,590
Why would this happen?

647
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,050
This...

648
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,070
This scene...

649
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,360
What caused this unusual phenomenon?

650
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,080
Yeah.

651
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,630
Something must be wrong.

652
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,370
This is bad.

653
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,520
Dragon Lord, watch out!

654
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,510
Dragon Lord, be careful!

655
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,070
Long Zhi!

656
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,590
Dragon Lord, don't bother.

657
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,920
I've failed to pass the tribulation.

658
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,400
No one can save me now.

659
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,480
With the protection of dragon ancestors,

660
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,340
you'll be fine.

661
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,920
I did too much evil.

662
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,290
The ancestors won't protect me anymore.

663
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,060
In fact, I already had a hunch long ago

664
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,820
that I couldn't overcome this tribulation.

665
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,680
I shouldn't have wasted
that golden armor of yours.

666
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,210
It's nothing compared to your life.

667
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,890
I only want you to be well.

668
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,670
Xiao Yao...

669
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,060
Actually, I've been

670
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,740
keeping a secret from you.

671
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,080
What is it?

672
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,580
I once slaughtered humans

673
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,730
in the name of Ao Hen.

674
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,690
As you finally transformed
into an Azure Dragon,

675
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,560
you fell deeply in love with a human.

676
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,500
I tried to dissuade you many times,

677
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,480
yet instead of taking my advice,

678
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,740
you became increasingly devoted to him.

679
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,210
It pained me to see you
persist in this mistake,

680
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,640
so I sneaked into the human clan

681
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,770
with an attempt to kill Hong Ye

682
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,230
in Ao Hen's name.

683
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,340
We humans have never had anything

684
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,170
to do with Ao Hen Clan.

685
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,210
How could you kill people

686
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,050
without cause?

687
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,190
Humans are lowly creatures.

688
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,720
No reason is needed
to exterminate your kind.

689
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,110
Father...

690
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,880
Long Zhi,

691
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,450
you...

692
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,010
I slaughtered the innocent

693
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,110
and thus lost heaven's blessing

694
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,110
and failed to pass the tribulation.

695
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,550
But I have no regrets.

696
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,030
Dragons are noble beings

697
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,030
that must never be dragged down by humans.

698
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,170
But humans won't remain weak forever.

699
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,570
Then it's all the more reason
to prevent them from using

700
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,030
an Azure Dragon's power
to find Yuli Spring.

701
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,110
Humans have long been oppressed by demons.

702
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,990
Should they achieve immortality,

703
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,360
they will definitely provoke conflicts.

704
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,620
Long Zhi.

705
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,230
Did you also slaughter

706
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,760
mountain demons
and those of the Lightning Clan

707
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,360
and the Fox Clan?

708
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,070
No.

709
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,930
I didn't do any of that.

710
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,070
Xiao Yao,

711
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,070
hate me all you want.

712
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,910
But you must remember one thing:

713
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,290
no tribulation can be harder to overcome

714
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,820
than the tribulation of love.

715
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,900
If you devote all your heart
to Hong Ye alone,

716
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,550
there will be a day

717
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,810
when dragons turn against you.

718
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,550
Long Zhi.

719
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,030
Long Zhi!

720
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,960
Long Zhi!
