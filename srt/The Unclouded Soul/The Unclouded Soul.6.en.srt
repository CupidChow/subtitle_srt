[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:37,600
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,680
Mr. Liu,

4
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,070
could you let us
make your two daughters as bait

5
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,039
to lure out the Demon King

6
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,200
and rid the people of this menace?

7
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,220
Absolutely not!

8
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,759
I...

9
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,920
The Feiyu Guard here,

10
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,050
so don't worry, sir.

11
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,150
We will make sure she's completely safe.

12
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,870
This great demon is way too rampant.

13
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,350
If we don't figure out a way to kill it,

14
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,840
-Xiao Yao, let's go.
-more people will die.

15
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,000
There's still no way!

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,680
These are my only 2 precious daughters.

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,789
I can't just watch them
go to their deaths!

18
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,350
How do you know your family won't be next?

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,690
My family will definitely not be next.

20
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,560
Tan'er wants to see you.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,470
Tan'er?

22
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,120
Any updates on the great demon?

23
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,920
Hong Ye wasn't the one behind it.

24
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,890
You heard it all?

25
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,790
How do you know it wasn't him?

26
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,230
I just know.

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
You saw him today?

28
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,110
Nope.

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,400
You did see him.

30
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,890
Tan'er, why didn't you summon me?

31
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,000
Sir,

32
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,710
she's that female swindler from before!

33
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,360
She stepped on and damaged the tiles
of my office in broad daylight.

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,680
This is illegal!

35
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,190
I came with good intentions to be bait
in place of your daughters

36
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,720
to lure out the great demon.

37
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,810
Okay, step wherever you like.

38
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,140
Tell our men to fall back a bit.

39
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,470
Yes.

40
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,240
This mist

41
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,329
doesn't seem quite right.

42
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,520
Xiao Yao!

43
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:52,850
Xiao Yao!

44
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,310
Xiao Yao!

45
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,860
Come back quickly!

46
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,560
You go find boats now to cross

47
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,600
the river and catch up with me.

48
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,260
-Yes.
-Yes.

49
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,070
Guys, take our time to look for boats.

50
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,890
No rush.

51
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,030
Hong Ye?

52
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,190
Xiao Yao?

53
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,000
Tan'er,

54
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,800
which direction is it exactly?

55
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,159
Lord Bingzhu!

56
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,030
Lord Bingzhu, this way!

57
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:45,750
Xiao Yao?

58
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,270
Come on!

59
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,670
There you are.

60
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,060
I have been waiting for you all this time,

61
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,520
waiting for you to find me.

62
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,830
You've been waiting for me?

63
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Ever since you left Demons' Valley,

64
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,180
I've been waiting for you,

65
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,700
waiting for your return

66
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,650
to my side.

67
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,600
Why are you suddenly telling me all this?

68
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,200
I don't know why,

69
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,030
but seeing you

70
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,530
always makes me feel so happy.

71
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,809
The moment we part,

72
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,179
I just can't wait to see you again.

73
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,130
What about you?

74
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,750
Do you feel the same way?

75
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,010
I don't know why I like you,

76
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,600
but I know

77
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,320
that with you around,

78
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,680
I can't see anyone else.

79
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,390
Xiao Yao,

80
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,940
from now on,

81
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,720
we'll be together.

82
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,490
I'll stay by your side,

83
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,000
cherish you,

84
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,540
watch the sun rise
and set with you every day,

85
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,670
and even reach for the stars
and the moon for you.

86
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,800
Would you like that?

87
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,520
I want to be with you forever.

88
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,150
But,

89
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,020
there's one final condition.

90
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,260
What condition?

91
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,560
You have to become a complete demon,

92
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,510
feed on human blood

93
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,740
to increase your power,

94
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,060
and never return to the mortal world.

95
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,530
Xiao Yao!

96
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
Brother!

97
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,780
Brother!

98
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,640
Save me, please!

99
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,500
Brother! It hurts so much!

100
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,720
Tan'er?

101
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,170
Did you really

102
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,600
kill those women?

103
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,830
No, I won't eat humans.

104
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,100
Absolutely not.

105
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,880
If you don't eat them,

106
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,250
you just can't become a pure demon.

107
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,170
You'll also have to die like those women

108
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,190
at the bottom of the lake.

109
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:30,960
No.

110
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,500
You're not Hong Ye!

111
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,600
You're not Hong Ye!

112
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,320
Who are you?

113
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,240
I am Hong Ye.

114
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,630
-Let go of me!
-Don't you recognize me?

115
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,010
You're not Hong Ye!

116
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,300
Bingzhu!

117
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,000
Help!

118
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,320
Bingzhu.

119
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,360
Hurry!

120
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,140
Save me!

121
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,030
It really hurts so much.

122
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,600
Bingzhu...

123
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,120
Help me.

124
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,200
Bingzhu!

125
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,010
Is that you?

126
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:06,960
Help me!

127
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,680
Tan'er?

128
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,920
Stop running.

129
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,450
You don't need to exhaust yourself
on the run anymore.

130
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,660
Anyway, you're never needed as a human.

131
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,810
Why not just turn into a demon

132
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,030
and return all your sufferings

133
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,930
to those who bullied you?

134
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,570
Xiao Yao?

135
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,830
Xiao Yao!

136
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,100
You should call me

137
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,600
Ning'an.

138
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,930
Why are you afraid to look at me?

139
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,320
Hong Ye,

140
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,470
you once said

141
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,710
that you would

142
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,990
die for me.

143
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,270
If you love me,

144
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,860
then give me your life.

145
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,700
Xiao Yao!

146
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,030
My Lord!

147
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,490
My Lord!

148
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,480
My Lord!

149
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,320
Are you real or an illusion?

150
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,170
My Lord! My Lord!

151
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:57,840
It's me,

152
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,430
Ji Yan.

153
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,550
If you're real,

154
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,090
then retreat.

155
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,780
Go back the way you came.

156
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,240
Pardon?

157
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,790
Retreat!

158
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:09,960
Yes.

159
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,200
Xiao Yao!

160
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,150
It's me.

161
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,230
Don't touch me!

162
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,500
Don't touch me!

163
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,510
Go away!

164
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,640
I'm the real Hong Ye.

165
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,080
-You summoned me with the jade pendant,
-Let go of me!

166
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,210
so I came to find you.

167
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,190
It's really me.

168
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,520
No matter what happened to you just now,

169
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,060
it was just a dream.

170
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,890
It's over now.

171
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,840
You're Hong Ye for real?

172
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,390
You are

173
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,200
the real Hong Ye?

174
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,390
No.

175
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,360
I'm the old demon.

176
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,360
There, there.

177
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,030
Don't be afraid.

178
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,640
I thought I was going to...

179
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,980
It's okay.

180
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
It's all over now.

181
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,430
This outfit was a gift from you.

182
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,260
I can give you another one.

183
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,910
I have plenty of money anyway.

184
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,530
Money, money, money.

185
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,160
All you think about is money.

186
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,440
Money can't get you everything.

187
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,210
At least it can get me clothes.

188
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,720
Fine.

189
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,210
Buy whatever you want since you're rich.

190
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,109
You might as well
buy me several more outfits

191
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,109
for you mess up with your tears, huh?

192
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,400
This time, I really needed help
to save my life.

193
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,220
I didn't summon you for no reason.

194
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,520
I wasn't blaming you before.

195
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,580
Where are we?

196
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,400
It looks like an ordinary forest,

197
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,110
but somehow everything feels so weird.

198
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,740
This is the Misty Forest.

199
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,400
What you saw earlier were

200
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,330
all illusions created by the mist.

201
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,070
It can reflect the deepest desires

202
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,070
buried inside you

203
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,540
and manipulate your body and mind.

204
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,260
Xiao Yao,

205
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,930
from now on,

206
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,170
we'll be together.

207
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,640
I'll stay by your side,

208
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,760
cherish you,

209
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
watch the sun rise
and set with you every day,

210
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,700
and even reach for the stars
and the moon for you.

211
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,830
Would you like that?

212
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,940
What did you

213
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,160
see just now?

214
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,110
Nothing.

215
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,240
I saw nothing.

216
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,170
What about you? Did you see anything?

217
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,350
I...

218
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,840
I saw nothing but you
as soon as I entered here.

219
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,900
Well, then,

220
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,270
perhaps we should...

221
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,000
We should get out of here first.

222
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:43,830
Mm.

223
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,050
Stay behind me.

224
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,440
Did you see anyone else

225
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,790
besides me in this forest just now?

226
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,960
-No.
-Nope.

227
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,920
My Lord,

228
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,590
did we lose

229
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
that girl?

230
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,700
She must still be in this forest.

231
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,150
But this mist is so spooky

232
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,250
that it can manipulate one's mind.

233
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,810
We can't let our men take this risk again.

234
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:36,920
Yes.

235
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,370
Little kitty, why are you here alone?

236
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,100
Are you lost?

237
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,720
Flower Lady!

238
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,300
Flower Lady,

239
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,940
where did you go again?

240
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,440
I hear you.

241
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,610
Come on over.

242
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,890
Flower Lady!

243
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,400
Flower Lady.

244
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,350
You naughty thing,
I told you not to run around.

245
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,200
Stop meowing.

246
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:48,800
Li?

247
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,240
Why are you here?

248
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:51,990
I've found Flower Lady.

249
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,360
[Li]

250
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,260
Let's go back.

251
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,590
Let's go.

252
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,080
We made it out.

253
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,460
Let me take a rest.

254
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,750
We're finally out of there.

255
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,750
What a creepy place.

256
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,770
That girl just now

257
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,530
seems to be the Qionghua Sect's heiress.

258
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,270
It's all your fault.
I didn't even get to ask her properly

259
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,800
before you dragged me away.

260
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,920
This forest is so eerie that you are

261
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,350
lucky enough to have made it out.

262
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,310
Yet you're blaming me?

263
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,450
You're a man.

264
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,030
In the human world,
even if women speak recklessly,

265
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,430
men shouldn't talk back.

266
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,200
Fine. I won't argue with you.

267
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,580
That masked one,

268
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,180
is he a human or a demon?

269
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,180
Why did you look

270
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,180
so alarmed?

271
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,730
I'm not quite sure either.

272
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,750
I could only sense

273
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,820
a very different aura around him.

274
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,440
He's not like a demon,

275
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,490
and even less like a human.

276
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,640
Neither human nor demon?

277
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,580
Isn't he basically the same as me?

278
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,240
By the way,

279
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,300
where are Luoluo and Dali?

280
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,230
In Pingjiang,

281
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,720
at the magistrate's office.

282
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,920
They've been caught?

283
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,320
Did you come here

284
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,720
because of them?

285
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,030
No.

286
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,530
Actually...

287
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,810
My feet fell asleep.

288
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,500
Six girls died in Pingjiang.

289
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,440
And the Qionghua Sect's heiress
has gone missing.

290
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,240
They all say you're the culprit.

291
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,550
I just want to prove to them

292
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,530
that you're not.

293
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,530
Come on,

294
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,330
go back to Demons' Valley with me for now.

295
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,370
Hold on.

296
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,010
What about the blade?
We haven't got it yet.

297
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,680
I had Xiao Mu mention stealing the blade

298
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,400
just in order to give you
a chance to leave.

299
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,930
Demons' Valley is safe now.

300
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,740
You can do anything as you wish.

301
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,090
What about Luoluo and Dali?

302
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,130
Don't worry.

303
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,260
After ensuring your safety,

304
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,390
I'll go pick them up.

305
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,390
Also...

306
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,830
What about the charges I brought upon you?

307
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,490
Demons' Valley has its rules.

308
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,370
We can't risk our people's lives

309
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,400
just because of Hei Wu's assertion.

310
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,000
My body has fully recovered,

311
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,410
with my power greatly boosted.

312
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,440
If they dare disturb the order again,

313
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,520
I will definitely banish them
from Demons' Valley.

314
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,120
By the way,

315
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,960
Bamboo is still young.

316
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,640
Don't take his behaviors personally.

317
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,500
When I return,

318
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,530
I'll make sure he treats you well.

319
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,410
Does this jade pendant

320
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,140
stop working in water?

321
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,320
No.

322
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,960
Then why didn't you come
when I almost drowned

323
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,890
last time?

324
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,500
You came?

325
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,270
You did come!

326
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,100
So you were the one who saved me
last time, right?

327
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,400
Mm.

328
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,770
That blade also attracted
the Feiyu Guards.

329
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,660
I didn't want to fight them
in the human realm.

330
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,590
Seeing you safe,

331
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,680
I just left first.

332
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,510
What about that time at the inn?

333
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,830
I summoned you in water at the inn, too.

334
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:34,720
Mm.

335
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,070
So that means you...

336
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,750
I didn't.

337
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,680
I saw nothing.

338
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,400
I just hid behind the screen.

339
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,880
I haven't even said what it was,

340
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,550
but you already know
what I'm talking about.

341
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,380
That means you did see me!

342
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,240
-I...
-You saw me!

343
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,550
Xiao Yao,

344
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,740
i-it was you who summoned me.

345
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,510
But...

346
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,280
But you did see me, didn't you?

347
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,160
Xiao Yao, I really didn't see anything.

348
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,890
I only saw you in the wooden tub.

349
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,370
No, I mean...

350
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,160
I-I didn't see the wooden tub.

351
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,480
I did see the wooden tub.

352
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,400
I just... I just didn't see you.

353
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,310
Then I totally freaked out

354
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,870
and hid inside the wooden tub...

355
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,470
I just hid behind the screen.

356
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,680
I really didn't see you.

357
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,540
I could only...

358
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,200
Not mad anymore?

359
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,630
Mm, not mad anymore.

360
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,080
Not anymore.

361
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,270
Stop!

362
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,200
Who allowed you to shoot?

363
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,060
There's still a human on the boat!

364
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,130
Xiao Yao!

365
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,660
You've already lured out Hong Ye,

366
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,480
proving that you're a human, not a demon.

367
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,680
Jump off the boat now!

368
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:05,960
My Lord,

369
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,030
give the order to shoot.

370
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,200
Forget about Xiao Yao now.

371
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,000
Lord Bingzhu,

372
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,920
Hong Ye is not the culprit.

373
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,960
It's someone else!

374
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,590
The Qionghua Sect Leader's daughter is
still alive.

375
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,750
I saw it with my own eyes.

376
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,960
Who else could pull that off
other than him?

377
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,480
Demons are always despicable.

378
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,920
Don't be threatened or bewitched by him!

379
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,680
Bewitched?

380
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,020
You say I'm the culprit.
Where's your evidence?

381
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,840
Shoot!

382
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,690
Another round!

383
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,380
Lord Bingzhu, you can't kill the innocent.

384
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,440
Hong Ye, tell him

385
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,750
that you didn't harm those girls.

386
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,590
Say it now!

387
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,840
I don't need to explain myself
to the Feiyu Guard.

388
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,650
I'll take that as a confession.

389
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,790
Let go of Xiao Yao

390
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,350
and fight me.

391
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,070
Okay.

392
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,210
Lord Bingzhu,

393
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,350
you keep saying he's the culprit.

394
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,750
Do you have any evidence?

395
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,410
What more evidence do we need?

396
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,880
The massacre in the imperial palace
a century ago

397
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,540
and Princess Ning'an's death

398
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,440
both involved him!

399
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,120
My past is

400
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,410
none of your business.

401
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,910
If you dare say one more word,

402
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,350
I'll make sure
you die the most terrible death!

403
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
Die!

404
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,110
Tan'er.

405
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,320
Tan'er!

406
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,850
Lord Bingzhu,

407
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,910
no matter how deep the enmity
between humans and demons runs,

408
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,360
if Hong Ye is not the culprit,

409
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,170
he should not bear this unjust blame.

410
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,720
I hope you can judge fairly

411
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,690
and hurry to find the real culprit.

412
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,130
The real culprit?

413
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,000
Very well.

414
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,790
When I get to the bottom of it,

415
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,100
I'll make sure you die fair and square.

416
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,000
My Lord, you used retreat to advance.

417
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,210
What a wise move.

418
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,080
Retreat.

419
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,760
Are you alright?

420
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,130
My Lord.

421
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,210
See if you want the memorial
to go like this.

422
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,400
"The Feiyu Guards surrounded

423
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,680
the great demon, Hong Ye, at the lake

424
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,140
and fought him for 4 hours.

425
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,100
Hong Ye was severely wounded.

426
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,640
Though he made a narrow escape,

427
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,510
he was already at death's door,

428
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,040
unable to harm anyone else.

429
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,370
The Feiyu Guards

430
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
have mobilized Zhou City's officials
to pursue with full force

431
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,450
and will eliminate the demon soon."

432
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,520
Do you want to bring
even more shame on us?

433
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,480
Commander Ji,

434
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,310
please tell our men to keep

435
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,210
what happened at the lake today

436
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,550
a secret.

437
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,060
Understood.

438
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,340
Give His Lordship some space.

439
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,240
Take a break, guys.

440
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,330
Tan'er,

441
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,880
what's wrong with you today?

442
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,470
Do you also believe

443
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,770
that Hong Ye is not truly an evil demon?

444
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,240
Princess Ning'an died because of you.

445
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,710
Is that true?

446
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:43,810
Xiao Yao,

447
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:46,600
don't ask.

448
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:55,070
I must look like her so much

449
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,460
so that you mistook me for her when you

450
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,810
saw me for the first time.

451
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,440
If I looked nothing like her,

452
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,710
would you still protect me like this?

453
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,310
You're not saying anything.

454
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,180
At first, I did mistake you for her,

455
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,530
but later I realized
you're not the same person.

456
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,140
Now,

457
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,440
no matter who you are,

458
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,080
I will...

459
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,910
There's no "before"
or "after" about my identity.

460
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,570
My name is Xiao Yao.

461
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,200
I've been called Xiao Yao my entire life,

462
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,350
not some "Ning'an."

463
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,550
I know you're only nice to me

464
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,700
because I look like Princess Ning'an.

465
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,690
I've accepted it to stay alive.

466
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,130
That's it.

467
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,880
I'm just curious

468
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,240
about what exactly happened
between you two.

469
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,150
Just asking.

470
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,130
Looks like

471
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,940
this is really not something
I can ask about.

472
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,970
Forget I said anything.

473
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,780
Just some bygones. There's

474
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,500
no need to bring them up again.

475
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,960
I suppose this jade pendant wasn't

476
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,510
meant to protect me, either.

477
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,160
In all my travels,

478
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,020
I never did anything I regretted.

479
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,100
But now, my greatest regret is

480
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,760
that I accidentally woke you up.

481
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,960
♪ Fear that the red thread that bound us,
the vows we engraved ♪

482
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,030

♪ The "forever" we swore are
meant to miss their mark ♪

484
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,460

Selfish!

495
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,770
Left without hesitation.

496
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,240
These are chaotic times indeed.

497
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,770
Demons have even infiltrated
the magistrate's office.

498
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,500
Exactly.

499
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,880
No wonder they've failed to catch any!

500
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,310
Yeah.

501
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,680
Aren't they deceiving and betraying us?

502
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,590
Let's go to the magistrate's office.

503
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:52,920
Let's go!

504
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,380
-Go take a look.
-Let's go.

505
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,780
Dali, Luoluo...

506
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,510
We've searched the entire city
with talismans only to find nothing.

507
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,510
So the demons were

508
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,480
hiding in the magistrate's office!

509
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,710
Can't believe

510
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,880
the dignified government office
harbored demons!

511
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,800
Were it not
for the Qionghua Sect's intelligence,

512
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,320
how long would you plan
to keep them hidden?

513
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,239
The Feiyu Guards ordered us to hide them.

514
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,670
It has nothing to do with our office!

515
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,320
Are you saying

516
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,409
that the Feiyu Guards,

517
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,230
whose job is to catch demons,

518
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,920
actually

519
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,770
keep minor demons?

520
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,920
I didn't say anything just now.

521
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,280
Kill him!

522
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,510
Kill him!

523
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,190
Slay the demons!

524
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,840
Kill him!

525
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,710
The Feiyu Guards have kept
these 2 minor demons

526
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,370
to help investigate the case.

527
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,300
Master Jin, why make such a fuss?

528
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,320
Are there any discoveries?

529
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,980
Another day has passed,

530
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,710
and I still don't know
whether my daughter is alive or not.

531
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,030
Since you, Feiyu Guards, are
so out of your mind,

532
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,160
our Qionghua Sect will uphold justice

533
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,180
and execute them

534
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,860
right here and now!

535
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,520
Luoluo! Luoluo!

536
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:06,800
Luoluo.

537
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,710
Stop it!

538
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,420
I've found your daughter.

539
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,480
She's still alive.

540
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,060
Where is Yunyi?

541
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,440
Release my 2 friends,

542
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,040
and I'll take you to find her.

543
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,820
Your friends?

544
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,280
Though they are demons,

545
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,740
they have never done any evil things.

546
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,960
The one who took your daughter isn't

547
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,150
Demon King Hong Ye.

548
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,160
I saw it myself.

549
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,470
-My daughter... Where on earth is she?
-Nonsense!

550
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:40,190
This woman clearly has a demonic aura,

551
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,120
and she's even protecting demons.

552
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,990
Master Jin, please calm down

553
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,670
and don't hurt the innocent.

554
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,840
Qionghua disciples!

555
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,890
-Yes!
-Yes!

556
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,190
Does your daughter have a cat

557
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,250
named Flower Lady?

558
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,230
Only I know

559
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,360
where your daughter is.

560
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,480
If you kill us,

561
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,010
you'll never see her again.

562
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,530
Honey.

563
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,630
You've already exhausted yourself

564
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,590
worrying about our daughter.

565
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,920
Don't force your core energy,
or it'll hurt your meridians.

566
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,590
She's my only daughter.

567
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,860
If anything happens to her,

568
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,190
there would be no point in me living.

569
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,710
Put away your swords!

570
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,590
As long as Yunyi can return
safe and sound,

571
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,120
I'll release your friends.

572
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,240
Good. It's a deal.

573
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,460
I'll give you 3 days. Three days at most.

574
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,700
Deliver meals twice a day.

575
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,030
Don't let any unauthorized persons

576
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,890
approach here.

577
00:36:59,070 --> 00:36:59,420
Yes.

578
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,550
Luoluo has a big appetite.

579
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,360
Dali needs plenty of water

580
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,170
and sunlight.

581
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,710
Change the meals to 3 deliveries a day.

582
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,030
Prepare a large water tank in the room

583
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,510
and allow them out for half an hour daily.

584
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:07,960
Yes.

585
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,190
Follow me.

586
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:12,820
Move aside!

587
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:21,960
Xiao Yao,

588
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,670
be honest with me.

589
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,710
Do you really have

590
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,040
the confidence to bring her back
in 3 days?

591
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
I think I can do it.

592
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,590
Do you know that your escape
from that forest today was

593
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,650
pure luck?

594
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,400
[Pingjiang Prefecture] [Misty Forest]

595
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:40,800
Here is

596
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,590
the Misty Forest.

597
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,880
It's not large, only about 666 hectares.

598
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,840
But it's shrouded in mist all year round

599
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,840
with no sunlight.

600
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,210
Locals don't dare to enter it

601
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,630
because once they go in,

602
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,160
almost none can make it out.

603
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,110
Occasionally, some do escape,

604
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,710
but they never remember
what happened inside.

605
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,940
It's not as terrifying as you say.

606
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,840
If I could escape once,

607
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,070
I can make it again.

608
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,880
By the way,

609
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,160
today you said

610
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,600
you saw the person who kidnapped the girl?

611
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,070
Yes.

612
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,660
What does he look like?

613
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,310
He has an iron hand

614
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,910
and also a mask on his face.

615
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,450
But strangely enough,

616
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,730
he seemed to mean no harm to the girl.

617
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,810
Instead, they appeared quite close.

618
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,910
Has this forest always been so peculiar?

619
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,660
Not really.

620
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,820
Twenty years ago,

621
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,800
a tribe called Hefeng
from the Northern Prairie

622
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,560
grew increasingly powerful

623
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,510
and had frequent conflicts
along our Tiancheng Kingdom's borders.

624
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,620
So they sent an assassination team

625
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,030
into our territory,

626
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,440
intending to assassinate His Majesty.

627
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,710
They were discovered by us

628
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,240
and pursued relentlessly.

629
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,080
Ultimately, they ended up being

630
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,520
eliminated in this forest,

631
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,030
with their bodies cremated.

632
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,010
Perhaps those assassins' resentment was
so strong

633
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,440
that it gathered
to form this mysterious mist

634
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,770
that never dissipates.

635
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,200
So this place became a forbidden area.

636
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,630
Is what you're saying recorded in books

637
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,230
or...

638
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,110
It's recorded in the confidential scrolls
of the Feiyu Guards.

639
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,310
Fine, fine. The Feiyu Guards' records.

640
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,900
But when I entered this forest today,

641
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,110
it felt

642
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,900
like someone had set up a barrier.

643
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,360
This barrier is similar to...

644
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,990
It's like the one in Demons' Valley.

645
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,670
Where there's a barrier,
there must be a passage.

646
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,130
That makes things easier.

647
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,910
[The news of the demon devouring humans
has spread throughout Pingjiang.]

648
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:44,760
[Suddenly,]

649
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,000
[all the girls started
fleeing from the city.]

650
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,600
[The families
who didn't have time to escape]

651
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,030
[just had their daughters either hidden]

652
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,650
[or disguised as boys]

653
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,770
[to avoid being found by the demon.]

654
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,440
Dad!

655
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,650
Mom!

656
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,230
My dear.

657
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,460
I don't care!

658
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,990
Just listen to my advice.

659
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,360
Staying home every day is
driving me crazy!

660
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,480
-Yeah! I want to hang out!
-So boring!

661
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,080
It's still better to be bored

662
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,640
than get eaten by a demon.

663
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,510
You know what?

664
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:10,760
That demon

665
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,200
only goes after
beautiful young ladies like you.

666
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,220
If you die,

667
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,410
handsome Lord Bingzhu

668
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,340
will belong to someone else.

669
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:21,920
Anyway,

670
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,550
crying and making a fuss won't help.

671
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,510
Honey,

672
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,000
nail these doors

673
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,490
shut completely.

674
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,110
From today on,

675
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,020
before the culprit is caught,

676
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,320
no one is allowed
to step outside this room.

677
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,010
My Lord, you seem a bit out of sorts.

678
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,360
Did you

679
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,160
have a fight with Xiao Yao again?

680
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:50,890
"Again"?

681
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,940
I mean,

682
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:55,320
having a fight isn't a big deal.

683
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,290
The main issue now is
that Luoluo and Dali

684
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,000
have ended up in human hands.

685
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,030
What should we do?

686
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,990
Their lives are not in danger for now.

687
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,510
And Xiao Yao

688
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,560
will work it out on her own.

689
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,920
With her half-baked demonic power,

690
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,610
she'll probably just get herself killed.

691
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,550
Miss, do you want to buy hemp ropes?

692
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,550
Are these all the hemp ropes you have?
Do you have any more?

693
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,230
Yes, we have more! How many do you need?

694
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,620
I'll take all you have.

695
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,030
Please follow me to the back warehouse.

696
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,890
We have plenty.

697
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:29,710
Wait.

698
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,090
What do you need so many ropes for?

699
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,840
There's only one way
to enter the Misty Forest.

700
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,770
Wait for me here.

701
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:41,590
No,

702
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:44,100
I must go to Pingjiang City myself.

703
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,430
No, you can't.

704
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,240
My Lord, you can go if you want to.

705
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,780
I'll wait for your return.

706
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,510
No...

707
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,440
See? I was right on the money.

708
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:54,960
I'll take them all.

709
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,710
Please deliver them
to the magistrate's office.

710
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,440
No problem.

711
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,070
Who are you?
