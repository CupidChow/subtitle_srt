[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,789
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,400
I'm dying of laughter!

4
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,310
Is it funny?

5
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,920
Yes.

6
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,350
Change your form.

7
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,240
You can do it.

8
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,790
Looks just like him!

9
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,680
Amazing!

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,400
I once experienced life
in the human realm,

11
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,470
and I witnessed joy and sorrow,
partings and reunions,

12
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,240
and the depth of parental love.

13
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,560
To say humans have no true love

14
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,180
is plainly biased.

15
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,560
Xiao Mu is naturally eccentric.

16
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,520
I usually

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,470
take the blame for him.

18
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,250
What he said just now was ill-chosen.

19
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,810
Everyone, just listen and let it pass.

20
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,840
Please don't take it to heart.

21
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,680
Meow.

22
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,840
-That's just like him!
-That's just like him!

23
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,370
Go to the cliff now
and reflect on your faults.

24
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,210
Anyone who pleads for her

25
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,110
will be punished as well.

26
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,530
Admit your mistake,

27
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,090
and I will let you go.

28
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,430
Fine.

29
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,079
Apologize to me,

30
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,880
and I'll let bygones be bygones.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,930
What did you say?

32
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,800
You told us to change our forms,

33
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
and I did it better than anyone.

34
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,730
Why am I being punished?

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,560
You openly spoke for humans

36
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,310
and broke the demon rules.
You deserve severe punishment.

37
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,800
Letting you reflect here

38
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
is already leniency.

39
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
And you still dare to push your luck?

40
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,210
Everything I said is true.

41
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,400
You may have your stance,

42
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,910
but you shouldn't have ignored the facts

43
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,570
and smeared humans like that.

44
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,520
You were misleading the minor demons.

45
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,150
If this continues,

46
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,870
they will only hate humans more,

47
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,560
and the conflict
between the two races will never end.

48
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,360
Whether you're human or a demon,

49
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,840
the demon realm cannot tolerate
divided loyalties.

50
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,000
Since you are in the Demons' Valley,

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,730
you can only stand with demons.

52
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,120
Even His Lordship no longer demands

53
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,080
that I choose one side or the other.

54
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,810
Why are you pressing me so hard?

55
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,520
Ever since I entered the Demons' Valley,

56
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,030
you've been targeting me at every turn.

57
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,960
I have swallowed my pride
and tried to appease you,

58
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,290
yet you only escalated.

59
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,400
I'm going to speak with His Lordship
about this.

60
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,660
you stubborn old fool.

61
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,390
You've been poisoning His Lordship
with your heretical ideas.

62
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,329
Today I'll teach you a lesson.

63
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
You're actually used...

64
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,070
Yes.

65
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,250
It's the Demon-binding Rope.

66
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,650
Remember this, Xiao Yao.

67
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,190
As long as I'm here,

68
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,430
I will never allow you
to disrupt Demon Hearts.

69
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,630
When you sincerely admit your mistake,

70
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,720
the Demon-binding Rope
will release itself.

71
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,120
I've done nothing wrong!

72
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,190
I've done nothing wrong!

73
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,360
If Xiao Dadan knows

74
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,870
I'm being bullied like this by a cat…

75
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,100
Are you cold?

76
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,430
Are you hungry?

77
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,020
Who are you?

78
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,840
Are you Xiao Ming or Xiao Mu?

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,800
Xiao Mu punished you

80
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,560
only to teach you a lesson.

81
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,890
How about this?

82
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,360
Starting today,

83
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,720
you'll water the camellias

84
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,920
on the back hill for 3 days straight,

85
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,520
and we'll let this matter go.

86
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,159
It's getting late.

87
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,310
Go back and get some rest.

88
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,770
Since when do you care so much
about flowers?

89
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,120
Every flower and blade of grass has life.

90
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,659
Of course I care.

91
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,950
Don't you only care about His Lordship?

92
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,350
Yes.

93
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,070
But

94
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,270
His Lordship protects all living things.

95
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,240
What I am doing
is helping ease his burden.

96
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,830
Don't overthink it.

97
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,430
Let's go.

98
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,950
You're so beautiful.

99
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Right?

100
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,450
I knew that today, I...

101
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,920
I've been exposed.

102
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,520
By whom?

103
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,360
How could she tell
when you're so convincing?

104
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,680
I know.
I thought I looked very convincing too.

105
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,040
Have you ever seen a cat demon
that cares about camellias?

106
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,560
No.

107
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,580
Neither have I.

108
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,380
You should have tried
to be more convincing.

109
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:22,800
Right?

110
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,560
Next time.

111
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,630
Let's go.
Xiao Mu has gone into cultivation.

112
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,560
Go back and get some sleep.

113
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,070
He definitely won't find out.

114
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,670
Watch out!

115
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,159
The Demon-binding Rope?

116
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,760
Why such a heavy punishment?

117
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,980
If I could leave on my own,

118
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,970
would I need you
to risk yourselves to rescue me?

119
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,310
Alright. Go now.

120
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,770
If Xiao Mu discovers this,

121
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,630
you will be punished just like me.

122
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,270
Hurry. Go.

123
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,190
What are you doing?

124
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,800
You're just leaving
because she told you to?

125
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,430
She didn't...

126
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,700
Let's think of another way.

127
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Don't come back.

128
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,700
Try to make yourself comfortable, okay?

129
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,890
Let's go. Let's go.

130
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,720
Stop shushing me.

131
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,010
So annoying.

132
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,160
This Demon-binding Rope
can not only trap demons

133
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,750
but also suppress their spiritual power,

134
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,680
making the captive feel like

135
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,680
their internal organs
are being crushed by boulders.

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,360
What should we do?

137
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,110
Xiao Yao said

138
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,120
she's fine.

139
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,040
Luoluo,

140
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,120
Xiao Yao only said that to reassure us.

141
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,850
How could she possibly be fine?

142
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,580
Well...

143
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,990
what should we do?

144
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,640
With our power,

145
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,850
we can't undo the Demon-binding Rope.

146
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,190
Let's go to Youning Cave.

147
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,270
What for?

148
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,480
To find help.

149
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,490
Help from whom?

150
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,670
His Lordship. Who else?

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,600
My Lord?

152
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,310
Stay away from me.

153
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,080
When did I

154
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,190
displease you, My Lord?

155
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,590
You know perfectly well.

156
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,360
I asked you
to teach the minor demons magic,

157
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,970
not to treat them as enemies.

158
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,340
Xiao Yao's power is still weak,

159
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,440
yet you punished her
with the Demon-binding Rope.

160
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,770
Even a great demon could not endure that.

161
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,630
How can she?

162
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,270
My Lord,

163
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,240
Xiao Yao has grown reckless

164
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,250
because of your favoritism.

165
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,800
If we don't restrain her now,

166
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,790
what if something goes wrong
in the future?

167
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,000
Are you going to

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,510
put yourself at risk again?

169
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,170
Put myself at risk? Nonsense!

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,150
I told you to undo it.

171
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,440
Xiao Yao spoke openly for humans today.

172
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,540
Aren't you even a little worried?

173
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,950
What is there to worry about?

174
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,150
Xiao... Xiao Yao...

175
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,300
has lived among... humans for years.

176
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,240
Of course she has...

177
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,120
Of course...

178
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,880
she has more...
experience than the minor demons.

179
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,320
I-If she said... something wrong,

180
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,150
it... was only normal.

181
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,080
N-No need to take it seriously.

182
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,540
You're right, My Lord.

183
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,420
I was being unreasonable.

184
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,330
If you're truly worried about Xiao Yao,

185
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,790
I can

186
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,630
accompany you to untie her.

187
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,480
That... that...

188
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,460

00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,150
Yes.

742
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,320
I followed him for a long time,

743
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,240
but in the end,
I held back from calling out to him.

744
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,620
I didn't want to bring him danger.

745
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,280
His daughter

746
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,480
has indeed become a demon.

747
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,220
Things can never go back to how they were.

748
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,480
Xiao Yao.

749
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,580
You will have a better future.

750
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,320
Although midnight has already passed,

751
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,920
may I make one more wish?

752
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,000
Go on.

753
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,190
I heard those demon-hunting sects

754
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,150
have a technique

755
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,490
called sword flight.

756
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,550
It's riding on swords in the sky.

757
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,340
Can demon arts do that too?

758
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,280
Easy peasy.

759
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,360
One more time!

760
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,590
Do it again!

761
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,280
It's so beautiful!

762
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,570
Then pick the one you like best.

763
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,000
This one. This one.
