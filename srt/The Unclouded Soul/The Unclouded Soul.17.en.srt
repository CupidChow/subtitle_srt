[Episode 17]

3
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,039
But you must tell me everything

4
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:43,039
that happened here in detail—

5
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:43,479
Tell us.

6
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:43,920
D...

7
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,150
Don't hide anything.

8
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,310
I don't dare hide anything.

9
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,320
Let's go.

10
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,220
They said

11
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,680
if I brought you here,

12
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,770
they would play shuttlecock with me.

13
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,830
I...

14
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,060
just wanted someone
to play shuttlecock with me.

15
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,960
You really like playing shuttlecock
this much?

16
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,430
Yes.

17
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,500
To be honest with you,

18
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,810
before now,

19
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,300
we've never actually seen
the Taotie with our own eyes.

20
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,680
It's just that after people
went into the mountains,

21
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,370
they never came back out.

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,310
And when we found the bodies,

23
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,630
they were all missing arms or legs.

24
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,480
So,

25
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,360
we just said it was the Taotie's doing.

26
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,030
You know, it's strange.

27
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,079
In recent years,

28
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,190
the Taotie has been appearing frequently

29
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,050
and often comes into the village.

30
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,470
Then how do you determine

31
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,130
that it's the Taotie who's hurting people?

32
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,800
Everyone knows there's a Taotie

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,080
on Mount Qiansui.

34
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,540
Besides the Taotie,

35
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,030
what else could it be?

36
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,340
The Taotie has returned!

37
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,680
Zixiu, you go home.

38
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,579
Go, go, go.

39
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,710
Go, go, go.

40
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,190
Hurry!

41
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,430
Catch the demon!

42
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,560
Catch the demon!

43
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,140
After it!

44
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:09,910
Where is it?

45
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,570
Over there!

46
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
Don't let it escape!

47
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,580
-Here!
-It's here!

48
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,560
Catch the demon!

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,160
Chase it!

50
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,459
Over there!

51
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,560
Don't let it get away!

52
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,120
Hurry up!

53
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,950
Where's the demon?

54
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,510
Quick!

55
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,490
Catch the demon!

56
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,830
It's here!

57
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,680
Catch the demon!

58
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,310
Demon, you can't escape!

59
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,110
Stop!

60
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,680
I'm going to kill it

61
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,600
to avenge Ya.

62
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,360
Before we clarify everything,

63
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
don't harm the innocent.

64
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,490
Who else could it be?

65
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,190
We already captured it.

66
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,120
Why not kill it?

67
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,920
It has taken human lives,

68
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,950
yet you protect it.

69
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,070
What are your intentions?

70
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,400
We agreed on it already.

71
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,270
We have no more silver
to give to the officials.

72
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:12,930
Move aside!

73
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,160
Since it's already subdued,

74
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,680
why not get to the bottom of this first?

75
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,390
Kill it! Kill it!

76
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,160
It's a demon!

77
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,330
Kill it!

78
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,510
Kill it!

79
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,860
Kill it! Kill it!

80
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,920
Kill it! Kill it!

81
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,750
Get out of the way!

82
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,160
Yes, kill it!

83
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,390
Kill it.

84
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,190
Kill it!

85
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,390
Kill it.

86
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,120
Kill it!

87
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,920
Kill it!

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,800
Silence!

89
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,190
Lock it up first.

90
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,680
We'll decide after the investigation.

91
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,720
Leader,

92
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,430
what do you think?

93
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,000
We will

94
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,560
follow your orders, My Lord.

95
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,510
I know

96
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,490
you don't want to hurt anyone.

97
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,190
If you really wanted to fight,

98
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,790
neither we nor the villagers

99
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,270
could stop you.

100
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,750
Don't be afraid.

101
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,190
I need to remove

102
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,160
this arrow

103
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,920
and apply medicine, okay?

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,659
That way, your wound can heal.

105
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,270
It might hurt a bit.

106
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,190
Try to bear it.

107
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,360
What's wrong?

108
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,360
It's nothing.

109
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,360
Get out.

110
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,750
Get out!

111
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,270
It's fine.

112
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,190
I need to remove your outer robe now

113
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,450
to apply the medicine.

114
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,560
Okay, okay.

115
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
I won't remove it.

116
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,750
I'll just apply it like this.

117
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,010
This is healing salve.

118
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,680
Why does it look somewhat familiar

119
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,020
yet different?

120
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,000
That's Little Leaf,

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
a spirit herb.

122
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,830
Don't talk nonsense.

123
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,920
I'm no spirit herb.

124
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,590
I'm a super powerful great demon!

125
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,490
You understand human speech.

126
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:42,960
Let me ask you,

127
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,409
are you responsible
for the villagers' deaths?

128
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,280
Then let me ask you in a different way.

129
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,060
You've been coming
to the village repeatedly.

130
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,920
Are you looking for something?

131
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,070
Li.

132
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,610
I'd like to borrow something from you.

133
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,650
What do you want?

134
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,040
Here,

135
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,420
take a look at this.

136
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,600
Do you recognize it?

137
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,840
Li says this belonged to his wife.

138
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,280
It's the one!

139
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,150
That's it!

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,880
Look at those eyes!

141
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,270
I've seen those eyes before.

142
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,730
They're exactly
like the ones in the forest.

143
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,790
Coming!

144
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,730
Keep it down.

145
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,650
This Taotie
hasn't hurt anyone in my family,

146
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,620
nor damaged my house or fields.

147
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,830
Why are you causing trouble with Li?

148
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:14,910
Help!

149
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,670
Help me!

150
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,270
Leader, help us!

151
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,990
The dead has really come back to life?

152
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,810
Fire! Hurry to put it out!

153
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,390
Go quickly!

154
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,490
Li, come on!

155
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,120
Hurry!

156
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,730
This way!

157
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,220
There's a fire! Quick!

158
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,390
Has another demon entered the village?

159
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,920
It has nothing to do with me.

160
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,240
Give me your blade.

161
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,690
No way.

162
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,480
What if the Taotie escapes?

163
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
I'll stay here and watch.

164
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,600
It's still chained up.

165
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,870
Don't worry, it can't escape.

166
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,320
Help! Help!

167
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,550
Help me!

168
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,600
Help!

169
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,980
Take care of yourself.

170
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,960
Help me!

171
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,840
I don't want to die!

172
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,030
Help!

173
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,480
As if I need you to tell me that.

174
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,610
Taking care of people is what I do best.

175
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,430
Help me!

176
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,440
Get up.

177
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,840
Help me!

178
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,200
Help me!

179
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,920
Help me!

180
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,490
Help! Help me!

181
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,360
Help me!

182
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,520
Save me! Help me quickly!

183
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,910
Save me quickly! Help me!

184
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,530
Get up now.

185
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,840
Thank you, My Lord.

186
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,900
Thank you, My Lord.

187
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,220
How many corpses are there in total?

188
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,510
How would I know?

189
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,510
It seems like all the bodies

190
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,440
from the graveyard have appeared.

191
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,750
Help me!

192
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,200
Help me!

193
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,270
Help me!

194
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,960
Help me!

195
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,720
Help me!

196
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,130
Help me!

197
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,000
Help!

198
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,000
Help!

199
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,960
Xiao Yao,

200
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,510
save me!

201
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,320
Help!

202
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,440
Save me!

203
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,010
Alright, alright.

204
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,810
I'll go check.

205
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,320
Xiao Yao, save me!

206
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,080
Save me!

207
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,870
Behind you!

208
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,520
Thank you.

209
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,020
Move aside!

210
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,940
We caught it
but weren't allowed to kill it.

211
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,200
Now it's escaped again.

212
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,530
Bunch of useless fools.

213
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,870
Watch your mouth.

214
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,200
It has never harmed anyone

215
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,530
and it just saved us now.

216
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,100
Saved you?

217
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,940
This demon

218
00:12:58,970 --> 00:12:59,910
can break free from chains

219
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,150
and tear those corpses apart.

220
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,270
You say it won't harm people?

221
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,550
Use your brain.

222
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,720
No matter how strong it is,

223
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,080
it only used that strength to save people.

224
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,510
If it had used that power against you,

225
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,370
do you think you'd still be alive?

226
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,480
I'm done arguing with you.

227
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,200
Who's coming with me to catch the Taotie?

228
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,600
Li, Xiao Yao has a point.

229
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,720
After tonight's ordeal,

230
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,410
if you go back into the mountains
to hunt the demon,

231
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,870
you'll likely not return.

232
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,240
Leader,

233
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,010
my talismans failed to stop the demon.

234
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,010
I am responsible.

235
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,170
I'll go with him.

236
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,530
My Lord, you cannot go.

237
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,300
My Lord,

238
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,240
tonight's situation

239
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,320
is something we've never seen before.

240
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,000
If the demon comes back

241
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,310
we certainly won't be able to resist.

242
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,250
Please, My Lord,

243
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,800
stay with us

244
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,860
to guard this village

245
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,960
and protect the women,
children, and elderly.

246
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,170
My Lord.

247
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,480
I'll go check.

248
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,280
Xiao Yao.

249
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,660
Don't worry.

250
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,670
That demon doesn't seem evil to me.

251
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,840
It actually seems quite humane.

252
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,000
If Li encounters it,

253
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,270
someone will surely get hurt.

254
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,670
We can't let that happen.

255
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,380
Those zombies just now
had no demonic power.

256
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,000
Their minds were confused too.

257
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,930
They must have been
cursed by someone to harm people.

258
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,670
I will set up

259
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,750
a formation around the village.

260
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,200
If demons attack again,

261
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,860
we'll be warned immediately.

262
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,710
Well, My Lord,

263
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,840
how can we help?

264
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,660
Tell the villagers to go home and rest.

265
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,990
I can handle this alone.

266
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:33,510
Then...

267
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,700
Thank you, My Lord.

268
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,970
Thank you, My Lord.

269
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,820
Let's go.

270
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,200
What's this?

271
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,670
How come I suddenly can't see clearly?

272
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,440
Why is there so much fog?

273
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,500
What's happening?

274
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,960
Greetings, My Lord.

275
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,110
Weren't you at the celestial mountain?

276
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,610
Those official ladies...

277
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,440
My Lord,

278
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,880
we received reports from the government

279
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,360
that the Mount Qiansui area

280
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,910
has been troubled
by demons for a long time.

281
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,110
That's why we rushed here without rest.

282
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,970
I came for the same reason.

283
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,400
Since that's the case,

284
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,120
I'll trouble all of you

285
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,410
to help me protect the people here.

286
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,220
As you command.

287
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,220
-As you command!
-As you command!

288
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,930
Thank you for your help,

289
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,070
Commander Ji.

290
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,800
Don't step on the formation!

291
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,030
Alright.

292
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,040
Kneel down!

293
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,770
Come, sir.

294
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,570
Get up quickly.

295
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,360
Commander Ji,

296
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,870
you're quite imperious.

297
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,350
I wouldn't dare.

298
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,110
Put away your blades!

299
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,290
This village is already impoverished.

300
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,079
None of you

301
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,819
are to disturb the villagers.

302
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,400
Yes.

303
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,640
Rise up now.

304
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
-Get up.
-My Lord,

305
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,829
we work for the court

306
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,089
and receive court salaries.

307
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,240
Why bother associating
with these peasants?

308
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,550
If you want to play the humble official,

309
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,069
you can do that back in the capital.

310
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,400
In this barren place,

311
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,040
who are you performing for?

312
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,980
Commander Ji,

313
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,800
without the common people,

314
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,530
there would be no court.

315
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,340
Without the people's taxes,

316
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,980
where would our salaries come from?

317
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,560
You're absolutely right, My Lord.

318
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,340
Feiyu Guards, attention!

319
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,010
-Yes!
-Yes!

320
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,950
Split into four teams

321
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,800
and set up defensive formations
around the village.

322
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,260
Take over patrol duties
from the villagers.

323
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,110
If any great demon appears,

324
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,280
protect the villagers

325
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,280
with all your might.

326
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,270
-Yes!
-Yes!

327
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,000
Let's go.

328
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,720
Go.

329
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,270
My Lord,

330
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,910
there's something I don't understand.

331
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:44,590
Speak.

332
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,830
Your demon-slaying blade

333
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,450
that never left your side before,
even while sleeping...

334
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,460
where is it now?

335
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,920
My Lord, since your return
from the celestial mountain,

336
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,960
did the immortals provide any guidance

337
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,090
about the location of the Yuli Spring?

338
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,930
You must have found the Yuli Spring water

339
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,940
and only need to present it
to the emperor in the capital.

340
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,140
I offer my congratulations in advance.

341
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,750
If you receive promotions and titles,

342
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,470
please look out for me.

343
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,810
Thank you in advance.

344
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,550
I haven't found the Yuli Spring.

345
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,390
But there's an extraordinarily powerful
great demon nearby.

346
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,670
If we can eliminate it,

347
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,280
you can have all the credit.

348
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,930
You probably know better than me

349
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,650
what the emperor wants.

350
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,100
I'm overstepping,

351
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,250
but I just want to
remind you of something.

352
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,830
If you return to the capital alone

353
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,480
without the Yuli Spring water

354
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,050
to gain the emperor's protection,

355
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,850
those officials' daughters
that you took away...

356
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,480
The powerful families in the capital

357
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,790
won't let you off easily.

358
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,440
It's not your place

359
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,830
to lecture me.

360
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm only concerned

361
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,900
for your welfare.

362
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,640
Water.

363
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,310
Water.

364
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:41,720
Li.

365
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:43,940
Li?

366
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,330
Demon King.

367
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,940
Mr. Ji, you're fashionably late.

368
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,480
And you arranged to meet me

369
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
in such a remote and strange place.

370
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,030
Why so cautious?

371
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,970
You jest, My Lord.

372
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,330
Your power is extraordinary.

373
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,830
I am just a mere human.

374
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,350
I need to rely on you.

375
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,400
Mr. Ji, since you are so cautious,

376
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,360
if someone ruins our plans,

377
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,230
what shall we do?

378
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,310
My Lord, please don't blame me.

379
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,460
Bingzhu's arrival

380
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,090
was unexpected to me as well.

381
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,920
He only said he heard about a great demon

382
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,180
and came to capture it.

383
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:25,790
But

384
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,380
his demon-slaying blade is missing.

385
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,040
Something serious must have happened.

386
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,210
Did he find the Yuli Spring?

387
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,240
I'm certain

388
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,980
he didn't find it.

389
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,390
With his sudden arrival,

390
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,970
should we continue

391
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,110
our plan?

392
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,970
Of course not.

393
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,610
His appearance

394
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,480
is unexpected, but...

395
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,820
it is heaven-sent.

396
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,410
What do you mean?

397
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,140
This is the Yuli Spring

398
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,240
that Master Bingzhu obtained
at the cost of his life.

399
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,920
I will do my utmost

400
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,390
to present it to His Majesty.

401
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,900
Didn't you say he didn't find Yuli Spring?

402
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,040
Lord Heiwu,

403
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,420
everyone has heard of
the Yuli Spring water,

404
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,900
but no one has ever seen it.

405
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:26,940
In other words,

406
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,330
as long as drinking it doesn't kill you,

407
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,350
it can all be called the Yuli Spring.

408
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,740
This is what Master Bingzhu received

409
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,000
in exchanged for his life.

410
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,860
Then, Mr. Ji, what do you want?

411
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,960
What I want

412
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,190
is only to
wholeheartedly serve you, Demon King.

413
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,850
You need not worry about
the Feiyu Guard slaughtering demons again.

414
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,960
You only need to provide us with some

415
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,030
minor demons that haven't
gone through the test yet.

416
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,820
Demon Slayer, you're quite calculating.

417
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,420
I fear one day

418
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,780
you'll scheme against me too.

419
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,200
I wouldn't dare.

420
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,280
We are all your soldiers.

421
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,510
The Feiyu Guard will

422
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,710
serve the Demon King with all our might.

423
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,010
Who is it?

424
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,480
Immortal!

425
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,510
An immortal has come!

426
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,670
Why did you come down from Mount Qiansui?

427
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,970
No need for such formality.

428
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,110
Immortal!

429
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,450
I heard about the village's suffering

430
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,610
and that many people have fallen ill.

431
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,490
I've brought the Yuli Spring
down the mountain

432
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,090
to help relieve your suffering.

433
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,640
Thank you, Immortal.

434
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,060
You are so merciful!

435
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,280
Quickly show the way.

436
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,190
Immortal,

437
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,950
this way please.

438
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,770
To the village, please.

439
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,770
This way, please.

440
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,650
You really are Ya.

441
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,750
No!

442
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,680
Li,

443
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,920
she is your wife, Ya.

444
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,710
If you keep talking nonsense,

445
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,890
I'll cut you down too.

446
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,420
What I'm saying is all true.

447
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,010
She wasn't eaten by demons.

448
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,480
She probably became like this

449
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,940
because she was poisoned.

450
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,850
Look,

451
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,830
what is this?

452
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,520
Impossible.

453
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,170
Tell me.

454
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,390
Did you kill Ya

455
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,240
and steal the jade pendant?

456
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,780
Tell me, did you kill her?

457
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:14,550
Speak!

458
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,260
Li!

459
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,800
You...

460
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,050
You can't keep running away
from this anymore.

461
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,250
She is Ya.

462
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,360
Impossible!

463
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,640
Impossible!

464
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,600
Ya was the most beautiful

465
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,850
and kind-hearted woman in the world.

466
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,060
She's still kind. That hasn't changed.

467
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,720
Look at the herbs on your arm.

468
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,030
Think about it.

469
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,790
Why does she always go to the village,

470
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,120
yet never hurts anyone?

471
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,960
Why are you the one

472
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,050
who sees her first
whenever she visits the village?

473
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,940
Why is it that every time
you chase and hurt her,

474
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,860
she never harms you in return,

475
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,270
and only runs away?

476
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,590
It's all my fault.

477
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,030
My Lord,

478
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,640
we've been patrolling
all village entrances

479
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,440
but found no trace of any demons.

480
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,960
There's a demon!

481
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
A demon is coming!

482
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,030
Demon!

483
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,830
-Run!
-Run!

484
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:06,880
Zixiu.

485
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,520
What's wrong?

486
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,040
I saw a demon.

487
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,680
What did this demon look like?

488
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,880
He wore a big black robe,

489
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
had a pale face,

490
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,070
and was not very tall.

491
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,720
The person talking to him

492
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,720
just now...

493
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,400
Zixiu.

494
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,980
Don't point like that.

495
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,270
The Taotie has returned!

496
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,850
The Taotie is back!

497
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,170
Feiyu Guards,

498
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,940
Eight Sun Formation!

499
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,750
Stop!

500
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,770
She's not a demon.

501
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,150
She's Ya.

502
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,240
Ya?

503
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,740
I...

504
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,810
It's all my fault.

505
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:26,650
All my fault.

506
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,340
I should have realized sooner.

507
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,460
Every day,

508
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,860
you snuck into the village at night

509
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,630
just to see me.

510
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,750
When I stabbed you,

511
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,910
there were tears in your eyes.

512
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,880
Every time I returned
from hunting in the mountains,

513
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,230
empty-handed,

514
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,680
there would always be prey

515
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,680
appearing on my path home.

516
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,080
I'm so stupid.

517
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,420
I didn't hear
what you were trying to tell me.

518
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,800
Ya,

519
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,310
do you hate me?

520
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,670
You did so much and waited so long,

521
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,140
yet I didn't recognize you.

522
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,400
I'm so stupid. I deserve to die.

523
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,050
I've caused you so much suffering.

524
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,380
I miss you.

525
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,400
Xiao Yao,

526
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,910
why are you crying?

527
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:27,500
Ya can never return to her original form.

528
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,090
What are you thinking of doing?

529
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,060
I'm telling you,

530
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,610
don't even think about it.

531
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,960
The real Taotie hasn't been found yet.

532
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,650
I still need my strength
to protect your life.

533
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,110
You have a way
to turn her back to her original form?

534
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,100
I'm telling you,

535
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,310
I won't agree to it no matter what.

536
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,040
Little Leaf,

537
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,750
please.

538
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,930
I know I'm dumb.

539
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,020
I didn't study techniques properly.

540
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,400
My power is too weak.

541
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,350
Now, I want to save someone

542
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,510
but have no way to do it.

543
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,440
Don't cry anymore.

544
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,400
Alright, alright.

545
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,560
I'll do it. I'll do it, alright?

546
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,810
But I must tell you,

547
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,680
my technique

548
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,690
can only turn her back for one hour.

549
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,000
After using the technique,

550
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,310
I'll turn into a straw bracele.t

551
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,240
If you face danger again,

552
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,300
-you can only rely on yourself.
-Okay. Change quickly.

553
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,560
Thank you.

554
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,880
Immortal, please bless us.

555
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,630
Immortal, please bless us.

556
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,590
Bring us fortune and ward off disaster!

557
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,630
Immortal, please bless us.

558
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,000
Bring us fortune and ward off disaster!

559
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,490
Do not panic, everyone.

560
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,590
I have come here

561
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:17,280
to relieve your suffering.

562
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,470
Drink the Yuli Spring water
from my bottle.

563
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,030
You will surely

564
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,350
be cured of all illnesses

565
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,960
and gain immortality.

566
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,550
-Thank you, Immortal.
-Thank you, Immortal.

567
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,240
Ya!

568
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:34,660
Zixiu?

569
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,310
You're finally back!

570
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,670
Where are the other villagers?

571
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,670
A demon entered the village

572
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,130
and gathered everyone.

573
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:42,630
Follow me.

574
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,260
Don't drink it!

575
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,990
Don't drink!

576
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,140
Don't!

577
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,380
This...

578
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,590
He's not an Immortal.

579
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,710
He's a demon!

580
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,230
Demon?

581
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,910
I became a demon after drinking his water!

582
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,410
You'll turn into a demon if you drink it.

583
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,600
What's going on?

584
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,880
Demon,

585
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,250
die!

586
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,780
Without the demon-slaying blade,

587
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,170
you think you can kill me?

588
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,890
The Feiyu Guard's reputation
extends far and wide,

589
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,980
and it's not just because of this blade.

590
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,110
Form the formation!

591
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,940
What's happening?

592
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,520
My Lord, I'm sorry,

593
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,530
but following you leads nowhere.

594
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,440
Everyone here today

595
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,580
must die.

596
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,420
With me here,

597
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,460
you lowly Heiwu, kneel down!

598
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,050
You use the demon race's name

599
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,800
to slaughter innocent people.

600
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,670
Truly despicable!

601
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:04,970
You...

602
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,610
We meet again.

603
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,280
Mount Qiansui,

604
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,400
is remote and isolated,

605
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,330
surrounded by mountains and rivers.

606
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,720
Troublemakers run rampant,

607
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,580
disrespecting imperial orders,

608
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:30,060
always seeking violence.

609
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,130
Today,

610
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,390
you even conspire with a demoness
and raise mythical beasts,

611
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,830
causing havoc everywhere.

612
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:36,760
The Feiyu Guard,

613
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,420
representing Tiansheng Kingdom's
righteous army,

614
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,420
has come here

615
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,740
to execute traitors

616
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,030
and eliminate future threats.

617
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
I'll deal with

618
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,920
this demoness myself.

619
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,240
Little Leaf.

620
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,920
Little Leaf.

621
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,230
Hong Ye.

622
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,700
Hong Ye!

623
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,580
If you don't come soon,

624
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,580
I'll have to strangle her.

625
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,920
This neck feels so familiar.

626
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,210
Why isn't your Hong Ye
coming to save you today?

627
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,340
Let's fight them!

628
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,300
Li!

629
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:57,710
Villains!

630
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,270
You're all villains!

631
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,510
Xiao Yao!

632
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,520
Zixiu!

633
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:45,920
Zixiu!

634
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,230
Zixiu!

635
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,360
Zixiu!

636
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:52,680
Xiao Yao.

637
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:02,640
Zixiu.

638
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,150
Zixiu.

639
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,150
Zixiu.
