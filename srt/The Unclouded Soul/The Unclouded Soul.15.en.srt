[The Unclouded Soul]

2
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,830
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,270
It's time to bring out

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,400
the extra dishes as well.

5
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,090
Xiao Yao!

6
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,430
Xiao Yao!

7
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,370
Xiao Yao!

8
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,329
What should we do, Xiao Yao?

9
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,520
Dali, hang in there!

10
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,600
Hong Ye once said that vengeful spirits

11
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,200
favor the chill of yin
and fear the heat of yang.

12
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,320
Dali,

13
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,520
do you remember the Wind-Control Technique
Xiao Ming taught us?

14
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:52,960
Yes.

15
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,050
Follow my lead in a moment.

16
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:55,870
Okay.

17
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,490
Don't see me.

18
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,350
Don't see me.

19
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,360
Don't see me!

20
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,000
Now!

21
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,220
Wind-Control Technique!

22
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:07,460
Xiao Yao.

23
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,940
Xiao Yao, are you okay?

24
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,470
I'm okay.

25
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,190
Xiao Yao,

26
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,040
why did you make such a big fire?

27
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,970
The candles are almost burned out.

28
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,920
The vengeful spirits are gone.

29
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,180
Does that mean we've cleared this level?

30
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,400
Why is it that
we still can't open the door?

31
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,630
Exactly.

32
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,390
According to what Pianpian said,

33
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,650
we should have cleared this level by now.

34
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,320
Why are there four exits?

35
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,030
Dali,

36
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,770
which one is the real exit?

37
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,680
Exactly.

38
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,940
Which way should we go?

39
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,720
Xiao Yao,

40
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,450
what do you think we should do?

41
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,360
The candlelight's back to normal.

42
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,410
Looks like all four doors will work.

43
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,360
Yeah, that's right.

44
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,020
They should all be connected.

45
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,780
Dali,

46
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,660
which one are you going to take?

47
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,290
Follow her.

48
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,580
Dali, wait for me!

49
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,110
And me, Dali!

50
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,040
Wait up!

51
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,570
I'll go check this side then.

52
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,020
I'll take this one.

53
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,960
Xiao Yao,

54
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,560
let me wipe your face clean first.

55
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:49,850
Thank you.

56
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,810
They got lucky.

57
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,040
The next level

58
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,840
will be the real challenge.

59
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,360
What's the rush?

60
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,910
Don't you fear death?

61
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,950
The mechanisms in this courtyard
are even more bizarre.

62
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,350
You'd better observe carefully yourself.

63
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,480
Little Leaf, give me a hint.

64
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,070
Won't you use your brain at all?

65
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,920
Want me to flick your forehead?

66
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,430
Look at these stone statues.

67
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,830
None of them have hearts.

68
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,960
What do you mean by that?

69
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,810
So you want me to draw hearts on them?

70
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,070
One's appearance is a reflection
of their heart,

71
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,710
and the heart spawns five ghosts:

72
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,480
jealousy,

73
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,909
vanity,

74
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,640
greed,

75
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,310
sloth,

76
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,450
and schadenfreude.

77
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,780
What's that supposed to mean?

78
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,160
Figure it out yourself.

79
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,240
No more hints.

80
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,090
Leaving things half-said—

81
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,560
what's your problem?

82
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,350
Why won't this candle light?

83
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,340
Xiao Yao.

84
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,440
Thanks for saving us just now.

85
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,240
If you need any help, just ask.

86
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,200
Yeah.

87
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,200
Xiao Yao.

88
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,320
As expected, you're the best.

89
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,380
You figured out the trick right away.

90
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,440
I've always known
Xiao Yao was extraordinary.

91
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,000
Look.

92
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,600
We only made it through earlier
thanks to Xiao Yao.

93
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,360
-Exactly.
-That's right.

94
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,150
Dali.

95
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,870
-What about us? What should we do?
-Xiao Yao, had I known you were this good,

96
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,200
I would've stuck with you
from the very beginning.

97
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,670
Exactly.

98
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,790
Yeah. I wish I had followed you
from the start.

99
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,360
Indeed.

100
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,200
Alright, everyone, let's focus on
finding clues first.

101
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,510
As long as we don't fight among ourselves,

102
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,720
I believe we'll be able to pass the trial.

103
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,200
-Alright.
-Okay.

104
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,510
Mm.

105
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,040
Alright.

106
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,440
A few compliments
and she's acting all high and mighty.

107
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,910
If we followed all her instructions,

108
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,510
we'd be sending her straight into
the Immortal Lord's favor for nothing.

109
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,110
Just butter her up a bit
to her face, that's all.

110
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,270
How come their clothes look so nice?

111
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,270
They don't know how to do anything,

112
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,510
yet they've been pampered since childhood.

113
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,370
And look at her—

114
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,120
there's actually jade on her shoes.

115
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,480
One pair costs as much as

116
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,630
all the clothes my father and I

117
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,480
have ever worn combined.

118
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,750
Xiao Yao.

119
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,200
Ning'an.

120
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,390
All Hong Ye ever thinks of is you.

121
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,630
What's so special about you?

122
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,510
Xiao Yao?

123
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,150
Xiao Yao, what's wrong with you?

124
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,790
Xiao Yao!

125
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,510
Xiao Yao, wake up!

126
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,730
What am I doing?

127
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,510
You...

128
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,360
Can you hear me now?

129
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,520
How did that happen?

130
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,200
I wasn't myself just now.

131
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,390
Who said you could touch me?

132
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,390
How dare you touch me?

133
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,360
Why did you hit me?

134
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,390
I meant to hit you!

135
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,600
-You started it!
-What are you doing?

136
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,670
My father outranks yours,

137
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,360
how dare you hit me!

138
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,600
Stop arguing, both of you!

139
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,550
What's wrong with practicing weapons?

140
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,600
Someone as fragile as you

141
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,870
would never be chosen
by the Immortal Lord!

142
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,510
I'm better than you at everything—
music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

143
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,000
The Immortal Lord will surely favor me.

144
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,910
-Why did you push me?
-And you.

145
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,000
I call you Dali every day
and consider you my sister,

146
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,150
but look what you've done!

147
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,870
You're so useless!

148
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,440
Exactly!

149
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,720
Give me back my bracelet!

150
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,360
What are you doing?

151
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,150
Give it back to her!

152
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,790
Look,

153
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,550
everyone has changed.

154
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,960
Don't forget, I'm a general's daughter!

155
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,840
Who do you think you are?

156
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,790
You dare push me?

157
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,440
You? You're not worthy!

158
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,690
I suddenly got really angry just now—

159
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,080
angry at them for having
nice clothes and possessions.

160
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,440
No,

161
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,890
it wasn't anger.

162
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,110
It was jealousy.

163
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,050
I was jealous of them just now.

164
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,230
Why did I suddenly...

165
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,150
You think you're so tough, huh?

166
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:01,940
How dare you talk about my father
like that!

167
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,550
How dare you talk about my father
like that!

168
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,150
Give it to me!

169
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,080
Return it to her!

170
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,360
How dare you talk about my father
like that!

171
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,290
It's because of this stone statue.

172
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,910
Give it back to her!

173
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,240
Give it back to me!

174
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,150
You didn't do anything!

175
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,390
What right do you have to take anything?

176
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,150
Exactly!

177
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,710
Give it back to me now!

178
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,790
Give it back!

179
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,520
My bracelet!

180
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,480
Who do you think you are to push me?

181
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,540
You dare to resist?

182
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,630
Are you crazy?

183
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,600
One's appearance is a reflection
of their heart,

184
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,460
and the heart spawns five ghosts:

185
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,610
jealousy,

186
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,480
vanity,

187
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,880
greed,

188
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,350
sloth,

189
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,350
and schadenfreude.

190
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,000
Get lost!

191
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,570
I said get lost!

192
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,010
Stop fighting!

193
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,150
Let me go!

194
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,970
Let go!

195
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,030
Stop fighting!

196
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,750
Stop fighting!

197
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,440
Let go!

198
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,010
Stop fighting, all of you!

199
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,350
Stop fighting! Stop!

200
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,150
Put some effort into it!

201
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,900
Stop fighting!

202
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,670
Stop it!

203
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,920
It's none of your business!

204
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,870
What are you doing?

205
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,870
Give it back to me!

206
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,590
I'll kill you!

207
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,950
Give me back my bracelet!

208
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,200
-What?
-How could you say that about us?

209
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,750
Give it back to her!

210
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,320
Let go!

211
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,720
This is what you get for
talking about my father like that!

212
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,450
Give it to me!

213
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,720
Stop fighting, you all!

214
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,910
Stop! Stop fighting!

215
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,910
Give it back to me!

216
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,960
Help!

217
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,980
Stop fighting!

218
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,790
This is her bracelet!

219
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,910
Why did you take it?

220
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,910
Hand it over!

221
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,370
First the cause, then the effect.

222
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,990
It was jealousy, vanity, and greed

223
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,320
that turned us against each other.

224
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,390
We can't let the stone statues
move anymore!

225
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:56,980
Let go!

226
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
These five stone statues

227
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,980
are the cores of this formation.

228
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,390
If the formation is completed,

229
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,140
we might all die!

230
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,720
Go away! Don't touch me!

231
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,170
I need to get out of here alive.

232
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,120
I still want to go out there
and enjoy wealth and glory.

233
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,890
It's you!

234
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,840
We can't let the stone statues move!

235
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,960
What are you standing there for?

236
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,840
Help me push!

237
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,140
Come help quickly!

238
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,410
Come on, hurry!

239
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,240
How impressive.

240
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,890
She figured out the formation.

241
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,420
Too bad,

242
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,750
it's already too late.

243
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,790
The stone statues are about to
return to their positions.

244
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,960
They'll be trapped in their own desires

245
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,490
and never be able to escape.

246
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,720
We and these stone statues
are bound by cause and effect,

247
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,050
affecting one another.

248
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,360
As long as we calm our minds,

249
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,180
they won't be able to affect us!

250
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,840
What do you mean?

251
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,450
So you're saying

252
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,190
we should do nothing now?

253
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,360
Yes. Do nothing

254
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,080
and think of nothing.

255
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,630
What kind of solution is that?

256
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,600
I think you're just trying to
get us killed as quickly as possible

257
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,910
so you can reap the benefits yourself!

258
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,670
That's right!

259
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,030
We all know what's going on.

260
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,240
You were the one who led us
to find the key to the last level.

261
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,900
Now that none of us can get out,

262
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,550
wouldn't all the credit
belong to you alone?

263
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,630
I have absolutely no interest

264
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,840
in the rewards!

265
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,870
I only came here

266
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,530
for someone who matters to me.

267
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,670
The Immortal Lord surely set up this trial

268
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,720
to select capable people

269
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,620
for her own use.

270
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,670
You're all daughters
from official families.

271
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,130
I'm sure you've heard that

272
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,270
only those who stay composed
in the face of Mount Tai collapsing

273
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,600
can achieve great things.

274
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
What does all this

275
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,720
have to do with us?

276
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,600
There's no other way now!

277
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,790
You have to trust me!

278
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,080
Close your eyes!

279
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,960
Remember,

280
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,870
if you can't calm your minds,

281
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,330
think about happy things.

282
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,000
Think about the people you love most.

283
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,600
No matter what,

284
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,330
just be happy and comfortable.

285
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,720
They're gone. All gone.

286
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,030
Great!

287
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,510
It's seven notes.

288
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,250
We've got all the strings.

289
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,310
Then can we get out of here now?

290
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,350
♪ The moonlight lingers ♪

291
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,400
♪ My heart is heavy ♪

292
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:41,200
♪ Past memories shackle my spirit ♪

293
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,160
♪ Offer my flesh and blood ♪

294
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,510
♪ Comfort my soul ♪

295
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:50,240
♪ One person returns to the shadows,
while all others live ♪

296
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,830
"Offer my flesh and blood."

297
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,200
"Comfort my soul."

298
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,590
"One person returns to the shadows,
while all others live."

299
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,880
This means...

300
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,680
They'll select someone from among us
to offer as a sacrifice

301
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,010
to the vengeful spirits in the courtyard.

302
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,110
♪ One person returns to the shadows,
while all others live ♪

303
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,040
This last level is the most ingenious.

304
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,080
As long as a life is truly sacrificed,

305
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,750
it will completely enrage
that vengeful spirit.

306
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,490
Once she goes into a frenzy...

307
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,550
The one who draws the shortest stick

308
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,880
must accept the outcome and admit defeat.

309
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,680
Go ahead and draw.

310
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,480
I'll go first.

311
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,310
Hurry.

312
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,070
Dali,

313
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,720
which one should I choose?

314
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,980
It's your own fate. Why are you asking me?

315
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
Go. Go over there.

316
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,410
I won't draw.

317
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,400
Xiao Yao,

318
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,960
why do you always have to
make yourself stand out?

319
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,560
I'm just following my heart.

320
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,140
The candle is almost burnt out.

321
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,160
Is what your heart wants

322
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,730
more important than
the lives of all of us?

323
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:07,960
Fine.

324
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,570
I'll choose first.

325
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,530
This one is yours then.

326
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,000
Everyone, show your sticks.

327
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,350
They're all the same length.

328
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,720
Did you make the sticks wrong?

329
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,450
Who hasn't shown their stick?

330
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,440
Who is it? Who else?

331
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,550
Huang Ying! Huang Ying
hasn't shown her stick.

332
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,750
Huang Ying, show it already.

333
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,680
What are you afraid of, Huang Ying?

334
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,670
Her stick is the shortest!

335
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,640
Accept the outcome and admit defeat.

336
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,400
That's right. Accept the outcome
and admit defeat.

337
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:10,830
Exactly!

338
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,720
You can't!

339
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,240
The strings are all in tune.

340
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,790
Sacrificing one person is now
a clear requirement.

341
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,400
You've contributed the most,

342
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,720
why keep interfering?

343
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,590
Huang Ying doesn't deserve to die.

344
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,440
She's been trying to help everyone
all along

345
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,510
and has never harmed anyone.

346
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,240
If she shouldn't die,

347
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,570
should you die instead?

348
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,270
Or tell us,

349
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,750
who should die?

350
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,000
She's so clumsy.

351
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,570
Even if she gets out alive,

352
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
she'll end up as fertilizer anyway.

353
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,650
We might as well sacrifice her now!

354
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,040
That's right.

355
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,310
Get out of the way,

356
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,030
or we won't be polite anymore.

357
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,240
Who made these rules?

358
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,640
If the one who talks the most nonsense
should die,

359
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,920
shouldn't it be you?

360
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,640
If the one with the highest rank
should die,

361
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,000
shouldn't it be you?

362
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,310
Can't you all use your brains?

363
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,830
From the moment we entered
the Courtyard of Mysteries,

364
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,830
every trial

365
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,920
seemed to require us
to compete for credit,

366
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,720
but in reality,

367
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,790
it was our united efforts
that helped us overcome these challenges.

368
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,650
No one can decide another's fate—

369
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,840
not even Dreamshard Immortal.

370
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,350
Xiao Yao.

371
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,790
Dali.

372
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,110
It's always the same ending.

373
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,720
No need to watch.

374
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,460
What are you doing?

375
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,120
Dali.

376
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,780
Don't go further down the wrong path.

377
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,750
We can't waste any more time!

378
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,350
The candle is about to go out!

379
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,870
We need a life for the sacrifice,

380
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,360
or we'll all die here!

381
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,960
Let's just pick up the sword

382
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,720
and kill her!

383
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,370
Let's go.

384
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,020
Catch her!

385
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,920
Don't let her escape!

386
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,480
You can't go!

387
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,180
Kill her!

388
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,200
Kill her!

389
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,880
Kill her!

390
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,110
Stop right there!

391
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,370
Don't hold me back!

392
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,810
Let go!

393
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,790
She must die!

394
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:17,960
Let go!

395
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,690
If she doesn't die, we will!

396
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,700
Let go!

397
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,940
Huang Ying!

398
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,500
Kill her for me!

399
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,560
Let me go!

400
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,450
Huang Ying!

401
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,600
Let go!

402
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,640
Let me go!

403
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,520
Hold her down!

404
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,200
Don't move!

405
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,990
Let me go!

406
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,200
Come here!

407
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,380
Kill her!

408
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,110
Come here!

409
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:47,880
Kill her!

410
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,310
Let me go!

411
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,910
Let go!

How could the sword break?

426
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,630
I didn't see them use any magic.

427
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,000
Huang Ying,

428
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,110
you...

429
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,830
Thank you, Xiao Yao.

430
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,800
Actually, I am

431
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,690
the vengeful spirit
of the Courtyard of Mysteries.

432
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,550
Many years ago,

433
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,770
I came to the Realm of Mist and Void
just like you.

434
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,890
Since I wasn't as clever as others,

435
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,930
I was mocked

436
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,000
and ostracized.

437
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,630
I originally thought that
as long as I treated others sincerely,

438
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,740
I would receive sincerity in return.

439
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,300
But unexpectedly,

440
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,150
my constant forbearance

441
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,130
only led to daily

442
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,310
and increasingly severe bullying.

443
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,000
Eventually,

444
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,480
I committed suicide by hanging.

445
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,690
The Immortal Lord didn't want my soul
to dissipate,

446
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,920
so he condensed my resentment.

447
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,100
Every time newcomers arrive on the island,

448
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,680
he places me among them.

449
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,550
First,

450
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,510
to test people's hearts.

451
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,880
And second,

452
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,200
to give me a chance.

453
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,650
If I meet someone who treats me sincerely,

454
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,000
my resentment can be soothed,

455
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,010
and I can reenter
the cycle of reincarnation.

456
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,400
But every time,

457
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,290
I was despised
for being stupid and clumsy.

458
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,480
Time after time, I got
isolated and rejected,

459
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,370
repeatedly chosen as a sacrifice.

460
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,930
They'd join forces and try to kill me
with that sword,

461
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,170
just like what you did.

462
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,410
So each time, the ones who died

463
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,330
were actually those who tried to kill you.

464
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,480
Testing human hearts again and again

465
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,440
has deepened my resentment.

466
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,380
No one has ever escaped from
the Courtyard of Mysteries.

467
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,440
Only tonight,

468
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,990
I met someone

469
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,790
who truly treated me as a friend.

470
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,830
I also experienced

471
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,920
what it feels like to have someone

472
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,750
act selflessly for me.

473
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,090
Xiao Yao.

474
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,830
Now that the strings are all in place,

475
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,240
how about I play a song

476
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,520
for you?

477
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,720
Ling Yi

478
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,300
and Rou Jia,

479
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,740
go serve at the Spirit Garment Pavilion;

480
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,720
Yun Qi

481
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,200
and Ling Yun—

482
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,040
the Spirit Spring Pavilion;

483
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,110
Ren Shu—

484
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,700
the Biexin Courtyard.

485
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,790
In today's trial,

486
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,350
one person stood out.

487
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,210
Xiao Yao,

488
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,010
you will replace Ying Ning

489
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,860
as the personal attendant
to the Immortal Lord.

490
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,790
I truly appreciate
the Immortal Lord's favor.

491
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,350
But I only entered
the Realm of Mist and Void

492
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,590
to take Hong Ye away.

493
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,640
I hope the Immortal Lord
will grant my wish.

494
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,440
Xiao Yao,

495
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,880
the chance to serve the Immortal Lord
up close is extremely rare.

496
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,880
Don't be foolish.

497
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,620
If there are other trials,

498
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,210
I'm willing to accept them.

499
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,550
I just hope the Immortal Lord
will let Hong Ye and me leave.

500
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,590
Alright then.

501
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,640
I'll report your words truthfully

502
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,030
to the Immortal Lord.

503
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,720
You may now go back to the flower sea
to water the flowers.

504
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,200
Yes.

505
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,790
Dali.

506
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,480
I'm here.

507
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,240
You are rewarded with the position

508
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,640
of personal attendant
to the Immortal Lord.

509
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,240
I'll serve the Immortal Lord
with all my heart.

510
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:23,180
[Lovely and intelligent]

511
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:25,480
Xiao Yao.

512
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,720
[Lovely and intelligent]

513
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,250
Why did you turn down
such a good opportunity?

514
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,710
I only want to rescue Hong Ye
and return to Demons' Valley.

515
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,200
At this point,

516
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,830
do you still think you can leave?

517
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,300
You've witnessed what
the Dreamshard Immortal is capable of.

518
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,560
We'll never be able to
get out of this Realm of Mist and Void.

519
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,590
Why not try

520
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,450
to make life better for yourself?

521
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,890
Congratulations.

522
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,370
Why do you always think you're right?

523
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,550
Hong Ye!

524
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,280
Hey!

525
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,190
Are you trying to drown me?

526
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,150
Little Leaf.

527
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,840
Can you sense

528
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,670
how Hong Ye is doing now?

529
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,920
Is he well?

530
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,070
He's fine.

531
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,980
Look, I'm even doing well here.

532
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,760
How could anything happen to him?

533
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,190
Can you summon him here one more time?

534
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,300
I've realized

535
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,760
you either try to drown me

536
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,400
or want me to commit suicide.

537
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,660
Who do you think I am?

538
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,590
I'm just a primordial spirit.

539
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,800
Every time I use my power,

540
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,890
I have to use all my strength.

541
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,050
You should know

542
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,440
the number of times I can use my power

543
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,760
is limited.

544
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,320
Hong Ye only sent me here

545
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,400
to protect you.

546
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,960
If I use my power recklessly,

547
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,880
I'll soon wither like dry grass.

548
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,850
Please don't cry, Xiao Yao.

549
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,840
Take care of yourself first,

550
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,720
so you can be there
when the moment comes to meet him.

551
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,800
Save your breath.

552
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,110
Go ahead and do it.

553
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,000
Are you really free of all attachments?

554
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,190
Is the wound on your face

555
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,510
healing well?

556
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,020
After I perish,

557
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,610
only my sister, Tan'er, will remain.

558
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,670
If you could show mercy, Miss Pianpian,

559
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:28,440
please spare her from
the torment of the Ghostly Fire.

560
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,700
My power is limited.

561
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,240
The Ghostly Fire

562
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,400
is formed from the vengeful spirits
of the unjustly dead,

563
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,600
and it fights endlessly with
the souls bound to the blade,

564
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,290
never ceasing.

565
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,760
Tan'er and you

566
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,360
share a similar fate.

567
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,840
I truly hope that someday,

568
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,220
you both can leave
this Realm of Mist and Void

569
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,040
and live the life you want.

570
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,070
How did my brother

571
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,480
really die?

572
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,710
He sacrificed his life for justice.

573
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,960
He was a hero.

574
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,920
I'm asking how he sacrificed himself
for justice

575
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,320
and who caused his death.

576
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,300
Since he was a Feiyu Guard,

577
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,000
was he killed by demons?

578
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,860
My answer remains the same.

579
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,670
If you truly want to know the truth,

580
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,320
help me find Tan'er.

581
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,720
After we slay the demonic spirits,

582
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,480
I will tell you everything in detail.

583
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,840
Why won't you give up?

584
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,030
As long as you can lure out
the Dreamshard's true form,

585
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,210
I can surely eliminate it.

586
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,550
Only by leaving
this Realm of Mist and Void

587
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,660
will you understand what you truly want

588
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,590
deep down.

589
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:53,840
Tan'er.

590
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:58,840
Tan'er?

591
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,240
Weren't you looking for my true form?

592
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,620
Here I am.

593
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,490
I was confused for a moment

594
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,820
and have let you down, My Lord.
