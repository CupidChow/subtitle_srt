[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:37,830
[Episode 27]

3
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:39,890
All these layers of yours here

4
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,789
have names.

5
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,710
One layer is called

6
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:47,310
saying one thing but meaning another.

7
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,640
Another layer is called

8
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,670
insincerity.

9
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:51,990
And another is called

10
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,789
being

11
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,759
too

12
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,479
proud

13
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,770
to admit things.

14
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,370
You've said so much,

15
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,310
as if you know me well.

16
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,630
You old demon...

17
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,729
You're just

18
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,520
cold on the outside but warm inside.

19
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,920
You should enjoy
the genuine love of this world—

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,430
with laughter

21
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,940
and tears,

22
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,030
so that your demon life be complete.

23
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,710
Are you truly

24
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,110
a human princess?

25
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,000
I...

26
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,000
am me.

27
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,079
But now I'm also not me right now.

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,190
In the past,

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,120
when reading,

30
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,079
I'd just read
whatever page the book opened to.

31
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,320
When walking,

32
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,680
I'd just follow

33
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,940
wherever the path led.

34
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,480
But now it's different.

35
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,450
I have people I want to protect.

36
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,690
I have things I really want to do.

37
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,000
Ning'an.

38
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,170
Ning'an.

39
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,250
What exactly do you want to do?

40
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,360
Receive the verbal decree:

41
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,360
last month, Princess Ning'an

42
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,910
trespassed into the palace several times

43
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,310
and defied the royal will,

44
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,760
setting a bad example
for the ladies of the inner palace.

45
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,400
From today onward,

46
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,630
Princess Ning'an

47
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,910
must diligently study

48
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,360
and practice swordsmanship daily.

49
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,690
This serves as a warning

50
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,150
to all ladies of the inner palace

51
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,709
to observe proper decorum in all actions.

52
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,920
By imperial order.

53
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,750
Thank you, Father.

54
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,720
A teacher's guidance

55
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,180
must not be taken lightly.

56
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,210
I humbly accept

57
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,880
and will reflect upon it day and night.

58
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,720
If I have any shortcomings,

59
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,630
I will promptly correct them.

60
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,050
A tear-essence...

61
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,750
A tear-essence...

62
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,410
Will reading these books

63
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,810
make you a good princess?

64
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,680
Where did this come from?

65
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,840
I passed through a plum forest

66
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,160
and saw that even in bitter cold,

67
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,510
its fragrance still spread everywhere.

68
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,070
I thought it suited you well,

69
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,270
so I picked it for you.

70
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,230
Thank you.

71
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,720
Wait,

72
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,710
I have something for you too.

73
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,860
Look at this book.

74
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,760
Isn't it touching?

75
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,030
Yes.

76
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,340
It's touching.

77
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,680
Look.

78
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,890
Let me read it to you.

79
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,320
The two people meet at the tower,

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,200
gazing at each other with tearful eyes.

81
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,400
Before parting,

82
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,040
they made a vow:

83
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:54,870
in life,

84
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,600
though they could not share a bed,

85
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,240
in death

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,800
they would share the same grave.

87
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,360
But Shanbo

88
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,890
fell ill with worry

89
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,170
and soon passed away.

90
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,550
Yingtai,

91
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,670
shocked by the terrible news,

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,310
was overwhelmed with grief.

93
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,930
When she went
to pay respects at his grave,

94
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,950
her deep sorrow

95
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,870
touched the heavens.

96
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,310
Aren't you touched?

97
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,680
I am.

98
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,120
Yes.

99
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,850
Wind, rain, thunder and lightning erupted.

100
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,920
The grave split open.

101
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,500
Yingtai gracefully leapt into the grave.

102
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,650
Seriously!

103
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,410
I'm touched.

104
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,390
Don't be sad.

105
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,380
The story's all made up.

106
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,560
One.

107
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,750
Two.

108
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,160
Three.

109
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:29,920
Four.

110
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,040
Where's five?

111
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,620
You've been practicing this set for days,

112
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,400
yet you show no improvement.

113
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,120
Raise your hands higher.

114
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,380
Keep your lower body steady. Don't move.

115
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,360
I hear Your Highness

116
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,250
wants to leave Yong'an Palace
by your own abilities.

117
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,010
With your current attitude...

118
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,890
Watch your stance.

119
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,070
With that attitude of yours,

120
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,670
even after a few more years of practice,

121
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,750
I doubt you'll ever leave Yong'an Palace.

122
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,080
It won't take that long.

You...

126

Sir!

127
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:25,590
Sir!

128
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,300
Are you...

129
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,910
Careful, careful.

130
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:28,870
Sir, are you...

131
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,740
Sir, are you all right?

132
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,750
I'm fine.

133
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,130
Continue practicing.

134
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,020
-Sir, that was careless of you.
-Take me to the imperial physician.

[Yong'an Palace]

136
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,120
Are you okay?

137
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,660
Karma really caught up with you.

138
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,740
That wasn't intentional.

139
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,000
Are you okay?

140
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,480
Why did you catch the sword
with your hand?

141
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,160
Your book says

142
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,960
human men and women
should avoid physical contact.

143
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,630
That doesn't mean you catch a sword
with your bare hand.

144
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,790
You'll get hurt!

145
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,670
It's fine.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,390
If you fell, you would feel pain,

147
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,720
but I have power protecting me,

148
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,030
such a small injury
isn't worth worrying about.

149
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,430
So what if you have power?

150
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,510
Not worrying about it doesn't mean
you won't get hurt.

151
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,400
You're angry.

152
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,510
What do you think?

153
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,270
A whole group of Feiyu Guards
couldn't hurt you,

154
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,840
yet you get injured with me.

155
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,770
Should I call you stupid or...

156
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,020
just plain stupid?

157
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,010
Let's go.

158
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,270
Compared to the Feiyu Guard,

159
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,930
you're much more formidable.

161
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,470
We haven't been allowed
into the bedchamber for days.

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,150
She's been talking to herself...

163
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,670
Could it be—

164
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,390
Don't talk nonsense.

165
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,150
Her Highness has become
much more cheerful lately.

166
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,680
She's brought so much life
to Yong'an Palace.

167
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,650
Let's pretend we didn't see that.

168

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,460
It's really fine.

171
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,450
Don't talk.

172
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,180
Don't do things like this again.

173
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,430
Yes.

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,340
Cute, isn't it?

175
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,720
This is the most beautiful sunset
I've ever seen.

176
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,900
Because it's high up?

177
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,250
It's because you're here.

178
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,850
Release.

179
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,670
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

180
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,440
It's just an arrow—

181
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,170
why would you need to shield me?

182

184
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,960
You've trespassed into the palace

185
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,760
and taken the princess hostage.

00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,600
Today,

00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,650
you will be executed!

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,540
I invited the Demon King here.

189
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,170
He did not trespass.

190

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,880
Princess,

194
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,580
you were already punished with confinement

195
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,780
for speaking in favor of demons before.

196
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
Now you're colluding with demons again—

197
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,010
are you planning treason?

198
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,940
I will explain to my father myself.

199
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,400
Let the Demon King go

200
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,240
and you won't be implicated.

201
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,970
You go first.

202
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,960
Indeed,
I have taken Princess Ning'an hostage.

203
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,440
If any of you dares to move,

204
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,400
I will kill her.

205
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,390
You couldn't stop me anyway.

206
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,600
Now you want to needlessly risk
the princess's life as well?

207
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,530
Can you bear that responsibility?

208
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,270
Hong Ye!

209
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,230
If you dare

210
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,740
harm the princess today,

211
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,870
Tiansheng Kingdom

212
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,440
will mobilize its entire force

213
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,840
to slaughter all demons!

214
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,580
Instead of being this princess
in name only,

215
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,600
how about you come with me
outside the palace

216
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,660
to see the scenery.

217
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,100
As you wish.

218
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,610
Demon King Hong Ye,

219
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,020
full of evil deeds,

220
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
broke into Yong'an Palace,

221
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,770
took the Princess hostage,

222
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,370
and forced us

223
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,570
to submit to demons.

224
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,070
The Feiyu Guards

225
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,290
are loyal and brave.

226
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,600
None of us surrendered to the demons.

227
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,890
But as a result, the Princess

228
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,280
was taken by the Demon King.

229
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,270
[Emperor Ning'an]

230
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:06,890
We

231
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,510
deserve death for our failure.

232
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,650
We beg Your Majesty

233
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,480
to punish us.

234
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,440
What is your name?

235
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,120
I am

236
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,910
Wang Hong.

237
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,480
What good strategy do you have?

238
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,830
I believe

239
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,960
the more arrogant the demons become,

240
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,290
the more

241
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,050
decisive our actions must be.

242
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,610
I boldly request

243
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,640
Your Majesty to allow

244
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,640
the Feiyu Guard to expand its forces

245
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,150
to form a righteous army,

246
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,550
and attack the demon's lair

247
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,880
to rescue the princess.

248
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,000
You lost my princess

249
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,120
but now you want more men and money?

250
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,850
Granted.

251
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,920
Wang Hong.

252
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,680
From today on,

253
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,000
you are appointed the Deputy Demon Slayer
of the Feiyu Guard.

254
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,880
Command all Feiyu Guards across regions,

255
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,100
locate the demon's lair,

256
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,560
and eliminate the demons—

257
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,990
to rescue the princess.

258
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,960
I

259
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,090
accept the decree.

260
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,090
You have one month to complete this.

261
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,740
Our

262
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,560
princess who's confined in the cold palace

263
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,420
has created quite an opportunity

264
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,120
for the Feiyu Guard.

265
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,380
Isn't that right,

266
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,970
Deputy Demon Slayer Hong?

267
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,580
It's all thanks to you,

268
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,840
My Lord, and your brilliant strategy.

269
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,870
I, Wang Hong,

270
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,220
am completely devoted

271
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,870
to you, My Lord.

272
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,360
My position as Deputy Demon Slayer

273
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,550
exists only to serve you better.

274
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,670
For example,

276
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,020
who died fighting the demons.

the plum blossoms from?

278
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,680

relieve depression,

368
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,560
generate fluids, and quench thirst.

370
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,410

373
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,440

you've liked them since you were little.

00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,970
They really are delicious.

375
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,480
Sir, I'll take a bag.

376
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,070
Here.

377
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:30,550
Hong Ye,

378
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,600
what's the most delicious thing
you've ever eaten?

379
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,770
It's not humans, is it?

380
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,190
Tell me,

381
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,200
over thousands of years,

382
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,640
how many people have you eaten?

383
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,210
Confess now!

384
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,720
Okay.

385
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,650
I confess.

386
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,350
You've really eaten humans before?

387
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,880
Do you know,

388
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,960
the demons who died at human hands

389
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,070
far outnumber the humans
who died at the hands

390
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,880
of demons?

391
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,480
You're only talking about

392
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,990
the royal family obsessed
with immortality and demon hunters.

393
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,350
Look at these ordinary people
on the street.

394
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,160
Many of them may have never seen
a demon in their entire lives.

395
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,630
They just want to live their own lives.

396
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,170
Many demons are the same, aren't they?

397
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,570
If everyone could just live peacefully,

398
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,040
why must there be
such hostility between us?

399
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,840
Hong Ye,

400
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,080
will you promise me something?

401
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,600
Go ahead.

402
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,650
Demons eat people—

403
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,370
yet you do not.

404
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,140
In the eyes of many humans,

405
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,460
all demons

406
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,550
are born to eat people.

407
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,860
So whether I eat humans or not,

408
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,570
it makes no difference.

409
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,740
Don't you want to break these prejudices?

410
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,300
Of course I do.

411
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,080
Resolving the conflict
between our two races

412
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,500
is easier said than done.

413
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,560
We can start with small steps.

414
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,000
-Maybe in a hundred years...
-Demon!

415
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,660
There's a demon!

416
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,830
A demon is eating people!

417
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,510
Demon!

418
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,240
There's a demon!

419
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,880
[Heal the World]

420
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,720
Madam.

421
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,040
Madam, wake up.

422
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,000
Please wake up, Madam.

423
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,430
I've spent half my life saving people,

424
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,190
yet I couldn't save you.

425
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,400
Liu, Liu...

426
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,510
-Hanxiang and I treated you so well.
-I want to see.

427
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,050
Why did you do this?

428
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,960
If you had a problem,
you should have come to me!

429
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,880
Liu!

430
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,480
Let me go!

431
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,720
Let me go!

432
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,650
Where is the demon?

433
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,250
That's him.

434
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,740
He's clearly human.

435
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,710
Liu

436
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,200
is a servant at the clinic.

437
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,800
He's been here for over a decade.

438
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,530
He's always been an honest man.

439
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,560
Just now, he suddenly went mad,

440
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,480
grabbed a kitchen knife,
and started slashing people.

441
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,540
He killed the mistress of the clinic.

442
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,430
If the officers hadn't arrived,

443
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,630
who knows how many more would have died.

444
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,140
Liu,

445
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,190
he usually avoids
even seeing chickens being killed.

446
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,520
This sudden madness...

447
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,710
Could he be possessed by a demon?

448
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,210
Demons are eating people!

449
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,770
Demons are eating people!

450
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,490
Move aside!

451
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,130
Eating people?

452
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,090
Being a demon is such busy work.

453
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,970
Demons are eating people!

454
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,960
Demons are eating people!

455
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,530
Move!

456
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,070
Help!

457
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,510
Stop!

458
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,000
Help me!

459
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,740
Where is the demon?

460
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,640
The demon is behind!

461
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,300
Back there!

462
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,200
My Lord.

463
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,610
It's my son's wedding night today.

464
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,440
W-We were drinking until midnight

465
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,890
and had just sent him
to the bridal chamber.

466
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:49,960
[Jin Jr.'s Father]

467
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,040
Then we heard a scream from inside.

468
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,760
When we went to check,

469
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,260
only my son remained in the room.

470
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,590
[Jin Jr.] [Jin Jr.'s Mother]

471
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,030
The bride was gone.

472
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,400
Did you see any demon?

473
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,350
No.

474
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,000
Who took the bride?

475
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,210
A demon!

476
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,440
Think carefully before you speak.

477
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,770
So the officers can help find your bride.

478
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,210
Take us to the bridal chamber.

479
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,110
Let's go.

480
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,430
Come on, move.

481
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,590
Let's go, hurry up.

482
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,030
Want to go take a look?

483
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,590
It's probably another robbery and murder

484
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,200
with demons taking the blame.

485
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

486
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,740
I'd like to take a look.

487
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,370
Mother is here.

488
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,240
It hurts?

489
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:42,640
Look at this.

490
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,390
[Happiness]

491
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,890
Look at the blood on the floor.

492
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,740
And the window.

493
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:50,880
If...

494
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,240
If it wasn't a demon,

495
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,190
who could have taken

496
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,730
a living person away?

497
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,020
Indeed.

498
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,030
Tigers and leopards

499
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,880
can't enter the city.

500
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,310
Until we find a body,

501
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,830
we can only call it a missing person case.

502
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,240
We need to investigate thoroughly

503
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,970
before reaching a conclusion.

504
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:10,890
But...

505
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,500
Well...

506
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,190
With this much blood loss,

507
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,550
the person couldn't have survived.

508
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,210
Regardless of what happened,

509
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,200
we must investigate
before making any conclusions.

510
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,070
Yes, yes.

511
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,590
This Jin family's son has such bad luck.

512
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,450
He married someone two years ago,

513
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,550
and just days after the wedding,

514
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,880
the bride disappeared.

515
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,640
Could it be

516
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,750
she was also eaten by a demon?

517
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,530
Exactly!

518
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,110
Could demons really have eaten her?

519
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,180
No way.

520
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,660
Let's go. Case solved.

521
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,090
Let's go take a look.

522
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,070
The old couple didn't see how

523
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,400
the bride disappeared.

524
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,440
They didn't search for her

525
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,500
but assumed she was dead.

526
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,960
And the groom was

527
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,480
shouting all over town
about demons eating people.

528
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,280
It's as if he wanted everyone to know.

529
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,400
When the officials came to question them,

530
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,680
they hemmed and hawed,

531
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,640
stuttered,

532
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,640
and gave irrelevant answers.

533
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,500
They clearly
had no intention of finding the bride.

534
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,310
And another thing—

535
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:03,410
[Happiness]

536
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,640
the bridal chamber was a wreck,

537
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,330
but the furnishings
and utensils were quite valuable.

538
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,790
If the bride was truly eaten by a demon,

539
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,200
why were her jewelry and accessories
still neatly placed on the table?

540
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,460
There's blood on the walls and floor,

541
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,730
yet why is that brocade quilt

542
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,970
completely clean?

543
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,790
Those valuable items

544
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,720
were all part of the bride's dowry.

545
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,750
Other than what's shown,

546
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,110
they must have been given
other things too.

547
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,920
Pawning this dowry into silver

548
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,640
would be enough
for the family to change their identities

549
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,560
and start a new life elsewhere.

550
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,880
You've heard it too.

551
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,200
The groom was married before years ago,

552
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,060
and that bride also disappeared.

553
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,230
He's just an experienced criminal.

554
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,680
You claim you've never left the palace,

555
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
yet how do you know so much about

556
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,750
these worldly, sordid schemes?

557
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,640
You seem more like someone who has lived

558
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,640
among common people for a long time.

559
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,310
I...

560
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,470
I've read many books.

561
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,920
Books describe human nature
and the ways of the world.

562
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,590
The most important thing for us now

563
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,390
is to find out where the bride is.

564
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,240
Either we see her alive,

565
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,700
or we need to find her body.

566
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,350
What you said might be right,

567
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,860
but you missed something.

568
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,000
There really were demons
in the bridal chamber.

569
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,460
And there's more than one.

570
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,360
Why didn't I see it?

571
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,960
Where were they?

572
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,790
Where?

573
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,250
Sometimes what your eyes see
isn't the truth.

574
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,110
Maybe there's more to the truth.

575
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,850
Let's make a bet.

576
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,200
I'll go find the murderer
of the hospital murder.

577
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,000
You go find the bride.

578
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,310
Let's see who's faster.

579
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,170
What's the bet?

580
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,070
Winner gets to request the loser
to do something,

581
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,510
and the loser can't refuse.

582
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,110
Okay.

583
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,480
Pinky swear.

584
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,680
The Hong Ye from one hundred years ago

585
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,480
was so competitive?

586
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,390
Interesting.

587
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,270
Dr. Zhang.

588
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,190
You have family matters to attend to.

589
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,110
Why don't you close the clinic for today?

590
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,590
These are just minor ailments.

591
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,240
If my wife's spirit is watching,

592
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,300
she would want

593
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,500
me to take good care of my patients

594
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,790
rather than dwelling

595
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,640
in sorrow.

596
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,970
Here's your prescription.

597
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,900
Dr. Zhang.

598
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,590
You and your wife were truly good people.

599
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,850
May your wife's spirit

600
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,410
watch over you.

601
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,440
Thank you. Take care.

602
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,920
Next patient.

603
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,270
Young sir,

604
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,210
what seems to be troubling you?

605
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,070
Chest tightness?

606
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,740
You mean

607
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,920
chest pain?

608
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,400
Sir,

609
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,790
what exactly is bothering you?

610
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,880
It's gone.

611
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,060
What's gone?

612
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,960
Conscience.

613
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,680
The conscience is gone.

614
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,440
Young sir,

615
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,050
stop pulling my leg.

616
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,130
There are many patients waiting.

617
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,130
How is your father-in-law lately?

618
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,180
Sir,

619
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,450
are you acquainted with him?

620
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Not at all.

621
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,110
If you're not ill,

622
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,970
please stop joking with me.

623
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,790
To send your benefactor's daughter

624
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,990
to her death.

625
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,670
Where has your conscience gone?

626
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,770
He killed her?

627
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,110
What?

628
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,440
Is that true?

629
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,550
He said he killed her.

630
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,080
What are you talking about?

631
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,250
I don't understand at all.

632
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,880
From a second-rate street doctor

633
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,140
to owning the largest clinic in town now—

634
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,750
it's all thanks to your wealthy merchant
father-in-law's support.

635
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,580
Now

636
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,480
you had an affair with another woman

637
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,830
and your wife found out.

638
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,330
You were afraid she would tell her father.

639
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,530
So you used your servant, Liu.

640
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,070
You brewed him a tonic

641
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,920
claiming it was
for strengthening his body,

642
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,680
but it actually worsened his insomnia,

643
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
caused him excitement

644
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,140
and even hallucinations.

645
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,790
You knew very well

646
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,440
that a person who doesn't sleep for days

647
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,440
is capable of doing anything.

648
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,880
So after a big fight with your wife,

649
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,070
you locked her up

650
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,870
with the mentally unstable Liu.

651
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,350
This

652
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,810
is the prescription you wrote for Liu.

653
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,070
Nonsense!

654
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,640
You're making things up.

655
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,830
Still trying to deny it?

656
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,650
Do I need to lay out
all the evidence piece by piece?

657
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:16,960
Go ahead.

658
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,320
I have nothing to hide.

659
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,160
You have a hunched back,

660
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,270
chronic ailments,

661
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,720
and you cough when agitated—

662
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,030
all problems you developed
when you were young.

663
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,830
This shows you came from poverty,

664
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,920
too poor to treat even minor illnesses.

665
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,150
And that handkerchief of yours—

666
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,480
it's clearly a woman's,

667
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,680
with traces of rouge on it.

668
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,550
But it's new.

669
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,590
This indicates that the woman
you're having an affair with

670
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,110
has been with you

671
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,440
for about three months.

672
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,830
Now you no longer have

673
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,030
the initial nervousness and concerns.

674
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,510
She can now start leaving

675
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,910
personal items with you.

676
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,750
When your father-in-law was mentioned,

677
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,590
you clenched your fists,

678
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,720
showing your anger.

679
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,950
Your raised eyebrows
show vigilance and fear.

680
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,070
But you don't feel the slightest pain

681
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,680
for your wife's passing.

682
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,239
That bedding is very soft,

683
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,610
clearly used daily,

684
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,400
suggesting you've been separated
from your wife for a long time.

685
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,280
The smash marks

686
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,710
on this table and chair

687
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,639
are still fresh.

688
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:18,710
Why?

689
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,760
It's still there,

690
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,489
but it has turned black.

691
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,210
You did the evil,

692
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,050
yet you blame the demons for it.

693
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,880
Today,

694
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,320
I will bring justice for your wife,

695
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,360
Liu, and the demons.

696
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,630
Heartless!

697
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,050
Utterly immoral!

698
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,890
If his wife had agreed to him
taking a concubine,

699
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,750
would she not have died unjustly?

700
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,540
That wouldn't happen.

701
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,630
The woman he was having an affair with

702
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,690
was his father-in-law's concubine.

703
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,810
You deserve worse than death!

704
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,280
I have one last question.

705
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,440
The prescription he wrote for Liu—

706
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,550
how did you find it?

707
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,810
He was just being guilty.

708
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,490
With one bluff, he confessed.

709
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,100
Have you really never left the palace?

710
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,480
Yes.

711
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,440
You're very experienced

712
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,480
and well-versed in social dynamics.

713
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,280
You're good at dealing with villains—

714
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,840
you feel like a swindler.

715
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,610
Talent—

716
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,410
this is called talent.

717
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,670
You lost.

718
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,200
You must do one thing for me.

719
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,430
How do you know I lost?

720
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,480
You found the bride?

721
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,680
Of course I found her.

722
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,410
Why else would I come to you?

723
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,150
Where is she?

724
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,150
Take me to her now.

725
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:34,710
Miss.

726
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,030
Is this the missing bride?

727
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,590
Are you trying to fool me?

728
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,480
Young master,

729
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,360
my childhood name is Cui.

730
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,030
Since childhood, I've wanted to leave home
to pursue immortal cultivation.

731
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,630
I didn't want to deal
with worldly affairs,

732
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,030
and especially didn't want to be bound
by marriage.

733
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,670
But my family wouldn't allow it.

734
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,000
That's why I found Jin's family

735
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,460
and arranged this scheme.

736
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,110
They kept the dowry,

737
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,280
and I gained my freedom.

738
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,680
We both got what we wanted

739
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,430
without hurting anyone.

740
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,150
Please keep my secret

741
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
and spare my life.

742
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,440
Miss,

743
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,960
your parents raised you your entire life.

744
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,030
To them,

745
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,400
they don't know if you're still alive.

746
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,430
They will spend

747
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,630
the rest of their lives
in pain and regret.

748
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,550
Isn't this

749
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,810
more heartbreaking
than leaving without saying goodbye?

750
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,030
My parents only care about their sons,

751
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,000
not me.

752
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,450
If my parents treated me
like how Jin treats his son,

753
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,090
perhaps I wouldn't think
about leaving home every day.

754
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,000
I won't go!

755
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,360
I don't want to go anywhere!

756
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,160
Son.

757
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,070
The officials finally left.

758
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,440
We need to leave quickly.

759
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,400
I won't go!

760
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,030
There are demons everywhere outside!

761
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,030
I'm not going anywhere! I refuse!

762
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,150
If we don't leave now, it'll be too late.

763
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:04,550
Hurry!

764
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,550
You have no choice. Let's go!

765
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,590
Help! Help!

766
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,710
Don't attract attention.

767
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,710
You've got the dowry and valuables.

768
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,800
Why haven't you left yet?

769
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,060
There are demons everywhere outside.

770
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,390
I'm not going anywhere.

771
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,080
You say you're afraid of demons,

772
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,810
but what are you?

773
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,320
What else could I be?

774
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,830
I'm human, of course.

775
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:33,960
Is that so?

776
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,070
Demon!

777
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:47,840
Demon!

778
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,210
Demonic art!

779
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:50,920
You...

780
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,800
You're deceiving me!

781
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,000
You're deceiving me!

782
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,030
Demonic arts!

783
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,920
Demonic arts!

784
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,720
Demonic arts!

785
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,340
Stop deceiving yourself.

786
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,210
Don't be afraid, my son.

787
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,330
All of you are chipmunks?

788
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,760
Are you two

789
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,030
demon-hunting immortals?

790
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,110
Our family has lived among humans

791
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,960
without harming anyone.

792
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,360
Please be merciful

793
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,650
and spare our lives.

794
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,280
I am Hong Ye, the Monarch of All Demons.

795
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,320
My duty

796
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,840
is to protect all demons.
