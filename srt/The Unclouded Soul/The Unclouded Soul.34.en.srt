[The Unclouded Soul]

2
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,789
[Episode 34]

3
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,560
My wish is

4
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,000
to see Hong Ye again.

5
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,770
When did you arrive?

6
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,970
I was just passing by

7
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,610
and saw you standing here alone.

8
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,210
My wounds have healed completely.

9
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,570
I came to thank you.

10
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,890
Where's my gift?

11
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,320
A thank-you isn't sincere without a gift.

12
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,150
This is...?

13
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,640
This is a mermaid pearl.

14
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,400
It holds great life energy.

15
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,490
In times of crisis,

16
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,890
it can save your life.

17
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,340
I know your power is strong,

18
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,500
but just in case.

19
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,350
So, you're saying that

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,730
you just happened to come here,

21
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,640
today just happens to be my birthday,

22
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,770
you just happened to have a gift with you,

23
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,240
and this bracelet

24
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,100
just happens to fit me perfectly?

25
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,610
This might just be

26
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,110
fate.

27
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,190
The merfolk are known for bad tempers.

28
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,750
I imagine this mermaid pearl

29
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,010
wasn't easy to obtain.

30
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,020
We barely know each other.

31
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:22,400
Why would I deliberately

32
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,200
prepare a birthday gift for you?

33
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,530
I, Ao Hen, repay kindness

34
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,800
and avenge grudges.

35
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,740
Don't read too much into it.

36
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,240
Thank you for your gift.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,850
Xiao Yao!

38
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,310
It's my birthday today.

39
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,310
I won't accept any challenges

40
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,570
or get into any fights.

41
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,470
Of course I know it's your birthday.

42
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,070
I came especially
to bring you a birthday gift.

43
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,080
No wonder he couldn't
catch up to the Dragon Lord.

44
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,670
Look at this Heaven-Shattering Hammer.

45
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,340
It's forged from a meteor.

46
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,640
One strike

47
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,640
can flatten a small mountain.

48
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,019
And this...

49
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,240
The Adamant Shield

50
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,760
is forged from Que Mountain crystal.

51
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,520
It can attack

52
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,200
and defend.

53
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,730
Attack and defend.

54
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,590
It can...

55
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,390
Can...

56
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,540
It's just a pot.

57
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,159
You'll definitely like this one.

58
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,540
This is the Golden Chiming Spear,

59
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,220
one of my favorites.

60
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,440
A thrust sounds like a phoenix cry.

61
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,880
A sweeping strike...

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
sounds like a dragon's roar.

63
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,950
What an awful sound.

64
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,350
How could you liken that
to a dragon's roar?

65
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,180
Thank you.

66
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,800
But do you think

67
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,310
I still need weapons?

68
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,310
Of course these weapons

69
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,630
are prepared for weaker species.

70
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,800
Great demons like us don't need them.

71
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,600
Just treat them as accessories.

72
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,230
Though your power is strong,

73
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,640
you're small in stature.

74
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,120
Holding these

75
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,870
looks more impressive
than being empty-handed.

76
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,400
It'll make others fear you.

77
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,090
I appreciate the thought.

78
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,870
There's more.

79
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,670
This bow

80
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,480
is said to have been
left behind by Hou Yi.

81
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,920
Just channel your power
into the bowstring,

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,780
and even without arrows,
it can pierce heavy armor.

83
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,920
That's right.

84
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,120
Channel your power into the bowstring.

85
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,090
Decide on a target in your mind.

86
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,600
Yao!

87
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,350
Disperse!

88
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,800
Are you okay?

89
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,570
Yao,

90
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,810
for your birthday,

91
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,560
are you planning to kill
a great demon for entertainment?

92
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,860
Why so petty?

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,330
I didn't hurt you, did I?

94
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,920
I haven't finished the one
you gave me last time,

95
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,480
and now you're bringing a new one again.

96
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,880
Didn't we make a promise?

97
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,560
To enjoy good food
and drinks together forever?

98
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,920
When I find something good,

99
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,000
I'll bring it to you right away.

100
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,680
Hmm.

101
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,920
Forever?

102
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,420
Of course.

103
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,630
That's my promise with Yao.

104
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,240
Long Zhi.

105
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,930
Set the table.

106
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,300
I'll share this fine wine with these two.

107
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,430
Thank you both for coming to celebrate
my birthday today.

108
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,560
I, Xiao Yao, toast to you both.

109
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,480
Yao.

110
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,700
He's not the one you have feelings for,
is he?

111
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,480
He's just a brute

112
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,120
who isn't worthy of you at all.

113
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,380
What are you thinking?

114
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,510
Xiao Yao,

115
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,850
even if you have someone you fancy,

116
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,920
you should still be mindful of your status
as a dragon.

117
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,560
If we're talking about suitable matches,

118
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,480
us vine serpents

119
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,530
at least share ancestry with the dragons.

120
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,070
But you Qiongqis

121
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,750
are simply

122
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,560
worlds apart from us.

123
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,380
You

124
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,480
have never taken cultivation seriously,

125
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,270
and only know how to play all day.

126
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,270
How dare you claim shared ancestry?

127
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,510
No matter how high one's cultivation,

128
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,120
without true spiritual connection,

129
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,410
you'll eventually part ways anyway.

130
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,870
She's an Azure Dragon.

131
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,920
Being with you

132
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,320
would only hold her back!

133
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,800
Who are you?

134
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,130
Why do you get to decide?

135
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,920
Enough, both of you!

136
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,360
He spits in my face every time.

137
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,580
So what if he spits in your face?

138
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,120
You're spitting in the food!

139
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,780
Who told you to spit? Sit down!

140
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,010
Sit down!

141
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,390
It's my birthday today.

142
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,050
Are you here to cause trouble?

143
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,100
If you really want to give me gifts,

144
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,270
then go find things I haven't seen before.

145
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,670
Something fresh and new.

146
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,920
We've all lived for thousands of years.

147
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,830
What could there be that we haven't seen?

148
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,630
That depends on your abilities.

149
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,000
Yao,

150
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,040
then does that

151
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,170
Lantern Grass from last time count?

152
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,680
It does.

153
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,810
But this time I want something newer.

154
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,190
No problem.

155
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:16,870
Wait for me-

156
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Goodbye, Yao!

157
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,750
Goodbye.

158
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,540
Xiao Yao.

159
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,890
Don't worry.

160
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,380
Before your birthday ends,

161
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,980
I'll definitely find something for you.

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,130
Oh my heavens.

163
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,270
Happy birthday, Dragon Lord!

164
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,840
We've been preparing for days

165
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,170
and hope you'll like it.

166
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,390
Come in!

167
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,150
What is this?

168
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
You said you wanted to find some humans,

169
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,040
so we

170
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,400
arranged a little performance for you.

171
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,840
This is the final trial.

172
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,440
When only one is left standing,

173
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,000
the trial will be completed.

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,630
Begin.

175
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,730
Long Zhi!

176
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,600
These three

177
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,390
killed their way through a hundred humans.

178
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,480
They're considered quite capable
among the humans.

179
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,360
Killed?

180
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,910
We captured a hundred humans

181
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,860
and told them only one would live.

182
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,440
If they live, they get to serve
the Dragon Lord.

183
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,030
Being able to serve the Dragon Lord alive

184
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,430
is their greatest honor.

185
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,480
Hong Ye!

186
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,220
Biting off more than you can chew.

187
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,910
Quick, put him on the bed.

188
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,790
Do it now!

189
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,480
Dragon Lord.

190
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,440
Humans are weak.

191
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,670
If you force power into him

192
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,480
in his current condition,

193
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,610
he definitely won't be able to take it.

194
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,440
What should we do then?

195
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
I didn't expect him to be so fragile.

196
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,310
Dragon Lord,

197
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,670
what's so special about this human

198
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,400
that you care so much about him?

199
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,760
I only punished him
because he offended you.

200
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,910
Please forgive me, Dragon Lord.

201
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,670
Dragon Lord,

202
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,530
humans are weak and have short lives.

203
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,390
Even if you save him,

204
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,620
he won't live long.

205
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,290
Whether he lives or dies

206
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,930
is for Heaven to decide,

207
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,200
not you or me.

208
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,960
But-

209
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,710
You claim to protect all beings,

210
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,570
yet you never count humans among them.

211
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,750
When demons treat humans this way,

212
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,680
have you ever thought about karma?

213
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,180
One day in the future,

214
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,310
humans will treat demons the same way.

215
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,910
Humans are lowly and incapable.

216
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,910
How could they ever be above demons?

217
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,510
You said yourself you wanted a human.

218
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,240
We were just following orders.

219
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,960
Were we wrong for that?

220
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,480
Leave.

221
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,670
But this is your bedchamber.

222
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,030
How can we leave him here?

223
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,550
Let's go.

224
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,200
What?

225
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,790
It's just a human.

226
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,350
If the Dragon Lord likes him,
let her be.

227
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,000
But tribulation is so dangerous.

228
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,510
Even the Dragon Lord has lost her mind.

229
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,240
When it's my turn to face tribulation,

230
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,900
will I even be able to survive?

231
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,360
Relax.

232
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
Your tribulation

233
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,200
won't come for another thousand years.

234
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,600
According to the Dragon Lord,

235
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,440
by then,

236
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,270
humans will be more powerful than you

237
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,930
and will have already captured you
as a servant.

live in her own chamber

272
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,430
and moved herself to a side hall.

273
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,650
He's just a mere human.

274
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,120
Why is the Dragon Lord
treating him so well?

275
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,240
If you ask me,

276
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,360
the Dragon Lord just thinks

277
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,320
keeping cats or dogs is too boring,

278
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,700
so she's keeping a human as a pet instead.

279
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,840
Hong Ye.

280
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,090
Hong Ye.

281
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,460
You're awake.

282
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,170
Your fever has gone down.

283
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,700
When did you wake up?

284
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,350
Why didn't saying anything?

285
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,000
Here,

286
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,360
drink some water.

287
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,070
Are you alright?

288
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,300
Don't come closer!

289
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,520
Why do you always want to kill me?

290
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,670
Why?

291
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,390
Why do you think?

292
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,520
You demons force humans

293
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,950
to kill each other for your amusement.

294
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,410
Thousands of people have died
by your hands.

295
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,960
Don't you deserve to die?

296
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:05,750
Come.

297
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,359
Drink some water first.

298
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,819
I don't want it!

299
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,400
They say

300
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
the winner

301
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,730
gets the honor of serving the Dragon Lord.

302
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,069
I would rather die

303
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:28,640
than accept such an honor.

304
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,880
Then die.

305
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,960
I'll watch.

306
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,370
You still have unfinished business,

307
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,430
and aren't willing to die now, right?

308
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,440
Whether you have someone you miss

309
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,740
or a revenge unpaid,

310
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,830
they're all reasons for you to stay alive.

311
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,640
Otherwise, you wouldn't still be standing

312
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,500
after fighting a hundred others.

313
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,270
My revenge

314
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,390
is the revenge of all humans.

315
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,320
Then heal yourself first

316
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,150
before thinking about revenge.

317
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,040
You are the Dragon Lord.

318
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,920
You're allowing me
to seek revenge against the demons?

319
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,030
What do you want?

320
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,130
What do you think I want from you?

321
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,540
Now I can understand

322
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,110
how Hong Ye felt
when he first entered Demons' Valley.

323
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,640
Hong Ye.

324
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,310
You've just barely survived.

325
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,590
Why are you moving around?

326
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,590
Just lie down.

327
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,180
With this body of mine,

328
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,020
I can't serve the Dragon Lord anyway.

329
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,750
There's no purpose in keeping me alive.

330
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,550
Let me go.

331
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,520
You're not to leave
until you're fully recovered.

332
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,930
I have more important things to do.

333
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,440
I must leave.

334
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,270
Hong Ye.

335
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,680
I saved your life.

336
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,930
You need to repay this debt, right?

337
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,640
What exactly do you want?

338
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,150
Heal your wounds and then go.

339
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,790
If you want to recover faster,

340
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,160
you need to walk around.

341
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,330
I can walk by myself.

342
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,750
Then you have to be careful.

343
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,070
If you get hurt,

344
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,000
I'll have to take care of you again.

345
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,370
I don't need your care.

346
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,750
Hong Ye!

347
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,950
The Dragon Lord is too nice to that human.

348
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,710
Good thing it's just a surface wound.

349
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,840
Otherwise, you'd be suffering again.

350
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,920
Why?

351
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,500
Why are you treating me like this?

352
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,720
You're not killing me

353
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,480
or letting me leave,

354
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,940
and you even take such good care of me.

355
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,640
I really don't understand.

356
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,750
Perhaps the fate between us

357
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,210
has not yet run its course.

358
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,150
Perhaps one day, humans will

359
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,040
be stronger than demons.

360
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,220
If that day comes,

361
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,490
I hope you'll remember our bond

362
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,250
and not try to stab me again.

363
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,290
Stronger than demons.

364
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,720
Yes.

365
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,110
True strength doesn't
come from external power,

366
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,470
but from within.

367
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,720
Since humans exist in this world,

368
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,520
they must have their strengths.

369
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,700
Otherwise,

370
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,070
with demons oppressing humans for so long,

371
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,130
humans would have vanished long ago.

372
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,910
Isn't that right?

373
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,540
From now on,

374
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,170
no matter where you are,

375
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,190
you must not belittle humans

376
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,340
or take human lives without cause.

377
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,700
Hong Ye will stay here to recover

378
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,120
until he's fully healed.

379
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,410
During this time,

380
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,720
all his needs

381
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,450
must be attended to with care.

382
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,000
Treat him as you would treat me.

383
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,430
Is that understood?

384
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,440
Yes.

385
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,240
Yes.

386
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,920
I heard you asked for some pearls.

387
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,960
Do you need anything else?

388
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,790
Just ask.

389
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,450
This is enough.

390
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,410
I just did something small

391
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,040
to show my appreciation.

392
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,090
For me?

393
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,660
Yes.

394
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,640
I ground the pearls into powder

395
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,000
and added some warm water.

396
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,200
If you soak your hands in it,

397
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,600
it'll nourish your skin.

398
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,310
Would you like to try?

399
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,860
If I do this,

400
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,410
will it make the Dragon Lord happy?

401
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,920
Just call me Xiao Yao.

402
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,200
As long as you don't insist on leaving,

403
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,130
anything you do will make me happy.

404
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,070
Xiao Yao.

405
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,390
How dare you!

406
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,270
Long Yu!

407
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,900
You dare try to assassinate
the Dragon Lord?

408
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,020
I'll kill you!

409
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,270
Dragon Lord!

410
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,010
He tried to kill you twice.

411
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,610
Why are you protecting him?

412
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,440
I said he wasn't to be harmed.

413
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,260
Do my words mean nothing to you?

414
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:32,960
Apologize!

415
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,910
He's human!

416
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,520
You're right.

417
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,320
Words aren't sincere enough.

418
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,790
You should suffer the same pain as him
to truly apologize.

419
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,640
Dragon Lord.

420
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,590
Because of him,

421
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,140
you don't care about me anymore?

422
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,590
Normally, I can reason with you kindly,

423
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,070
but I can also

424
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,470
be stern and teach you
the meaning of rules.

425
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,680
Now, can you tell me

426
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,700
why you've repeatedly tried to kill me?

427
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,820
I thought

428
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,420
you were keeping me trapped in the palace

429
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,510
just to humiliate me.

430
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,190
But I never expected

431
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,610
that you would

432
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,690
turn against your own kind for me.

433
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,800
Xiao Yao.

434
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,680
I was wrong.

435
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,440
Between us,

436
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,890
there's no need for hostility.

437
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,520
If you're willing,

438
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,460
let's start as friends,

439
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,110
alright?

440
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,030
I can also promise you.

441
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,990
As long as I'm here,

442
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,880
the dragons won't harm any humans.

443
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,920
Be careful next time!

444
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,350
If you leave the water again,

445
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,210
you'll end up on someone's plate.

446
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,590
Fortunately, it met a kind Water Dragon.

447
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,980
and survived.

448
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,850
If you can treat the aquatic folk kindly,

449
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,880
why can't you treat humans the same?

450
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,420
They don't deserve it.

451
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,350
Why?

452
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,920
Humans are the lowest beings in the world,

453
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,240
without a trace of power.

454
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,770
Not having spiritual power
makes them lowly?

455
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,830
Because of my birthday,

456
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,630
so many people died for nothing.

457
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,680
Even an Azure Dragon

458
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,030
might not be able to bear the karma

459
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,270
of so much killing.

460
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,900
If you lose reverence for life,

461
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,880
how can dragon
command respect from others?

462
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,070
As an Azure Dragon,

463
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,510
what kind of beings am I protecting?

464
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,270
The world

465
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,370
doesn't just consist of dragons.

466
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,210
If you don't understand this,

467
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,570
you'll always be a little dragon,

468
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,000
and never become a true Long Yu.

469
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,500
Thank you for your guidance, Dragon Lord.

470
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,960
I'll go practice my cultivation
right away.

471
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,800
What you said to him—

472
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,000
was it true?

473
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,130
Of course.

474
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,230
I'm feeling much better now

475
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,810
and want to go for a walk.

476
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,610
Do you want me to accompany you?

477
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,640
Mm.

478
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,460
What are you listening to?

479
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,240
The sound of the sea.

480
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,160
You can really hear it.

481
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,310
This conch shell

482
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,240
has only a trace of power,

483
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,610
but it still lets you feel
the presence of the ocean.

484
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,640
But its power is too small,

485
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,030
just like humans.

486
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,070
The law of nature
is survival of the fittest.

487
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,990
But humans refuse to accept this fate.

488
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,560
We will find ways
to make ourselves stronger.

489
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,820
Have you heard of the Yuli Spring?

490
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,010
I was originally a human prince

491
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,560
who moved the deity
during a heaven ritual.

492
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,090
To free humans from our short lives

493
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
and from being oppressed by demons,

494
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,820
the deity opened a divine spring

495
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,700
on the celestial mountain in the sea,

496
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,730
called Yuli.

497
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,080
Drink from this spring,

498
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,060
and humans can achieve immortality.

499
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,850
Unfortunately,

500
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,880
we humans have to

501
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,140
find the celestial mountain ourselves.

502
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,040
So even ten thousand years ago,

503
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,720
everyone was already
exhausting their energy

504
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,380
to search for the Yuli Spring.

505
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,310
Have you assembled the Kunlun Mirror?

506
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,740
The Kunlun Mirror?

507
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,310
Never heard of it.

508
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,930
Then how did you search
for the celestial mountain?

509
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,780
We put all our efforts
into building a ship,

510
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,110
hoping to try our luck at sea.

511
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,440
But unexpectedly,

512
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,480
we soon encountered a tsunami.

513
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,830
So

514
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,190
that's how we met

515
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,130
on the shore.

516
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,070
Yes.

517
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:15,040
We will definitely find
the celestial mountain.

518
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,250
Humans are truly delusional.

519
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,550
The seas have always
belonged to us dragons.

520
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,880
I've roamed these waters for years,

521
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,240
and I've never seen a celestial mountain,

522
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,640
only scattered islands.

523
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,590
Besides,

524
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,110
the ships built by humans

525
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,120
are really crude.

526
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,030
One strong wind and they fall apart.

527
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,830
They can't even reach the deep waters,

528
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,890
let alone find a celestial mountain.

529
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,400
That's why I said

530
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,350
dragons should help with the search.

531
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,160
What do human affairs

532
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,880
have to do with us dragons?

533
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,790
Long Yu accepts the order.

534
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,850
I'll go search now.

535
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,900
Has this kid gone mad in his cultivation?

536
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,200
If the little dragon goes alone

537
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,140
and encounters a great demon,

538
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,160
I'm afraid...

539
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,270
Yes.

540
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,010
Long Zhi accepts the order.

541
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,430
This boat

542
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,290
is from the dragons?

543
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,010
Dragons don't need boats.

544
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,790
This was all I could find.

545
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,980
Would you please talk to me?

546
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,350
Such a handsome face,

547
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,270
sitting there in silence,

548
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,330
it's like you're guarding my spirit.

549
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,000
I once received a divine vision too.

550
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,030
Would you like to know

551
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,960
what I saw?

552
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,440
I saw what my future husband looks like.

553
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,520
You...

554
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,610
You are my destined husband.

555
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,510
The deity

556
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,850
is supreme.

557
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,100
How could they give such personal
romantic revelations?

558
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,160
Don't you have

559
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,160
customs for praying for marriage blessings

560
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,750
or fertility goddesses or something?

561
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,400
No.

562
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,240
We aren't even married yet.

563
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,300
What's all this talk about children?

564
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,920
I see.

565
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,660
But the fact is you'll become my husband.

566
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,060
Humans are still suffering greatly.

567
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,680
I can't think about personal romance.

568
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,040
Don't be afraid.

569
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,420
Sit tight. I'm here.

570
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:36,900
Hold on to me.

571
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,230
Hold tight.

572
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,560
Hong Ye has survived a tsunami.

573
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,630
At this moment,

574
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,080
he must be frightened.

575
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:57,590
But he thought first

576
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,470
of my safety.

577
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:08,770
It's okay now.

578
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,510
Mm.

579
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,510
They all treat me

580
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,510
like an all-powerful Azure Dragon.

581
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,510
Only you

582
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,270
protect me like an ordinary woman.

583
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,110
Thank you.

584
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,120
I'm a man.

585
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,860
The oars are gone.

586
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,760
If the oars are gone,

587
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,190
let this boat

588
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,350
drift with the waves.

589
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,880
There won't be any more danger.

590
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,450
Mm.

591
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,150
The current Hong Ye has no power

592
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,980
and is oppressed by demons,

593
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,800
yet in moments of danger,

594
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,710
he still protects me with his life.

595
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,110
How could someone like him

596
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,480
be the evil man

597
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,410
that the Qiong Qis speak of
thousands of years later?

598
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,680
You're awake.

599
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,810
Thank you.

600
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,490
What about you?

601
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,040
You didn't sleep?

602
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,270
Look!

603
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,340
There's a fishing village ahead.

604
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,660
Are you hungry?

605
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,550
I'll find a house

606
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,480
and make you something delicious.

607
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:47,550
Hmm,

608
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,620
I'm hungry.

609
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,850
They say

610
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,210
the owner of this house

611
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,480
went to sea
and was never heard from again.

612
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,760
Let's rest here.

613
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,150
I didn't think that you could cook.

614
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:06,760
Of course.

615
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,720
I'm a man.

616
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,270
The conditions here are far more modest

617
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,400
than in the Dragon Palace.

618
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,660
You'll have to make do.

619
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,100
My old place wasn't even this nice.

620
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,880
It smells so good.

621
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:31,960
This fragrance,

622
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,030
I could smell it every day
and never get tired of it.

623
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,550
Drink slowly.

624
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,070
Mm.

625
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,130
Careful, it's hot.

626
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:52,910
Delicious.

627
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,880
But just soup alone won't fill me up.

628
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,990
Make me a bowl of noodles please.

629
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,190
What are noodles?

630
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:07,600
Oh, right.

631
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,000
They don't exist yet.

632
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,630
They're delicious.

633
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,800
I'll teach you how to make them.

634
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,200
Go find some wheat flour.

635
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,440
