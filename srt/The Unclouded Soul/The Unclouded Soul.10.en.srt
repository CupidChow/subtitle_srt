Nothing looks like you there.

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,630
There's something else.

00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,360
Same for you.

60
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,560
Luoluo, do you think Xiao Yao
would like this one?

61
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,290
It looks quite similar to mine.

62
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,390
I want to eat it.

63
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
You can taste whichever one you like.

64
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,310
Luoluo, why are you always
thinking about eating?

65
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,480
It smells so good.

66
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,390
Shut up.

67
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,440
It smells wonderful.

68
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,510
Why is your skin so delicate?

69
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,600
Ms. Fairy, if I use your fragrant balm,

70
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,110
will I look like you?

71
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,210
Your skin is already delicate,

72
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,680
but if you use our fragrant balm,

73
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,740
it will become even better than ours.

74
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,820
I want it!

75
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,830
Let me try it!

76
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,510
I want one too!

77
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,370
I want that one!

78
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,510
I want one too!

79
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,380
They're so beautiful.

80
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,480
Ms. Fairy,

81
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,560
where is this fragrant balm from?

82
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,940
Realm of Mist and Void.

83
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,160
Where is that?

84
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,870
What kind of place is it?

85
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,240
Have you heard of it?

86
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,940
The Realm of Mist and Void
rests on the sea.

87
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,600
It's a paradise for women,

88
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,220
where women are respected above all.

89
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,650
No men to oppress them.

90
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,159
No arranged marriages.

91
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,830
In the Realm of Mist and Void,

92
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,270
women never age,

93
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,920
always remaining as delicate as flowers.

94
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,270
No wonder they're so beautiful.

95
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,800
Can I go there too, Ms. Fairy?

96
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,070
Does such a place really exist?

97
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,510
Is it true?

98
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,920
Of course it exists.

99
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,720
Who is this?

100
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,240
A fairy!

101
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,000
A fairy!

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,310
So beautiful!

103
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,390
Is she a fairy?

104
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,950
A fairy.

105
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,330
Is she a celestial being from heaven?

106
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,750
So beautiful!

107
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,410
The 4 of us
are from the Realm of Mist and Void.

108
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,600
All the goods in this shop

109
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,270

by our sisters from the realm.

110
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,610
We now offer them to you as gifts,

111
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,870
hoping to connect with kindred spirits.

112
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,190
I want that one!

113
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,480
Look at these fragrant ointments.

114
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,750
Girls all love them.

115
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,550
How about we get one for Xiao Yao?

116
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,000
But we don't have any money.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,330
What can we use to buy it?

118
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,430
Didn't you say that good looks

119
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,040
can bewitch people's hearts?

120
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,270
Look at this girl.

121
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,680
She looks so adorably lovable.

122
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,560
Come here quickly.

123
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,760
She's talking to you.

124
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,830
I knew you looked special.

125
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,270
Your skin is so delicate.

126
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,270
You're so pretty.

127
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,340
If you use these,

128
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,100
you'll look even more radiant.

129
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,620
Feel free to pick anything

130
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,820
from this counter.

131
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,720
-Ms. Fairy, I want one too!
-I want one too!

132
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,320
I don't have that much money.

133
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,950
She's so lucky!

134
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,040
I'm so envious of her!

135
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,870
Can I have this as a gift?

136
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:21,920
Of course.

137
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,310
Go ahead and choose.

138
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,160
I have something too!

139
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,800
Ms. Fairy, I have something too.

140
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,830
I have a hairpin.

141
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,480
This is a rouge box.

142
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,559
I have a hairpin too!

143
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,720
Mine is better!

144
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,049
-The green one looks better.
-Pink. Pink.

145
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,470
Thank you, Ms. Fairy.

146
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,870
Young lady.

147
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,030
I see you have a special connection

148
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,270
with the Realm of Mist and Void.

149
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,510
There are some special items
inside the shop.

150
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,310
Would you like to come in and see?

151
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,630
Yes, I'd love to.

152
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,550
Follow me.

153
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,610
I'd like to as well.

154
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,840
How can I get in?

155
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,470
I want to go in too!

156
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,080
Ms. Fairy!

157
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,300
Ms. Fairy!

158
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,750
So beautiful.

159
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,120
Come closer and look.

160
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,090
It's even more beautiful.

161
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
Who is the person in this portrait?

162
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,510
Is it someone imaginary

163
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,670
or someone real?

164
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,490
The person in this painting

165
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,670
is the most beautiful being
in the Three Realms,

166
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,730
the queen of all flowers in the world,

167
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,570
called Dreamshard Immortal.

168
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,600
We are all her disciples.

169
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,240
She herself

170
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,120
is a thousandfold more beautiful
than this portrait.

171
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,480
So,

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,510
where is she?

173
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,720
Dreamshard Immortal lives

174
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,240
in the Realm of Mist and Void
on the celestial mountain beyond the sea.

175
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,300
Only women with the sincerest hearts

176
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,320
can see her true face.

177
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,440
If a girl is naturally gifted

178
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,480
and destined to meet Dreamshard Immortal,

179
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,280
she may be accepted as a disciple

180
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,790
and enjoy eternal youth and beauty.

181
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,440
I can see
you're exceptionally intelligent,

182
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,040
far from an ordinary mortal.

183
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,630
Me?

184
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,720
Yes.

185
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,270
Take this portrait home,

186
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,140
hang it by your bed,

187
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,960
and make offerings of fresh flowers daily.

188
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,290
With sincere devotion,

189
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,530
Dreamshard Immortal will come
to take you to the Realm of Mist and Void.

190
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,000
Ms. Fairy,

191
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,480
I'd like to ask,

192
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,240
why are you being so nice to me?

193
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,270
Because

194
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,820
sooner or later, we'll be sisters
in the Realm of Mist and Void.

195
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,630
So how did they agree

196
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,430
to teach you how to make noodles?

197
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,910
Didn't you tell me

198
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,500
that silver is the most useful thing
in the human realm?

199
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,280
So how much silver did you give?

200
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,850
I don't remember exactly.

201
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:30,960
100 taels?

202
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,550
Or maybe 200.

203
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,000
You...

204
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,840
With that much silver,

205
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,870
you could buy the entire noodle shop,

206
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,670
but we only ate 2 bowls of noodles.

207
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,270
But I wasn't buying noodles.

208
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,230
I was buying your happiness.

209
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,960
Xiao Yao!

210
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,030
Xiao Yao!

211
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,000
Xiao Yao!

212
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,390
My Lord.

213
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
Xiao Yao, yesterday was your birthday.

214
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,320
Luoluo and I were looking everywhere
for gifts,

215
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,480
but we're still late.

216
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,410
Not late at all.

217
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,080
Thank you for being so thoughtful.

218
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,080
Congratulations on your birthday.

219
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,180
My Lord.

220
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,690
We need to speak with Xiao Yao
about something. Is that okay?

221
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,440
Would you like to see

222
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,110
the gift we prepared for you?

223
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,040
Let's go.

224
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,670
Let's go.

225
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,400
I'm leaving.

226
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,910
Slow down.

227
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,240
Quickly, show it to Xiao Yao.

228
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,120
Take a look.

229
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,440
Happy birthday.

230
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,670
Take a look.

231
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,270
Thank you.

232
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,270
What is this?

233
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,530
Fragrant balm.

234
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,910
Apply this to your face every day,

235
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,720
and you'll stay youthful
and radiant forever.

236
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,080
It smells wonderful.

237
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,740
Doesn't it?

238
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,640
Where did you get it?

239
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,960
From the Garden of Mist and Void.

240
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,910
I traded the flower from my head

241
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,610
with someone from the garden.

242
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,270
This fragrant balm
comes from the Realm of Mist and Void.

243
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,530
Realm of Mist and Void?

244
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,870
What kind of place is that?

245
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,970
It is a wonderful place.

246
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,390
It's inhabited entirely
by immortal maidens.

247
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,790
There are no men there,

248
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,840
only women.

249
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,080
All they do there every day

250
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
is make themselves more beautiful.

251
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,120
Really?

252
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,550
Yes.

253
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,320
Among them,
there's one who is the most beautiful,

254
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,980
called Dreamshard Immortal.

255
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,960
Today, they gave me a painting—

256
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,000
only for me.

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,440
Let me show you.

258
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,000
Show me quickly.

259
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,600
Let me see.

260
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,280
It's exceptionally beautiful.

261
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,000
Isn't it beautiful?

262
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,010
It's so beautiful.

263
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,870
Right?

264
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,720
No! Throw it away quickly!

265
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,480
Why?

266
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,960
What's wrong, Xiao Yao?

267
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,620
[Pei] [Zhirui]

268
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,630
[Ying Ning]

269
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,250
[Pianpian]

270
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,080
Flower Demon,

271
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,870
I saw through your true form at a glance.

272
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,330
We've been waiting outside
for over a month

273
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,150
and still couldn't find

274
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,410
a way through Demons' Valley's barrier.

275
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,510
Thankfully, you brought
Dreamshard Immortal's portrait in.

276
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,630
So we can find our way
into Demons' Valley.

277
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,340
What?

278
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,520
Xiao Yao, run!

279
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:28,910
Luoluo!

280
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,570
The minor demon still got away?

281
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,790
I've tied her up

282
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,500
and left her in the woods.

283
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,860
Take her

284
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,830
back to the cliff and wait for me.

285
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,200
Where are you going now?

286
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,960
I'm going to meet the Demon King, Hong Ye.

287
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,860
What's wrong with you?

288
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,000
This is Dreamshard Immortal's order.

289
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,870
Or maybe,

290
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,450
you can come with me?

291
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,560
Forget it.

292
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,150
I'll wait for you at the cliff ahead.

293
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,750
-Why are you here?
-Why are you here?

294
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,130
Which one

295
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,510
of you is the real one?

296
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,550
Quick! Catch her!

297
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,920
Quick! Catch her!

298
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,600
Quick. Help me fight her!

299
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,550
Why aren't you doing something?

300
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,710
Why aren't you doing something?

301
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,330
You two fight it out.

302
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,690
Whoever wins

303
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,390
must be the real one.

304
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,650
Whose side are you on?

305
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,470
Whose side are you really on?

306
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,920
I choose you. You're the real one.

307
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,400
Quick. Help me fight her.

308
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,780
Ying Ning.

309
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,570
Do you truly not recognize me?

310
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,230
You, me, Zhirui, and Pei,

311
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,420
by Dreamshard Immortal's command,

312
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,160
came to Demons' Valley
to deliver a message to Hong Ye.

313
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,490
Ask that one over there.

314
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,310
You almost ruined everything!

315
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:11,910
After her!

316
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,510
Stop!

317
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,109
Xiao Ming!

318
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,270
Whenever you're in danger,

319
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,400
you always look for Xiao Ming.

320
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,310
Look carefully.

321
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,160
I'm Xiao Mu.

322
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,430
Pianpian.

323
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,550
Subdue this cat demon.

324
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,680
I'll wait for you at our previous spot.

325
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,890
My Lord,

326
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,830
Xiao Yao has been taken away
by her accomplices.

327
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,340
This woman is human,

328
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,250
yet she knows demonic arts

329
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,400
and somehow entered Demons' Valley.

330
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,920
You're from the Realm of Mist and Void?

331
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,550
Exactly.

332
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,110
The Monarch of All Demons has returned,

333
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,230
yet hasn't come
to see Dreamshard Immortal.

334
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,280
So she sent me to pay a visit.

335
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,960
I have no interest
in any dealings with her.

336
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,940
Return Xiao Yao to me.

337
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,260
Please rest assured, Demon King.

338
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,800
We won't harm her in any way.

339
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,120
We simply wish to invite you

340
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,280
to speak with Dreamshard Immortal
in person.

341
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,070
My Lord!

342
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,380
Hong Ye, don't bother about me.

343
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,570
Tell us,

344
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,690
where is Dreamshard Immortal?

345
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,080
Hong Ye,

346
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,680
100 years ago, you went to great lengths

347
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,740
to piece together the Kunlun Mirror,

348
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,170
but you gave it to humans for nothing,

349
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,110
which cost you your life.

350
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,910
Now that you've awakened again,

351
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,850
I fear your kind heart

352
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,310
will be deceived by humans once more.

353
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,000
I want

354
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,630
to invite you
to the Realm of Mist and Void

355
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,720
for a little chat.

356
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,160
I have

357
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,630
nothing to discuss with you.

358
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,400
Pianpian.

359
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,470
Present my gift.

360
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,410
It's poison!

361
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,160
You...

362
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,980
I made this specially for you.

363
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,400
It's called Heart-Devouring Poison.

364
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,450
If you accept this gift,

365
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,750
I'll have them release

366
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,110
these minor demons.

367
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,910
My Lord, you absolutely cannot!

368
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,160
Hong Ye, don't.

369
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,240
Hong Ye.

370
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,730
Though your power is great,

371
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,490
you have too many weaknesses.

372
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,500
If you want to neutralize it,

373
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,240
come within 7 days

374
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,670
to the Realm of Mist and Void.

375
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,840
It's fine.

376
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,000
Then we'll be waiting for you

377
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,090
in the Realm of Mist and Void, Demon King.

378
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,510
Dreamshard Immortal,

379
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,960
whose identity lies
between the Three Realms,

380
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,580
is neither human, nor demon, nor immortal.

381
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,610
She's called Spirit.

382
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,640
She was originally a fairy
from the Heavenly Realm.

383
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,480
Later, she became enamored
with the human realm

384
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,730
and descended to the realm
without permission.

385
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,180
Then she married a human.

386
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,200
Because she was tainted
by the impurities of the mortal world,

387
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,260
she can never return
to the Heavenly Realm.

388
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,830
She's been trapped in the cycle
of birth, aging, sickness, and death.

389
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,560
To preserve her eternal youth,

390
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,100
she replaced her heart

391
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,510
with a crystal heart.

392
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,010
Since then,

393
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,920
she has survived
by consuming the essence of mortal women

394
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,320
to maintain her beauty
and extend her life.

395
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,390
The place where she resides

396
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,660
is called the Realm of Mist and Void.

397
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,940
In human legends,

398
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,000
that place is known

399
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,300
as Penglang.

400
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,960
So does she live on a celestial mountain?

401
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,410
It's merely a celestial mountain
imagined by humans.

402
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,750
The true celestial mountains

403
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,080
aren't so easily found.

404
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,310
So she came to you for the Yuli Spring?

405
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,620
Precisely.

406
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,930
If she obtains the Yuli Spring,

407
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,880
she can return to the Heavenly Realm.

408
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,510
However, her true form can't leave
the Realm of Mist and Void.

409
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,350
So she can only transform into a nightmare

410
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,440
to gather disciples

411
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,400
who collect mortal women for her

412
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,350
and bring them
to the Realm of Mist and Void.

413
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,410
Our Demons' Valley

414
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,830
is surrounded by powerful enemies.

415
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,630
I need everyone to work together

416
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,640
and cultivate diligently.

417
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,240
Yes.

418
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,310
Yes.

419
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,520
Xiao Mu,
lead everyone in proper cultivation.

420
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,960
Let's continue with the lesson.

421
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,040
Everyone, turn to chapter 3
of the Baize Drawings.

422
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,510
Every record in it

423
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,350
must be committed to memory.

424
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,880
So when you encounter danger
in the future,

425
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,440
you'll know how to respond.

426
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,370
Xiao Yao.

427
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,480
Xiao Yao.

428
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,680
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,880
I really didn't know
there was a trap in that portrait.

430
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
I'm sorry.

431
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,880
I'm sorry.

432
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,710
We've brought trouble to His Lordship.

433
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,920
You didn't know either.

434
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,240
His Lordship's power is profound.

435
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
He'll be fine.

436
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,950
Yeah.

437
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:52,880
My Lord!

438
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,310
Go back.

439
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,200
It's nothing.

440
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,520
It wasn't like this just now.

441
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
The Heart-Devouring Poison isn't fatal.

442
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,330
It only draws out the evil thoughts

443
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,130
that exist in a demon's nature.

444
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,340
I have cultivated for 1,000 years.

445
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,590
A tiny venomous insect

446
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,590
is no match for me.

447
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640
I'll go to Youning Cave now

448
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,940
to use my power to suppress it

449
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,270
and slowly force the venomous insect out.

450
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,110
Xiao Mu.

451
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,720
Yes.

452
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,180
Lead everyone in their cultivation.

453
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,340
Without my permission,

454
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,540
no one is allowed to enter Youning Cave.

455
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,830
Yes.

456
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,310
Go to class now.

457
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,000
But...

458
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,240
It's fine.

459
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,440
Xiao Ming.

460
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,970
I can't take it anymore.

461
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,760
I've been at my limit for a while!

462
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,660
How is His Lordship doing?

463
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,920
I'm talking to you.

464
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,380
How is His Lordship doing?

465
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,510
He says he's fine,

466
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,750
but since I've been by his side
for so many years,

467
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,480
how could I not notice?

468
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,300
He's just enduring it,

469
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,400
pretending nothing's wrong.

470
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,810
What do you mean?

471
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Dreamshard said,

472
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,240
7 days is the limit,

473
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,150
but
with His Lordship's current cultivation,

474
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,680
suppressing it for 10 days
would be his absolute limit.

475
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,220
If the poison takes effect after 10 days,

476
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,510
what will happen?

477
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,070
It's better not to witness it.

478
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,200
Dreamshard Immortal

479
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,920
lives in the Realm of Mist and Void
on a celestial mountain beyond the sea.

480
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,980
Only women with the sincerest hearts

481
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,040
can see her true appearance.

482
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,600
If a girl is naturally gifted

483
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,480
and destined to meet Dreamshard Immortal,

484
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,280
she may be accepted as a disciple

485
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,750
and enjoy eternal youth and beauty.

486
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,200
Hei Wu!

487
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,070
Get out now!

488
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,160
My Lord,

489
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,110
why have you summoned me

490
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,070
so late at night?

491
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,310
I know exactly what you're thinking.

492
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,000
You two have been blinded by power.

493
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,270
You would even put

494
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,850
your own kind in danger.

495
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,200
Today,

496
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,370
I command you to leave Demons' Valley

497
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,550
and never return.

498
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,400
I've been blinded by power?

499
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,720
Tell me which of my actions

500
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,980
wasn't for the benefit of our demon kind.

501
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,400
Now you tell me to leave.

502
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,760
On what grounds?

503
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:49,830
Xiao Yao.

504
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,920
Hong Ye.

505
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,960
How are you feeling?

506
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,080
I wanted to give you
the jade pendant again.

507
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,070
But with this poison unresolved,

508
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,340
my presence near you

509
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:14,820

into this straw bracelet.

It will surely keep you safe and sound.

516
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,050

that His Lordship
can defeat Dreamshard Immortal

and return safely.

588
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,210
Otherwise, every demon in Demons' Valley

589
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,800
will never forgive you!

590
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,610
True feelings fade away like dreams.

591

Hurry, let's go.

593
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,790
Coming.

594
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,060
Isn't Xiao Yao supposed
to be good at fortune-telling?

595
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,840
Why can't she tell

596
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,520
she was born under an unlucky star?

597
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,590
You broomstick!

598
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,690
Xiao Yao is suffering enough.

599
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,810
Don't go too far.

600
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,590
Isn't her suffering well-deserved?

601
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,480
Because of her,

602
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,510
our Demons' Valley

603
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,510
has suffered disaster after disaster.

604
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,670
Stop talking nonsense.

605
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,190
This has nothing to do with Xiao Yao.

606
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:09,920
That's right.

607
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,190
We were the ones
who brought back that painting.

608
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:12,510
Yes.

609
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,880
Since I'm your classmate,

610
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,480
let me give you both some advice.

611
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,590
Stay away from her.

612
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,920
Mind your own business.

613
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,800
I'm warning you.

614
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,000
Xiao Yao is our good friend.

615
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,330
Yeah.

616
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,070
Stop criticizing her like that!

617
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,510
Right!

618
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,670
Xiao Yao is my savior...

619
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,220
I shouldn't have bothered
advising you two.

620
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:41,800
Luoluo.

621
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,320
Keep watch here.

622
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,990
Grunt twice, no matter who comes.

623
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:45,550
Yes.

624
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,710
Dali.

625
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,620
Come, quickly.

626
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,660
This is for you.

627
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,400
What is this?

628
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,300
A safety charm.

629
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,400
This isn't an ordinary charm.

630
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,190
Luoluo and I risked our lives to steal it.

631
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,280
You can use this charm

632
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,140
to see if His Lordship is safe now.

633
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,330
How do I use it?

634
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,510
Just think of His Lordship in your heart

635
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,640
and burn this charm.

636
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,360
If it burns completely to ash,

637
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,760
it means His Lordship is safe.

638
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,290
Then you can stop worrying.

639
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,560
What if it doesn't burn completely?

640
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,640
Then it means...

641
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,480
We can't think about that now, Xiao Yao.

642
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,140
If you want to try it, hurry up.

643
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,960
We're done for if we're caught.

644
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,810
May it burn completely to ashes.

645
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,670
Your peace

646
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,480
is my peace.

647
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,950
May it burn completely to ashes.

648
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,670
Your peace

649
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,020
is my peace.

650
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,510
What are you 3 doing here?

651
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,800
Not sleeping

652
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,260
or cultivating properly,

653
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,230
just gathering together

654
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,500
and chattering away.

655
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:31,320
We...

656
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,470
We want to cultivate,

657
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,480
but our minds aren't calm.

658
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,940
We want to sleep but can't.

659
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,720
Get some rest early.

660
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,220
Don't miss tomorrow's morning class.

661
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:39,870
Yes.

662
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,230
Xiao Yao.

663
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,580
Where are your 2 best friends?

664
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,320
They cultivated too late last night.

665
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,020
They probably overslept.

666
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,650
I'll go wake them up now.

667
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,710
No need.

668
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,630
Show me the results
of your extra practice.

669
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,280
If you've made significant progress,

670
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,080
I'll give you all a day off today.

671
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,650
Hurry!

672
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,860
Are we going
to the Realm of Mist and Void now?

673
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,170
Xiao Yao, I'm thinking...

674
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,110
Even if we both reach
the Realm of Mist and Void,

675
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,700
with just the two of us,

676
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,490
what help could we possibly be?

677
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,360
I don't know either.

678
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,840
But if I just sit here waiting,

679
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,800
doing nothing,

680
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,210
I'll suffer like that charm.

681
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:13,960
Yeah.

682
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,800
Dali.

683
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,630
This time is different from before.

684
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,890
It could be dangerous.

685
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:19,550
If...

686
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,480
What do you mean?

687
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,920
You don't want to take me?

688
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,650
I'm definitely going with you.

689
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,920
His Lordship has been taken away

690
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,150
because of that painting

691
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,360
I brought back.

692
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,280
Besides,

693
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,230
when you saved Luoluo and me before,

694
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,230
you never worried about the danger.

695
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,840
Xiao Yao, do you think

696
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm too talkative?

697
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,510
Do I annoy you?

698
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,920
I can be quiet if you want.

699
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,910
To Pingjiang Prefecture. To find Bingzhu.

700
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,330
Let's go.

707
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,360
you should try another approach.

They've all left.

Feiyu Guard and Prefect have left?

712

They're gone.

Feiyu Guard captured the great demon

714
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,320
and returned to the capital
to report their success.

715
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,380
The prefecture office
provided valuable assistance,

716
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,280
so Prefect has taken his family
to have an audience with the Emperor.

717
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,070
He's surely going to be promoted again.

718
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:12,630
You may go.
