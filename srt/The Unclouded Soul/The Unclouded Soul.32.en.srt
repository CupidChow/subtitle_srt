[The Unclouded Soul]

2
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,800
[Episode 32]

3
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,400
So your reckless flattery

4
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,080
finally got you into trouble.

5
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,400
It's alright. It's alright.

6
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,840
I'm not really angry.

7
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,200
You're quite cute actually,

8
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,950
much better than

9
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,680
that snide Ao Hen.

10
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,840
Xiao Yao,

11
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,880
did Ao Hen provoke you again?

12
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,759
No, no, no.

13
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,820
My spiritual power

14
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,590
is too weak.

15
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,150
It has nothing to do with Senior.

16
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,040
It doesn't matter.

17
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,150
As long as we are here,

18
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,760
you are still unmatched in this world.

19
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,230
Yes.

20
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,000
I appreciate your kindness,

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,530
but I think it's better
to cultivate on my own.

22
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,400
Sister,

23
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,280
let me teach you instead.

24
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,430
Um,

25
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,170
could you please stop calling me Sister?

26
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,760
You said it yourself.

27
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:24,630
If I don't

28
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,150
call you Sister anymore,

29
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
does that mean

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,300
I can like you?

31
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,079
What nonsense are you talking about?

32
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,680
If anyone is teaching her, it will be me.

33
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,120
Since when was it your turn?

34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,750
Qiong Qi,

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,590
you can barely protect yourself,

36
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,510
and you still have the nerve
to teach Xiao Yao.

37
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,840
You're courting death.

38
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,750
If Xiao Yao wishes to recover
her former spiritual power,

39
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,280
then naturally I will be
the one to teach her.

40
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,840
Fine.

41
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,470
Get past me first before you say that.

42
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,280
-Fine.
-I was the one who said it first.

43
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,079
It has nothing to do with you.

44
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,120
It has nothing to do with you.

45
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,030
It has nothing to do with me?

46
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,560
-I said it has nothing to do with you.
-Enough!

47
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,860
If you three are too idle,

48
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,780
then help us rebuild Demons' Valley.

49
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,110
At least put that strength
of yours to use.

50
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,810
I am not meant to handle menial tasks.

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,200
Wouldn't that

52
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,150
be a waste of my talents?

53
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,000
But many places were destroyed by you.

54
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,490
If you are unwilling to stay and help,

55
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,710
please leave.

56
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,430
Sister,

57
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,290
don't be angry.

58
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,030
I'll do whatever you ask me to.

59
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,520
Can you stop calling me
"Sister" all the time?

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,360
How old do you think
you are compared to me, anyway?

61
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,150
My Lord!

62
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,190
My Lord!

63
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,710
Qiong Qi, Ao Hen, and Teng She

64
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,030
are all repairing the barriers
throughout the valley.

65
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,079
That's good.

66
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,110
We don't have to rely solely on
your power anymore.

67
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,340
I was worried

68
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,910
that while you
were repairing the barriers,

69
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,470
those three might launch a sneak attack,

70
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,200
and we wouldn't know what to do.

71
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,090
It seems I worried for nothing.

72
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,240
Now things

73
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,610
are finally evened out.

74
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,010
But come to think of it,

75
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,850
Xiao Yao is truly remarkable.

76
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,360
She managed to make those
three fierce and ruthless beings

77
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,490
obey her every word.

78
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,910
I wonder

79
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,280
what kind of tangled karma or bond

80
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,080
the four of them shared

81
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,910
ten thousand years ago.

82
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,560
My Lord,

83
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,120
I...

84
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,800
The three old monsters have been
sealed away for ten thousand years.

85
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,000
How could they possibly be a match

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,950
for Your Lordship,

87
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,350
who cultivates day and night without rest?

88
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,200
When all is said and done,

89
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,180
all of this is Xiao Yao's fault.

90
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,750
Somehow she

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
became entangled with those three.

92
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,040
A hundred years ago,
she already betrayed your trust.

93
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,220
And now,

94
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,440
seeing their great power

95
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,630
and how they obey her every word,

96
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,000
she's playing both sides

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,990
like the fickle woman she is.

98
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,580
Silence!

99
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,640
Xiao Yao doesn't even recognize them.

100
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,960
How can you blame her?

101
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,670
If it weren't for Xiao Yao,

102
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,000
this calamity

103
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,710
wouldn't have been resolved so easily.

104
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,680
If I say something nice, it's wrong.

105
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,010
If I say something harsh, it's also wrong.

106
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,440
Your thoughts are truly hard to guess.

107
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,740
I guess this is what they mean

108
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,230
by "handsome as a jade tree
in the breeze."

109
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,820
I'm so cultured!

110
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,860
Senior,

111
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,430
you've worked so hard
repairing the barrier.

112
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,430
Try this.

113
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,820
What's this?

114
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,870
Food I saved from the humans.

115
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,940
It's delicious.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Especially this sugarcane. Try it.

117
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,800
It's such an ugly thing.

118
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,640
Just looking at it kills my appetite.

119
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,550
What kind of treasure is this?

120
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,210
Sugarcane.

121
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,720
And this one's good too.

122
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,240
Delicious.

123
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,510
It tastes different.

124
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,480
Good. It's really good.

125
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,040
Not bad.

126
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Try this one.

127
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,970
Is it delicious?

128
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,780
Once mighty and proud across the realms,

129
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,630
the demons have now

130
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,690
been driven into such a small valley.

131
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,080
It is truly a pitiful sight.

132
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,160
Senior.

133
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,270
Senior.

134
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:31,990
Senior.

135
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,570
Witnessing your power today

136
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,950
has filled us with awe and admiration.

137
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,510
Yes, yes.

138
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,430
We humbly ask
if you would be willing to teach us,

139
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,070
so that if humans invade again,

140
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,600
we may be able to assist you.

141
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,159
Yes.

142
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,320
If you can still stand after three days

143
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,720
of training under me,

144
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,840
I'll teach you some skills.

145
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,920
Okay.

146
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,430
1,996.

147
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,340
1,997.

148
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,660
1,998.

149
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,870
1,999.

150
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,920
2,000!

151
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,890
Cultivate spiritual power.

152
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,600
Train your physical body.

153
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,120
Train!

154
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,990
Attack, and your strength will double.

155
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,540
Defend, and you can withstand blows.

156
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,630
Remember this:

157
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,600
Might makes right!

158
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,400
Might makes right!

159
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,680
Might makes right!

160
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,870
Might makes right!

161
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,200
Might makes right!

162
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,240
Might makes right!

163
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,360
Might makes right!

164
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,630
Might makes right!

165
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,630
You are right!

166
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,850
You are right!

167
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:41,840
Senior.

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,150
This is Bamboo's second uncle.

169
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,280
I brought it for you.

170
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,880
Remove the bottom part.

171
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,480
Done.

172
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,130
Let me teach you a new game.

173
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,070
It's called

174
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,190
Ju.

175
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,940
Without using spiritual power,

176
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,030
you must throw the ball

177
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,880
into that basket to win.

178
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,120
And if I win?

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,730
If you win...

180
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,000
if you win,

181
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll grant you one wish.

182
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,440
Wait.

183
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,600
I haven't finished explaining the rules.

184
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,670
I won't use spiritual power either,

185
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,270
but I'll

186
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,990
try my best to stop you.

187
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,840
Are you ready?

188
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,790
My mother said

189
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,920
that those who love to laugh are lucky.

190
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,390
That doesn't count.

191
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:07,990
Try again.

192
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,210
Come on.

193
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,870
Alright, here I come.

194
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,440
Again!

195
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,690
Go!

196
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,400
Look.

197
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,690
Amazing.

198
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,400
I'll spare you this time.

199
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,700
Go back and tell Hong Ye

200
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,960
that if he wants to
attempt an assassination,

201
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,750
he should send more capable people.

202
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,480
No, no.

203
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,240
You've misunderstood.

204
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,960
Well, we...

205
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,550
We just wanted to learn from

206
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,080
your extraordinary poise.

207
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,680
No, I mean—

208
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,000
your integrity.

209
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,550
Yes.

210
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,560
For bamboo,

211
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,720
integrity is of the utmost importance.

212
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,550
Yes.

213
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,150
Whatever you plan to do,

214
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,760
keep at least ten zhang away from me.

215
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,410
Do not let Xiao Yao
misunderstand anything.

216
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,410
Otherwise, I will kill you on sight.

217
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,360
As long as I stay more than ten zhang away,
I can follow you, right?

218
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,080
Ten zhang.

219
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,390
Ten is enough.
I can follow you now, right?

220
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,200
My Lord!

221
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,240
My Lord, something terrible has happened!

222
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,570
You need to do something
about it, My Lord!

223
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,320
My Lord.

224
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,550
What's so urgent?

225
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,510
Those three ancient demons

226
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,200
are buying loyalty everywhere.

227
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,600
If this continues,

228
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,720
all the minor and inexperienced demons

229
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,450
will fall under their control.

230
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,270
You're making a fuss over nothing.

231
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,790
I'm really not.

232
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,470
Go take a look and you'll see.

233
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,360
Hurry!

234
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,600
Let's go, My Lord!

235
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,450
Whoever can lay so much as a finger on me

236
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,150
will be granted
a hundred years of cultivation.

237
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,600
What?

238
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,120
Really?

239
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,600
What?

240
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,480
-A hundred years?
-A hundred years of cultivation?

241
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:07,870
A hundred years!

242
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,440
One,

243
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,030
two,

244
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,750
pull!

245
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,030
My Lord,

246
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,570
look at them.

247
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,910
They're supposed to be training,

248
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,600
yet here they are fooling around

249
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,200
with this useless nonsense.

250
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,520
Pull harder!

251
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,000
I am trying!

252
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,980
Did you skip your meal?

253
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,390
Harder!

254
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,200
Harder!

255
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,910
One, two,

256
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,720
pull!

257
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,830
One, two, pull!

258
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,040
One, two, pull!

259
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,900
Training physical strength like this

260
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,700
isn't such a bad thing after all.

261
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,370
My Lord.

262
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,960
Look over there.

263
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,480
Again!

264
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,340
Forget it,

265
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,840
just tell me your wish.

266
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,910
Since Dali left,

267
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,720
I haven't had any friends.

268
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,800
No one wants to play with me.

269
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,790
I'm unhappy every day.

270
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,330
But just now,
when I was playing with you, Senior,

271
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,130
it felt like I had a friend again.

272
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,150
So let's keep going.

273
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,510
You said it yourself.

274
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,030
This time

275
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,860
it's my turn!

276
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,440
How can there be

277
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,930
a demon lord with such overwhelming power?

278
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,240
Indeed.

279
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,180
The way he concentrates on
his work is mesmerizing.

280
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,910
Yes.

281
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,560
They're clearly old-fashioned
fabric and patterns,

282
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,030
yet on him

283
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,590
they look extraordinary.

284
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,100
You're too young to get it.

285
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,080
This is called classical style.

286
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,070
Classical?

287
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,380
Classical beauty.

288
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,750
I...

289
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,290
I never imagined that
after ten thousand years,

290
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,770
styles could change

291
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,960
so much.

292
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,530
Demon Lord, this is my

293
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,360
hair.

294
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,800
It looks so beautiful.

295
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,870
Lift your head.

296
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,770
Stretch out your arms.

297
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,480
A bit higher.

298
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,360
That's beautiful.

299
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,430
It suits you well.

300
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,750
Bamboo, he's complimenting you.

301
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,510
My Lord,

302
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,240
look at this.

303
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,720
My Lord, please wait for me.

304
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,030
My Lord, there's no need to worry.

305
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,080
Xiao Ming and Xiao Mu

306
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,860
will always be by your side.

307
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,750
Your spiritual power
has only just recovered,

308
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,600
so please make sure to rest more.

309
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,600
They're just a few ancient demons
from ten thousand years ago.

310
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,530
What is there for me to worry about?

311
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,030
Haven't I already seen everything
you wanted to show me?

312
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,390
Why are you still following me?

313
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:47,790
I...

314
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,840
Why are you here?

315
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,370
Xiao Yao.

316
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,960
Take care of yourself, My Lord.

317
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,000
I came to see you.

318
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,640
What smells so good?

319
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,990
I made some flower pastries.

320
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,610
Ao Hen, Qiong Qi, and Teng She

321
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,080
did a great job repairing the barrier.

322
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,670
I want to invite them
to try these flower pastries

323
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,750
to show my gratitude.

324
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,670
You came at the right time.

325
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,730
Let's go find them.

326
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,400
Those three are ancient beasts

327
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,130
and can be extremely cruel
when they go wild.

328
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,440
Well, Xiao Mu once said

329
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,500
I would bring disaster to the demons.

330
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,200
I can tell

331
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,270
they bear no ill will toward the demons.

332
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,000
But they have feelings for you.

333
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,510
So,

334
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,320
are you afraid they'll harm
the demons, or...

335
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,840
Yes,

336
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,150
I'm jealous.

337
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,870
If I hadn't heard it with my own ears,

338
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,140
I wouldn't believe you'd say that.

339
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,910
I used to think

340
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,750
that as long as my spiritual power
was strong enough,

341
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,200
there was nothing in this world

342
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,670
I needed to fear.

343
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,120
But after I met you,

344
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,080
I realized

345
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,520
that even the strongest can be afraid.

346
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,910
I'm afraid of losing you.

347
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,050
I'm afraid you might get hurt,

348
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,130
and even more afraid that those three

349
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,290
might join forces and take you away.

350
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,020
Even if I fought with all my might,

351
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,300
I still couldn't get you back.

352
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,170
Are you still afraid?

353
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:42,790
Hmm.

354
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,720
Yes.

355
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,030
Alright, let's be serious.

356
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,980
Come, let's go find them together.

357
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,840
Let's go.

358
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,160
Demon Lord,

359
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,310
those who benefit the demons
deserve rewards,

360
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,030
and those who harm them
deserve punishment.

361
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,110
They worked hard

362
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,440
repairing the barrier.

363
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,430
They deserve some appreciation.

364
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,590
Aren't you coming?

365
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,530
Then I'll go by myself.

366
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:16,920
I'm off.

367
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,080
You're really not going?

368
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,400
You're really not going?

369
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,790
Did you make all these?

370
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,110
Yes.

371
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,170
Whatever you make must be delicious.

372
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,720
It's so delicious.

373
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,030
I declare

374
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,240
this is the most

375
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,900
delicious thing in the world.

376
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,240
Ao Hen,

377
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,440
These flower pastries
won't last for ten thousand years.

378
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,310
Don't tell me you want to
plant them in the ground

379
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,440
so they'll grow into
flower trees next year.

380
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,400
What do you know?

381
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,240
These flower pastries
were made by Xiao Yao,

382
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,400
so of course I need to keep them

383
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,730
to enjoy them properly.

384
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,030
-Enjoy them properly.
-To thank the three of you
for your hard work,

385
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,760
these flower pastries
were made by me and Hong Ye.

386
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,310
Hong Ye,

387
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,850
come out and eat with us.

388
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,270
Do you really think I'll come
just because you called me?

389
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,960
No matter what grievances
we've had before,

390
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,680
we demons are one family.

391
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,450
I offer tea instead of wine,

392
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,250
and consider
our misunderstandings resolved.

393
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,780
Go ahead and eat.

394
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,050
This is mine.

395
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,240
You're not worthy

396
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,810
of sharing with us.

397
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,000
My sister worked hard to make these.

398
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,750
Don't you dare

399
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,830
ruin them.

400
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,470
You've already eaten so much.
You're still eating?

401
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,830
Sister likes watching me eat.

402
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,880
She already told you
not to call her "Sister" anymore.

403
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,750
I'll call her whatever I want.

404
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,030
It's none of your business, you big oaf.

405
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,540
Teng She,

406
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,160
don't think I don't see through
your little schemes.

407
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,890
Stop hiding behind the
brother-and-sister act.

408
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,440
You're always the most scheming one,

409
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,550
and you've got the nerve
to say that about me?

410
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,200
Hong Ye,

411
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,200
this is all because of you.

412
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,930
Let go.

413
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,220
I said

414
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,550
I'd be the one to kill Hong Ye.

415
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,550
Everyone, let go!

416
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,440
All of you stop!

417
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,730
-Sister.
-Don't call me that.

418
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,820
Aren't you all tired?

419
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,200
Xiao Yao,

420
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,510
I've never forced you

421
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,970
to do anything you didn't want to.

422
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,920
But today, when I saw you

423
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,850
look at him with such infatuation,

424
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,400
I just couldn't stand it.

425
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,440
Since we met,

426
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,310
you've acted like
you don't know us at all,

427
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,440
only desperately protecting Hong Ye.

428
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,770
Aren't you curious about your past?

429
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,060
Don't you want to ask

430
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,640
why we just came out of Yunmeng Lake

431
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,790
and immediately wanted to
settle scores with him?

432
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,160
I truly don't understand

433
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,960
whether you genuinely don't know,

434
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,920
or if you're pretending
not to know just so you can stay with him.

435
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,900
I don't want to know about the past.

436
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,830
Ten thousand years have passed.

437
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,750
The world

438
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,070
has already changed.

439
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,680
How could I not have changed?

440
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,110
You...

441
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,110
Yes,

442
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,000
it's been over ten thousand years,

443
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,830
but your personality
hasn't changed at all.

444
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,640
How do you explain that?

445
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,750
Doesn't that prove

446
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,230
that my choice won't change either?

447
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,910
I was hoping

448
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,000
to have a proper conversation
with you all.

449
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,030
But now I see

450
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,090
there's no point in talking further.

451
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,200
Tonight is the night

452
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,810
Xiao Yao and I
will consummate our marriage.

453
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,980
Consummate your marriage?

454
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,790
No matter what we went through
in the past,

455
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,810
she is the woman I will marry in the end.

456
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,510
When did

457
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,810
you two get married?

458
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,400
A hundred years ago.

459
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,960
No matter how much time passes,

460
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,520
no matter what we go through,

461
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,820
the man I will marry

462
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,110
is Hong Ye.

463
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,250
I waited for you in Yunmeng Lake
for ten thousand years.

464
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,450
Why couldn't you wait

465
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,630
even a mere hundred?

466
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,510
Then let today's flower pastries

467
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,670
serve as our wedding pastries.

468
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,790
Since the three of you
have already eaten them,

469
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,480
don't bring up what happened
ten thousand years ago again.

470
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,400
Let us go,

471
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,060
and spare yourselves as well.

472
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,180
Wedding pastries?

473
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,210
Pah!

474
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,270
Filthy things!

475
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,440
I...

476
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,160
Pah!

477
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,650
Wedding pastries?

478
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,370
The mortal world is truly filthy.

479
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,790
It's only been a few days,

480
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,410
and I already have lines on my face.

481
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,310
Not at all,

482
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,740
Exalted Immortal.

483
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,240
Your skin is as smooth as jade,

484
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,480
and your flesh is like ice and bone.

485
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,210
Even my fingertips slip

486
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,930
slip when I touch your skin.

487
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,710
If the war were not so urgent,

488
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,110
what reason would there be

489
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,860
to linger in such a tainted place?

490
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,640
Yes.

491
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,790
His Majesty and all the consorts

492
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,270
are deeply grateful
for your great kindness.

493
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,640
The consorts of every palace

494
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,680
have offered up their
personal cosmetics and adornments.

495
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,610
Please, choose whatever you like.

496
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,080
I deserve death,

497
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,370
yet I beg you for mercy.

498
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,920
Just now, I was truly frightened.

499
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,830
The person who prepared
this box of hairpins

500
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,240
is extremely malicious.

501
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,550
You must not use these, Exalted Immortal.

502
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,590
The designs

503
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,680
of these hairpins

504
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,640
are based on

505
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,920
the phoenix tail,

506
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,750
silk orchids,

507
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,270
and dragon's blood flowers—

508
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,870
all symbolizing longevity.

509
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,380
Only elders of advanced age
would wear them.

510
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,830
You are merely sixteen,

511
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,310
in the prime of youth.

512
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,570
To display such things

513
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,160
is truly...

514
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,550
Which consort

515
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,110
sent this dressing case?

516
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,750
The Exalted Immortal is speaking to you.

517
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,880
The Western Palace.

518
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:59,030
Was it the Consort of the Western Palace
herself who prepared this dressing case?

519
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,720
I truly don't know.

520
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,510
The Emperor always praises
the Consort of the Western Palace for her wisdom.

521
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,830
All matters in the inner palace,

522
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,880
great and small,

523
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,060
are decided by her alone.

524
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,300
Surely it was an unintentional oversight

525
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,790
on her part.

526
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,160
Exalted Immortal, I beg you

527
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,310
to show leniency,

528
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,860
considering the Consort's

529
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,550
unparalleled beauty and grace.

530
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,350
Unparalleled beauty and grace?

531
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,580
Is she truly that stunning?

532
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,940
Of course, she cannot compare to you.

533
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,090
But within the Tiansheng Kingdom,

534
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,170
the Consort of the Western Palace

535
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,720
is indeed regarded as foremost in beauty.

536
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,660
Yanlan,

537
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,320
which palace do you serve in?

538
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,400
I

539
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,650
have served in the Eastern Palace

540
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,440
since childhood.

541
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,790
At this critical juncture
of life and death for the nation,

542
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,680
how dare you drag me into

543
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,610
the intrigues of the inner palace?

544
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,100
Tell your master

545
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,190
to give me an explanation!

546
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:09,940
Exalted Immortal,

547
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,070
I'm clumsy with words

548
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,000
and slow-witted,

549
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,140
and I have offended you.

550
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,480
But this matter truly has nothing to do

551
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,640
with my lady.

552
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,420
Please be merciful, Exalted Immortal.

553
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,500
I spoke carelessly

554
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,540
and angered the Exalted Immortal.

555
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,210
will punish myself to appease you.

556
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,370
All of you, withdraw.

557
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,440
Who have you truly become now?

558
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,530
♪ Fear that the red thread that bound us,
the vows we engraved ♪

559
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,620

♪ Afraid of the exchanged life and death,

564

whether it's eavesdropping or peeping,

673
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,070
we should wait outside for His Lordship

674
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,670
for such an important event.

675

Do you agree?

676
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,780
I never thought they'd still be together

677

678
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,159
So,

679
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,550
why are we still here

680
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,150
anyway?

681
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,050
What's the use of crying?

682
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,880
If she sees you like this,

683
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,850
she'll only despise you more

684
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,200
and drift further away from you.

685
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,510
Hong Ye,

686
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,370
you coward!

687
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,820
-You don't even dare to fight me head-on.
-You fought a lot.

688
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,880
Did Sister ever say

689
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,760
she'd like you if you won?

690
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,710
Even if she doesn't like me,

691
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,910
I can't let that Hong Ye take advantage.

692
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,210
I can't let him have her.

693
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,290
Get out of my way.

694
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,480
Move!

695
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,280
You're going to pick a fight with Hong Ye?

696
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,930
Of course.

697
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,450
They're already married.

698
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,920
If you hurt Hong Ye now,

699
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,030
you're hurting Sister.

700
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,780
I won't allow you to hurt her!

701
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,400
Teng She,

702
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,760
whose side are you on?

703
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,990
I'm on Sister's side.

704
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,620
As long as she's happy,

705
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,560
even if it breaks my heart,

706
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,820
I'll protect her choice till the end.

707
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,620
What if Hong Ye's affection is just

708
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,960
as false as it was ten millennia ago,

709
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,020
and his motives are just as ulterior?

710
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,150
Are you truly willing to stand by

711
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,530
and watch her be betrayed again?

712
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,510
If Xiao Yao knew

713
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,170
what Hong Ye truly did to her
all those years ago,

714
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,540
she would never have agreed to marry him.

715
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,040
Gentlemen,

716
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,820
if we truly care for her,

717
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,890
the most important thing we can do

718
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,860
is to reveal Hong Ye's true nature—

719
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,880
to let her see it clearly
and make her own choice again.

720
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,400
It's not that simple.

721
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,920
No matter what we say now,

722
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,280
Sister doesn't want to listen

723
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,080
or believe us.

724
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,340
Then let us form

♪ Dreams break like begonia blossoms ♪

747
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,840
This is the third best bowl of noodles

748
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,700
I've ever had.

749
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,540
♪ Rising against the torrent ♪

750
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,520
And what about the second best?

751
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,440
♪ Turning the account of impermanence ♪

752
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,930
That would be the bowl

753
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,340
from Xu's Noodles on my birthday.

754
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,110
So,

755
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,220
what's the very best then?

756
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,590
The very best

757
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,320
will be

758
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,030
the bowl you make for me tomorrow.

759
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,220
Oh, so you want me

760
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,400
to make noodles for you for a lifetime.

761
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,840
Yes.

762
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,490
Where did you learn these sweet words?

763
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,330
Do I need to learn this?

764
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,980
You're the one who doesn't know how.

765
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,360
My Lord!

766
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,110
My Lord, something terrible has happened!

767
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,800
Three great demons
have occupied Youning Cave.

768
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,840
They're casting spells
and forming arrays inside,

769
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,500
saying they want to
settle scores with Xiao Yao.

770
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,050
Time-Reversal Array.

771
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,070
What are you doing?
