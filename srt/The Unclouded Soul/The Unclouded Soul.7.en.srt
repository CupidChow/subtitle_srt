[The Unclouded Soul]

2
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,670
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,759
I'll take them all.

4
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,710
Please deliver them
to the magistrate's office.

5
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,390
No problem.

6
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,310
You are...

7
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,320
What are you doing here?

8
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,560
Why are you and the Feiyu Guard
going to Misty Forest again?

9
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,090
It's none of your business.

10
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,830
Protecting the demons
is my responsibility.

11
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,470
You are

12
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,730
no exception.

13
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,380
Who do you think you are?

14
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,230
Coming and going

15
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,070
as you please.

16
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,630
I, Xiao Yao, have been wandering
the martial world for a long time.

17
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,820
I don't need anyone's protection.

18
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,500
Let me go!

19
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:11,850
Xiao Yao.

20
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,130
Stop making a fuss.

21
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,100
Me? Making a fuss?

22
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,030
Fine.

23
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,630
I'm the one making a fuss.
It's all my fault.

24
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,890
Can you release me now?

25
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,260
It's really dangerous
for you to go in alone.

26
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,540
It's none of your business!

27
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,210
Let go!

28
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,190
Xiao Yao.

29
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,030
The Misty Forest
is the mountain elves' lair.

30
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,579
That masked man
is the rare thousand-year mountain elf.

31
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,540
He is neither human nor demon,

32
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,540
existing outside the Three Realms.

33
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,190
You can't handle him alone.

34
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,720
A mountain elf?

35
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,660
Come back with me.

36
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,120
I'll explain everything.

37
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,650
My Lord.

38
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,690
Do you still want the rope?

39
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,820
Where's that girl from just now?

40
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,980
She left with that gentleman.

41
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,640
Gentleman?

42
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,420
What kind of gentleman?

43
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,480
How was he dressed?

44
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,170
He was tall

45
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,620
with fair skin.

46
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,390
Tan'er, the great demon
is right before us.

47
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,790
Can't you sense it?

48
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,230
Twenty years ago,

49
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,950
the Hefeng Tribe rose to power
in the Northern Prairie.

50
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,470
The tribe leader,
imitating the Emperor of Tiansheng,

51
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,180
sent a fleet to search
for the Penglang Celestial Mountain.

52
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,030
But the fleet encountered a storm at sea.

53
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,070
Only one small boat remained,

54
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,270
drifting aimlessly.

55
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,680
By chance, it reached Penglang

56
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,260
and found the Yuli Spring.

57
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,260
The crew on the boat

58
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,980
were all loyal warriors
of the Hefeng Tribe,

59
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,100
extremely faithful,

60
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,630
who dared not drink it themselves

61
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,540
but wanted to bring it back
to their leader.

62
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,260
Little did they know
that on their way back,

63
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,100
they encountered another storm,

64
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,579
which blew their boat
into Tiansheng territory.

65
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,510
The Emperor of Tiansheng

66
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,510
wouldn't miss such an opportunity.

67
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,870
He immediately mobilized the Feiyu Guard
and various sects

68
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,820
to seize

69
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,140
the Yuli Spring at all costs.

70
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,840
You have all been deceived!

71
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,880
The spring water

72
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,490
is the tears of a demon,

73
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,660
drawing out the raw essence
of human nature and desire.

74
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,250
What you call immortality

75
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,519
is

76
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,000
an eternity of suffering!

77
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,400
The Hefeng Tribe was slaughtered.

78
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
But one young warrior survived.

79
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,409
For revenge,

80
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,130
he swallowed mud mixed with water
from the Yuli Spring,

81
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,190
prayed to demons for power,

82
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,080
and transformed into a mountain elf.

83
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,950
Why do you know so much about this

84
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,080
as if you've seen it with your own eyes?

85
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,950
It's all recorded in the Baize Drawings.

86
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,010
You didn't do your research properly

87
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,820
and you have the nerve to ask?

88
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,200
[Taotie]

89
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,340
[Mountain Elf]

90
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,340
He killed many people

91
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,310
for revenge.

92
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,380
Many sect leaders died by his hand.

93
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,010
He has a blood feud with humans

94
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,070
but nothing with demons.

95
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,070
Later, all major sects
were forced to unite.

96
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,040
And rumors about the elf
gradually disappeared.

97
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,300
We thought he was dead.

98
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,510
Unexpectedly,
he's been hiding in the Misty Forest

99
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,570
living eternally.

100
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,880
All his loved ones are dead.

101
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,120
What's the use of immortality?

102
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,670
Each day must feel like a year to him,

103
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,870
unbearably painful.

104
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,190
It's not surprising that he kidnapped

105
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,900
the Qionghua sect leader's daughter.

106
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,560
This is the consequence
of humans' own actions.

107
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,740
No.

108
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,630
The grievances of the previous generation

109
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,820
shouldn't fall on the next.

110
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,430
No matter how deep the elf's hatred is,

111
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,290
that girl shouldn't be involved.

112
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,140
This matter doesn't concern demons.

113
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,990
Demons never enter
the Misty Forest either.

114
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,220
Even if someone needs to be rescued,

115
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,700
humans should save their own.

116
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,870
Xiao Mu, be quiet!

117
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,140
My Lord, I...

118
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,310
My Lord.

119
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,920
My Lord, you really cannot go.

120
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,900
If it's about Luoluo and Dali,

121
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,630
all the more reason
you don't need to get involved.

122
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,580
I can resolve this
with one trip to Pingjiang.

123
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,830
A mere mountain elf

124
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,900
is no match for me.

125
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,780
Why are you trying so hard to stop me?

126
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,040
All the demon subjects

127
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,190
hope you can become powerful again,

128
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,310
leading us to find the Yuli Spring.

129
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,650
If you go to save humans

130
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,470
at this critical moment,

131
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,140
do you really want Hei Wu
to get the Demon Heart?

132
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,400
Luoluo and Dali are trapped among humans

133
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,860
in danger because of this.

134
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,170
If we abandon them,

135
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,990
how can we restore the Demon Heart?

136
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,310
No.

137
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,810
My Lord, you cannot go.

138
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,130
No, no!

139
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,750
My Lord!

140
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:54,800
You cannot go!

141
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,360
Xiao Yao.

142
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,570
Step aside.

143
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,070
If you won't save them,

144
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,110
I'll go myself.

145
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,950
You don't need to worry about me.

146
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,820
I have my own plan.

147
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,480
Move aside.

148
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,630
I won't worry about you.

149
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,030
I'll listen to your plan.

150
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,590
I'll do whatever you say.

151
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,890
What's in this bag?

152
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,810
The smell is so strong.

153
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,320
It's so stinky.

154
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,030
Of course dried fish stinks.

155
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,420
But it can lure cats out.

156
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,610
We can bring the leftovers back
for Xiao Ming.

157
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,740
He'll like them too.

158
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,830
Are you sure?

159
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,700
What about this hemp rope?

160
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,570
What's it for?

161
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,910
We can't go in together

162
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,460
so we don't frighten the girl.

163
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,340
I'll go in first.

164
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,220
If I encounter any danger,

165
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,550
I'll tug the rope twice.

166
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,740
If I don't pull the rope,

167
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
it means it's safe,

168
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,340
and you can let the rope down.

169
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,150
Xiao Yao.

170
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:27,870
Why don't

171
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,160
you wait for me here?

172
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,990
I'll go bring that girl back.

173
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,030
How will you bring her?

174
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,560
Kidnap her like the elf did?

175
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,700
Fine.

176
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,700
I won't say anything more.

177
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,030
Let's follow your plan.

178
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,220
That's our only option anyway.

179
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,580
Since the jade pendant was taken back,

180
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,910
we can't use the summoning spell anymore.

181
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,450
Let me do it.

182
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,670
Don't tie it too loose,

183
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,800
or it might fall off.

184
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,500
Don't tie it too tight either.

185
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,460
I'm afraid of being strangled.

186
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,460
I haven't even started tying it yet.

187
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,470
Then hurry up.

188
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,150
Done.

189
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:16,990
Xiao Yao!

190
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,420
Be careful.

191
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,150
Kitty.

192
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,090
Little Kitty.

193
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,310
Xiao Yao!

194
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,070
It loves these dried fish the most.

195
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,270
You can feed it these.

196
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,860
Nobody ever comes here,

197
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,030
it's so lonely.

198
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,850
It's so nice that you're here.

199
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:53,820
Xiao Yao.

200
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,210
Why did you come in?

201
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,630
Weren't you supposed to wait outside?

202
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,820
I noticed something strange with the rope,

203
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,820
so I came to check.

204
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,740
You were worried I might be in danger.

205
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,190
No,

206
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,900
you were worried
my face might be in danger.

207
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,540
Earlier, Flower Lady ran away,

208
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,150
and I came out with Li to look for it.

209
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,220
He said he was in the forest

210
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,680
and encountered a couple,

211
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,960
whom he frightened.

212
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:21,960
He was talking

213
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,590
about you two, wasn't he?

214
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,280
Since we've found the person,

215
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,080
let's go back.

216
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,080
Why such a hurry?

217
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,820
Why?

218
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,570
I came to this place by my own choice.

219
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,980
Li knows medicine

220
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,440
and can heal my eyes.

221
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,150
In just a few more days,

222
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,950
my eyes will be able to see again.

223
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,030
Please tell my parents

224
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,550
that there's a very nice person
taking care of me

225
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,010
and they shouldn't worry.

226
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,020
You don't believe me?

227
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,820
Let me take you to Li

228
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,530
so he can tell you himself.

229
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,510
Which way?

230
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:01,800
This way.

231
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:02,750
Let's go.

232
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:03,700
Wait.

233
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,620
Ignore him.

234
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,190
Let's go.

235
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,860
Every plant and tree here

236
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,320
is Li's friend.

237
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,060
We're here. It's right here.

238
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,320
Let's go.

239
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,310
I know you're annoyed.

240
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,440
Li.

241
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,680
Li, we have visitors.

242
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,090
Li.

243
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,910
Li.

244
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,310
He was just here

245
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,730
but now he's gone again.

246
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,950
Don't touch that!

247
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,130
Li.

248
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,980
I brought two friends to see you.

249
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,190
My parents noticed I was missing

250
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,800
and got worried,
so they sent them to find me.

251
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,550
Why are you wearing a mask again?

252
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,610
Didn't we agree you wouldn't wear it?

253
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,180
Flower Lady.

254
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,460
Don't be scared.

255
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,430
Don't be scared.

256
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,220
Thank you.

257
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:41,970
Can't you see?

258
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,270
I've been blind since childhood.

259
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,470
I can't see anything.

260
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,790
What happened

261
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,590
to your hand?

262
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,220
My hand...

263
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,520
is gone.

264
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,690
You're so pitiful.

265
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,750
Let me touch your face.

266
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,460
I should at least know

267
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,190
what the person
who saved Flower Lady looks like.

268
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,070
Why...

269
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,840
Why do you wear a mask?

270
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,300
I'm ugly.

271
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,930
I can't see.

272
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,480
You don't need to wear
a mask in front of me.

273
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,550
What's your name?

274
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,430
Li.

275
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,860
Li.

276
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,600
My name is Yunyi.

277
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,790
My parents always say
it's dangerous outside.

278
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,520
They never let me go out to play.

279
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,960
This time they brought me to Pingjiang,

280
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,200
but I'm still trapped indoors all day.

281
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:07,620
Li.

282
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,650
Take me out to play.

283
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,740
Otherwise, when my parents wake up,

284
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,400
I won't be able to go out again.

285
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,450
Li, please,

286
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,730
take me out to play.

287
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,090
This place feels so different

288
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,800
from where I live.

289
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,390
It smells so nice.

290
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,970
Old Pagoda.

291
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,720
You tripped my friend.

292
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,560
Is there someone else here?

293
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,560
Old Pagoda is this big tree beside you,

294
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,300
an old friend of mine.

295
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,970
Then,

296
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,150
take me to greet your old friend.

297
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,230
Let's go.

298
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,770
Your good friend must be very tall,

299
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:17,810
very big,

300
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,200
with many birds
making homes in its branches.

301
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,420
From now on,

302
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,369
Old Pagoda,

303
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,890
you're my good friend too.

304
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,750
It seems like it's talking.

305
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,110
It says your eyes

306
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,780
can actually see.

307
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,030
Really?

308
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,020
You can understand what it's saying?

309
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,060
It also says

310
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,670
you just need the first dewdrop

311
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,070
from the forest at sunrise
to wash your eyes

312
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,430
for half a month continuously,
and you'll be cured.

313
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,390
That means

314
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,560
I can hang out here for half a month.

315
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,520
Great!

316
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,640
Your family will be worried.

317
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,430
It's fine.

318
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,630
My parents are usually very busy.

319
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,110
They don't have time for me.

320
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,820
Besides,

321
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,590
if my eyes are really cured,

322
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,850
they'll be overjoyed.

323
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,220
Good.

324
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,110
From now on,
come with me daily to collect morning dew.

325
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,960
Wonderful!

326
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,330
If my eyes really heal,

327
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,260
I'll see my parents with my own eyes,

328
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,190
then look at you,

329
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,160
and see all the beautiful sights
in this vast world.

330
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,270
Your face must be good looking,

331
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,880
but you always wear a mask.

332
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,460
Since the first time I met you,

333
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,790
you've been wearing it.

334
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,310
Xiao Yao, Hong Ye,

335
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,540
please tell me,

336
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,870
is Li's face good looking?

337
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,120
Yes, it is.

338
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,430
I knew it.

339
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,000
Yunyi, go sit in the sunshine for a while.

340
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,390
It will be good for your eyes.

341
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:53,850
Mm-hmm.

342
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,260
Xiao Yao, come on.

343
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,400
I'll take you to have some fun.

344
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,120
Let's go.

345
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,090
Demon King.

346
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,590
You are the mountain elf.

347
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,160
Did you kill the human ladies

348
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,140
by the lake?

349
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,790
No.

350
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,480
Who did then?

351
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,840
Find out yourself.

352
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,350
You're a Demon King.

353
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,640
Why did you come to my forest

354
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:35,950
these many times?

355
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,590
I'm here to look
for that little girl just now.

356
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,010
A demon like you

357
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,580
is meddling in human affairs?

358
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,830
Why do you

359
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,670
keep her here?

360
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,040
To heal her eyes.

361
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,810
Do you know she's the only daughter
of Qionghua's sect leader?

362
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,300
Years ago,
all major sects and the Feiyu Guard

363
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,510
nearly wiped out your kind.

364
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,190
Do you truly want to heal her?

365
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,190
I did this

366
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,150
to atone for my sins.

367
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,630
The mountain elf is born of revenge.

368
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,960
What is this atonement for?

369
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,870
My father once said,

370
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,670
the Yuli Spring is the tears of demons.

371
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,290
What you call immortality

372
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,590
is just endless suffering.

373
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,060
For revenge,

374
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,790
I swallowed the mud
containing Yuli Spring water

375
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,570
and became a mountain elf,

376
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,830
killing countless people.

377
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,510
But I suffered the backlash

00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,610
Now do you believe

560
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,360
Hong Ye is not the murderer?

561
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,300
Whether you believe it or not
is not my problem.

562
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,230
Catching the killer
is the Feiyu Guard's job anyway.

563
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,270
But I hope
you won't implicate the innocent

564
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,110
and can help prevent more
young women in Pingjiang

565
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,440
from dying needlessly.

566
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,830
The city gates have been closed for days.

567
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,940
Citizens keep
their doors and windows shut.

568
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,630
The Feiyu Guard patrols day and night.

569
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,290
No one else will die unjustly.

570
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,020
If the city gates remain closed,

571
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,670
won't people starve to death?

572
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,460
True. People fear starvation,

573
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,130
and so does the killer.

574
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
You mean...

575
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,950
As long as he still craves blood,

576
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,590
he'll eventually slip up
and reveal himself.

577
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,320
So what we need to do now is to...

578
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:38,780
Wait.

579
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,070
Lower your voice.

580
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,300
Don't let everyone in Pingjiang know

581
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,700
you killed those people.

582
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,980
I'm here.

583
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,500
Thank you for escorting me back.

584
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,260
Xiao Yao.

585
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,210
The city is still not safe.

586
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,740
Stay safe.

587
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,670
Of course.

588
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,220
I hope you can find the killer soon

589
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,020
and restore Pingjiang's peace.

590
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,870
Of course.

591
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:12,230
Tan'er.

592
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,690
Hong Ye is clearly in there.

593
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,719
Why won't you come out of your sheath?

594
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,860
Don't tell me
you've taken a liking to that—

595
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,150
Just kidding.

596
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,260
Just kidding.

597
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,409
That Feiyu Guard has left?

598
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,130
Mm-hmm.

599
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,310
He didn't want to chat with you
any longer?

600
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:46,949
He did.

601
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,030
But there was nothing to talk about.

602
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,260
The wine from the human realm

603
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,690
is quite interesting.

604
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,290
I am the Demon Lord,

605
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,270
above all demons.

606
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,750
Similar to your human emperor.

607
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,830
I may seem noble,

608
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,860
but I'm actually lonely.

609
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,530
I have no friends to drink with.

610
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,710
Isn't it just that you don't trust others?

611
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,640
You make it sound

612
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,390
so fancy.

613
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,180
I've been sincere before,

614
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,030
and have trusted people too.

615
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,320
But in the end,

616
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,960
it became a weapon for others to hurt me.

617
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,910
Since then,

618
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,980
I've been unwilling to trust again.

619
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,980
I thought I had

620
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,050
become cold-hearted.

621
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,060
Until...

622
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,550
