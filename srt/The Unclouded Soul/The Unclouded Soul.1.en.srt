00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,940
[The Unclouded Soul]

2
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,759
[Episode 1]

3
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,920
[Since the beginning of time,]

4
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,840
[legends have told of
a celestial mountain]

5
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,150
[with a spring called Yuli.]

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,259
[Humans who drink it gain immortality,]

7
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,289
[while demons
gain 1,000 years of cultivation.]

8
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,590
[However,
this mountain drifts between sea and sky.]

9
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,000
[Only with the guidance
of the ancient Kunlun Mirror]

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,870
[can one be led there.]

11
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,710
[Humans and demons alike
have been trying to find it]

12
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,870
[relentlessly.]

13
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,680
[Among them, the emperors of the
Tiancheng Kingdom were the most obsessed,]

14
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,960
[even sending seven costly expeditions.]

15
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:22,790
The celestial mountain?

16
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,810
[Emperor of Tiansheng Kingdom]

17
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,790
The divine has blessed me.

18
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,329
This must be Yuli Spring.

19
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,420
[Dreamshard Immortal]

20
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,690
Greetings, Exalted Immortal.

21
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,020
Thank you for granting me Yuli.

22
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,200
What you see

23
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,190
is merely an illusion.

24
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,800
To find the true Yuli Spring,

25
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,780
you need the guidance of the Kunlun Mirror

26
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,150
to find the path
to the celestial mountain.

27
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,060
Please enlighten me, Exalted Immortal.

28
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
You're the Emperor, who is supreme.

29
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,680
Others are of no concern,

30
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,030
except Hong Ye, the Monarch of All Demons.

31
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,840
But Hong Ye was

32
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,840
destroyed by our ancestors 100 years ago.

33
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,579
He is merely lying dormant.

34
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:40,860
If he drinks from Yuli Spring first

35
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,060
and regains his powers,

36
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:44,920
in this world,

37
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,579
no one will be able to match him.

38
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,020
Remember this face.

39
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,810
[Hong Ye]

40
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,920
If you want to live forever,

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,910
you must step over my dead body!

42
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,800
Yuli Spring...

43
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,510
Your Majesty,

44
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,430
what's wrong?

45
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,070
His Majesty
was tormented by nightmares at night,

46
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,409
and the Feiyu Guard failed to protect him.

47
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,740
All Feiyu Guards,
assemble outside the side hall

48
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,720
for punishment

49
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,750
The late emperor
established the Feiyu Guard

50
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,550
to eliminate demons in the capital.

51
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,830
And now,

52
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,800
in your time,

53
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,130
demons have invaded my bedchamber!

54
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,159
Your Majesty, please calm your anger!

55
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,600
I deserve death!

56
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,100
Should I keep the Feiyu Guard,

57
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,000
or should I keep you as the Demon Slayer?

58
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,930
Your Majesty!

59
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,110
Your Majesty!

60
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,430
Your Majesty!

61
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,180
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!

62
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,390
Please spare my life, Your Majesty!

63
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,190
Which one is Bingzhu?

64
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,360
I am...

65
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,140
Bingzhu.

66
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,800
[Bingzhu]

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,310
From today onward,

68
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,750
you will take over as the Demon Slayer
of the Feiyu Guard.

69
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,730
With this token,
you can command all provinces

70
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,280
[Demon Slayer of the Feiyu Guard]

71
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,040
to assist the Feiyu Guard

72
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,230
in eliminating evil demons.

73
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,430
I-I, Bingzhu,

74
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,659
obey your command.

75
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,720
Bingzhu, Demon Slayer of the Feiyu Guards,

76
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,320
enter the hall
to receive the imperial decree!

77
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,580
Thank you, sir.

78
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,270
It's 9PM!

79
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Lock your doors and windows,

80
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,140
keep your family safe,

81
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,430
and beware of demons!

82
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,159
Mom,

83
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:42,880
why can't we go outside after dark?

84
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,360
Because when it gets dark,

85
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,020
demons come out to eat people.

86
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,409
Mom.

87
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,870
The demons you talk about—

88
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,720
do they look like this?

89
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,950
Little rascal, go to sleep.

90
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,870
Demon! Demon!

91
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,610
Demon!

92
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,710
[Xiao Yao]

93
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,380
Keep your family safe!

94
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,600
It's 9PM!

95
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,160
Lock your doors and windows,

96
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,480
keep your family safe,

97
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,390
and beware of demons!

98
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,610
Demon!

99
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,600
Don't be afraid!

100
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,730
I will surely capture that bear demon!

101
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,510
A sorcerer is catching demons!

102
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,630
Everyone, come and help catch the demon!

103
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,270
Hurry!

104
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,740
Where is it?

105
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:39,900
My Lord,

106
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,299
since the demon has appeared,

107
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,030
[Ji Yan]

108
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,480
should we use the Feiyu token

109
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,080
to call for reinforcements?

110
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,200
My demon-slaying blade hasn't alerted me.

111
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,800
Why panic?

112
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,550
Where is it?

113
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,680
Where is it?

114
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,600
Where's the demon?

115
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,660
Where's the demon?

116
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,240
Everyone, rest assured.

117
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,320
Now that I've taken action,

118
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,240
victory is certain. Follow me!

119
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,670
Let's go!

120
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,240
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

121
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,170
Catch the demon!

122
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,630
Hurry! This way!

123
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,430
Don't let the bear demon escape!

124
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,870
It's the curfew hour.

125
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,840
Who's there?

126
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,150
Officer,

127
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,150
I am a demon hunter from Jiwei Mountain.

128
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,650
I've been chasing a bear demon
all the way here.

129
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,150
Please do me a favor

130
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,410
and open the city gate.

131
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,770
Closing the city gates at night
is the law.

132
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,790
[Pingjiang Prefecture]

133
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,190
No one may enter or leave.

134
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,550
The bear demon is violent by nature

135
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,720
and has hurt countless people.

136
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,390
If it returns to Pingjiang Prefecture
to cause harm,

137
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,320
what good will closing the gates do?

138
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,220
That's right!

139
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,240
The officials have their own judgment.

140
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,960
Master,

141
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,640
please don't make things difficult for us.

142
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,150
Heroine,

143
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,870
if you leave the city now,

144
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,270
the demon will turn back,

145
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,750
and the ones who suffer

146
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,200
will be common folk like us.

147
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,780
Yes, yes!

148
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,570
Please stay, heroine!

149
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,290
Please stay, heroine!

150
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,530
-Stay!
-Stay!

151
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,160
Protect us, heroine!

152
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,450
Please stay!

153
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,910
Stay, heroine!

154
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,060
Make way! Make way!

155
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,210
The Prefect is here!

156
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Set down the sedan.

157
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,970
Set down the sedan! Set down the sedan!

158
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,150
Master,

159
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,940
I've prepared excellent food and wine
at my residence.

160
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,200
[Prefect]

161
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,030
Please stay at my house for a few days.

162
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,360
Yes, yes.

163
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,150
But...

164
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,480
Master, may I have a word with you?

165
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,720
Go!

166
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,200
Go!

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,280
To be honest with you, Master,

168
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,240
I have two daughters

169
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,570
at home.

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,910
They've heard about
the recent demon attacks

171
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,550
and haven't eaten
or slept properly for days.

172
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,790
They're often distracted and anxious.

173
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,080
I hope you can help us.

174
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,060
I appreciate your kindness,

175
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,020
but if I don't eliminate the bear demon,

176
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,980
what if it returns to harm the people?

177
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,830
What should we do if the bear demon
comes back?

178
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,210
-Master! You can't leave!
-You can't leave us alone.

179
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,940
Shut up! Shut up!

180
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,900
Who are you to speak here?

181
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,760
If you take the Master home,

182
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,360
-who will protect us common folk?
-Stop making such a fuss!

183
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,220
How about this?

184
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,030
I have

185
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,440
some talismans here.

186
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,080
Place them on your doors and windows,

187
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,000
and they will prevent demons
from approaching.

188
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,270
You can also carry them with you.

189
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,390
Recite the incantation,

190
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,390
and it will keep demons at bay.

191
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,390
Today,

192
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,260
I'll give them to you.

193
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,340
Master,

194
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,720
I heard that others' talismans
are quite expensive.

195
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,510
You're giving these away for free.

196
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,720
Will they actually work?

197
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,000
How rude!

198
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,360
These were given to me

199
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,690
by my master for protection before I left.

200
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,330
Talk about ingratitude!

201
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,360
So ungrateful.

202
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,280
Forget it then.

203
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,510
I'll take them all.

204
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,120
Name your price, Master.

205
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,990
I'll pay 5 coins!

206
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,030
10 coins!

207
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,340
I'll pay 60 coins!

208
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,000
Why is he bidding up the price?

209
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,760
I'll pay 1 tael!

210
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,000
That's too much.

211
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,130
I can't afford that.

212
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,240
Everyone,

213
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,120
since fate has brought us together today,

214
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,320
I'll create a bond of goodwill with you.

215
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,880
I'll sell this talisman

216
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,530
for one coin a piece. Is that all right?

217
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,570
No need to rush! Don't push!

218
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,240
Pay the money and you'll get one!

219
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,870
You just need to pay!

220
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,960
Don't push!

221
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,860
Stop pushing!

222
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,390
There's enough for everyone!

223
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,920
I've been hunting demons for years,

224
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,550
but today I've truly opened my eyes.

225
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,550
I didn't know you were here, sir.

226
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,630
Forgive me for not greeting you properly.

227
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,630
Please accept my apologies.

228
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,160
Please step back, Prefect.

229
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,520
I'd like to have

230
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,640
a word with this female Master.

231
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,670
I'm Bingzhu,

232
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,120
[Demon Slayer of the Feiyu Guard]

233
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,920
Demon Slayer of the Feiyu Guard.

234
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,340
So you're Master Bingzhu.

235
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,260
May I ask your name

236
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,910
and which immortal sect you belong to?

237
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,720
We focus on quiet cultivation.

238
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,270
To avoid worldly distractions,

239
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,630
I cannot disclose that information.

240
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,870
Please understand.

241
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,200
This seems to be fur

242
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,060
that fell off that demon just now.

243
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,120
It is bear fur,

244
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,170
but since it hasn't been nourished
by blood,

245
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,700
it has long since dried out.

246
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,590
Perhaps it was scorched by my fire whip.

247
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,910
That makes sense.

248
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,690
But this footprint

249
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,380
doesn't match the size of that bear demon.

250
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,080
That bear demon

251
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,620
was massive,

252
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,050
weighing between 150 and 250 kilograms,

253
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,080
but this footprint looks like...

254
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,150
it's from something
barely over 50 kilograms—

255
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,630
more like a human.

256
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,380
Master,

257
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,830
what's your opinion?

258
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,150
Fifty-fifty?

259
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,720
All of it.

260
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,230
Forty-sixty?

261
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,650
-You get sixty, and I get forty.
-I told you.

262
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,030
All of it.

263
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,030
The Feiyu Guard has been
watching over the city this whole time,

264
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,510
and not a single fly has gotten out,

265
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,550
which means the demon...

266
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,120
is still inside the city.

267
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,750
What exactly do you want?

268
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,610
Feiyu Guards came here

269
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,900
to catch the demon.

270
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,120
But this female master

271
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,720
accidentally let it escape.

272
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,580
Fortunately, the Feiyu Guard...

273
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,150
didn't fail its mission.

274
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,120
Move!

275
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,530
Move!

276
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
Behave yourself!

277
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,840
Move!

278
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,390
Move!

279
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,000
It's a human!

280
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:54,750
It's a human!

281
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,630
It's a human!

282
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,670
It's a human!

283
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,360
Daughter,

284
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,000
[Xiao Dadan]

285
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,130
we've been exposed!

286
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,020
Frauds!

287
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,240
I've had my eyes on you from the start.

288
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,390
Still trying to run?

289
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,200
Beware!

290
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,000
[Justice of the World]

291
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,720
Beware!

292
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,700
Please, sir.

293
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,910
Have a seat.

294
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,510
Sit.

295
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,720
[Righteousness]

296
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,950
Swindler, state your names!

297
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,440
Bring cold water here

298
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,680
to wake her up.

299
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,790
Cold water.

300
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,320
Yes.

301
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,960
Where am I?

302
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,960
Officer?

303
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,750
-Dad?
-Daughter.

304
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,460
-You insolent criminal!
-You...

305
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,080
You are extremely brazen.

306
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,030
This is the magistrate's office,

307
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,320
not a place for your theatrics!

308
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,960
My name is Xiao Yao.

309
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,140
This is my father, Xiao Dadan.

310
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,170
Those people are from my hometown.

311
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,870
We were originally hunters.

312
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,600
But several months ago,

313
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,320
the magistrate's office suddenly ordered
us to catch demons within a deadline.

314
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,520
How do we know how to catch demons?

315
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,080
We had no choice

316
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,000
but to leave our hometown.

317
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,390
Out of desperation,

318
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,270
we risked our lives to hunt a bear

319
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,410
and used its skin

320
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,960
-to pretend to be a demon.
-Troublemakers.

321
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,720
Menaces!

322
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,600
So you're the ones
behind the demon disturbances in the city!

323
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,610
You caused my daughter...

324
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,910
You caused my daughter mental fatigue

325
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,920
and the people of this city
are living in fear.

326
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:58,770
Officer,

327
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,870
I know I was wrong.

328
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,840
But we have never harmed anyone.

329
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,400
We're just asking for a chance to live.

330
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,920
Please judge us fairly.

331
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
[Righteousness]

332
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,910
Judge?

333
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,640
We caught you red-handed.

334
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,200
Guards!

335
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,440
Take this female swindler to prison

336
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,750
to await execution!

337
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:14,280
And give the others 50 strokes each!

338
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,280
I'd like to see

339
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,109
who dares spread rumors again

340
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,310
about demons in this prefecture.

341
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,400
My Lord! My Lord!

342
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,589
My daughter may be reckless

343
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,920
and deserving of death,

344
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,880
but I beg you

345
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,240
to spare her life.

346
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,680
Take them away! Take them away!

347
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,310
My Lord!

348
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,210
Let me go!

349
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,510
I've returned all the money.

350
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,750
Why must you take my life?

351
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,010
You corrupt official!

352
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,110
You can't catch demons;

353
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,590
all you know is killing people.

354
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,310
And you!

355
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,240
Demon Slayer of the Feiyu Guard?

356
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,160
You use the name of demon hunting

357
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,240
to bleed the people dry

358
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,960
and collude with this corrupt official.

359
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,450
And now

360
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,880
you want to take our lives
to earn credit with your superiors.

361
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,030
If I die, will that make the demons

362
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,200
in this city disappear?

363
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,400
Outrageous! Outrageous.

364
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,790
Guards! Gag her

365
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,000
and drag her out!

366
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,570
-I'm telling...
-Wait.

367
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,560
I think you made a good point.

368
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,930
By killing,

369
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,010
we can't catch any demons.

370
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,310
But what if the one I kill

371
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,350
is actually a demon?

372
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,070
This is the compass

373
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,370
the Feiyu Guard uses for hunting demons.

374
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,790
When a demon is near,

375
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,350
the bead inside moves

376
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,550
and helps us

377
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,870
locate it.

378
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,270
From the city gate
to the magistrate's office,

379
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,530
you've been spinning stories all night.

380
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,880
Now honestly tell us your true identity.

381
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,290
Since it's come to this,

382
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,730
I'll tell you the truth.

383
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,400
I am a demon.

384
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,320
A nine-tailed fox demon.

385
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,480
Go ahead, kill me,

386
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,880
and go claim your credit.

387
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,320
Since you're so eager to die,

388
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,710
I'll grant your wish!

389
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,310
My Lord!

390
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,100
My Lord!

391
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,280
Please don't!

392
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,080
Let me explain on her behalf.

393
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,550
My daughter

394
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,400
is indeed different from others.

395
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,330
Her blood carries a peculiar scent

396
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,750
that attracts snakes, insects,
and other foul creatures.

397
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,000
People may mistake her for a demon,

398
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,250
but she isn't.

399
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,630
Many people came to my home,
splashed dog's blood,

400
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,750
drove us from place to place, and hunted
and reviled us wherever we went.

401
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,070
But she's not a demon.

402
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,220
She... she was born from my wife.

403
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,320
She's human.

404
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,000
Human!

405
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,880
So her blood

406
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,770
can attract demons?

407
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,160
Wait...

408
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,500
Since that's the case,

409
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,230
I shall use you as bait
to lure out the true demons.

410
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,530
Once we catch a great demon,

411
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,260
I'll release them all.

412
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,130
What do you say?

413
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,840
You said it yourself.

414
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,430
I hope you keep your word.

415
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,440
Set up the formation!

416
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,230
This is the heart of Qingyuan Mountain,

417
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,970
a place filled with demonic energy
for 100 years.

418
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,480
We read the stars and predicted

419
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,610
that a great demon would appear today.

420
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,530
We didn't expect you to suddenly show up.

421
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,830
You...

422
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,430
Don't pull me.

423
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,720
You...

424
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,080
Miss,

425
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,470
I'm sorry about this.

426
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,310
What are you doing?

427
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,240
If what your father said is true,

428
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,510
that the peculiar scent in your blood
can attract demons,

429
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,840
then this will count as you making amends.

430
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,960
I'll cooperate with you until dawn.

431
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,590
Tomorrow at 5 in the morning,

432
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,830
whether a great demon appears or not,

433
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,310
you must let us go.

434
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,720
It hurts.

435
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,600
We'll see by then.

436
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,460
My Lord,

437
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,590
this girl only has a sharp tongue.

438
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,750
Can we trust her?

439
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,420
The compass reacts
when it gets close to her,

440
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,720
which means she's not an ordinary person.

441
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,200
But my demon-slaying blade didn't warn me,

442
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,880
so she's not a demon.

443
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,880
She's neither human nor a demon,

444
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,940
so she must have some unusual traits.

445
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,300
Today is the 15th day of the 7th month,

446
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,480
when yin and yang shift
and demonic energy peaks.

447
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,920
Xiao's wilderness survival rule No. 9:

448
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,980
at night, always stay off the ground.

449
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,750
Officials claim there are demons

450
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,350
to embezzle money.

451
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,000
Commoners claim there are demons

452
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,880
just to scare their children.

453
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,440
Great demons are not that easy to find.

454
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,310
Be patient.

455
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,010
This is no ordinary great demon.

456
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,550
This time, I've truly found a treasure.

457
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,440
You want this?

458
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,160
You...

459
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,000
Step back.

460
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,000
Catch it.

461
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,030
The Zhu Jiuyin lineage?

462
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,270
Attack.

463
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:27,830
Yes.

464
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,880
I'll give it to you.

465
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,590
Let's see

466
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,950
who catches it first.

467
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,390
[Seal]

468
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,370
The great demon has appeared.

469
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,700
You should let me go now.

470
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,190
It's not time yet.

471
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,480
Why did you try to kill it?

472
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,950
Didn't you see
it was trying to kill people?

473
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,310
It had no intention to kill people.

474
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,750
If you hadn't
activated the formation first,

475
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,030
it wouldn't have become so agitated.

476
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,400
My Lord, please help us!

477
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,000
We can't hold on much longer!

478
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,920
Come back!

479
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,960
It's dangerous!

480
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,660
Catch her!

481
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,640
Let me go!

482
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Your lord said

483
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,480
he'd let me go once the demon appeared.

484
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,080
How can he go back on his word?

485
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,410
Miss!

486
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,000
Ning'an!

487
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,470
How dare you come back?

488
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,240
You're not Ning'an.

489
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:12,830
[Xiao Ming/Xiao Mu]

490
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,360
Ning'an wouldn't
let herself smell this bad.

491
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,430
You smell bad! Your mouth stinks.

492
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,180
It's been 100 years.

493
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,240
You still won't let go of His Lordship?

494
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,880
What?

495
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,340
Give me back His Lordship!

496
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,950
Don't catch me!

497
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,030
Don't run!

498
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,490
Give me back His Lordship!

499
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,280
Are you in a hurry to die?

500
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,550
Come back here!

501
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,750
Stop right there!

502
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,720
She's a fallen immortal.

503
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,510
Don't look at her!

504
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,240
Don't fall for her charm spell!

505
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,570
Monarch of All Demons?

506
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,230
You have finally appeared.

507
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,030
Ning'an.

508
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,070
You still won't let me go.

509
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,880
Hong Ye,

510
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,880
soon I'll make you come to find me.

511
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,350
Sir.

512
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,239
According to the hexagrams...

513
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,670
My Lord,

514
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,230
so many of our brothers
were injured this time,

515
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,840
but we still didn't catch the great demon.

516
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,370
Could we use the Feiyu token

517
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,190
to request more provincial troops
for reinforcement?

518
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,710
Provincial troops
are fine for catching people.

519
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,370
If we send them to hunt demons,

520
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,850
they'll just be walking to their deaths.

521
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,480
But that great demon is no ordinary one.

522
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,340
If we don't eliminate it quickly,

523
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,110
I'm afraid a disaster will happen.

524
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,170
Great demons are hard to find anyway.

525
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,480
Let's stop searching for now.

526
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,140
Let's wait for it to come to us.

527
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,760
My Lord!

528
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,660
Thank goodness!

529
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,190
My Lord, you have finally woken up!

530
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,320
Heaven has shown mercy.

531
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,960
I've been waiting for you day and night,

532
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,470
and you're finally back!

533
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,220
My Lord,

534
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,920
please look at me carefully.

535
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,550
Transform into Xiao Mu first.

536
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,370
My Lord...

537
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,410
I want to see him.

538
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,840
My Lord, you...

539
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,590
Three,

540
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,280
two...

541
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,360
Alright, alright.

542
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,030
My Lord?

543
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,510
Greetings,

544
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,630
My Lord.

545
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,800
It was that human girl

546
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,360
who awakened me?

547
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,230
Yes.

548
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,190
Get away!

549
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,590
Don't come over!

550
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,440
It's bad enough you kidnapped me.

551
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,700
Don't come any closer!

552
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,920
I'll eat you!

553
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,920
Stay back!

554
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,190
Hello there.

555
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,920
I was forced to come to Qingyuan Mountain.

556
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,880
I meant no offense.

557
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,760
Please let me go.

558
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,300
Demons

559
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,530
are a scourge
that all are duty-bound to eradicate.

560
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,800
As the princess,

561
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,230
my previous behavior

562
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,880
was merely to disturb your mind.
