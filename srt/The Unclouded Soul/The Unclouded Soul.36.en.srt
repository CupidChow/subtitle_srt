00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,130
As long as you live,

4
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,210
I'll make you suffer every day.

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,259
Can't take it anymore?

6
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,039
I knew it.

7
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,610
A human like you

8
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,590
could never make her happy.

9
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,050
But if you promise

10
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,850
to never see Xiao Yao again,

11
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:00,300
I'll let you go.

12
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,560
Say it.

13
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,669
Say it.

14
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,910
Say it out loud!

15
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,590
Why aren't you speaking?

16
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,079
Promise me you won't see her again,

17
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,360
and I'll end your suffering.

18
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,340
Just say it.

19
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,670
Say it!

20
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
If I can see her again,

21
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,220
this little suffering

22
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,960
means nothing to me.

23
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,760
Even if I kill you,

24
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,240
Yao probably still won't like me.

25
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,350
I can let you go.

26
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,610
But you must promise

27
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,610
that for as long as you live,

28
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
you will never...

29
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,890
Never

30
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,120

31
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,010
Do you really think
I don't dare to kill you?

32
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,710
You are pure and sacred,

33
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,010
and shouldn't coexist with
the filthy humans.

34
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,640
On the day of the eclipse,

35
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,490
you should have killed me.

36
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,450
But instead, you healed my hand,

37
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,870
making me think of you day and night.

38
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,000
For my Ao Hen Clan,

39
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,240
cultivation is a battle.

40
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,290
We fall when defeated,

41
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,170
and lick our own wounds when victorious.

42
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,760
For thousands of years,

43
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,350
you're the only one
to have ever tended to my wounds.

44
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,950
I only helped you out of pity,

45
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,120
nothing more.

46
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,730
I won't force you to like me.

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,490
But I will do my utmost

48
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,610
to do anything that benefits you.

49
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,080
And I will completely eliminate

50

anything that harms you.

51
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,390
How could you possibly know better than me

52

what's best for me?

53
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,160
Thank you for your concern,

54
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,840
but please stop meddling in my affairs.

55
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,909
I'm asking you one last time.

56
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,130
Where is Hong Ye?

57
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,670
I swear,

58

if you just give me one chance,

59
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,620
I'll protect you for ten thousand years.

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,140
I'm late.

65
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,250
Let's go.

66
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,280
Your behavior

67
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,110
is truly disgraceful.

68
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,680
Did you think I couldn't see

69
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,430
how much you've made Hong Ye suffer?

70
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,950
At least I never truly wanted to kill him.

71
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,880
How does it feel

72
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,330
to hand Hong Ye over to Xiao Yao yourself?

73
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,330
Better than having Yao hate me.

74
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,350
After cultivating for thousands of years,

75
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,020
both of us are no match for a mere human.

76
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,070
Is your mouth

77
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:40,260
laced with poison?

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,680
Hong Ye!

79
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,060
Your meridians aren't like a demon's.

80
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,280
I can only temporarily suppress
the turmoil in your body.

When we return to the Dragon Palace,

82
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,370
we'll heal you properly.

83
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,180
I won't go back
to the Dragon Palace with you.

84
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,760
I will protect you well from now on.

85
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
I won't let any demon hurt you again.

86
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,290
You've already helped me so much.

87
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,890
I can't always hide under your protection.

88
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,160
And I can't become your burden.

89
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,430
Don't say that.

94

187
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,730
Take care of yourself too.

188
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,240
Father.

189
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,620
Father.

190
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,390
Father.

191
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,480
Father.

192
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,640
Father.

193
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,900
Look at me.

194
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,620
I'm Ye.

195
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,630
I have returned.

196
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,360
Father.

197
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,670
Father.

198
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,320
Father!

199
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,760
Father.

200
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,390
Prince Ye,

201
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,670
you've finally returned.

202
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,030
Who did this?

203
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,890
The Ao Hen Clan.

204
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,370
You led the fleet

205
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,480
to search for the celestial mountain
and didn't return for over a month.

206
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,030
We sent search parties again and again,

207
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,960
but in the end, along the shore,

208
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,400
we only found the wreckage of your fleet.

209
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,160
Everyone thought you had perished,

210
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,760
and the emperor
fell gravely ill because of it.

211
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,720
Just recently,

212
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,250
news came from a southern fishing village

213
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,750
that villagers had seen you.

214
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,080
The emperor rose from his sickbed,

215
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,180
saying he wanted to welcome you home.

216
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,090
He was planning to leave today,

217
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,120
but unexpectedly,

218
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,530
the Ao Hen Clan
descended from the sky just now

219
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,630
and destroyed everything they could!

220
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,550
We have failed.

221
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,670
We couldn't protect the emperor.

222
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,970
Prince Ye,

223
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,780
the human race is now in grave danger.

224
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,870
Since you have returned safely,

225
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,330
we beg you
to immediately ascend the throne.

226
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,600
Lead humanity in continuing
the search for the Yuli Spring

227
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,190
to give our race

228
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,550
a glimmer of hope in this world.

229
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,190
Since the demons haven't
wiped out all humans yet,

230
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,650
I shall borrow the power of heaven

231
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,630
to fight for humanity's future.

232
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,200
Long live Emperor Ye!

233
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,470
Heaven and earth,

234
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,650
the origin of all energy.

235
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,270
Within and beyond the Three Realms,

236
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,290
only the Way is supreme.

237
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,600
Encompassing heaven and earth,

238
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,370
it nurtures all living beings.

239
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,810
Profound wisdom penetrates,

240
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,850
as the five energies rise.

241
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,240
The human emperor

242
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,960
prays for heaven's mandate,

243
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,430
seeking divine guidance

244
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,070
to find the Yuli Spring

245
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,790
and protect all people
from suffering and hardship.

246
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,800
The celestial mountain
and Yuli have not appeared

247
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,570
because humans
have not shown true sincerity.

248
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,670
Deity, I beg you for guidance.

249
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,940
I am willing to find the Yuli

250
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,080
at any cost.

251
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,120
As with all things in the world,

252
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,430
if you desire it intensely,

253
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,760
you will become enlightened.

254
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,859
If humans wish to become powerful,

255
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,640
they must first have a powerful heart.

256
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,400
Then will you be able to carry

257
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,270
the divine power bestowed upon you.

258
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,440
I, Hong Ye,

259
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,770
am willing to receive divine power...

260
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,910
with my mortal body.

261
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,320
I grant you power

262
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,460
to aid your cultivation.

263
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,750
If you find Yuli,

264
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,160
only then
can the divine power be passed on.

265
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,850
Otherwise, humans cannot be saved,

266
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,960
and extinction would be justified.

267
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,020
How exactly can I prove myself

268
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,130
to find Yuli?

269
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,860
Each demon tribe has passed down

270
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,490
a pearl that condenses
the primordial spirit.

271
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,590
Gather all eight pearls

272
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,550
and the celestial mountain
and Yuli will descend for you.

273
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,830
Your Majesty,

274
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,930
drawing like this
is harmful to your health.

275
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,800
You must stop.

276
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,070
The deity has shown mercy,

277
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,130
granting me power.

278
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,600
If I don't protect humans now,

279
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,920
what am I waiting for?

280
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,970
What is this?

281
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,620
Distribute these divine talismans
to everyone.

282
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,560
Keep them close.

283
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,610
If you encounter ordinary demons,

284
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,160
these will shield you
from their demonic power.

285
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,480
Yes.

286
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,780
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

287
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,070
Several guards empowered with divine power
went to patrol the mountains

288
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,240
and surprisingly captured a demonic beast.

289
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,350
This is the first time we humans
have seen a demonic beast

290
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,550
without having to flee,

291
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,150
and instead brought it back.

292
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,160
What kind of beast is it?

293
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
An illusion beast

294
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,630
with no power to harm humans.

295
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,510
Illusion beasts are extremely rare.

296
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,040
They survive in the world
through illusions.

297
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,640
Though they have little power,

298
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,510
they can transform at will,

299
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,520
deceiving both demons and humans.

300
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,500
If this demon serves us,

301
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,450
it will surely be beneficial.

302
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,030
How so?

303
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,810
Though you have gained divine power,

304
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,630
the power gap between you

305
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,640
and the many demons remains vast.

306
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Why not fight poison with poison

307
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,110
and use this illusion beast

308
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,550
to sow discord among demons?

309
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,200
Only then can we gather all pearls,

310
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,700
proving our sincerity to the deity.

311
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,550
Your Majesty,

312
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,020
this is the only way
to gather all the pearls.

313
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,830
The demons slaughter humans

314
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,020
using the most extreme methods.

315
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,270
Your Majesty,

316
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,030
you bear a deep blood feud.

317
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,630
Now,

318
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,540
you have a way to take revenge.

319
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,920
Why are you showing mercy to the demons?

320
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,830
Which clan do you want to start with?

321
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,330
Those who most enjoyed bullying humans

322
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,100
were the mountain demons.

323
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,900
Let's start with them.

324
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,440
Hand over the Earth Pearl

325
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,830
and your lives will be spared.

326
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,560
Ridiculous!

327
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,960
The mountain demon tribe
has guarded this pearl for generations.

328
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,090
You'll never get it.

329
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,720
If all mountain demons die,

330
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,920
there will be no point

331
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,460
in guarding the pearl.

332
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,450
Spare their lives

333
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,790
and I'll take you to get the Earth Pearl.

334
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,310
Leader,

335
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,810
you can't!

336
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,870
After this disaster,

337
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,780
our tribe no longer has the power
to guard the pearl.

338
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,790
We must preserve some of our bloodline

339
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,760
to prevent complete extinction.

340
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,000
Follow me.

341
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,990
The Earth Pearl has the power of life.

342
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,270
One must respect all natural beings

343
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,800
to receive its protection.

344
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,610
Let's go.

345
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,410
Leader!

346
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,140
Dragon Lord,

347
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:06,750
the Bi Fang Clan's
Wind-Settling Pearl has also been stolen.

348
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,350
Various clans are facing trouble
one after another now.

349
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,570
Rumors say the Ao Hen Clan
uses extremely treacherous methods.

350
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,350
Should we also prepare
some countermeasures?

351
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,600
If the Dragon Lord
hadn't shown mercy before,

352
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,310
Ao Hen wouldn't even exist anymore.

353
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,440
Although his reputation isn't great,

354
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,890
he's never been this vicious before.

355
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,980
Could it be that when you spared him
for Hong Ye's sake,

356
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,250
it completely disrupted Ao Hen's mind?

357
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,270
Though he's ruthless,

358
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,840
he's not one for indiscriminate killing.

359
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,180
Besides, after the solar eclipse,

360
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,710
he experienced the benefits
of cultivation.

361
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,600
He surely wouldn't act this way.

362
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,240
I fear that while mountains
and rivers may change,

363
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,970
one's nature remains the same.

364
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,440
Report!

365
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,000
Qiong Qi's leader has brought

366
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,270
the leaders of Lei Meng, Fox,
Mountain Demon, and Bi Fang Clans.

367
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,790
They're all waiting outside.

368
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,450
Let them in.

369
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,270
Yes.

370
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,960
Dragon Lord,

371
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,480
Ao Hen's actions are disgraceful.

372
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,880
Such a disgrace to demon-kind

373
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,010
must be eliminated.

374
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,750
The Fox Clan has already suffered

375
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,720
multiple raids from the Ao Hen Clan.

376
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,240
It's one thing
that our tribe is weaker than theirs,

377
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,350
but our repeated concessions

378
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,960
only made them more aggressive.

379
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,310
They kill innocents

380
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,480
with vicious methods.

381
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,030
Even after I handed over
the Thunder Pearl,

382
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,070
they still slaughtered my people,

383
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,800
cutting off the foundation
for future generations' cultivation!

384
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,250
The Mountain Demon Clan

385
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,270
only has a few remaining now.

386
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,510
I watched helplessly

387
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,030
as my entire clan, including our leader,

388
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,350
died before my eyes!

389
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,750
Though there have been
conflicts between clans,

390
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,120
none have been as ruthless as Ao Hen.

391
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,160
Dragon Lord, since you've
achieved Azure Dragon form,

392
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,510
if you still stand by
and do nothing like before,

393
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,830
then you're simply enabling
the Ao Hen Clan.

394
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,270
Indeed.

395
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,030
That's right.

396
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,400
The dragons cannot stand idle!

397
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Please, Azure Dragon, help us.

398
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,510
Please bring justice, Azure Dragon.

399
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:47,790
Yes.

400
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,370
Dragon Lord.

401
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,290
Ao Hen ambushed my clan.

402
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,250
You witnessed it yourself.

403
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,610
As the Azure Dragon,

404
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,310
committed to protecting all beings,

405
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,920
surely you will be fair.

406
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,380
We've come today

407
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,210
in hopes that you would lead us

408
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,500
to gather all clans

409
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,370
and punish Ao Hen together!

410
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,520
Punish Ao Hen!

411
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,350
Yes, punish him!

412
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,720
Yes, punish Ao Hen!

413
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,640
Punish Ao Hen!

414
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,400
Punish Ao Hen!

415
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,250
Though Ao Hen is powerful,

416
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,850
he doesn't have the ability
to fight all demons at once.

417
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,510
If he truly acts this way,

418
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,440
it only harms others
without benefiting himself.

419
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,480
I think

420
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,960
this matter is highly suspicious.

421
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,240
Dragon Lord,

422
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,260
the Ao Hen Clan

423
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,310
has been pillaging and killing for years,

424
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,200
constantly improving their power.

425
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,070
They must think
that their cultivation is complete

426
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,070
and now, they want to rule the world.

427
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,500
Why do you hesitate?

428
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,090
Rumors say that Ao Hen
and the Azure Dragon

429
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,800
have a close relationship.

430
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,000
Could it be

431
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,340
you're favoring Ao Hen?

432
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:55,840
Lei Meng.

433
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,440
You're worried,

434
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,920
but you shouldn't speak such nonsense.

435
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,720
Otherwise,

436
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,640
I will be the first to turn against you.

437
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,310
Our clan is facing extinction.

438
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,490
What do I have to fear from you?

439
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,130
Come on then!

440
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,950
I'm not afraid of you!

441
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,790
Stop arguing!

442
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,090
Punishing Ao Hen isn't difficult,

443
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,110
but if there are forces behind this

444
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,970
stirring conflict among demons,

445
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,310
wouldn't we be falling into their trap?

446
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,680
Everyone, return home for now.

447
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,880
Take care of your people and treasures,

448
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,490
and repair your barriers.

449
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,040
I will find Ao Hen myself.

450
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,430
Once I uncover the truth,

451
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,610
I'll give you all an explanation.

452
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,410
What if everything

453
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,680
truly is Ao Hen's doing?

454
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,750
I will eliminate the evil

455
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,840
and show no mercy.

456
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,700
This is the first time
you've approached me on your own.

457
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,840
I've always thought

458
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,920
I needed to find the Yuli Spring

459
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,880
and achieve immortality

460
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,020
before I could be with you forever.

461
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,960
But today's chaos

462
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,260
has made me realize

463
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,250
that if I were to die one day,

464
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,100
the only thing I would worry about

465
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,090
would be the bond I have with you.

466
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,960
You're different

467
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,160
from before.

468
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,310
Life is short.

469
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,790
I can't control everything.

470
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,080
If that's the case,

471
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,710
what I want to do most,

472
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,510
and the only thing I can do,

473
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,510
is to tell you how I feel.

474
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,500
With a strand of my hair
representing my love,

475
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,760
I formally ask for your hand in marriage.

476
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,640
Will you tie your fate with mine

477
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,100
until the end of time?

478
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,140
Perhaps I'm being too abrupt.

479
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,320
I'm willing.

480
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:02,720
Hong Ye,

481
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,880
the reason I came here

482
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,300
was to find you.

483
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,660
You are the very reason
of my existence here.

484
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,050
Xiao Yao.

485
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,540
No matter what happens in the future,

486
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,550
remember this:

487
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,350
everything I do is only

488
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,550
so I can stand by your side
as your equal.

489
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,880
Between us,

490
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,670
there is not only equality,

491
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,730
but also

492
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,990
love at first sight that lasts forever.

493
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,070
Next month, August 15th,
in the human calendar

494
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,630
will be our wedding day.

495
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,810
Is that alright?

496
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,590
Yes.

497
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,270
That's absolutely not acceptable.

498
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,240
How could a human
be worthy of the Azure Dragon?

499
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Yes, Dragon Lord.

500
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,640
There has never been

501
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,750
a precedent of marriage
between demons and humans.

502
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,200
Please reconsider, Dragon Lord.

503
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,060
-Please reconsider, Dragon Lord!
-Please reconsider, Dragon Lord!

504
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,040
Dragon Lord...

505
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,380
If everything always followed old customs,

506
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,030
there would be no Azure Dragon either.

507
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,760
Dragon Lord,

508
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,640
you and Hong Ye

509
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,750
have only known each other
for a short time.

510
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,440
This... things are moving too fast.

511
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,110
-Yes.
-Yes.

512
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,070
Things are moving too fast.

513
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,400
Since when has the depth of love

514
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,620
been measured
by the length of acquaintance?

515
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,100
Well...

516
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,040
Dragon Lord.

517
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm afraid a human would marry a dragon

518
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,640
just so they can use
the dragon clan's power

519
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,500
to help them find the Yuli Spring.

520
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,350
Rumors of this spring

521
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,410
has now spread among all demon clans.

522
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,550
The claim that Yuli Spring
can enhance cultivation

523
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,070
has caused many demons
to neglect their proper cultivation

524
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,070
and focus only on finding
the celestial mountain.

525
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,070
I suspect the Ao Hen Clan
keeps stirring up trouble

526
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,350
and killing other demons

527
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,210
must be connected to this matter.

528
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,200
With many issues unresolved
among the demon clans,

529
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,800
everyone is waiting for you
to uphold justice.

530
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,790
If you marry a human at this time,

531
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,830
it will likely cause unease
among all clans.

532
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,150
Yes, Dragon Lord.

533
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,270
If the Dragon Lord doesn't marry Hong Ye,

534
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:08,000
will everyone
stop seeking the Yuli Spring?

535
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,670
Long Yu!

536
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,010
Since becoming the Azure Dragon,

537
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,440
our Lord has settled disputes
and protected the weak,

538
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,400
never indulging in luxury,

539
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,320
and never acting arrogantly toward anyone.

540
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,230
From great demons

541
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,190
down to the flowers and grass,

542
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,989
she treats all with utmost care.

543
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,960
Just for Long Zhi's tribulation,

544
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,770
she put in tremendous effort.

545
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,030
In my opinion,

546
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,400
the Dragon Lord
has never done anything harmful to demons,

547
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,199
so we should trust her decision.

548
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,630
Secondly, speaking of status,

549
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,440
no one ranks higher than the Azure Dragon.

550
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,880
You surely don't intend to use status
to restrict the Dragon Lord

551
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,230
and condemn her
to lifelong solitude, right?

552
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:39,630
Well...

553
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,070
I...

554
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,139
Marriage matters

555
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,230
are ultimately
the Dragon Lord's personal affair.

556
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,510
Even if Hong Ye is unworthy,

557
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,320
it's only a matter of a hundred years,

558
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,960
which has almost no impact for demons

559
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,270
and the Dragon Lord.

560
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:54,190
If she can't even make
a hundred-year decision for herself,

561
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,320
then that's no fun.

562
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,320
In the future,

563
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,650
who would want to become the Azure Dragon?

564
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,160
Rest assured, everyone.

565
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,060
I haven't forgotten my duties
as the Azure Dragon.

566
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,510
I, Xiao Yao, promise

567
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,280
that before the wedding,

568
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,210
I will resolve all issues
affecting the demon clans.

569
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,150
-Yes!
-Yes!

570
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,710
Yao,

571
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,500
you've finally come to see me.

572
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,480
Drinking alone?

573
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,110
It's not as good
as what I gave you before.

574
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,700
If you hadn't come,

575
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,570
I wouldn't have brought out
those good wines at all.

576
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,090
I've come to see you

577
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,050
to borrow the Mist Pearl again.

578
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,180
You lost Hong Ye again?

579
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,280
This is a sacred treasure
of your entire clan,

580
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
yet you carry it around so casually.

581
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,090
If I carry it with me,

582
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,440
then it's my responsibility.

583
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,960
If I didn't keep it with me,

584
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,630
then it would be
the entire clan's responsibility.

585
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,580
I don't even consider it a treasure,

586
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,840
so being casual about it doesn't matter.

587
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:34,840
Wait.

588
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,910
Let me stand further away

589
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
before you start.

590
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,360
I don't want to see Hong Ye's face.

591
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,770
I'm not here to find him.

592
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,590
The Ao Hen Clan
has gained notoriety lately,

593
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,290
but I've searched everywhere
and couldn't find him.

594
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,370
I want to see

595
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,880
if he's hiding because he truly fears

596
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,940
that I'll kill him.

597
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,330
If he really did those things,

598
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,370
he should know hiding is useless.

599
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,570
I, Ao Hen,

600
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,800
never care about my reputation.

601
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,760
But when I heard that several major clans

602
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,970
went to the Dragon Lord
to address the situation,

603
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,630
I was actually quite pleased.

604
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,170
Clearing the undeserved infamy

605
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,280
of the Ao Hen Clan

606
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,840
wouldn't be a bad thing.

607
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,720
But I never expected

608
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,960
that even the Dragon Lord
who protects all beings

609
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,490
would believe such rumors.

610
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,870
If it weren't for finding out the truth,

611
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,200
I wouldn't be
the only one looking for you.

612
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,550
If I say I didn't do it,

613
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,910
would you believe me?

614
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,150
Then at least tell me

615
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,840
where you were during those days,

616
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,840
what you did,

617
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,270
and who can verify it.

618
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,080
I have nothing to say.

619
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,070
Various clans have lost their pearls

620
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,630
and countless lives have been lost.

621
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,090
The demon world
has never been in such chaos.

622
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,440
If you truly didn't do it,

623
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,190
you should join everyone

624
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,390
to work together and uncover the truth.

625
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,750
The Ao Hen Clan wasn't attacked.

626
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,780
Our Universe Pearl is untouched.

627
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,860
Why should I care about other clans?

628
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,780
My affairs

629
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,070
are none of your business.

630
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,590
If you refuse to cooperate,

631
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,280
then I'll have to take you back
to the Dragon Palace

632
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,340
to deal with later.

633
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:25,960
Wait!

634
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,250
I can vouch for him.

635
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,510
This really wasn't Ao Hen's doing.

636
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,320
Shut up!

637
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,070
At a time like this,

638
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,150
you're still worried about your pride?

639
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:35,760
Yao,

640
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,800
since you took Hong Ye
away from Mount Yangxu,

641
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,960
he's been here every day,

642
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,550
feeling both ashamed and sorrowful.

643
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,190
He's been taking me

644
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,960
to drink heavily in this forest.

645
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,920
Teng She, stop talking!

646
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,000
He had no time to steal pearls!

647
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,070
Xiao Yao and I

648
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,290
went from enemies to friends.

649
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,670
Now, because of a human,

650
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,510
she hates me.

651
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,510
What's so special
about that Hong Ye anyway?

652
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,480
Has the world changed?

653
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,570
Isn't might supposed to make right?

654
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,760
Right?

655
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,240
I don't understand.

656
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,760
I regret it too.

657
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:21,840
Tell me,

658
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,160
should I go apologize to Xiao Yao

659
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,080
and beg for her forgiveness?

660
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,320
Say something!

661
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,400
Yes!

662
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,110
No.

663
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:31,920
I shouldn't.

664
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,080
I, Ao Hen, am full of pride and dignity.

665
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:34,920
I'm harsh to others

666
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,070
and even harsher to myself.

667
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,590
Even when facing death...

668
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,960
I will never lose my composure.

669
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,780
Yes...

670
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,360
Serves you right.

671
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,760
I, Ao Hen, swear to heaven.

672
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,320
From now on,

673
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,840
if I ever wrong Xiao Yao...

674
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,920
May I be struck by lightning.

675
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,840
When he made that vow,

676
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,030
the sky was clear,

677
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,590
with no lightning in sight.

678
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,480
It proves that

679
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,030
he was sincere.

680
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,610
I believe what you said.

681
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,360
But this way,

682
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,440
things are even worse.

683
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,150
See,

684
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,690
Yao still believes you.

685
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,500
She may believe me,

686
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,940
but I've lost all dignity now.

687
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,150
Then let's

688
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,230
find out the truth together.
