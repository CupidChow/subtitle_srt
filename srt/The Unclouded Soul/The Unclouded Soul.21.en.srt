[The Unclouded Soul]

2
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,780
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,470
If your heart is not sincere,

4
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,350
your life will end.

5
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,000
But Exalted Immortal...

6
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,570
Without destiny for immortality,

7
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,720
it'll all just be a fleeting dream.

8
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,030
Even the Exalted Immortal cannot save you.

9
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,800
Why is that?

10
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,110
Those hundred maidens sent last time

11
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,000
had too much selfish desire

12
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,150
and too many distracting thoughts,

13
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,390
making you unworthy of the Yuli Spring.

14
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,720
Please, Exalted Immortal,

15
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,540
do not be angry.

16
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,310
Since ancient times,
human hearts are hard to fathom.

17
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,680
If any wretched servant
has offended Exalted Immortal,

18
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,280
I will punish them severely.

19
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,250
But everyone in the Tiansheng Dynasty

20
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,130
has been sincere to Exalted Immortal—

21
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,290
the heavens can be the witness.

22
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,079
If you claim your heart is sincere,

23
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,310
then cut it out and show it to me.

24
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,280
Didn't you believe that by drinking
from the Yuli Spring,

25
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,720
you had already achieved immortality?

26
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,870
If what you drank
was truly the Yuli Spring,

27
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,030
you wouldn't die.

28
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,640
Shall we test it?

29
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,150
I was foolish.

30
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,630
Please, Exalted Immortal,
give me another chance.

31
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,630
I will surely show Exalted Immortal

32
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,190
my sincerity.

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,660
Though you've made a mistake,

34
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,980
there is someone
truly sincere by your side.

35
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,800
He is the key to finding the Yuli Spring.

36
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,579
Please enlighten me, Exalted Immortal.

37
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,870
Bingzhu of the Feiyu Guard

38
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,280
is worthy of great purpose.

39
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,470
Where is Bingzhu?

40
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,710
Your Majesty,

41
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,720
Bingzhu is imprisoned
in the Imperial Prison,

42
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,800
awaiting execution
at noon as you commanded.

43
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,310
No!

44
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,920
My Lord,

45
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,810
it's already past 9 a.m.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,060
We should escort the prisoner
to the Meridian Gate now.

47
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,340
Haven't you found that demoness yet?

48
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,159
No.

49
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,230
We cannot allow any complications.

50
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,170
Let's just deal with him here.

51
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,750
Here?

52
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,100
I'm afraid

53
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,720
this goes against His Majesty's wishes,
My Lord.

54
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,980
His Majesty's wishes?

55
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,580
His Majesty's wishes are unfathomable.

56
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,720
What's the point
of following so many imperial edicts?

57
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,800
I spoke out of turn.

58
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,270
Forgive my impertinence.

59
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,000
It's all up to My Lord to decide.

60
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,350
What His Majesty wants to see

61
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,390
is Bingzhu

62
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,550
beheaded in front of everyone.

63
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,340
But Lord Bingzhu
has drunk from the Yuli Spring.

64
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,400
I fear beheading alone

65
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,660
won't eliminate the root of the problem.

66
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,490
That would truly go against
His Majesty's wishes.

67
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,850
Go fetch some mulberry paper.

68
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,790
Let's suffocate Lord Bingzhu

69
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,350
to death.

70
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,510
Yes.

71
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,480
A promotion to a first-class official

72
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,080
makes you worry-free
about food and clothing.

73
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,860
With new titles bestowed,

74
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,030
may it be an auspicious omen!

75
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,210
Put another one.

76
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,230
The imperial edict has arrived!

77
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,980
By the mandate of heaven,

78
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,750
the Emperor decrees:

79
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,510
in consideration of

80
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,950
the many loyal years of service
of the accused,

81
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,610
Bingzhu of the Feiyu Guard,

82
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,240
who devoted himself to slaying demons,

83
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,830
I wish for peace throughout the land,

84
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,600
and hope for his sincere repentance.

85
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,570
I hereby pardon Bingzhu and summon him
to the West Garden for an audience.

86
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,070
So it is decreed.

87
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,300
I, your humble subject,
receive this edict.

88
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,120
Lord Bingzhu,

89
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,040
your palanquin is ready.

90
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,650
Please come this way.

91
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,520
As long as the heart remains,

92
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,160
nightmares can still occur.

93
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,440
From now on,

94
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,830
at least no one can use
nightmare techniques against me anymore.

95
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,160
Your brother will be safe now.

96
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,280
I have become a spirit.

97
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,670
Sooner or later,

98
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,010
you will kill me too—

99
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,130
just as you slaughter other demons.

100
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,400
There are too many things in this world
that need to be judged as right or wrong.

101
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,630
But the rights and wrongs
that don't concern me,

102
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,610
I no longer wish to argue about.

103
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,570
I will only care
about the three of us from now on.

104
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,500
How's that?

105
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,810
My Lord always knows what's best.

106
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,170
What's best?

107
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,440
This, of course!

108
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,090
I told Xiao Yao and Dali before

109
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,200
that rolling in the mud feels wonderful,

110
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,730
but they didn't believe me.

111
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,610
What did you say, My Lord?

112
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,390
Did you get the directions?

113
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes, I did.

114
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,360
We're still hundreds of miles
from Mount Qingyuan.

115
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,690
Then let's keep moving.

116
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,720
My Lord,

117
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,790
the shopkeeper thought I was cute

118
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,510
and gave me a freshly steamed bun.

119
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,360
Would you like half?

120
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,850
No.

121
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,690
Walk faster.

122
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,970
Are we in such a hurry?

123
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,270
It's to make you stronger

124
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,840
so you won't end up
as someone else's bun filling.

125
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,640
How thoughtful you are, My Lord.

126
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,310
My Lord,

127
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,530
are we still going on foot?

128
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,390
What else?

129
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,060
If you could conjure some silver,

130
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,460
we could buy a carriage

131
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,640
and walk less.

132
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,630
The shopkeeper just now also said

133
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,360
taking the water route
is actually the fastest way.

134
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,020
Why didn't you say so earlier?

135
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,460
I just remembered it.

136
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,430
I shouldn't have let
a pig ask for directions.

137
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,270
My Lord.

138
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,030
I just finished eating,

139
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,120
but I feel hungry again.

140
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,600
Can I—

141
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,210
Watch out!

142
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,500
-Luoluo!
-My Lord!

143
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,570
Save me!

144
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,150
In broad daylight,

145
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,420
strolling through Black Wind Fortress
like this—

146
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,350
do you think we're all fast asleep?

147
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,580
What do you want?

148
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,400
Leave...

149
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,260
Leave some toll money.

150
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,280
You dare to rob me?

151
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,520
Have you really thought this through?

152
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,020
Boss.

153
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,510
I don't know what

154
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,900
this guy is up to.

155
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,510
Let's all attack together,

156
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,830
cut him into pieces,

157
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,920
and be done with it.

158
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,030
He's just a weak scholar,

159
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,290
and you're all scared?

160
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,870
Step back.

161
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,750
Let me handle him.

162
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,000
If we kill him,
how can we sell him for a good price?

163
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,400
I am a merchant's son.

164
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,310
The one you've captured
is my personal attendant.

165
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,770
I was passing through
with a family treasure

166
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,670
when I unfortunately
got separated from my family.

167
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,320
If you release my attendant,

168
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,920
this treasure

169
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,600
will be yours.

170
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,720
No, no!

171
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,310
I was wrong!

172
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,580
I'm not fighting anymore!

173
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,200
I'm sorry!

174
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,720
-Release him!
-I'm sorry.

175
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,710
Release him! Release him!

176
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,440
Release him.

177
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,410
Get lost.

178
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,490
My Lord, you're amazing!

179
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:35,870
Luoluo,

180
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,840
are you alright?

181
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,480
I'm fine.

182
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,390
My Lord,

183
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,960
why didn't you
just use your power to fight them

184
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,620
instead of making up stories?

185
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,590
Among humans,

186
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,530
we should use human methods.

187
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,840
We should adapt to our surroundings.

188
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,240
Hong Ye!

189
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
That makes sense.

190
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,020
Luoluo!

191
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,750
Xiao Yao?

192
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,390
Where are you going?

193
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,720
Back to Demons' Valley.

194
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,240
Are you done with your business?

195
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,050
You're leaving
without saying goodbye again.

196
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,080
In my current state,

197
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,740
I can't protect you properly.

198
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,740
This trip to Demons' Valley

199
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,450
will be extremely dangerous.

200
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,930
I don't even know if I'll return alive

201
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,090
or be able to stand by your side again.

202
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,520
If you come with me,

203
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,470
it will only bring you more danger.

204
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,240
So you just left me there alone?

205
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,700
I never wanted to leave you

206
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,300
or abandon you.

207
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,420
I only want to find

208
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,850
a safe place for you.

209
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,960
So I made a decision of my own accord.

210
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,310
Yes—of your own accord!

211
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,200
That's only what you think!

212
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,390
Do you know what I think?

213
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,360
Did you ever ask me?

214
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,620
You don't have the right to decide
whether I'll stay or not!

215
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,670
We've been

216
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,320
through life and death together.

217
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,520
What's there to fear?

218
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,920
Hong Ye, I'm asking you once.

219
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,480
In this life,

220
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,750
shall we never see each other ever again

221
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,130
or go through thick and thin together,

222
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,800
moving forward hand in hand—

223
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,660
make your choice.

224
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,150
For me,

225
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,900
my answer has always been only you.

226
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,040
Let's go,

227
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,430
back to Demons' Valley.

228
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,320
This is what you chose, right?

229
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,850
I wish for your heart alone,

230
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,640
and to never part
until we're old and gray.

231
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,060
I, your guilty subject, Bingzhu,

232
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,770
pay respects to Your Majesty.

233
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,040
Rise.

234
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,240
Be seated.

235
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

236
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,900
My dear minister,

237
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,650
do you still resent me?

238
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,060
This guilty subject

239
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,589
would never dare.

240
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,599
I have always valued talent.

241
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,640
Otherwise, the court

242
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,960
would not have loyal ministers like you

243
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,089
who come from humble origins.

244
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,920
However,

245
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,500
the position of Feiyu Guard Demon Slayer
is no ordinary role.

246
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,780
On a smaller scale,
it concerns my personal safety.

247
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,620
On a larger scale, it bears
the responsibility for all people's lives.

248
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,200
I had to be

249
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,180
extremely cautious.

250
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,640
Do you understand?

251
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,840
This guilty subject

252
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,170
understands.

253
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,240
I have investigated.

254
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,890
This sea voyage,

255
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,150
although it failed to locate Yuli Spring,

256
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:07,910
the fault

257
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,570
was not yours.

258
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,310
As the Emperor,

259
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,370
I have the wisdom to judge character.

260
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,130
Sending you to the Imperial Prison

261
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,310
was your final test.

262
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,080
The Yuli Spring is crucial to the empire.

263
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,010
I need someone like you
who can withstand such trials

264
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,390
for me to feel at ease.

265
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,920
As of today,

266
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,210
I have no more doubts about you.

267
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,030
You need not address yourself

268
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,030
as "guilty subject" anymore.

269
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,250
Considering your years of loyal service

270
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,010
and excellent character,

271
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,530
I hereby name you Bulwark Duke.

272
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,190
In accordance with your noble rank,
I'll reward you with 100 acres of land,

273
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,970
and a thousand stones of grain.

274
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,920
How does that sound?

275
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,400
I

276
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,720
thank Your Majesty
for your generous grace.

277
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,680
Long live

278
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,030
Your Majesty!

279
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,590
Whether I can live long or not depends on

280
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,790
if you find the Yuli Spring or not.

281
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,280
Come.

282
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,300
Tell me everything in detail.

283
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,960
When you met the Exalted Immortal,

284
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,550
what did you talk about?

285
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,590
What does the Exalted Immortal prefer?

286
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,480
Your Majesty,

287
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,640
I

288
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,050
have only met the Exalted Immortal once.

289
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,910
The rules on the island were strict.

290
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,480
I was not allowed to move around freely.

291
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,590
So I

292
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,440
don't know the details.

293
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,350
Enough.

294
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,990
It's useless

295
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,550
to talk about the past now.

296
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,040
Since you are favored
by Exalted Immortal,

297
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,420
you should quickly find a way
to ask Exalted Immortal

298
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,550
what else I need to do

299
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,640
to be granted the Yuli Spring.

300
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,400
I

301
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,590
dare ask Your Majesty,

302
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,270
is the Exalted Immortal you speak of

303
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,720
still the one in this painting?

304
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,200
The Exalted Immortal

305
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,230
has many incarnations.

306
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,480
As long as she is still willing
to reveal herself to me,

307
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,540
immortality is still possible.

308
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,330
[Residence of the Bulwark Duke]

309
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,550
[Distinguish right from wrong]

310
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,170
Welcome home, Bulwark Duke.

311
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,030
My Lord!

312
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,530
I know my crime is unforgivable,

313
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,190
but considering our many years

314
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,920
of fighting side by side,

315
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,150
I beg for your mercy, My Lord.

316
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,910
My Lord.

317
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,130
I know I cannot escape death.

318
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,330
I have failed you.

319
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,090
Whether you kill me or not,

320
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,550
I submit to your judgment.

321
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,280
But I want to say,

322
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,210
those who wanted to kill you

323
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,630
were never us brothers,

324
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,570
but the imperial edict!

325
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,410
Please, My Lord,

326
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,240
don't make things difficult
for the brothers.

327
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,160
Everyone joined the Feiyu Guard—
a job so tough—

328
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,890
all for the sake of their families.

329
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,030
We're all risking our lives

330
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,430
in exchange for a salary.

331
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,440
If they have offended you in any way,

332
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,300
they were only following orders.

333
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,290
If you have grievances,

334
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,590
direct them at me, Ji Yan, alone.

335
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,920
The brothers have a hard life.

336
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,150
I beg for your forgiveness.

337
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,100
If that's the case,

338
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:11,750
I, Ji Yan,

339
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,210
am willing to cut off my own hand

340
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,350
to appease My Lord.

341
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,090
I submit myself to your judgment!

342
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,510
Everyone, get up.

343
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,960
Get up!

344
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,920
When did you

345
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,420
start colluding with the demons?

346
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,770
What kind of deals have you made?

347
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,440
Tell me everything in detail.

348
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,960
If you hide even the slightest detail,

349
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,540
I will show no mercy.

350
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,570
Thank you for sparing our lives, My Lord.

351
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,790
[Distinguish right from wrong]

352
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,720
My first encounter with the demons

353
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,270
began after Miss Xiao Yao

354
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,600
was captured and taken to Demons' Valley.

355
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,070
Back then, you had just been appointed
as the Demon Slayer of the Feiyu Guard

356
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,530
and posted bounty notices

357
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,350
to lure out the great demons.

358
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,910
That very night,

359
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,360
a demon calling himself Heiwu

360
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,200
approached me.

361
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,110
He offered to help the Feiyu Guard

362
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,060
eliminate the Demon King Hong Ye.

363
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,930
Now, on the first and fifteenth
of each month,

364
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,800
the demons

365
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,610
offer up some minor demons.

366
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,110
We escort them to
the Elixir Refining Chamber

367
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,170
in the West Garden to create elixirs.

368
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,570
With this arrangement,

369
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,020
we also earn rewards for our brothers

370
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,770
to support our families.

371
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,350
I never imagined

372
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,350
the Feiyu Guard has fallen so low.

373
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,030
My Lord!

374
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,500
Forgive my boldness.

375
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,150
But what we have between
the Feiyu Guard and the demons

376
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,910
is already the best we can have.

377
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,070
What are you talking about?

378
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,980
Only when soldiers

379
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,160
don't eliminate bandits completely,

380
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,160
will the court keep the soldiers employed.

381
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,680
My Lord.

382
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,830
Demons can never be completely eliminated.

383
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,240
The current arrangement,

384
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,310
where demons provide
some insignificant minor demons

385
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,310
for the Feiyu Guard to report as captures—

386
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,970
isn't this the best solution?

387
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,890
Besides you,

388
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,200
no one wants
the demons completely exterminated.

389
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,550
Since you became the Demon Slayer,

390
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,790
you've pushed everyone too hard.

391
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,310
Each of us

392
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,960
risks our lives day and night

393
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,170
without receiving any benefits.

394
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,030
We had no choice

395
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,040
but to join forces
with the demons against you.

396
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,350
My Lord,

397
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,650
the feud between humans and demons

398
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,000
ultimately means less than the lives

399
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,200
of our families.

400
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,350
We just want to protect those close to us.

401
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,380
If everyone were like you,

402
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,700
saving the world

403
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,970
while suffering
the tragic deaths of loved ones

404
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,690
and the torment
of souls unable to reincarnate,

405
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,010
what would be the point?

406
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,720
Even if all these brothers were gone,

407
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,530
and replaced with new ones,

408
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,270
the result would be the same.

409
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,310
I speak

410
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,390
from the bottom of my heart.

411
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,190
Please reconsider, My Lord!

412
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,310
Please reconsider, My Lord!

413
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,220
Please reconsider, My Lord!

414
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,870
Please reconsider, My Lord!

415
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,640
Please reconsider, My Lord!

416
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,400
Last night,

417
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,270
that woman who fought with you,

418
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,960
has she appeared again?

419
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,030
The Feiyu Guard and Imperial Guards

420
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,090
have searched the entire city
but found no trace of her.

421
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,440
However, that woman
has exceptional martial arts skills,

422
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,790
and she has
the demon-slaying blade with her.

423
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,960
She should be fine.

424
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,920
When you recover your power,

425
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,520
you must conjure
lots and lots of silver for me.

426
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,310
Okay.

427
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,550
I'll give you anything you want.

428
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,810
Xiao Yao.

429
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,000
I want to ask you something.

430
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,960
Yes, go ahead.

431
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,900
Dali...

432
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,790
is not coming back, is she?

433
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,740
You've been avoiding the subject

434
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,770
and I've been afraid to ask.

435
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,410
But the closer we get to Demons' Valley,

436
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,420
the more I think about her.

437
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,540
Dali...

438
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,510
has become the most beautiful flower
among all blossoms.

439
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,400
That's good.

440
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,200
She always loved beauty.

441
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,840
Dali has gone far away for cultivation.

442
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,590
I'm sure we'll see her again someday.

443
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,750
Yes.

444
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,400
My Lord,

445
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
are you all right?

446
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,440
I suddenly feel uneasy.

447
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,480
I just need to rest here for a while.

448
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,650
You all go ahead.

449
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:23,310
Yes, sir.

450
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:23,830
Yes.

451
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,750
If one is not a spirit,

452
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,430
can they still use spirit arts?

453
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,200
No.

454
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,540
You've been carrying the Exquisite Heart
you brought back

455
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,520
from the Realm of Mist and Void.

456
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,170
It's right here.

457
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,610
I was so arrogant.

458
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,790
I kept saying I would take care of you.

459
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:53,000
But in the end, because of me,

460
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,610
you've taken the same path as Lu Tong.

461
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,550
I, Bingzhu,

462
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,890
carry the empty title of demon slayer,

463
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,230
but in the end, I couldn't save anyone.

464
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,610
What's wrong with you?

465
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,160
Why do I still feel heartache?

466
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,970
Wasn't replacing
my heart with the Exquisite Heart

467
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,880
supposed to make me feel nothing?

468
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,520
You were originally a kind person.

469
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,750
Even if you changed your heart,

470
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,240
it wouldn't change who you are.

471
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,830
No!

472
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
I am a demon,

473
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,050
a spirit...

474
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,920
I used spirit arts to bewitch people.

475
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,440
Humans can be good or bad—

476
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,300
same goes for spirits and demons.

477
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,570
What corrupts both humans and demons

478
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,980
is desire.

479
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,960
Half of my life has been in vain.

480
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,920
I no longer care about
right or wrong in this world.

481
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,070
My only wish is

482
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,720
for the day when we

483
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,920
stand against each other
to never come.

484
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,250
If that moment truly comes,

485
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,720
I beg you...

486
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,510
Promise me,

487
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,270
will you?

488
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,070
Promise me,

489
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,030
please?

490
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,240
A-Aren't we going back to Demons' Valley?

491
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,460
Where is this place?

492
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,070
The barrier at the riverbank

493
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,530
must have been destroyed.

494
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,440
There will certainly be
many Feiyu Guards stationed there.

495
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,440
I once set

496
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,230
a hidden barrier here

497
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,719
that only I can open.

498
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,679
I thought

499
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,480
I'd never need to use it.

500
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,670
My Lord, your foresight is formidable.

501
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,360
In that case,

502
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,320
we can rush in

503
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,480
and kill them all,

504
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,190
catching them off guard.

505
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,000
Then after that...

506
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,070
Kill what?

507
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,800
If we fight,

508
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,260
there will be casualties.

509
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,300
My Lord is indeed amazing,

510
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,070
but he is a lord

511
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,929
who truly cares about the demons.

512
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,949
He would hope

513
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,929
to take back Demons' Valley
without any bloodshed.

514
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,710
Although I don't quite understand,

515
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,110
I think that makes sense.

516
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,590
What should we do next?

517
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,000
Let me check the situation.

518
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,110
We can discuss it later

519
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,610
after figuring out their formation.

520
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,360
Take His Lordship

521
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,889
and hide somewhere safe.

522
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,000
Hide?

523
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,510
Hide?

524
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,190
Yes.

525
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,110
Not hide.

526
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,000
It's rest.

527
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,920
My Lord has been working hard these days

528
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,250
and needs to rest first.

529
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,440
Just find a place

530
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,170
where no one will discover you.

531
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,030
But even I don't feel tired.

532
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,190
You've been eating,
drinking, and sleeping the whole way,

533
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,450
why would you be tired?

534
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,640
That's true.

535
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,290
I'll go ahead and wait for you.

536
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,190
Xiao Yao.

537
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,960
As the Demon Lord,

538
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,630
I have my responsibilities.

539
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,780
Though I've lost my power,

540
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,460
no one knows Demons' Valley
better than I do.

541
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,640
I don't want to hide.

542
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,860
Besides, Heiwu fears me the most.

543
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,230
The Feiyu Guard has been searching
for the Kunlun Mirror.

544
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,710
As long as they want something,

545
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,070
we can find a way

546
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,720
to defeat them one by one.

547
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,070
But...

548
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,950
It's here!

549
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,670
We're back!

550
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,410
Let's go back and fight now!

551
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,930
We'll kill them all—

552
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,590
Oh no,

553
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,840
today is the first day of the month.

554
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,220
I...

555
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,180
Mr. Wu Huan!

556
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,730
Look, there's a donkey.

557
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,070
Go!

558
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,590
As a bamboo stick,

559
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,390
you can't even escape in a bamboo forest.

560
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,910
You deserve to be caught
and made into mats and baskets.

561
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,750
Go ahead.

562
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,990
Keep running.

563
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:13,760
Stop!

564
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,150
My Lord?

565
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,220
My Lord!

566
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,960
My Lord, you're finally back!

567
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,730
My Lord!

568
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,110
He wants to capture us

569
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,040
and hand us over to the Feiyu Guard.

570
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,700
Did you not die from poisoning?

571
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,250
It was the Dreamshard Immortal who died.

572
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,200
Why should I fear poison?

573
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,720
You previously framed Xiao Yao

574
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,110
and led the Feiyu Guard
to massacre Demons' Valley.

575
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,770
I was too busy to kill you then,

576
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,050
which allowed you to harm your own kind
with Heiwu today.

577
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,530
This is truly a capital offense.

578
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,800
Go back and tell Heiwu.

579
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,640
I never wished
to see our kind harm each other.

580
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,210
I'll give him one chance.

581
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,680
Release our kind immediately,

582
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,920
leave Youning Cave,

583
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,110
and get out of Demons' Valley.

584
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,900
But if he dares to persist in his folly,

585
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,080
I will show no more mercy.

586
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,460
I will make sure your evil deeds

587
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,710
are paid back a thousandfold.

588
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,840
Wu Huan.

589
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,100
The count is off today.

590
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,320
These few minor demons

591
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,400
are far from enough.

592
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,460
Are you underestimating
the Feiyu Guard's abilities?

593
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,410
There are more.

594
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,280
They're all behind.

595
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:37,710
Go.

596
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,680
That looks like the Demon King Hong Ye.

597
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,550
Are you sure?

598
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,320
Are you certain it's the Demon King?

599
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:55,710
Yes.

600
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,710
I've seen him before

601
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,310
when I raided Demons' Valley

602
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,620
with the Demon Slayer.

603
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,360
Luoluo.

604
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,230
Bamboo.

605
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,360
Are they the ones who have been
coming to Demons' Valley

606
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,420
to capture demons?

607
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,330
-Yes!
-Yes!

608
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,360
Very well.

609
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,500
With My Lord here today,

610
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,900
are you going to make them
pay for their crimes in blood?

611
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,040
I'll count to three.

612
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,960
If I can still see you then,

613
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,460
you'll have only your bad luck to blame.

614
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,070
Three.

615
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,110
Go!

616
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,560
Two.

617
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,230
Go.

618
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,670
Run!

619
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,160
Run! Hurry!

620
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,600
W-Why?

621
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,840
Hong Ye, let's go.

622
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:55,880
Captain!

623
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,630
Captain.

624
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,630
Why are we running?

625
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,590
Don't be stupid. You said it yourself.

626
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,850
That's the Demon King.

627
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,110
But he didn't chase us.

628
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,150
Last time we saw him, he was formidable.

629
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,110
Flying through the sky,
burrowing underground,

630
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,400
killing anyone in his way.

631
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,630
But just now he seemed

632
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,020
somehow different.

633
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,780
He was all talk.

634
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,540
He didn't use his power at all.

635
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,020
If that's the case,

636
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,500
his power might be...

637
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,960
Gone.

638
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,550
This is our chance
to defeat the Demon King

639
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,140
and achieve great merit!

640
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,440
What kind of hunter runs away

641
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,800
after spotting his prey?

642
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,600
Let's go back!

643
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,030
Let's see what powers he really has.

644
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:32,720
Let's go!

645
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,070
Go!

646
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:34,440
Move!

647
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:34,730
Go!

648
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,130
Move!

649
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:35,690
Let's go!

650
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,480
W-Wait.

651
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,360
W-Why are we running?

652
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,840
Didn't His Lordship say
when he counts to three, we would...

653
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,970
Take our revenge?

654
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:42,510
Yeah.

655
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,200
Xiao Yao.

656
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,700
Take Bamboo and Luoluo

657
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,670
and leave first.

658
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,870
I'll deal with Wu Huan.

659
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:47,420
Wait!

660
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,010
Don't worry.

661
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,440
I have a way to lure him away.

662
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,100
Go quickly.

663
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,110
No.

664
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,320
This is the only way.

665
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,480
Otherwise all of us

666
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,530
will be trapped here.

667
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,590
You still can't go.

668
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,360
I have a plan

669
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,320
that can both repel the enemy

670
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,730
and keep everyone safe.

671
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,440
He's gone indeed.

672
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,190
He must've gotten injured when fighting

673
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,650
the Dreamshard Immortal,

674
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,480
which depleted all his power.

675
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,630
Everyone spread out and search carefully.

676
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,440
Capturing the Demon King

677
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,510
brings far greater merit
than catching thousands of minor demons.

678
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,030
Go now!

679
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:21,670
Yes!
