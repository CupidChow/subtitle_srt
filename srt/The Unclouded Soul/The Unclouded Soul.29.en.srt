[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,910
[Episode 29]

3
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,039
Elders, you have to believe me.

4
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:42,039
This is exactly what Hong Ye is like.

5
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,070
My Lord has returned.

6
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,280
My Lord, who has been working tirelessly
for the demons,

7
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,539
has finally returned.

8
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,950
This time,

9
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,680
what sacred demon relic have you

10
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,810
brought back for us?

11
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,380
I don't need to report my whereabouts
to you.

12
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,880
I'm asking on behalf of the elders.

13
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,280
Rumors say

14
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,020
you've been quite close with humans.

15
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,080
You don't even care

16
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,340
about demons being humiliated anymore.

17
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,380
Where did these rumors come from?

18
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,430
Whatever one does

19
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,840
always leaves traces.

20
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,730
Well said.

21
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,950
Everything done leaves a trace behind.

22
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,120
As the Demon Lord,

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,960
I should indeed thoroughly investigate

24
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,240
the rumors about you.

25
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,200
Since you claim

26
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,170
you're asking on behalf of the elders,

27
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,290
then let the elders

28
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,870
share their concerns

29
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,579
directly with me.

30
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,520
Hong Ye,

31
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,890
we made you our Demon King

32
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,720
to revitalize our demon kind

33
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,680
and to resist human aggression.

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,120
Don't lose your way.

35
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,680
Heiwu has been working tirelessly

36
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,400
to strengthen our demon forces.

37
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,470
But you,

38
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,000
every time you go to the human realm
seeking sacred demon relics,

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
you face all sorts of difficulties.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Since you're here today,

41
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,400
you should first clarify

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,430
your relationship with the humans.

43
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,560
Otherwise,
if these rumors are proven true,

44
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,870
we old fellows

45
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,470
can no longer take your side.

46
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,970
Elders,

47
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,310
the grievances between our two races

48
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,550
have existed for ages.

49
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,680
But if demons truly want to find peace,

50
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,440
we must understand how humans think.

51
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,800
His Lordship is so powerful.

52
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,000
How many years has he been cultivating?

53
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,150
At least a thousand years.

54
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,829
Four thousand years?

55
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,440
Five or six thousand years?

56
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,430
Anyway,

57
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,630
it's not more than ten thousand years.

58
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,000
I've never seen

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,710
a demon who lived over ten thousand years.

60
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,120
So you don't know either.

61
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,650
What...

62
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,740
What...

63
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,310
are you talking about?

64
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,550
Let me tell you,

65
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,000
in the entire Demons' Valley,

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,820
there's nothing about His Lordship

67
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,980
that I don't know.

68
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,030
Ask me anything.

69
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,230
All right, all right.

70
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,690
Then tell me what

71
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,870
His Lordship's true form is.

72
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,600
His Lordship's true form is...

73
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,550
His...

74
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,900
His Lordship's...

75
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,070
What's His Lordship's true form again?

76
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,400
Why are you sighing?

77
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,990
It's not that I don't know.

78
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,120
It's that, for this kind of thing,

79
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,310
if His Lordship
doesn't mention it himself,

80
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,310
it's not something we can ask about.

81
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,280
But there's one thing

82
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,140
I can guarantee

83
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,339
is absolutely true.

84
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,950
What?

85
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,480
That His Lordship's power
used to be extremely weak—

86
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,560
incredibly weak.

87
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,310
But the previous Demon King

88
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,750
admired His Lordship greatly.

89
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,920
He said His Lordship

90
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,690
was the most talented individual

91
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,240
with the greatest potential
in the entire demon race.

92
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,950
So before the old Demon King passed away,

93
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,000
he left instructions

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,390
specifically naming His Lordship

95
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,000
as the new Demon King

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,640
to protect the entire demon race.

97
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,830
But because His Lordship's power

98
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,120
was truly too weak,

99
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,250
many great demons were not convinced.

100
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,350
They said His Lordship was

101
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,850
unworthy of the position.

102
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,720
So to prove himself, His Lordship

103
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,390
broke and rebuilt

104
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,140
all the meridians in his body—

105
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,650
he was at death's door.

106
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,130
That's what made him

107
00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:00,290
the strongest and most powerful
great demon of our time.

108
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,800
And as for His Lordship's identity,

109
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,040
there are many theories
throughout the demon race.

110
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,870
Do you know
what the most ridiculous one is?

111
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,830
Some demons say

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,190
that His Lordship

113
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,400
sprang from some crack in a rock.

114
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,130
How could that be possible?

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,240
And others say

116
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,750
that His Lordship is a descendant

117
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,680
of the long-extinct ancient dragon clan.

118
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,400
Actually, I think

119
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,680
His Lordship himself isn't clear

120
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,480
about what his true identity is.

121
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,020
But it doesn't matter.

122
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,600
No matter who he is

123
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,560
or where he came from,

124
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,750
it doesn't change the fact that

125
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,480
he is now the most powerful demon
of our time.

126
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,340
That's enough.

127
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,750
He never mentioned any of this to me.

128
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,920
That's normal.

129
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,360
He has always been a man of few words.

130
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,220
You'll get used to it eventually.

131
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,240
But do you know

132
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,630
what I've seen him do most often

133
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,409
is?

134
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,200
He'd just stand here,

135
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,880
looking over there,

136
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,420
at the moon,

137
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,440
as if waiting for something,

138
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,720
with a lonely expression.

139
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,740
It always made my heart ache.

140
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,690
Perhaps it's just as the old saying goes:

141
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,190
the more powerful one's power is,

142
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,750
the more one has to sacrifice,

143
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,280
and the lonelier one feels.

144
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,530
Have you ever seen him cry?

145
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,190
Are you kidding?

146
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,430
Why would the Demon King ever cry?

147
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,360
I'm serious.

148
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,750
I'm serious too!

149
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,040
So what if he's the Demon King?

150
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,580
Not even once?

151
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,300
Actually, I think

152
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,610
even if he does cry,

153
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,510
he'd find a place where no one can see him

154
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,630
and cry in secret.

155
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,600
After all,

156
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,730
he is the Demon King.

157
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,510
So,

158
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,320
since then,

159
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,720
Xiao Mu and I decided

160
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,159
we would stick with him,

161
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:40,860
keep him company,

162
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,950
stay by his side,

163
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,159
and talk to him constantly—

164
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:43,870
even if it's nonsense,

165
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,330
we'd keep talking to him.

166
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,870
Maybe in that moment

167
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,100
he would feel less alone.

168
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,070
After talking with you today,

169
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,630
I want to be even better to him!

170
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,800
-I want to be—
-You're already good enough to him.

171
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,400
Not at all!

172
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,750
More than enough.

173
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,190
Is His Lordship coming back soon?

174
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,590
Should we go welcome him?

175
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,260
Oh right, I completely forgot about that,

176
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,060
chatting with you all this time.

177
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,720
I'm afraid you'll talk
His Lordship to death.

178
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,430
Humans,

179
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,440
out of fear of demons,

180
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,070
slaughter demons.

181
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,120
Demons, hating humans,

182
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,270
eat humans.

183
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,940
It's a vicious cycle—

184
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,660
difficult to break.

185
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,140
The best solution now

186
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,220
is for both races

187
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,760
to cease fighting

188
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,330
and coexist peacefully.

189
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,200
His Lordship always comes and goes alone,

190
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,370
but he's different only with you.

191
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,800
Not only does he protect you,

192
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,310
he also smiles at you often.

193
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,630
In that brief moment just now—

194
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,700
I counted—

195
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,550
he smiled at you four times.

196
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,040
That's more than he's smiled

197
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,370
at me in the entire year.

198
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:42,890
Tell me honestly.

199
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,720
Who are you really?

200
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,850
Perhaps because I'm new here,

201
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,050
His Lordship is just looking after me.

202
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,360
Let me tell you,

203
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,130
in Demons' Valley,

204
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,120
the most important person

205
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,270
to listen to is His Lordship.

206
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,920
After that,

207
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,830
it's Xiao Mu

208
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,160
and me.

209
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,270
You...

210
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,960
Where are you going?

211
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,480
Go that way.

212
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,880
Where does this path lead to?

213
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,090
It leads to the prison.

214
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,190
Nothing worth seeing there.

215
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,040
Prison?

216
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,450
The Demons' Valley a hundred years later

217
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,180
doesn't have a place like this.

218
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,580
Who do they keep in there?

219
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,870
Seriously?

220
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,460
Human prisons hold demons;

221
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,420
naturally, demon prisons hold humans.

222
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,450
What are they captured for?

223
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,000
What do you think

224
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,330
we do to them?

225
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,830
Have you ever eaten a human?

226
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,510
No.

227
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,390
I heard human flesh isn't tasty.

228
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,840
It's dry and tough,

229
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,700
nowhere near as good as dried fish.

230
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,350
Who would eat humans?

231
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,750
Humans are reserved
for the great demons and elders—

232
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,280
never for somebody like me.

233
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,630
What are you doing?

234
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,150
I told you there's nothing to see.

235
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,210
What are you doing?

236
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,030
Help!

237
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,750
Save me!

238
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,630
-Help!
-Save me!

239
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,790
Help!

240
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,840
Help me!

241
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,120
Save me!

242
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,510
Help me!

243
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,720
-Help!
-Save me!

244
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,790
-Save me.
-You can't eat this.

245
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,570
They are for the sacrifice.

246
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,360
Please save me!

247
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,440
I beg you—

248
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,120
I beg you, immortal demon lord,

249
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,320
-please spare my life.
-Stop shouting.

250
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,170
My Lord,

251
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,260
I'm just

252
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,490
a city guard from the human realm.

253
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,340
I know my mistake

254
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,910
of accidentally disturbing

255
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,910
your meditation.

256
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,400
I beg you, My Lord,

257
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,200
spare me.

258
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,720
I have a family to support!

259
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,650
Let me tell you,

260
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,870
no human who enters Demons' Valley

261
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,040
leaves alive.

262
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,150
I swear to heaven!

263
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,870
I will never reveal anything

264
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,890
about what happened in this valley.

265
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,900
If you don't believe me, My Lord,

266
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,560
I am willing

267
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,730
to gouge out my eyes

268
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,290
and bite off my tongue.

269
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,870
-Save me!
-I beg you, My Lord,

270
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,230
spare my life.

271
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:30,790
Enough.

272
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,670
Stop your senseless crying.

273
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,340
That's enough.

274
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,270
You've seen enough.

275
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,790
We need to go welcome His Lordship.

276
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,430
Let's go.

277
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,320
Princess.

278
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,590
Stop looking.

279
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,910
Let's hurry.

280
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,960
His Lordship, don't leave!

281
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,240
Don't go, His Lordship!

282
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,480
Those children are only 6 or 7 years old.

283
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,080
Why won't they spare
even such young children?

284
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,620
Humans may have short lives,

285
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,120
but they grow up fast.

286
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,470
In just over 10 years,

287
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,870
they can reach adulthood.

288
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,020
Unlike us demons,

289
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,750
who need at least
several hundred years of cultivation

290
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,550
just to barely transform into human form.

291
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,600
Do you know how much
it took for Xiao Mu and me

292
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,930
to take this human form?

293
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Hong Ye

294
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
hasn't eaten humans before, right?

295
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,120
What?

296
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,080
Hong Ye.

297
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,810
How dare you!

298
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,560
How dare you address
His Lordship by his name?

299
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,770
Has he or has he not?

300
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,030
I don't know.

301
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,720
Though I haven't seen it myself,

302
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,790
but think about it:

303
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,030
His Lordship has been in this world
for thousands of years.

304
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,030
What hasn't he seen?

305
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,230
What hasn't he eaten?

306
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,290
Eating a human

307
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,030
is nothing strange.

308
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,750
You go ahead first.

309
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,010
I'll come along later.

310
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,660
Where are you going?

311
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,280
His Lordship told me
to keep a close eye on you.

312
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,660
His Lordship told me

313
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,360
to take good care of you.

314
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,080
I need to relieve myself now.

315
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,670
You staying right here

316
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,720
and waiting for me to return

317
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,750
would be the best care you could provide.

318
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,680
Don't follow me.

319
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,570
I don't even want to follow you.

320
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,510
Hurry up.

321
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,550
Elders, look at this.

322
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,220
This is our Demon King,

323
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,670
a king who sympathizes with humans

324
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,870
and speaks for humans at every turn.

325
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,710
Do you think

326
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,320
he still deserves

327
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,790
to sit on the Demon King's throne?

328
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,960
The survival of our demon race
is a long-term strategy,

329
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,690
not something as shortsighted

330
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,480
as you perceive it.

331
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,810
I'm shortsighted?

332
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,910
Me?

333
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,850
Only absolute suppression
can bring true peace!

334
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:42,790
Hmm.

335
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,220
Our demon race

336
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,510
has suffered humiliation from humans
for thousands of years.

337
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,200
As the Demon King,

338
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,510
instead of thinking about revenge,

339
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,970
you stand with the humans.

340
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,950
Elders, look at this.

341
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,210
Hong Ye's words today

342
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,960
aren't thoughts formed in just a few days.

343
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,510
He must have

344
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,950
harbored treacherous intentions
for a long time.

345
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,150
Hong Ye,

346
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,740
trusting human nature

347
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,020
will lead to irreversible disaster.

348
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,670
Hong Ye,

349
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,360
do you know

350
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,120
your getting too close
to the humans

351
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,600
was told to us by a human?

352
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,600
Wu Huan!

353
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,580
Bring them here!

354
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,790
-Sister, please help me.
-Please save me.

355
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,520
Don't speak.

356
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,150
I will take you out of here.

357
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,790
Hurry.

358
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,720
Follow me.

359
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,560
Hold hands.

360
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,160
Princess,

361
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,150
please spare my life too.

362
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,790
Earlier in the palace,

363
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,890
I've offended you many times,

364
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,540
but that was just my duty.

365
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,390
I never meant to offend you, Princess.

366
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,850
You've already hit me too.

367
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,940
I only beg you, Princess,

368
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,960
to spare my life.

369
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,960
I promise

370
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,910
to take these three children

371
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,910
safely back home.

372
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,790
About what happened in this valley,

373
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,820
I won't say a word.

374
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,970
I will forever be grateful for your

375
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,430
great kindness and mercy.

376
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,540
Please give me a chance

377
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,430
to redeem myself.

378
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,840
You liar.

379
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,210
You're helping humans?

380
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,640
Princess,

381
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,570
let me go!

382
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,780
I'll protect you from this cat demon.

383
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,350
You're

384
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,140
a human princess?

385
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,430
Yes.

386
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,000
I am a human princess,

387
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,050
but I'm also Hong Ye's friend.

388
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,600
You've been deceiving His Lordship!

389
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,750
I haven't deceived anyone.

390
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,910
Hong Ye has great powers.

391
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,300
How could I possibly deceive him?

392
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,540
He brought me here

393
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,320
so that humans and demons

394
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,480
could understand each other better.

395
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,360
He's seeking

396
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,700
a way for coexistence.

397
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,670
You're talking nonsense!

398
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,360
How is that possible?

399
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,150
Why not?

400
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,970
Must we fight
and kill each other every day?

401
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,440
The princess is right.

402
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,390
Humans and demons coexisting

403
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,270
is the right way!

404
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:44,990
Shut up.

405
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,270
If you don't believe me,

406
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,330
you can ask Hong Ye.

407
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,440
I...

408
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,550
I...

409
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,740
I can't just take your word for it.

410
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,290
If you want to free the humans,

411
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,310
it must be His Lordship

412
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,510
who says so in person.

413
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,480
Oh no.

414
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,790
Wu Huan is coming.

415
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,930
He must be here for the sacrifices.

416
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,430
Princess.

417
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,610
Save me, Princess!

418
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,850
Save me, Princess!

419
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,750
Quick!

420
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,240
Please save me, Princess!

421
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,790
Save me, Princess, please!

422
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,710
Help me!

423
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,200
Quick,

424
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,870
take them to those bushes over there

425
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,690
and hide them.

426
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,850
I'll deal with him.

427
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,630
Go now!

428
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,010
Let's go.

429
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,040
Come on, move!

430
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,490
Ning'an.

431
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,590
I've never seen His Lordship

432
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,030
as happy as today.

433
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,390
Remember,

434
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,810
don't disappoint His Lordship.

435
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,700
Go!

436
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,110
Where are the humans?

437
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,040
I ate them.

438
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,670
Three small ones and one big one—

439
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,670
you ate them all?

440
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,440
Yes.

441
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,080
Those three small ones were quite tender,

442
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,910
but the big one wasn't good.

443
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,670
He's too tough,

444
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,320
and fatty.

445
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,720
Do you know who they were?

446
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,080
The big one was the Feiyu Guard leader.

447
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,000
We needed him alive for questioning.

448
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,270
Those three small ones were sacrifices

449
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,240
for the ancestral ceremony
on the first day.

450
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,520
And you just ate them?

451
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,240
Look.

452
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,170
You're getting upset.

453
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,120
You didn't put up any signs here.

454
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,580
How was I supposed to know?

455
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,550
Don't you usually only eat
rotten fish, prawns,

456
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,030
grasshoppers, and rats?

457
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,310
Since when did you start eating humans?

458
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,370
Don't mention it.

459
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,720
The weather's been bad these days.

460
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,260
My dried fish isn't ready yet.

461
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,450
I was starving,

462
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,790
so I had to eat them.

463
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,570
Fine.

464
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,480
Since you admit you ate them,

465
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,910
come back with me to Youning Cave

466
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,370
to explain to the elders.

467
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,950
Take your claws off me.

468
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,750
You ate them?

469
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,820
The human Feiyu Guard
I worked so hard to capture

470
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,290
admitted himself

471
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,360
that Demon King is secretly colluding
with the human royal family.

472
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,960
I came to confront the Demon King
with this person,

473
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,360
and the next thing I know,

474
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,630
you've eaten him?

475
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,400
I believe it.

476
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,150
But do the elders believe it?

477
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,859
Why did you eat the humans?

478
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,369
I was hungry.

479
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,480
You were hungry?

480
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,210
The elders are hungry too.

481
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,680
What he ate were sacrifices.

482
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,829
This is a serious crime.
He should be punished.

483
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,920
You did that too?

484
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:22,790
Yes.

485
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,200
I wasn't satisfied with just one,

486
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,599
so I ate all three of them.

487
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,030
You ate them all in such a short time?

488
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,310
Weren't there other demons

489
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,440
sharing with you?

490
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,640
Why should I share with other demons?

491
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,790
Well.

492
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,630
Very well.

493
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,160
Given what you said,

494
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,720
stealing offerings

495
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,160
deserves

496
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,300
the punishment of lightning.

497
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,510
Fine.

498
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,880
Xiao Ming caused trouble

499
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,550
because I didn't discipline him properly.

500
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,200
I'll take the punishment for him.

501
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,170
No, no!

502
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,840
Silence!

503
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
Even if the cat stole the offerings,

504
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,850
we're punishing him

505
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,920
because he overstepped his bounds.

506
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,260
How could we punish

507
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,770
the Demon King instead?

508
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,300
But what if

509
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,270
the Demon King ordered his subordinate
to silence others,

510
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,870
who should be punished then?

511
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,310
Without solid evidence,

512
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,680
we

513
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,880
should not make baseless accusations.

514
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,880
Recently,

515
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,480
the human Feiyu Guard
has repeatedly invaded Demons' Valley,

516
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,010
and many demons
have suffered at their hands.

517
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,070
Hong Ye,

518
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,410
as the Demon King,

519
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,720
you've failed to protect the residents
of Demons' Valley,

520
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,320
yet you constantly speak
in favor of humans.

521
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,790
That human has been captured by me
for days,

522
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,400
as all the elders know.

523
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,440
This cat

524
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,870
normally eats fish and mice,

525
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,440
but today he swallowed
so many living humans.

526
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,070
Tell me,

527
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,740
without orders from you, his master,

528
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,930
would he dare to do such a thing?

529
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,200
Heiwu.

530
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
You needn't go to such lengths

531
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,480
to fabricate crimes against me.

532
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,170
Today I'll fulfill your wish.

533
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,170
If punishment is required,

534
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,620
I accept it.

535
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,440
Good.

536
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,020
The cat is Hong Ye's trusted aide.

537
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,440
Whether it's poor supervision

538
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,840
or secret instructions,

539
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,050
stealing offerings

540
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,340
makes his punishment justified.

541
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,440
Elders,

542
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,830
please

543
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,290
cast the lightning spell for punishment.

544
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,720
Come.

545
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,680
Swear to heaven.

546
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,370
I, Wang Hong,

547
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
swear to heaven

548
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,880
that upon leaving Demons' Valley,

549
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,270
I will definitely
take these three children

550
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,800
safely back to their families.

551
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,110
As everything I've seen and heard
in this valley,

552
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,040
I won't say a word

553
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,790
after leaving this place.

554
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,310
No.

555
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,640
I want you, after you return,

556
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,520
to tell my father everything you've seen

557
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,790
and experienced.

558
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,920
Tell him that demons are like humans,

559
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,780
there are good and bad among them.

560
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,990
Say that I hope Father

561
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,820
can be kind and benevolent

562
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,640
to reconcile and coexist
with the demons.

563
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,370
To reconcile

564
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,070
and coexist

565
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,180
with the demons.

566
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,010
If this oath is broken,

567
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,730
heaven's punishment will surely follow.

568
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,270
Oh, no.

569
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,760
I, Wang Hong,
will definitely keep my oath!

570
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,200
My Lord!

571
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,240
My Lord!

572
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,110
Let me go!

573
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,200
My Lord.

574
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,310
My Lord.

575
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,550
My Lord!

576
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,080
No...

577
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,830
No!

578
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,200
Stop!

579
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,120
This has nothing to do with His Lordship!

580
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,500
I ate the offering!

581
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,870
My Lord!

582
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:46,830
My Lord.

583
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,770
My Lord.

584
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,140
It's not a big deal.

585
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,600
Why are you crying so much?

586
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,000
I have my power to protect me.

587
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,570
I'm fine.

588
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,290
My Lord,

589
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,930
Heiwu clearly wanted to kill you.

590
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,290
If it had been me instead,

591
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,900
I would have been destroyed completely.

592
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Where is Ning'an?

593
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,620
Where are those humans?

594
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,650
Tell me quickly.

595
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,920
My Lord,

596
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,960
don't trust the human race too much.

597
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,640
They...

598
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,170
Hong Ye.

599
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,250
Ning'an.

600
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,290
Does it hurt?

601
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,420
I'm fine.

602
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,970
You released those humans?

603
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,080
They're just children.

604
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,090
You're lying!

605
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,410
-She let the Feiyu Guard go—
-Shut up.

606
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,270
Just tell me

607
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,170
where they are.

608
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,730
I just want to ask you one thing.

609
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,680
Answer me honestly.

610
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,840
Have you ever eaten humans?

611
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,990
I've fought against humans
for thousands of years,

612
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,720
and indeed many human warriors

613
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:29,530
and sorcerers

614
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,710
have died by my hand.

615
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,430
But something as tasteless and vile
as eating humans

616
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,090
is something I've never done.

617
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,870
Mm-hmm.

618
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,980
I believe what you say.

619
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,020
Those children and the Feiyu Guard,

620
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,950
I've hidden them at Chenxiang Sea.

621
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,680
Whether to release them or keep them—

622
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,410
I wanted to discuss it with you.

623
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,180
My Lord,

624
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,550
you absolutely cannot let humans

625
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,270
know the secrets of Demons' Valley.

626
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,110
If that happens,

627
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,830
they might plunder our treasures,

628
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,520
and at worst,
countless lives might be lost.

629
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,880
For self-preservation,

630
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,790
demons would have to migrate elsewhere
to survive.

631
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,190
Please think carefully!

632
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,680
Jump down.

633
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,920
Jump.

634
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,190
Demon King,

635
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,950
Your Highness,

636
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,300
I have already sworn an oath.

637
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,920
Please spare my life.

638
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,830
Return to the human realm

639
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,090
and keep your promise.

640
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,950
Children, come here.

641
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,580
Hug your shoulders

642
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,240
like me.

643
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,310
Close your eyes.

644
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,870
Count from 1 to 10 silently,

645
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,950
and then you can open your eyes.

646
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,360
My Lord,

647
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,720
the future of our demon race

648
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,470
now depends entirely on the humans.

649
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,200
It's far too dangerous.

650
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,640
If disaster strikes,

651
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,910
we'll all be beyond redemption.

652
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,160
I must return to the human realm now.

653
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,640
I'll meet with my father.

654
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,840
I'll tell him

655
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,180
that the Demon King
has chosen to trust humans,

656
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,000
to temporarily cease hostilities.

657
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,350
It's now on humans to decide
how we should respond.

658
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:52,950
Very well.

659
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,030
I'll escort you back.

660
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,160
My Lord.

661
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,400
What if Ning'an

662
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,930
doesn't return after this?

663
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,680
Ning'an will return.

664
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,240
I...

665
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,510
You...

666
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,640
You never listen to anything I say.

667
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,550
I give up!

668
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,640
Seriously!

669
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,570
What if my father detains me

670
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,800
and I can't escape?

671
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,700
Then I'll come rescue you.

672
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,600
What if I

673
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,680
am no longer in this world?

674
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,210
Why are you suddenly asking this?

675
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,270
I just want to know.

676
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:32,750
What if I

677
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:33,980
die?

678
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,290
Then I'll find you in your next life.

679
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,380
Hong Ye.

680
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,310
Promise me,

681
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,880
if,

682
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,000
when you find me again,

683
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,590
I have changed,

684
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,350
you and Princess Ning'an

685
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,680
will just be friends.

686
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,800
Just be friends.

687
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
Will you promise?

688
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,240
No.

689
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,630
Why not?

690
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,480
Because I love you.

691
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,790
Perhaps it's because of your kindness,

692
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,840
your purity,

693
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,510
and your loyalty.

694
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,580
You showed me
a different kind of human realm.

695
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:23,920
You also allowed me to see

696
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,330
the future of our two races

697
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,060
I've never envisioned before.

698
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,670
But all of this is because

699
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,160
you

700
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,490
are you.

701
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,550
You've never spoken like this before.

702
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,860
Of course not.

703
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,090
I've never said such things to anyone.

704
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,380
You're the first

705
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,680
and will be the only one.

706
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,960
What if I

707
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,340
weren't Princess Ning'an?

708
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,720
I like you.

709
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,840
No matter what your name is,

710
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,550
what your status is,

711
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,390
whether you're human or spirit,

712
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,810
it doesn't matter.

713
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,350
I just don't know

714
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,110
if you feel the same way.

715
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,160
I do.

716
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,500
Coming back here,

717
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,820
it feels like it'd been forever.

718
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Go back to your palace first

719
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,300
and get some good rest.

720
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,140
Whatever happens,

721
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,880
I'll face it with you.

722
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,790
Then I want you to stay with me
until I fall asleep.

723
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,120
Leave after I'm asleep.

724
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,520
All right.

725
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,140
Don't move.

726
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,160
It's a small trick.

727
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,120
Your Majesty,
Princess Ning'an has returned.

728
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,780
She entered Yong'an Palace
with the Demon King.

729
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,400
She really came back with the Demon King.

730
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,780
It's absolutely true.

731
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,800
They've entered the array set
by the Feiyu Guard.

732
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,550
By now,

733
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,410
they should be fighting already.

734
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:28,640
[Yong'an Palace]

735
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,770
It's you.

736
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,410
I thank Your Highness for saving my life.

737
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,170
After we kill the Demon King,

738
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,550
I will certainly report to His Majesty

739
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,270
that you led the Demon King into our trap.

740
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,730
You're full of lies!

741
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,540
I told you to tell my father the truth.

742
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,090
What did you say?

743
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,860
I reported truthfully.

744
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,530
I was simply careless

745
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,350
and fell into the trap
of the cunning demons.

746
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,800
Fortunately, the princess saved me

747
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,200
and I escaped with my life.

748
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,750
Therefore,

749
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,990
all the more we should kill the Demon King

750
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,120
to redeem ourselves

751
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,400
and serve the royal family.

752
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,000
Hong Ye suffered lightning punishment

753
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,350
to save you.

754
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,390
How dare you be so ungrateful.

755
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,960
The princess just said

756
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,440
Hong Ye

757
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,510
has just endured lightning punishment

758
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,480
and his power is greatly diminished.

759
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,080
Feiyu Guard, hear my orders!

760
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,940
Whoever wounds Demon King Hong Ye

761
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,860
will be rewarded with gold.

762
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,060
Whoever kills Hong Ye

763
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,110
will be granted a title!

764
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,240
Activate the array!

765
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,950
I was going to let you all go,

766
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,690
but now I really want you dead.

767
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,230
I'm carrying Hong Ye's child.

768
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,450
If you kill him,

769
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,810
you're killing me too.

770
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,070
Feiyu Guards, you've all heard it.

771
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,550
[Yong'an Palace]

772
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,350
The princess is entangled with demons

773
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,550
and blinded by demonic arts.

774
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,400
Now she's carrying a demon spawn.

775
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,860
If the princess is harmed,

776
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,480
it's considered loyalty
in capturing demons.

777
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,230
Who dares to touch her?

778
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,610
Imperial decree!

779
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,650
Everyone stop!

780
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,920
[Yong'an Palace]

781
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,350
All you servants,

782
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,160
kneel down!

783
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:23,820
Kneel!

784
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,640
His Majesty's verbal decree:

785
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,910
Princess Ning'an and Demon King Hong Ye
are summoned to the palace.

786
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,560
His Majesty also said,

787
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,970
to show his sincerity,

788
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,270
only I will escort

789
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:42,110
Your Highness and the Demon King
to the royal study.

790
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,480
Step aside now!

791
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,310
[Yong'an Palace]

792
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,310
Your Highness,

793
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,270
Demon King,

794
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
this way, please.

795
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,930
Your Highness and Demon King,
please wait here.

796
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,070
Ning'an.

797
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,590
Ning'an.

798
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,160
You've finally returned.

799
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,040
Are you...

800
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,350
injured?

801
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,770
Were you frightened just now?

802
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,570
I will punish those Feiyu Guards at once!

803
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,350
I am...

804
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,280
fine, Father.

805
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,080
Thank you for your concern.

806
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,570
Rise, please rise.

807
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,480
That's good.

808
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,160
That's good.

809
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,960
During these days when you were away,

810
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,200
I worried about you every day.

811
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,199
Meeting for the first time,

812
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,730
I must seem foolish to the Demon King.

813
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,480
Leave now.

814
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,929
Without my permission,

815
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,280
no one is to enter.

816
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,420
The Demon King and I
have important matters to discuss.

817
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,920
You may go.

818
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,650
Yes, Your Majesty.

819
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,909
You may leave.

820
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,320
I have

821
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,070
no spiritual power

822
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,630
and no magical techniques.

823
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,070
If the Demon King wishes to kill me now,

824
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,130
it would be effortless.

825
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,050
If killing me
could bring peace to the world,

826
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,480
I implore the Demon King

827
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,520
to do so immediately.

828
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,060
Didn't you say you had matters to discuss?

829
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,070
What is it?

830
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,710
If the Demon King
has no intention of killing me,

831
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,440
then let's put aside our guards

832
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,630
and work together
for peace between our races.

833
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,920
I've heard that the Demon King

834
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,580
has feelings for my princess.

835
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,280
Is that true?

836
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,400
Yes.

837
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,270
You have great taste.

838
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,110
My Ning'an is wonderful.

839
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,370
However, in the past, I've had

840
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,670
many regrettable circumstances

841
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,230
and couldn't protect her properly.

842
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,220
It seems that Ning'an

843
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,050
will suffer less in the future.

844
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,670
As your father, I owe you an apology.

845
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,740
Since you were born,

846
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,440
I've rarely visited you.

847
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:30,710
First,

848
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,600
I feared that remembering your mother

849
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,960
would break my heart.

850
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,150
Second, everyone at court

851
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,560
had their eyes on you.

852
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,230
By staying away,

853
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,710
I was actually protecting you.

854
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,360
Come,

855
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,710
I'll take you to see your mother.

856
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,030
This is your mother.

857
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,740
Back then,

858
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,550
I was still a prince.

859
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,110
I first met your mother

860
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,000
at an academy.

861
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,510
She was standing in the corridor,

862
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,770
playing with a parrot,

863
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,550
teaching it to speak.

864
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,800
With just one glance,

865
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:25,110
I couldn't take my eyes off her.

866
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,800
After that,

867
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,230
I often went to the academy

868
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,110
to meet your mother.

869
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,630
As time went by,

870
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,290
we promised to grow old together.

871
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,250
I brought your mother

872
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,710
into my residence.

873
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,110
But I gradually discovered

874
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,590
your mother

875
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,740
not only talked to parrots,

876
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,550
but also frequently with cats and dogs,

877
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,410
and even with the fish in our home.

878
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,150
The servants

879
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,760
often saw these animals

880
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,620
communicating with your mother.

881
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,400
She often said

882
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,410
all things have spirits,

883
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
and that demons

884
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,590
are manifestations of natural power.

885
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,200
Until one day,

886
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,670
I saw with my own eyes

887
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,960
that your mother's blood

888
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,550
could attract animals from miles around.

889
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,880
It was then I had to accept the fact

890
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,960
that she was a demon.

891
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,230
A human prince's

892
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,360
love affair with a demon

893
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,210
was not accepted in this world.

894
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,980
For me to ascend the throne smoothly,

895
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,350
your mother

896
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,840
moved out of the palace

897
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,640
to live in a separate residence.

898
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,780
After giving birth to you,

899
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,510
she died from complications.

900
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,870
I didn't want to see
Ning'an living away from me,

901
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,320
but the entire court said
she was ill-fated

902
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,480
and must be killed.

903
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
I promised them

904
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,940
that when Ning'an came of age,

905
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,960
she would be married off
to a frontier kingdom.

906
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,020
Only then was I able to
keep her in the palace.

907
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,900
Now my daughter

908
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,880
has fallen in love with the Demon King,

909
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,480
it must be fate.

910
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,630
But I don't want the tragedy I experienced

911
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,290
to repeat itself with you two.

912
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:16,890
Therefore,

913
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,940
I hope you

914
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,840
can openly marry Ning'an.

915
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,550
Demon King,

916
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
are you willing?

917
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,710
Of course I am.

918
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,760
Good.

919
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,600
The Demon King

920
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,800
marrying a human princess means

921
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,510
the harmony between our races

922
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,110
will begin

923
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,380
with our royal families.

924
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,060
Isn't this better than

925
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,590
you trying so hard

926
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,550
to gradually heal the divide?

927
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,120
Father, you knew our plan?

928
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,320
It is also exactly what I have in mind.

929
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,550
However,

930
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,360
I have one more request.

931
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,900
I'd like to hear it.

932
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,440
I hope

933
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,510
you can find

934
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,890
the ancient Kunlun Mirror.
