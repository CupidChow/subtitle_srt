[Episode 38]

3
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,330
The illusion beast.

4
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,630
The illusion beast.

5
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,759
No wonder Long Zhi failed her tribulation.

6
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,430
She lost the protection
of the Dragon Essence Pearl.

7
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:52,920
How...

8
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,840
How...

9
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,590
How could this happen?

10
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,900
How did it come to this?

11
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,620
The Treasure House has a barrier.

12
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,370
Only dragons can enter.

13
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,310
The Dragon Essence Pearl
is a sacred dragon relic.

14
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,960
Only those with dragon scales can open it.

15
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,760
Who switched the Dragon Essence Pearl?

16
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,510
Long Yu.

17
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,000
Do you have anything to say?

18
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:25,990
A...

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,840
A few days ago,

20
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,760
I took Hong Ye to the Treasure House
to see the Dragon Essence Pearl.

21
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,079
But I swear,

22
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,880
we just looked at it.

23
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,820
Really. It was just a look.

24
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,750
I have no idea

25
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,030
how the Pearl was switched.

26
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,840
I knew it.

27
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,400
Hong Ye was definitely up to no good

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,079
trying to get close to Dragon Lord.

29
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,960
This little dragon
has caused such disaster.

30
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,750
He should be banished from our clan!

31
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,200
Yes,

32
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,079
banish him!

33
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,640
What I'm saying is all true.

34
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,430
Hong Ye said

35
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,490
he wanted to prepare
a wedding gift for the Dragon Lord.

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,630
That's why I agreed to show him.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,630
You...

38
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,870
Long Yu, how could you do this?

39
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,530
I'll go find Hong Ye
and get to the bottom of this.

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,470
Sister.

41
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,690
If this is what you want,

42
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,960
I accept it.

43
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,870
But please look back at me once more.

44
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,240
Xiao Yao.

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,030
As an Azure Dragon,

46
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,510
your power has reached its peak.

47
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,280
Why do you still want to
exterminate all other demons?

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,100
Is it to avenge Hong Ye?

49
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,960
Yes.

50
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,020
Hong Ye!

51
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,540
When you were slaughtering humans,

52
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,620
did you ever imagine this day would come?

53
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,710
You once said,

54
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,890
either endure,

55
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,750
or be ruthless.

56
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,390
Either endure,

57
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,900
or be ruthless,

58
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,330
so you can stand firm.

59
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,320
For tens of thousands of years,

60
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,160
humans have suffered
under demon oppression.

61
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,950
Unlike humans,

62
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,850
you've enjoyed all the best
of heaven and earth,

63
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,940
with nearly immortal lives.

64
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,630
But from today,

65
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,370
humans will no longer need to endure.

66
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,430
With the Yuli Spring,

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,540
it is now humans' turn

68
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,480
to hold dominion over this world.

69
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,190
Xiao Yao gave everything for you.

70
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,310
She loved you,

71
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,100
protected you,

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,480
and defied her own kind to marry you—

73
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,360
yet in the end,

74
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,250
you merely used her!

75
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,710
How do you face her again?

76
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,420
[Happiness]

77
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,000
Xiao Yao...

78
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,230
will surely forgive me.

79
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,340
Everything I've done

80
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,630
was so we could be together forever.

81
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,159
[Happiness]

82
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,350
Ao Hen.

83
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,040
Xiao Yao.

84
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,700
The Yuli Spring

85
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,510
has finally appeared.

86
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,160
So,

87
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,680
was everything—our marriage,

88
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,560
having me try on the wedding robes—

89
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,480
all part of your plan?

90
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,050
That's not true.

91
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,120
You also pretended to be Ao Hen

92
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,560
and slaughtered the demons,

93
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,120
right?

94
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,430
Switching the Dragon Essence Pearl,

95
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,159
using the illusion beast
to impersonate me,

96
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,430
and tricking them out of their pearls—

97
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,030
you did all that, didn't you?

98
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,910
Protecting humans is my duty,

99
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,220
but falling in love with you

100
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,510
was instinct.

101
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,410
When I left the Dragon Palace,

102
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,160
I realized

103
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,220
I had already fallen in love with you.

104
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,290
I thought about giving up.

105
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,830
In Ao Hen's cave,

106
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,220
even when I was dying,

107
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,160
I still couldn't let you go.

108
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,160
At that moment, I realized

109
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,630
how insignificant I was.

110
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,480
I had no power to protect humans,

111
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,510
and I didn't even deserve

112
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,330
to stand before the one I love.

113
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,080
Yes.

114
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,670
I did all those things.

115
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,560
I have to obtain the Yuli Spring

116
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,810
to be with you forever.

117
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,480
Otherwise,

118
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,550
I would have to watch helplessly...

119
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,620
watch my people

120
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,790
being trampled by demons again and again.

121
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,500
Xiao Yao.

122
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,760
Now I've finally defeated all the demons

123
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,160
and can stand before you.

124
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,600
Look.

125
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,250
The Yuli Spring is right ahead.

126
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,470
If we take this step,

127
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,060
I can protect the world together with you.

128
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,700
I want to watch sunrises
and sunsets with you

129
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,260
for thousands of years,

130
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,040
tens of thousands of years,

131
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,070
never leaving your side.

132
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,360
[Happiness]

133
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,500
Xiao Yao.

134
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,810
I can finally truly stand by your side.

135
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,270
It seemed just one step away,

136
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,510
but it took so long,

137
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,440
so, so, long.

138
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,040
Immortality gained at the cost of lives,

139
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,280
does it truly bring happiness?

140
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,240
You speak of humans as innocent—

141
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,730

00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:17,920
♪ You are the old wound in my palm ♪

192
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,329
must be repaid.

193
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,930
Look everyone, it's the Dragon Lord!

194
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,490
Dragon Lord.

195
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,240
Is...

196
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,800
Is this the Yuli Spring?

197
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,830
The Yuli Spring?

198
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,790
The Yuli Spring?

199
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,990
The eight pearls

200
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,720
were originally demon treasures.

201
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,190
Tainted with human desires,

202
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,490
these desires gathered together,

203
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,190
and have taken physical form.

204
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,210
My power can only fragment them.

205
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,050
These scattered mirror fragments

206
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,700
contain all the suffering and resentment
of this world.

207
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,120
When they are merged again,

208
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,330
chaos will descend once again.

209
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,930
You must use all your strength

210
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,680
to prevent them from merging again.

211
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,350
At the Dragon Lord's command!

212
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,840
Dragon Lord,

213
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,030
even if you pour
all your strength into it,

214
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,880
you cannot bring him back to life.

215
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,140
Why torment yourself?

216
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,240
He may not return to life,

217
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,140
but he will not fall
into the cycle of reincarnation either.

218
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,790
The Azure Dragon's power

219
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,610
can let him sleep for 5,000 years.

220
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,110
When he awakens,

221
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,400
no human memories will remain.

222
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,830
Let him

223
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,230
atone to the demons.

224
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,920
Hong Ye,

225
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,050
you will not die.

226
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,110
If you die,

227
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,450
I will never be able to return.

228
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,990
Our destinies

229
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,510
are bound together forever.

230
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,540
Rest assured, Dragon Lord.

231
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,310
I will cultivate here,

232
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,390
protecting Hong Ye

233
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,550
until he awakens.

234
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,750
Thank you, Long Yu.

235
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,180
But I need you to do three things.

236
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,330
Even if it were thousands of tasks,

237
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,750
I am at your command.

238
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,340
You are pure-hearted

239
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,220
and without ambition.

240
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,000
First,

241
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,810
I want you to cultivate diligently

242
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,950
and become the Monarch of All Demons.

243
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,620
How is that possible?

244
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,090
The demon race has suffered a catastrophe,

245
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,960
and their strength is greatly diminished.

246
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,070
They need a leader with profound power

247
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,640
and upright character

248
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,920
to guide them in rebuilding.

249
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,440
I didn't do well.

250
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,570
I shall entrust you

251
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,780
with this important task.

252
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,320
I...

253
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,240
I cannot promise,

254
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,030
but I will try my best.

255
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,830
Second,

256
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,190
Ao Hen, Qiong Qi, and Teng She

257
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,700
have been sealed off by human arrays.

258
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,690
I want you to find suitable demons

259
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,920
to protect them well.

260
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,110
I have failed them.

261
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
At your command.

262
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,800
I will definitely accomplish it.

263
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,440
Third,

264
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,970
remove me from the dragon clan.

265
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,370
In this world,

266
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,360
there will be no more
Azure Dragon Xiao Yao.

267
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,870
Dragon Lord...

268
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,440
Today's outcome is all my fault.

269
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,410
I don't deserve to be an Azure Dragon,

270
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,060
nor to be remembered by everyone.

271
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,400
Promise me.

272
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,000
Yes.

273
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,480
Dragon Lord!

274
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,070
Dragon Lord!

275
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,460
Dragon Lord!

276
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,200
I didn't let you go back

277
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,790
because you couldn't bear the truth.

278
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,270
For the past ten thousand years,

279
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,720
this world has not known lasting peace

280
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,440
despite your sacrifice.

281
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,910
The temptation of the Yuli Spring
is too great.

282
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,240
The mirror fragments separate and merge—

283
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,320
the wars between humans and demons
have grown ever more frequent.

284
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,630
Qiong Qi, Ao Hen, and Teng She,

285
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,300
have all been resurrected.

286
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,810
What will you choose to do now?

287
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,260
If I can't figure it out,
I'll just not think about it now.

288
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,250
Past and present lives
are cause and effect of each other.

289
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,110
When you open your eyes again,

290
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,750
you will face a world plunged
into chaos once more.

291
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,750
Finally...

292
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,830
You're awake.

293
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,890
Why are you so sad?

294
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,680
I'm not sad.

295
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,150
I'm happy.

296
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,720
Where is this?

297
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,110
The Demons' Valley.

298
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,270
The Demons' Valley?

299
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,480
Who are you?

300
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,440
I am your

301
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,740
old friend,

302
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,270
Long Yu.

303
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,000
My old friend?

304
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,240
What about me?

305
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,920
Who am I?

306
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,570
You are Hong Ye.

307
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,050
Xiao Yao.

308
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,510
I'm sorry.

309
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,350
Hong Ye and I have let everyone down.

310
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,450
You already know the truth.

311
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,590
Why do you still choose him?

312
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,240
Despite all of Hong Ye's mistakes,

313
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,750
he is my husband.

314
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,890
He was 10,000 years ago,

315
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,480
and he still is,10,000 years later.

316
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,590
Hong Ye did harm the demons,

317
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,120
and deceived you all.

318
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,550
But you also slaughtered humans.

319
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,590
This cycle of revenge will never end.

320
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,930
Ten thousand years ago,

321
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,860
after I learned the truth,

322
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,090
I killed Hong Ye with my own hands.

323
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,400
Five thousand years ago,

324
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,580
he awakened as a demon,

325
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,770
with no memory of being human.

326
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,400
For thousands of years,

327
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,380
he has been serving the demons.

328
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,160
Perhaps by fate,

329
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,110
he has been repaying his debt.

330
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,860
Thank you for accompanying me.

331
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,430
You will always be my good brother.

332
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,000
Ten thousand years have passed,

333
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,630
and I can still only be your brother?

334
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:24,780
Never mind.

335
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,680
I promised you

336
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,480
I would never force you
to do anything you don't want to.

337
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:34,940
Teng She.

338
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,480
Whenever I feel depressed,

339
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,710
you always cheer me up.

340
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,230
You'd drink with me,

341
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,270
and think of me in everything.

342
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,450
We are the world's

343
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,450
closest siblings.

344
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,330
If you hadn't

345
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,120
rescued me from the Chaos Clan,

346
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,450
I would still be

347
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,550
just a little earthworm.

348
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,440
How could I become
the Teng She I am today?

349
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,300
I will forever be grateful to you.

350
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,060
As long as you

351
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,950
can be happy.

352
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,030
I once said

353
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,930
I will respect your choice.

354
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,840
Since you've chosen him,

355
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,810
I will sincerely give you my blessing.

356
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,360
Just as I did

357
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,330
10,000 years ago.

358
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,830
I know you're cold on the outside
but warm inside.

359
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,070
But I still hope

360
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,150
you can stop being too tough.

361
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,720
In this world, besides winning and losing,

362
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,380
there is also true affection.

363
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,170
You will definitely find

364
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,770
that special someone.

365
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,800
Hong Ye and I

366
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,040
thank you for your generosity
and tolerance.

367
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,960
But there's still a major issue

368
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,290
that we need to resolve.

369
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,400
The 8 demon pearls

370
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,030
were later transformed
into mirror fragments

371
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,490
forming the Kunlun Mirror

372
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,010
which can open the gate
to the Yuli Spring.

373
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,070
The Yuli Spring is

374
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,590
the source of all conflicts in this world.

375
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,920
Therefore, we must seal it permanently.

376
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,410
Yes.

377
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,690
To seal the Yuli Spring completely,

378
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,980
we must destroy the Kunlun Mirror.

379
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,400
Take out those four pieces
we already have first.

380
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,910
These four mirror fragments

381
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,550
represent the four obsessions
of the human realm.

382
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,600
Love and Separation.

383
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,000
Lasting Resentment.

384
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,489
Unattainable Desire.

385
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,320
Unresolved Attachment.

386
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,090
The remaining four pieces

387
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,840
represent
Birth, Aging, Sickness, and Death.

388
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,800
Let's split into four groups

389
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,850
to find them—

390
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:25,889
how's that?

391
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:34,840
I take your silence as agreement.

392
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,750
I'm still the same as before,

393
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,880
always listening to Sister.

394
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,030
I've always followed your orders.

395
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,190
In that case,

396
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,820
let's make a bet.

397
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,139
Let's see who finds the fragments first.

398
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,550
Come.

399
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,800
Let us

400
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,510
end this chaotic world together.

401
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,150
This...

402
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,960
This is an omen of great disaster!

403
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,590
Meteor.

404
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,510
The disaster star split into four!

405
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,400
We can't win this!

406
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,560
The world will be taken over by demons!

407
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,980
We can't defeat them!

408
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,110
Run!

409
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,670
Run!

410
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,320
Hurry!

411
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,510
Ridiculous!

412
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,380
The demons haven't even attacked yet,

413
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,440
and you're already in disarray.

414
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,920
You're an Imperial Guard—

415
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,440
you lose your dignity just like this?

416
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,050
A mere Feiyu Guard like you

417
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,210
doesn't get to point fingers
at us Imperial Guards.

418
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,360
We are all the Emperor's personal guards.

419
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,370
Drawing your blade
before the Imperial Guard

420
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,830
is equivalent to treason!

421
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,280
This is a matter of life and death.

422
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,770
If anyone else dares to disrupt morale,

423
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,580
they will be executed!

424
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,410
After the battle is over,

425
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,880
you can file complaints
when we return to the capital.

426
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,960
But now,

427
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,550
pick up your weapons

428
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,610
and aim at Demons' Valley!

429
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,660
Where are we going now?

430
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:15,870
The North Sea.

431
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,400
Is a fragment of the Kunlun Mirror there?

432
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,710
Ten thousand years ago,

433
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,400
the North Sea
was a domain of the dragon clan.

434
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,800
The dragons nurtured
the Dragon Essence Pearl there.

435
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,210
My Master was the last of the dragon clan,

436
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,640
but I never heard him mention this.

437
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,130
Was your Master named Long Yu?

438
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,520
You met him
when you went back 10,000 years ago?

439
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,110
Yes.

440
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,180
I once asked my Master

441
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,080
what the world was like before.

442
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,330
But he always kept it secret.

443
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,820
Xiao Yao.

444
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,620
What exactly happened 10,000 years ago?

445
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,500
That's a very long story.

446
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,200
Are you ready to hear it?

447
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:02,970
My Lord.

448
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,420
Congratulations.

449
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,710
Given our current situation,

450
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,280
what is there to celebrate?

451
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,470
Congratulations on your increased power.

452
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,820
Now your demon-slaying blade
can not only kill demons,

453
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,130
but humans as well.

454
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,490
In today's world,

455
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:36,230
have humans and demons
truly become indistinguishable?

456
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,510
It doesn't matter

457
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,550
if it's human or demon anymore.

458
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,670
You don't have much time left.

459
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,440
Those four shooting stars in the sky

460
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,320
were three ancient great demons
and Hong Ye.

461
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,280
They've split up now

462
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,590
with only one purpose.

463
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,170
The Kunlun Mirror.

464
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,880
They're moving so quickly,

465
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,630
I fear they've already located
the mirror fragments.

466
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,900
If they collect all the fragments,

467
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,730
we may never have another chance.

468
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,070
The old demon is right.

469
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,650
They've gone in four directions—
north, south, east, and west.

470
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,650
We can use our numbers against them.

471
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,400
With the full force of the Feiyu Guard,

472
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,110
we can defeat them one by one.

473
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,080
We still have a chance.

474
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,420
Which one should we target first?

475
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,180
[Hong Ye] [Qiong Qi] [Ao Hen] [Teng She]

476
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,840
The closest one.

477
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,420
It has already reached Mount Buchou.

478
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,610
Are there any demons left?

479
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,230
You're too late.

480
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,220
The humans have taken everything
worth taking.

481
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,280
I'm the only one left—

482
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,110
an old demon with no spiritual energy.
