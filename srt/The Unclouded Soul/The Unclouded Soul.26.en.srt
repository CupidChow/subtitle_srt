00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,890
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,570
Where am I?

4
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:43,640
Is anyone here?

5
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,039
Hello?

6
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,479
Anyone around?

7
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,210
How beautiful.

8
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,430
Xiao Yao,

9
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,090
is this really you?

10
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,280
Gorgeous,

11
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,560
stunning—

12
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,079
perfect descriptions of you.

13
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,710
But who am I now?

14
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,430
Who's there?

15
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,270
Your Highness,

16
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,560
it's time for lunch.

17
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,190
"Your Highness"?

18
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,240
Am I in the imperial palace?

19
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,710
I am Princess Ning'an?

20
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,070
Yes, Your Highness.

21
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,170
Anything wrong?

22
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,590
What else?

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,650
Your Highness rarely talks to others

24
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,710
and enjoys reading, writing, and painting

25
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,080
in your bedchamber alone.

26
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,630
Your Highness doesn't even show

27
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,960
much interest in items of gold and silver.

28
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,610
Your Highness?

29
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,000
Go on.

30
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,560
Has the princess...

31
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,630
I mean, have I

32
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,270
been like this since childhood?

33
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,000
Well...

34
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,560
Say it.

35
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,910
I heard

36
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,360
Your Highness

37
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,870
was given birth by a maid.

38
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,030
Disdaining such humble origins,
His Majesty has always

39
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,490
neglected Your Highness.

40
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,190
Your Highness doesn't even

41
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,190
get to see His Majesty once in a year.

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,079
That's why Your Highness
has grown increasingly silent.

43
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,240
As time passes,

44
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,560
rumor even has it that Your Highness...

45
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,079
is a jinx.

46
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,280
Have I...

47
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,030
always looked like this?

48
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,280
Yes.

49
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,470
What's your name?

50
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,240
It's Mocui,

51
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,610
which was given by Your Highness.

52
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm just teasing you

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,950
and joking around.

54
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,510
Of course I know your name is Mocui.

55
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,120
I realize I've been like this
since I was little.

56
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,120
I'm also aware that I'm Princess Ning'an.

57
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,180
All those questions were only a test.

58
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,720
Mocui,

59
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,240
do you know

60
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,130
where demons reside now?

61
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,350
No, I don't.

62
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,360
Your Highness,

63
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,070
please do not speak of demons again,

64
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,530
or His Majesty will impose
more punishment.

65
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,120
"More"?

66
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,510
Previously,
Your Highness spoke for demons.

67
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,159
His Majesty learned about it,

68
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,480
went absolutely livid,

69
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,800
and ordered to confine Your Highness

70
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,930
to your bedchamber.

71
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,870
Got it.

72
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,630
Your Highness, you cannot go out.

73
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,240
There will be more punishment
if His Majesty finds out,

74
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,100
Your Highness!

75
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,580
Step aside.

76
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,310
We're guarding Yong'an Palace
by imperial order.

77
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,710
We beg for Your Highness's understanding.

78
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,070
You guys will pay for this.

79
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,360
How come I can't use

80
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,250
spiritual power in this place?

81
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,270
Both of you, hurry up.

82
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,420
There are many other places to clean.

83
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,040
Give it to me.

84
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,390
Sure.

85
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,800
Be careful.

86
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,270
Yes.

87
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,430
Alright.

88
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,510
Come with me to check out other places.

89
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:06,870
Yes.

90
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,310
Sure.

91
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,880
Watch your step.

92
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,150
Your Highness.

93
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,010
Your Highness.

94
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,330
Your Highness,

95
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,310
if you run away,

96
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,240
we lowly servants will lose our heads.

97
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,300
Please forgive us.

98
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,830
I'm only forbidden from leaving
Yong'an Palace,

99
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,550
not the bedchamber!

100
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,270
The princess barely carried any authority.

101
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,920
What are these?

102
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,010
Even the books she read are so boring.

103
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,090
[Drunk and seated alone,
to whom shall I tell my sorrow?]

[The waning autumn moon will not be whole.

105
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,780
Did Ning'an write this?

106
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,160
Drunk and seated alone,

107
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,370
to whom shall I tell my sorrow?

108
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,870
The waning autumn moon will not be whole.

109

Snow lies lonely on frontier mountains.

110
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,170
Where did the Demon Lord hide
a hundred years before my time?

111
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,530
When will I ever find Hong Ye?

[Yong'an Palace]

113
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,580
Your Highness.

114
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,340
Your Highness,

115
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,800
it's time for dinner.

116
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,660
Your Highness?

117
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,870
Your Highness...

118
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,680
Sit down.

119
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,430
Please spare me, Your Highness.

120
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,920
Just put on my clothes
and sleep here tonight.

121
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,720
I promise to be back before dawn.

122
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,390
But I dare not.

123
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,160
Will you undress yourself
or shall I help you?

124
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,059
I'll do it myself.

125
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,730
I beg you, Your Highness.

126
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,480
Please do return before dawn.

127
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,190
The Demon King is coming!

128
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,320
The Demon King is coming!

129
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,030
The Demon King is coming!

130
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,200
What? What's going on?

131
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,720
Run!

132
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,300
Run!

133
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,910
What's happening?

134
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,600
The Feiyu Guard set a trap
to catch the Demon King,

135
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,150
yet the latter still managed to escape!

136
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,810
Run, or you'll die
when the Demon King gets here!

137
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,620
The Demon King?

138
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,480
Feiyu Guards on a demon hunt!

139
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,210
Those who obstruct us will die!

140
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,600
I have no intention of killing.

141
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,520
All I want is to retrieve
the sacred artifact of us demons.

142
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,120
Since it's not in your place,

143
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,470
I'll go search somewhere else.

144
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:45,950
You demon!

145
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,220
Demon,

146
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,030
you think you can enter and leave
the imperial palace

147
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,090
just as you please?

148
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,840
Then let's see

149
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,550
if you're able to stop me.

150

[Yong'an Palace]

151
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,270
Hong Ye was formidable.

152
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,730
How did Princess Ning'an
manage to wound him?

153
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,740
Hong Ye didn't recognize me just now.

154
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,840
That means he hadn't known Ning'an
by this moment a hundred years ago.

155
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,270
He could've just fled.

156
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,670
Why did he turn back?

157
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,480
Was it to save me?

158
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,550
But why would he save me?

159
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,030
Does he know who I am or not?

160
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,080
What are you looking at?

161
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,170
You're that maid I just met, right?

162
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:36,960
Yes, I am.

163
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,880
Well, not exactly.

164
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,960
May I ask if you're here to
deflower a maiden

165
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,760
or to have a clandestine affair?

166
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,450
Aren't you afraid of me?

167
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,930
Why should I be afraid of you?

168
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,590
Don't all you humans
fear being devoured by demons?

169
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,700
How handsome of you.

170
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,790
You don't strike me
as a man-eating monster.

171
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,550
Besides,

172
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,630
if you wanted to eat humans,
you would've done so already,

173
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,390
instead of browsing around over there.

174
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,390
Interesting.

175
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,680
You're still as good-looking as ever.

176
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,500

00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,070
What?

179
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,610
Xiao Yao didn't exist a hundred years ago.

180
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,720
I guess I'll have to acquaint with him

181
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,450
using the identity of Ning'an.

182
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,080

about what just happened

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,670
Has the princess's bedchamber

192
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,530
been searched?

193
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,480
Not yet.

194
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,990
Princess Ning'an

195
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,080
is being confined...

196
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,470
for defending demons.

197
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,700
Don't leave!

198
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,930
-Let go.
-You...

199
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,640
No way.

200
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,790
-Let go.
-I won't!

201
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,720
Let go of me!

202
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,630
As my father says,

203
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,670
persistent pursuit wears down
the strongest resistance.

204
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,440
I must hold onto you.

205
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:48,960
Let go!

206
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,600
No way!

207
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,220
Is this the etiquette

208
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,880
the human emperor taught you?

209
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,620
Yes.

210
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,100
Hong Ye!

211
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,580
How do you know my name?

212
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,150
I...

213
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,870
Tell me.

214
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,240
I dreamed of you.

215
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,640
A man who looked exactly like you

216
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,860
in my dream told me he was named Hong Ye.

217
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,690
I don't know how that happened.

218
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,630
Even as a royal princess,

219
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,840
I'm nothing

220
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,630
but a poor girl despised by her father

221
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,360
and regarded as a jinx by all
in the imperial palace.

222
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,100
Everyone avoids me.

223
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,930
But finally, you showed up.

224
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,920
Could you please...

225
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,120
stay and talk with me?

226
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,170
I'm confined in my bedchamber all day long

227
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,100
with no one to talk to.

228
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,850
I'm all by myself,

229
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,490
helpless and forlorn.

230
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,000
Just stay and talk with me,

231
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,750
will you?

232
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,290
You're being confined?

233
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,210
This pity play still works on him
as expected.

234
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:08,790
Yes.

235
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,310
What does it have to do with me?

236
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,060
Your Highness,

237
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,210
have you gone to bed?

238
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,930
Her Highness is sound asleep.

239
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,580
Why not come back in the morning, sir?

240
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,630
You know the consequences
of keeping Feiyu Guards

241
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,900
from carrying out duties.

242
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,550
It's inappropriate to search
Her Highness's bedchamber,

243
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,750
since she's a lady after all.

244
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,550
On top of that,

245
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,270
there's no way Her Highness
would pilfer palace artifacts.

246
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,270
We heard Her Highness
made several failed attempts

247
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,550
to leave the palace today.

248
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,600
Given our duty to safeguard the palace,

249
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,730
we must ensure Her Highness's safety.

250
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,390
Halt.

251
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,530
Her Highness is asleep.

252
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,590
You must not enter.

253
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,770
This is a matter of duty.

254
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,960
Sorry for intruding,

255
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,820
Your Highness.

256
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,000
Out of the way!

257
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,210
Your Highness!

258
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,310
An incident occurred
in the palace tonight.

259
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,970
Was Your Highness disturbed?

260
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,080
Fancy finding Your Highness

261
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,710
in the mood to play the zither

262
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,420
in the middle of the night.

263
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,020
Why haven't you knelt in my presence?

264
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,350
How bold of you!

265
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,280
You...

266
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,600
Y-You...

267
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,950
A-Are you...

268
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,420
the maid I saw earlier?

269
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,400
"Maid"?

270
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,440
Are you suggesting

271
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,610
you saw me earlier?

272
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,590
When?

273
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,070
Where?

274
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,030
I was mistaken.

275
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,350
Your Highness has spent

276
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,150
the entire day in the bedchamber

277
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,610
playing the zither

278
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,220
for stress relief.

279
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,540
We humble servants

280
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,550
are just looking for
missing palace artifacts.

281
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,610
Hope Your Highness

282
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,580
can show some understanding.

283
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,750
By breaking into my bedchamber,

284
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,480
you've completed your task, right?

285
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,310
How dare you!

286
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,130
Your Highness,

287
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,480
you're compassionate about demons.

288
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,610
Why not be compassionate about us too?

289
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,250
We're only carrying out our duties.

290
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,410
Get out!

291
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,370
Get out now!

292
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,250
This is outrageous.

293
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,960
Scram.

294
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,160
I...

295
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,130
mean no offense.

296
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,680
-Please...
-Scram!

297
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,270
They really drove me up the wall.

298
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,200
Mocui.

299
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,650
Yes.

300
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,790
Leave the room as well.

301
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,830
Nobody is allowed in

302
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,720
unless I order otherwise.

303
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,160
Yes.

304
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,680
Hong Ye!

305
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,950
Where are you hiding?

306
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,880
Hong Ye?

307
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,750
I'm here.

308
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,770
Don't break the zither.

309
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,140
Lift your foot.

310
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,900
The other one.

311
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,750
Why are you so interested in this zither?

312
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,780
[Yong'an Palace]

313
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
She's so keen on playing the zither.

314
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,350
Princess Ning'an

315
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,940
is not submissive at all,

316
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,630
as opposed to what people say.

317
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,600
She's quite something.

318
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,550
The princess still behaves
with such forbearance

319
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,010
despite years of His Majesty's neglect.

320
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,940
She's certainly no ordinary girl.

321
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,960
From now on,

322
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,050
keep close watch on Yong'an Palace.

323
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:17,510
[Yong'an Palace]

324
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,030
Yes.

325
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,810
You actually play the zither so well.

326
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,620
Why didn't you tell me before?

327
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,640
"Before"?

328
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:41,910
Oh, right.

329
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,890
We weren't exactly close before.

330
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,200
This zither

331
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,530
is what demons hold sacred,

332
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,880
named Fuxi.

333
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,510
I came to the imperial palace

334
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,240
specifically for this zither.

335
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,740
I didn't expect it to be in your chambers.

336
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,430
To restore Hong Ye's spiritual power,

337
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,880
you need only collect a single drop
of his tear-essence.

338
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,710
I'll give you the zither,

339
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,760
provided that you do me a favor.

340
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,480
What is it?

341
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,750
Alright.

342
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,890
Let's begin.

343
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,680
Don't blink.

344
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,920
Wave your hand

345
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,400
to send air to your eyes.

346
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,850
Close your eyes.

347
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,550
Try hard.

348
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,070
Harder.

349
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,070
Alright. Try again.

350
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,190
One, two, three.

351
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,440
Cry!

352
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,590
As I already told you,

353
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,660
demons don't easily cry.

354
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,440
I didn't cry
even in the face of catastrophes.

355
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,660
I've never seen my own tears myself.

356
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,410
How ridiculous.

357
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,110
This folly is a waste of time.

358
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,870
Let go.

359
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,350
You're basically robbing me.

360
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,200
This is a sacred artifact of demons.

361
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,270
You humans just seized it from us.

362
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,310
It is now simply being returned
to its rightful owner.

363
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,920
I said let go.

364
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,860
No way.

365
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,350
T-T-This zither is the only gift

366
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,150
that my father has ever given me.

367
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,730
Now you're taking it with a mere claim
that it belongs to demons.

368
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,960
You've even tried to intimidate me,

369
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,940
yelled at me, and bullied me.

370
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,640
I was left alone and miserable as a child.

371
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,340
My mother passed away early.

372
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,680
My father doesn't care about me.

373
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,730
Nobody in all the imperial palace
likes me.

374
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,270
When you appeared,

375
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,100
I thought we could be friends.

376
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,670
But as it turns out,
you only care for my zither.

377
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,610
"Friends"?

378
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,350
After knowing each other
for just a few hours,

379
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,080
do we count as friends already?

380
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,130
I've lived for thousands of years,

381
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,970
yet I've never had a friend.

382
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,270
Perfect.

383
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,290
Then I'll be your friend from now on.

384
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,430
Apart from my tears,

385
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,630
what else do you want?

386
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
As long as I can have the zither back,

387
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,160
I'll try my best to meet your needs.

388
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,030
A soft heart lies beneath
Hong Ye's tough exterior.

389
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,160
I'll have to soothe his nerves

390
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,890
while seeking another chance.

391
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,110
Great.

392
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,600
Then would you keep me company
and talk with me?

393
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,270
Tell me

394
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,860
what it's like
outside the imperial palace.

395
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,070
In terms of natural scenery,

396
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,870
Mount Qingyuan alone comprises

397
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,120
countless ridges stretching far away.

398
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,720
Mountains aside,

399
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,530
there are two major seas:

400
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,680
the West Sea and the East Sea.

401
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,140
They're vast and magnificent,

402
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,870
dotted with numerous islands.

403
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,480
Beyond those,

404
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,160
there are many mysterious places
that neither of our races have explored.

405
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,360
This boundless world

406
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,110
is endowed with abundant resources.

407
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,310
Nature gives life
to all sorts of creatures,

408
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,920
which all share in the radiant grace
of the sun and moon.

409
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,830
Not just mountains, rivers,
lakes, and seas,

410
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,030
but every living being

411
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,160
can draw energy from heaven and earth.

412
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,010
Are there pig demons
in the Demons' Valley?

413
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,640
And peony flowers that have just

414
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,720
taken human form?

415
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,480
You said you've never left
the imperial palace.

416
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,940
How do you know so much
about the demon realm?

417
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,000
Do those who have ventured
outside the palace

418
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,660
necessarily have knowledge
of the demon realm?

419
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:41,880
No.

420
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,270
So, it takes one's heart

421
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,510
rather than one's eyes

422
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
to actually learn about something.

423
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,240
For me, understanding is gained

424
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,160
by seeing things
from another's perspective.

425
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,890
All humans want to kill demons,

426
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,030
but you're quite an exception.

427
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,050
That's because I'm no ordinary human.

428
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,120
Oh no.

429
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,460
The look in his eyes...

430
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,710
He's now taking me as Princess Ning'an,

431
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,830
not Xiao Yao.

432
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,370
Don't you dare fall in love with me!

433
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,700
Nonsense!

434
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,750
I met you just a moment ago.

435
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,950
How can I possibly...

436
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,080
This is absolutely absurd.

437
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,550
Who knows what the future holds?

438
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,230
I am a human after all.

439
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,210
I'm just worried
that you might hate me for what I am.

440
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,000
In fact, since humans and demons
are both creatures of this world.

441
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,130
we shouldn't be hostile to each other.

442
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,410
Besides,

443
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,030
you've never stepped outside
the palace gates

444
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,490
or harmed the demon realm.

445
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,680
I won't hate you.

446
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,640
But if you dare offend me again...

447
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,510
I won't.

448
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,400
So we're friends now?

449
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,760
I suppose so.

450
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,690
Do you know how to make noodles?

451
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,550
I feed on the spiritual energy
of heaven and earth.

452
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,570
How would I know how to make noodles?

453
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,810
Then you're in for a treat.

454
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:17,680
Wait here for me.

455
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,740
Don't go anywhere.

456
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,870
Zhang.

457
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,720
How are the steamed buns coming along?

458
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,240
Almost ready.

459
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,550
I heard you were promoted
to the Imperial Kitchen.

460
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,640
A real blessing, wasn't it?

461
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,240
Yes, sure.

462
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,350
This transfer...

463
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,960
Your Highness!

464
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,170
Please forgive me!

465
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,640
I didn't know Your Highness's presence.

466
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,440
I crave Your Highness's pardon!

467
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,240
You may rise.

468
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,090
I'd like to do some cooking myself.

469
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,510
Have I somehow

470
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,550
failed to please Your Highness
with my cooking?

471
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,340
I beg Your Highness to give me
a second chance.

472
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
You've done nothing wrong.

473
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,270
I just feel like

474
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,800
cooking something on my own.

475
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,330
All of you may leave now.

476
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,350
Please spare us, Your Highness!

477
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,610
Once we step out of this room,

478
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,780
we and our families

479
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,520
will all lose our lives.

480
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,660
Fine then.

481
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,310
You can stay and help.

482
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,790
Thank Your Highness.

483
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,720
-Thank Your Highness.
-Get up now.

484
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,750
Is there eel?

485
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,310
Yes.

486
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,270
Any shrimps?

487
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,110
Yes.

488
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,070
Ginger and scallions?

489
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,400
Yes.

490
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,160
Soy sauce?

491
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,620
Yes, everything Your Highness needs!

492
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,680
Let's get started!

493
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,550
Debone the eel.

494
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,750
Cut it into chunks about 3 fingers wide.

495
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,880
Peel, devein, and butterfly

496
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,810
the shrimps, leaving the tails on.

497
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,440
The dough has to be moderately firm.

498
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:38,880
Got it.

499
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,070
Your Highness,

500
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,130
the wok is cleaned.

501
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,680
The Imperial Kitchen staff
are really good.

502
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,810
Look how spotlessly clean this wok is.

503
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,880
Bring the ingredients over.

504
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,540
Right away!

505
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,600
Terrific.

506
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,590
Wonderful.

507
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,070
Thanks to Your Highness's instructions,

508
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,550
I'm sure these noodles
will be a heavenly delight.

509
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,010
What a fantastic recipe
of Your Highness's!

510
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,490
Careful, Your Highness.

511
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,490
This chilli powder is rather spicy.

512
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,260
To what extent?

513
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,590
To an extreme extent.

514
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,080
Where tears will well up?

515
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,880
Yes, I guess.

516
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,600
You humans really know how to enjoy life.

517
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,300
Have some more.

518
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,130
Why stare at me?

519
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,880
You look great when you eat.

520
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,140
Is the salt level alright?

521
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,200
Yes.

522
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,330
Don't you find it spicy?

523
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,330
Is it spicy?

524
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Then it must be perfectly seasoned.

525
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,300
What are these for?

526
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,680
Could you peel the onions for me?

527
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,750
I don't know how.

528
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,680
You like eating this?

529
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,550
Yes.

530
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,400
Fine.

531
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,060
Onions are difficult to peel.

532
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,210
I'm just peeling an onion for you.

533
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,010
What's so moving about it?

534
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,430
This snuff powder is a tribute
from foreign states.

535
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,350
A sniff of it is enough

536
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,880
to have one's eyes watering
and nose running.

537
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,000
Hold still.

538
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:35,680
Yes.

539
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,480
I'll present you something fun.

540
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,600
What on earth are you doing?

541
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,230
Men rarely cry, but they do

542
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,030
when they're struck by true sorrow.

543
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,000
I don't believe

544
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,600
you have no sad story at all.

545
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,280
My father says

546
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,530
making friends

547
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,800
is the greatest joy in life

548
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,449
and worth being celebrated
with many drinks.

549
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,699
Your account of the human emperor

550
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:25,010
makes him sound less abominable now.

551
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,210
Here you are.

552
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,340
Where's yours?

553
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,460
Right here.

554
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,350
Well...

555
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,190
As a lady within palace walls,

556
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,400
I can't hold my liquor.

557
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,320
Little wine though it is,

558
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,360
it symbolizes heartfelt friendship.

559
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:42,949
Drink up!

560
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,450
You drank it up?

561
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,160
Didn't you say, "Drink up"?

562
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,060
You really can hold your liquor.

563
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,130
One more jug.

564
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,230
Tell me how many years you've lived.

565
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Several thouand.

566
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,430
I can't recall the exact number.

567
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,970
You must've been through many hardships

568
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,540
during these thousands of years, right?

569
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,690
I can't recall any either.

570
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,550
Cheers.

571
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,910
Have you ever loved a person?

572
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,110
Or a demon?

573
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,450
I'm the Demon King.

574
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,550
I've devoted all my heart to demons.

575
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,310
It has no room for anyone else.

576
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:15,880
Come on.

577
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,210
Let's have more drinks.

578
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,670
You never get drunk.

579
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:34,040
Why didn't you tell me that?

580
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,480
So much fine wine of mine has been wasted.

581
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,940
This could have lasted me quite a while.

582
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,370
You're a human princess.

583
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,230
Why stint on a few jugs of wine?

584
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,630
Yeah.

585
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,280
It's not easy to be a princess.

586
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,480
You're quite generous sometimes.

587
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,470
For example, you didn't

588
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,090
hesitate much to return Fuxi Zither to me.

589
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,650
You even asked to make friends with me.

590
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,670
Only with you.

591
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:07,800
Yeah.

592
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:11,370
I've never fraternized with another human.

593
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,240
I'd only do that with you.

594
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,820
You don't get it.

595
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,680
You're ignorant of everything.

596
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,400
You don't have spiritual power now.

597
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,880
You might catch a cold for standing

598
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,110
in the wind.

599
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,170
What...

600
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,640
What did you say?

601
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,480
The wind is rising.

602
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,860
It's getting cold.

603
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,910
I'll shield you from the chill.

604
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,710
I'll protect you.

605
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,000
Don't be afraid.

606
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,230
Now you even want to protect me?

607
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,230
Yes.

608
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,790
Why are you treating me this well?

609
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,710
You fool,

610
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,400
I'm trying hard not to do more.

611
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,440
I am...

612
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,810
a demon.

613
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,280
I know.

614
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,070
I know you are a demon—

615
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,460
one who has lived for an age,
and then another, and another.

616
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,190
You've seen humans' deceit

617
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,070
and witnessed your fellow demons
turning against each other.

618
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,190
You don't easily put trust

619
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:06,320
in humans or demons.

620
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,800
But you still hope to
restore demons' reputation

621
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,070
and clear their name.

622
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,290
You firmly believe
that you must be

623
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:16,320
responsible for all demons
since you're the Demon King.

624
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,550
That's why
you've been utterly strict with yourself,

625
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,570
why you've cultivated so hard,

626
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,890
and why you've never allowed yourself
to make a mistake.

627
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,430
Right in here,

628
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,510
you've built up

629
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:35,840
one barrier

630
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,070
after another.

631
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,730
Because you're afraid.

632
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,660
You fear being seen through.

633
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,910
You fear becoming dependent on others.

634
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,420
You fear...

635
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,280
that you'll end up getting disappointed

636
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,030
when you have expectations.

637
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,670
You also fear

638
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,280
that you'll lose something

639
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,750
after attaining it.

640
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,450
That'll only bring you more pain.

641
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,510
So,

642
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,630
each of your barriers in here

643
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,590
has a name.

644
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,520
One is called

645
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,800
"saying what you don't mean."

646
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,240
One is called

647
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,400
"never speaking your mind."

648
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,760
Another is called

649
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,670
"too"

650
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:24,590
"proud"

651
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,320
"to"

652
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,290
"confide."

653
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,170
You've said so much,

654
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,330
as if you know me well.

655
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,480
You old demon,

656
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,480
your words are mean,

657
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,280
but your heart is tender.

658
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,710
You should enjoy
the genuine love of this world.

659
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,380
To laugh

660
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,700
and cry—

661
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,240
that's the way
to complete your demon life!

662
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,510
Are you truly

663
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,960
a human princess?
