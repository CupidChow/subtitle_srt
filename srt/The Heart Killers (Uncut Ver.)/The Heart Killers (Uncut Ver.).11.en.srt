1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,770
(Previously) Lilly killed your
parents with her own hands!

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,640
That's why you need to let me help you.

3
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,970
I'll help you start over with me.

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,030
We split into two teams.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,750
Kant and I will dig up
anything we can find on Lilly.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,610
You and Style go after Keen.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,430
Her birthday is coming up.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,330
I want some young things like you
to take care of her and her friends.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,010
He didn't leave you.

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,100
Mother put a hit on him.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,620
There's no need to be afraid.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,110
You and I will be fine.

13
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,820
(Let's make a deal.)

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,460
(You get me dirt on Lilly, )

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,780
(and I'll spare your boyfriend's life.)

16
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,840
(This is why I never trusted
you to take care of these things.)

17
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,460
(I knew I was only
going to be disappointed.)

18
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,520
That's everything I can dig up on Mother.

19
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,410
Financial transactions

20
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,780
and everything about her employees…

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,080
That's all I could find.

22
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,940
You're not thinking about
stabbing us in the back, are you?

23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm not!

24
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,690
I want to get away from
her as much as you do.

25
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,390
I just want my boyfriend back.

26
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,820
I was used, just like you were.

27
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,250
Bison.

28
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,250
Go get him.

29
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,210
Nont.

30
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,280
Hold it.

31
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,290
You'll get your hug soon.

32
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
But if you're being tricky in any way,

33
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,580
I promise you'll die in each other's arms.

34
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,240
Listen to me.

35
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,730
I wanna live a good, normal life, too.

36
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,820
I want to be with the one I love.

37
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,410
I don't want anything to do
with killing people anymore.

38
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,230
All this time,

39
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,980
I just thought that

40
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,390
if I could make her happy,

41
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,450
she'd let me go.

42
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,550
But as it turned out,

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,210
no matter how good I am,

44
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,250
she just wouldn't let me go.

45
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,080
Are you okay?

46
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,680
I'm alright.

47
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,510
What are you going to do to Mother?

48
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,650
What?

49
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,440
Are you still worried about her?

50
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,820
No, I'm not.

51
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,480
I'm just going to say that
if you need my help with anything,

52
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,460
I'm here.

53
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,980
I want to see her downfall, too.

54
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,980
Whoa.

55
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,560
I almost shed tears seeing
how much they love each other.

56
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,300
I'd have done the same thing for you.

57
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,890
What are you going to
do with this information?

58
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,370
I'm going to kill her.

59
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,620
Don't do it.

60
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,730
I don't want you to kill anyone again.

61
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,480
What will you have me do?

62
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,310
Let me watch my parents'
murderer live a happy life?

63
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,100
That's not what I'm saying.

64
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,380
I just think there are other ways.

65
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,440
I want to be sure

66
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,600
that the two of you
have a chance to make it.

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,180
What do you suggest?

68
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,390
I'll talk to Captain Chris in
case there's anything he can do.

69
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,500
Will he agree to help?

70
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,500
Doesn't he want us in jail?

71
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,520
This is just a matter of negotiating.

72
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,680
Don't worry.

73
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,420
We'll do anything to keep you out of jail.

74
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,000
"The Heart Killers"
(Episode 11)

75
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,600
How was your bath, Cap?

76
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,930
What are you doing here?

77
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,410
I definitely didn't call for you.

78
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,480
And I sure as hell won't
work with you again.

79
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,210
We have a deal for you.

80
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,730
What deal?

81
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,700
Hurry up and spit it out.

82
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,000
I have to go pick my kid up from school.

83
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,200
Tell him, bud.

84
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,530
If you can keep Fadel
and Bison out of jail,

85
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,550
we'll help you get the
people behind their operation.

86
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,210
And how would you do that?

87
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,690
You couldn't even help falling in
love with them while investigating.

88
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,500
They've agreed to cooperate.

89
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,520
We'll get you the big fish you want.

90
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,310
But right now…

91
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,310
I can only give you the smaller fish.

92
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
If you can do what you say,

93
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,670
I'll do everything I can.

94
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,530
Promise is a promise, Cap.

95
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,120
Hey.

96
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,540
This is my friend, Tong.

97
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,800
He works in Khaosan.

98
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,540
He's an expert on fake ID and passports.

99
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,450
What are you doing?

100
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,300
Making you a fake passport, duh.

101
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,130
In case you need to run.

102
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,760
Didn't you say Kant made
a deal with that captain?

103
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,610
I don't trust him.

104
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,970
Cops are always looking for
ways to up their ranks, right?

105
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,420
What would I do if he had you beat?

106
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,180
Where do you think I'll
go with a fake passport?

107
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,400
You can go somewhere close by first.

108
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,880
You just have to cross a border,

109
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,160
then fly from there.

110
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,930
You call me after that and I'll fly to you.

111
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,610
We can fly back here
after everything dies down.

112
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,630
It takes 20 years for
these cases to expire.

113
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,800
We'll be old men by that time.

114
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,500
So what if we're old?

115
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,610
I'll still wanna be with you.

116
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,980
Thank you

117
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,520
for doing all this for me.

118
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,530
I don't think I love myself
half as much as you love me.

119
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,750
Trust me on this.

120
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,250
Just get this done.

121
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,390
We don't know what could happen.

122
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,860
I'll get Bison one as well.

123
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,540
This friend of yours,

124
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,400
can we trust him?

125
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,120
Of course.

126
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,810
We've been friends since high school.

127
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,720
Dude got me into nightclubs
since we were barely 20.

128
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,970
Thank you for coming
with me to pick Babe up.

129
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,800
Of course.

130
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,580
It's me who has to thank you.

131
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,740
I've always wanted a
brother, you know that?

132
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,500
It's boring being an only child.

133
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,490
I'd love you to be my family.

134
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,460
It was difficult, wasn't it?

135
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,650
I'll have to get it done quickly.

136
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,250
Sure.

137
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,980
See you.

138
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,210
Bye.

139
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,980
He's here.

140
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,200
Hey.

141
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,530
How was school?

142
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,890
Are the bullies still bothering you?

143
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,670
Not at all.

144
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,090
Who'd dare after you
kicked their butts that day?

145
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,980
You gotta tell me if the
bullies are back, alright?

146
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,850
What would you do?

147
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,340
I'll just teach them a few lessons.

148
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,500
They gotta know not to
mess with my little brother.

149
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,820
You hungry?

150
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,510
Hey, I'm gonna go to the toilet real quick.

151
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,180
Why don't you and Babe wait in the car?

152
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,410
Okay.

153
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,480
Let's go.

154
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,120
What should we have for dinner?

155
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,940
You decide.

156
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:35,620
He's a smart kid.

157
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,970
He's also a good basketball player.

158
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,110
Ladies,

159
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,980
let's make a birthday toast
for our Lady Anusara Suthasini.

160
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:50,920
Cheers.

161
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,970
Happy birthday.

162
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,520
Thank you for hosting
such a fun party for me.

163
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,730
It's been a while since I
last enjoyed myself so much.

164
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,300
I've still got another
surprise for you, ma'am.

165
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,410
You do?

166
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,210
Guys, come in.

167
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,030
These boys are taking
care of us tonight, ladies.

168
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,920
I guarantee you full satisfaction.

169
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,200
Isn't this boy…

170
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,470
the one we met at the golf club?

171
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,940
Yes.

172
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,570
I remember you saying
he's good at what he does.

173
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,660
I asked him to come.

174
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,070
Well…

175
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,840
his friend is quite cute, too.

176
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,990
If you like them,

177
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,970
they're both all yours.

178
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,820
You're the best, dear.

179
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,860
You always know just what's on my mind.

180
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,050
I promise you, after this party,

181
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,980
I'll make sure my husband
gives you a seat at the table.

182
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,100
Thank you.

183
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,670
You two.

184
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,530
Take good care of their lady.

185
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,490
She is my VIP guest.

186
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,680
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

187
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,160
Would you like some wine, ma'am?

188
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,370
Happy birthday to you.

189
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,970
I'm going to make a wish, guys.

190
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,950
I wish you more happy
and sexy years to come.

191
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,200
Thank you, dear.

192
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,590
I guess I don't have to get you a present,

193
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,460
since I already gave you two tonight.

194
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,840
I must say…

195
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,230
The present is definitely to my taste.

196
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,170
Come sit here.

197
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,840
You're good at your job.

198
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,700
Your friend is, too.

199
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
He knows just what to say.

200
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,570
It's guys like you who'll
make it in the world.

201
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,730
How so, ma'am?

202
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,060
If you have that lady bewitched,

203
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,330
you'll be well taken care of.

204
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,230
Seize the chance.

205
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,110
You don't know if it's ever
coming your way again.

206
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,250
You're right.

207
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,960
When the chance presents itself,

208
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,650
I have to grab it with both hands.

209
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,730
I won't let it slip out of my grasp.

210
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,890
Style.

211
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,080
Why don't you pour Ms. Lilly
and the lady some more wine?

212
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,570
I'm out of wine.

213
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,080
Of course.

214
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,830
You're really something!

215
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,180
Here you go.

216
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:58,770
Thanks.

217
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,000
Let's hear it for our lady.

218
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,460
Cheers!

219
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,210
Bottoms up, milady.

220
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,050
Mind if I pick a song?

221
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,570
I'd love to sing with you, Ms. Lilly.

222
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,280
No.

223
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,860
I don't sing.

224
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,530
And don't you dare try to sucker up to me.

225
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,410
You're here for her.

226
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,380
Of course.

227
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,460
Here you go.

228
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,710
You should sing us something.

229
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,060
What should I sing?

230
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,970
How about “I Love You”?

231
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,890
Oh, there it is.

232
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,330
- Sing with me, ladies.
- Of course.

233
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
What now?

234
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,040
I told you I wouldn't do
it again after the last guy.

235
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,040
This is the last hit.

236
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,440
You can go your way after that.

237
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,580
Fine.

238
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,730
How do you want me to kill them?

239
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,730
Bullet or poison?

240
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,400
I have to grab this chance with both hands.

241
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,370
I won't let it slip out of my grasp.

242
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,550
Who are you?

243
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,300
Hello.

244
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,660
I'm dating your son, Mother.

245
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,490
Dear.

246
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,300
What is all this?

247
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,290
What did you do?

248
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,180
It's nothing.

249
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,180
It's not “nothing.”

250
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,180
That's you on the screen, isn't it?

251
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
I need to go to the bathroom.

252
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,260
That's Ms. Lilly, isn't it?

253
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,100
It's her.

254
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,660
It's her.

255
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,350
It's her!

256
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,160
It's her!

257
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,690
Fadel.

258
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,630
Bison.

259
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,970
What are you doing here, my sons?

260
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,620
We're not your sons.

261
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,370
Bison, how could you say that?

262
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,560
I'm your mother.

263
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,620
Mother?

264
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,620
Mother?

265
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,620
My mother is dead!

266
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,140
You killed her.

267
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,430
You put a hit on the man I loved,

268
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,880
because you didn't
want me to quit this job,

269
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,550
and you still dare call yourself my mother?

270
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You never think of us as your sons.

271
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,970
You only keep us for your image,

272
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,900
so we could do your dirty work for you.

273
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,250
I did it with good intentions.

274
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,970
There is no point getting your heart broken
by some temporary love...

275
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,050
Shut up!

276
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,050
You never love anyone.

277
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,200
How would you know what love is?

278
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,740
She does know love.

279
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,290
But the only thing she loves is herself.

280
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,410
We will finally live our lives

281
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,420
without her.

282
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,220
Listen.

283
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,570
If I don't make it out of this mess,

284
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,900
so won't you.

285
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,360
You kill people.

286
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,360
You're getting locked up just like me!

287
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,380
Don't worry about us.

288
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,950
We have plans.

289
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:33,560
We're getting out of this profession with
your dead body as our final masterpiece!

290
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,140
Bison.

291
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,460
Can you really kill your own mother?

292
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,460
You're not my mother!

293
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,740
Hey!

294
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,180
Don't do it.

295
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,180
You promised me.

296
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,880
You promised you won't kill anyone again.

297
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,860
Don't fall for her trick.

298
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,100
You said you wanted to live a normal life.

299
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,440
It's going to happen soon.

300
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,440
But if you shoot her,

301
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,100
there won't be an ‘us.'

302
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,340
Fadel.

303
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,230
I want a future with you.

304
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,990
Just forget the past.

305
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,090
You two should go.

306
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,280
We'll deal with things here.

307
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,890
Don't worry.

308
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,970
We'll see each other again.

309
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,340
Take the gun.

310
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,310
Be careful.

311
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,290
Take this car and drive to the border.

312
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,610
Leave the car there and cross over.

313
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,610
I don't think the police
know about this yet.

314
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,610
If you go right now, there's
a chance you might make it.

315
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,620
Your passports.

316
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,840
It's your new identity.

317
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,170
Don't contact us until things die down.

318
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,510
We'll go to you when we can.

319
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:25,970
Same goes to you.

320
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,800
Don't come see me like you did last time.

321
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,650
It's too risky.

322
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,460
I'll go to you.

323
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,420
Are you two going to be fine?

324
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,940
The cops are going to come after you.

325
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,540
Don't worry.

326
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,030
I'll deal with things on my end.

327
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,810
We should focus on
making sure you two are safe.

328
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,340
Style.

329
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,070
Listen to me.

330
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,070
If they torture you for information,

331
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,550
don't put up with it.

332
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,940
Just confess.

333
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,560
Don't you dare get hurt, you hear me?

334
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,450
Don't worry.

335
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,220
I won't spit anything
out even if they kill me.

336
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,910
Style, I'm being serious.

337
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,750
They really could kill you.

338
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,590
You don't have to worry.

339
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,970
I have a knack for surviving.

340
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:12,680
Fine.

341
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,720
Kant.

342
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,850
I never told you this,

343
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,260
but thank you for
taking care of my brother.

344
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,680
No problem.

345
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,930
I gotta love you when I
love your brother, right?

346
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,770
You should get going.

347
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,180
You'll get there in the
morning if you leave now.

348
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,610
Stop!

349
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:48,840
Cap.

350
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,610
Where do you think you're going?

351
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,240
Everyone calm down.

352
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:02,790
I knew you'd help them run.

353
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,240
Just let them go.

354
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,250
You got Ruerat and Lilly.

355
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,270
You know these two were being used.

356
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,610
That's no excuse.

357
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,740
They killed people.

358
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,450
Just hand them over,

359
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,150
and you'll be spared.

360
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,300
Fine, then.

361
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,350
If I don't make it,

362
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,340
you don't make it.

363
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,030
What are you saying?

364
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,670
You bribed a school administrator
to get your kid into that school.

365
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,830
I have proof, too.

366
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,830
Here's a gift.

367
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:54,800
I hope you take good care of my son.

368
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,490
Are you blackmailing me?

369
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,270
You dare?

370
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,150
Blackmailing is a strong word.

371
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,810
Let's just say we're negotiating.

372
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,290
If this video gets out,

373
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,940
your reputation as a police captain

374
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,770
and your dream of getting a promotion

375
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,600
are gone.

376
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
I can make a big deal out of it, Cap.

377
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,400
I can't let them walk free.

378
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:31,980
All I can do is help reduce the sentence.

379
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,100
How many years?

380
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,460
Five.

381
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,620
No.

382
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,390
I won't accept anything
less than their freedom.

383
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,300
But we'll take it.

384
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,340
Kant.

385
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,470
I'm done running.

386
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,350
I'm tired.

387
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,900
Fadel and I aren't gonna make it anyway.

388
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,200
Five years behind bars…

389
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,290
That's still better than
running all our lives.

390
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,330
If it has to be like that,

391
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,750
I'll never get to really live.

392
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,000
Hey.

393
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,760
You don't know if these
cops will keep their word.

394
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,400
What'd you do if the
final sentence is death?

395
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,010
He's got a point.

396
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,440
How can I trust you?

397
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,660
I never go back on my word.

398
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,920
If that's your decision,

399
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,770
I'll take it.

400
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,980
You heard them, Cap.

401
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,970
Can I ask you one thing?

402
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,610
What now?

403
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,970
Give me one day.

404
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,110
You can come get them after that.

405
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,600
What are you planning now?

406
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,490
I'm not planning anything.

407
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,830
I just want to spend
time with the man I love

408
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,680
before we part.

409
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,600
Please, Captain.

410
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,110
For the sake of this old colleague.

411
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,980
I'll delete every evidence
I have of your bribery.

412
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,440
Fine.

413
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,460
You bring them to me tomorrow.

414
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,330
If you don't,

415
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,370
the next time I see them, they're dead.

416
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,970
Tomorrow.

417
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,300
Won't you eat something?

418
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,600
It's your favorite dish.

419
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,760
I can't stomach it.

420
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,950
I'm sorry this is all I could do for you.

421
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,140
What are you apologizing for?

422
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,700
You did your best.

423
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,580
I knew how hard you tried.

424
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:48,600
It's all the consequences
of my own actions, anyway.

425
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,920
I really did all those bad things.

426
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,100
I deserve this.

427
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,960
I'm not sad because I'm going to jail.

428
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,510
I'm just sad because

429
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,110
I won't get to be with the man I love.

430
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,300
God really has some weird
sense of humor, doesn't he?

431
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,450
Right when I met a good guy,

432
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,970
when I finally found a good love,

433
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,420
I'm going to jail.

434
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,970
I think it'd hurt less
if someone just shot me dead right now.

435
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,460
I won't let you die.

436
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,250
You're staying with me.

437
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,400
Five years will go by in a flash.

438
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,340
I'll wait for you.

439
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,450
I'll be okay if you won't.

440
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,920
I said I'll wait.

441
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,330
Don't you trust me?

442
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,150
We only have one day.

443
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,710
Let's not spend it being sad.

444
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,870
Let's do something that
will become good memories.

445
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,400
Right?

446
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,700
Why do you look even sadder?

447
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,990
You tell me not to be sad,
but you look pretty bummed.

448
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,060
Let's eat.

449
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,380
I'm not sad at all.

450
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,800
I just have something in my eyes.

451
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,290
Still bummed, aren't you?

452
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,980
You did your best.

453
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:06,400
If I found out earlier, you
wouldn't have to go to jail.

454
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,200
Style, listen to me.

455
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,280
I chose to walk down this path.

456
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,260
I knew what was coming
for me from the get-go.

457
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,570
Either I get locked up,

458
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,460
or I die.

459
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,560
Five years in jail is so much better.

460
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,680
I don't want you gone for even a day.

461
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,970
I have to take
responsibility for what I did.

462
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,660
I can't change the past.

463
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,980
This could be a chance
for me to start over.

464
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,600
I want to be a good man

465
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,600
who deserves everything you do for me.

466
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,240
We have one day together.

467
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,300
I want to make the most out of it.

468
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:19,400
What you want to do,
where to go, what to eat,

469
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,840
just let me know.

470
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,200
I'll take you anywhere.

471
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,900
I don't want anything like that.

472
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,440
I just want to do something simple.

473
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,700
Go where we feel comfortable,

474
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,700
with just you and me.

475
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,290
I'll let you pick

476
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,970
what you want to do.

477
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,120
Okay, then.

478
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,800
Can we start by

479
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,490
hugging you for 10 minutes straight?

480
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,060
Take your time.

481
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,970
'Morning, Dad.

482
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,810
Hey.

483
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,970
Good morning.

484
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,330
Oh, hey.

485
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,590
You're here often now, aren't you?

486
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,590
This ain't no hotel, you know?

487
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,790
He's not here often enough, more like.

488
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,220
We're going to have
breakfast at the market.

489
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,470
What are you talking about?

490
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,470
Just have breakfast at home.

491
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,980
Fadel, sit down.

492
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,660
Oh, but I don't want to impose.

493
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,180
You're not imposing.

494
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,970
You're dating Style.

495
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,280
You're as good as being my family.

496
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,300
Sit down, you two.

497
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,690
You know what, Dad?

498
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,410
This guy makes the most
delish burgers out there!

499
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,360
Oh, you jerk.

500
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,990
Are you saying my cooking
doesn't compare to his now or what?

501
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,500
Next thing I know I'll be
running this place alone.

502
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,500
As if I'd ever leave you alone.

503
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,440
Who's going to annoy you if I'm not here?

504
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,210
Well, Fadel.

505
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,350
What are your plans for the future?

506
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,880
Are you going to flip burgers
for the rest of your life?

507
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,280
It's my favorite thing to do.

508
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,280
I guess I'll keep doing it.

509
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,980
That's good.

510
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,980
Doing what you love is good.

511
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,970
If things go well, just
open another franchise.

512
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,640
No one wants your business advice, old man.

513
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,330
Just focus on keeping
this place up and running.

514
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,360
Hey, you gotta plan
these things out thoroughly

515
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,530
if you want to keep seeing each other.

516
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,240
And since gay marriage is legal now,

517
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,320
you two should definitely do that.

518
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,780
Don't jump the gun, old man.

519
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,190
We just started dating.

520
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,050
Whatever.

521
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,440
If you're getting
married, do it before I die.

522
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,310
Give me five years.

523
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,860
I just want to save up enough money

524
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,260
and I'll come talk to you, Dad.

525
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,390
Hey, look who just called me Dad.

526
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,220
Bold, I'll give you that.

527
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,120
Let's have breakfast.

528
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,760
Hey, this is yesterday's
leftovers, isn't it?

529
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,970
Why are you taking me here?

530
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,300
You said you missed your childhood.

531
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,960
I thought this might help you relive it.

532
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,680
Let's have fun today.

533
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,020
Can you forget for a second
what's happening tomorrow?

534
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,360
Be with me today.

535
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:14,840
Please.

536
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,120
Let's go inside.

537
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,840
Come on.

538
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,460

539
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:28,320

I love history.

542
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,570
My parents always took me to museums.

543
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,280
I love dinosaurs as well.

♪ Want to face the lessons ♪

547
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,090
Besides northern lights hunting with you,

548
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,700
I have another place I want to go with you.

549
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,800
Where?

550
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,340
Mount Bromo in Indonesia.

551
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,610
Really?

552
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,160
I want to go there, too.

553
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,040
I'm not sure I'm fit enough
for that hike, though.

554
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,640
If you can't, I'll carry
you all the way up there.

555
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,660
That was where my dad
asked my mom to marry him.

556
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,480
That's so romantic.

557
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,860
What are you gonna do?

558
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,100
Are you following in your parents' footstep
and asking me to marry you there?

559
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,210
Hey.

560
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,210
What are you doing?

561
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,250
You think I'm proposing?

562
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,210
Who knows?

563
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,920
You always surprise me.

564
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,980
I have every right to assume, you know?

565
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:58,470
What if I… really am proposing?

566
00:39:58,890 --> 00:39:59,980
Will you say yes?

567
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,580
Even if you asked me now,

568
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,580
it'd be five years before we
could have our wedding night.

569
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,220
Can you wait that long?

570
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:14,230
Well, then, how about we just skip to that?

571
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,160
What are you guys doing?

572
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,720
We're taking a look at this thing.

573
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,360
Don't you guys get hot?

574
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,510
It's hot in here.

575
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,540
You should go before it's erupted.

576
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,980
You don't wanna die
like the people of Pompeii.

577
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:38,900
Let's go.

578
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,200
Hurry! Run!

579
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,500
What the hell was that?

580
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,500
Alright. Let's go, then.

581
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,530
Where the hell did he come from?

582
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,690
Totally killed the vibe!

583
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,070
Go!

584
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,000
No!

585
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,630
I surrender.

586
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,410
I surrender!

587
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,730
I'm tired.

588
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,480
Let's take a break.

589
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,930
Did you have fun?

590
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,400
Yeah.

591
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,300
I'm really tired.

592
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,210
Hey.

593
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,740
You!

594
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:47,530
Hey.

595
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,980
Are you gonna be so
sweet to me like this all day?

596
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,390
Yeah.

597
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,410
Get ready for that.

598
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,590
You'll get a toothache just from this.

599
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,880
Looking forward to it.

600
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:02,840
It's too bad I didn't get to see
your sweet side from the get-go.

601
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,840
You wasted all that time
being so mean to me.

602
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,830
Who'd want to be sweet
with an annoying guy?

603
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,490
You're just like Bison.

604
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,850
You always find something
good in a bad guy.

605
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,330
I believe people can change.

606
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,970
I love a mission.

607
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:31,940
You'll be my… Project Boyfriend.

608
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:36,600
I'll help you turn over a new leaf.

609
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,160
You think this Project
Whatever of yours is gonna work?

610
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,720
You think I can change?

611
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,960
You tell me if it works

612
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:51,980
when you let me do this to you.

613
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:57,290
Stop it.

614
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:23,090
When I was a kid, I wanted to
be an astronaut or an astronomer.

615
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,600
I was so obsessed with outer space.

616
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,600
I could recite all the
names of the planets.

617
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,190
Hey.

618
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,870
You know how there's
zero gravity in outer space?

619
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:42,080
But if two astronauts who got sent up there

620
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,140
happened to fall in
love and wanted to kiss,

621
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,400
how would they do it?

622
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:56,730
They would float… into a kiss.

623
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:57,770
Show me.

624
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:03,520
Hey, guys.

625
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,890
What now, kid?

626
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:10,310
Did you know I've been to outer space?

627
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,060
You did?

628
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:13,110
How did you do it?

629
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:19,390
I was the dog put on the Sputnik 2.

630
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,720
Don't tell me your name is Laika!

631
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,960
Yes!

632
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,260
But how did you know?

633
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,260
I read, duh.

634
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:34,330
Did you know Laika died in outer space?

635
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,820
Dad never told me that part…

636
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,970
It's alright.

637
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,580
Laika did the world a great
service in space studies.

638
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,700
You didn't die for nothing.

639
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,390
Dad…

640
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,840
Dad! Dad!

641
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:52,990
Come on.

642
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,610
Why'd you tease him like that?

643
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,490
It's all facts!

644
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,520
And I couldn't help it.

645
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,240
He kept interrupting us.

646
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,240
I don't have much time, you know?

647
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,590
Let's go.

648
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,960
Hey.

649
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,460
Why is your name on this tombstone?

650
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,290
I had it done for myself.

651
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,290
No one knows this.

652
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,780
Not even Bison.

653
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:36,730
Why would you do that?

654
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,340
I live my life on the line.

655
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:45,090
I could die at any moment.

656
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,280
No matter how I die,

657
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,490
I just know I'll be doing it alone.

658
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:51,970
So I had this done.

659
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:54,980
I'll write it down later,

660
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,340
but just bury me here when I die.

661
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:59,490
No need for a funeral.

662
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,680
It's not like I have any
family who'd mourn me.

663
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:08,640
The only person who would cry for me
would be Bison.

664
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,960
Your boyfriend is literally
standing right here.

665
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,040
I'll be mourning.

666
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,610
I'll make sure your grave is well decorated

667
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,980
with flowers and burgers on the daily.

668
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,540
And when I die,

669
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,000
I'll be lying right next to you.

670
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,000
I won't let you get lonely.

671
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,530
Even when we were ghosts,

672
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:51,290
I'd still be yapping your ears off.

673
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,020
I'm taking you here

674
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,680
because I want to tell you that…

675
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:09,100
Ever since I met you,

676
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,960
I've been thinking less
and less about death.

677
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,650
You've made me realize that

678
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,020
I want to keep on living
just to spend time with you.

679
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,420
That's the most romantic thing I've heard.

680
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:34,000
I make you want to keep living?

681
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,290
When you talk to me like that,

682
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,570
it's totally irresistible, you know?

683
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,810
You're making me feel like I'm being lame.

684
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,020
You're just romantic in
an oddly specific way.

685
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,020
Who the hell takes their
boyfriend to their grave?

686
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:52,470
I doubt I'll ever find
another one like you.

687
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,050
Don't die on me just yet.

688
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:01,120
Stay and be weirdly romantic
with me for a very long time.

689
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:30,450
Do you know why it's called
the “Milky Way” in English?

690
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,100
Why?

691
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,640
Tell me.

692
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:38,460
In Greek mythology,

693
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:41,570
Hercules, the son of Zeus who was
born from a mortal, was taken in by Zeus.

694
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:45,780
Zeus didn't know how to
feed the half-mortal baby,

695
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,000
so he sneakily let the baby
drink from Hera's breast.

696
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:51,320
While the baby was feeding,

697
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:52,940
the goddess Hera was startled awake,

698
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:55,580
puzzled as to what toddler
was feeding from her.

699
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:57,210
She pushed the baby away in shock

700
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,580
and sprayed milk all across the sky.

701
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,580
That's where the name
“Milky Way” came from.

702
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:03,710
Are you for real?

703
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,350
I feel like you're pulling my leg.

704
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:06,230
It's true.

705
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,770
I read that somewhere.

706
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,850
We call it “The White
Elephant Path” in Thai, right?

707
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:13,230
It comes from the belief that
white elephants are from heaven.

708
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:15,420
Each culture calls it differently,

709
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,750
depending on what their beliefs are.

710
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,440
Alright, alright.

711
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,720
I believe you now that you used
to be obsessed with astronomy.

712
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:33,690
I want to go stargazing with you everywhere

713
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,120
and listen to you tell me these stories.

714
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,600
I've got a lot more to tell.

715
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:44,400
Can you really wait?

716
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,290
Of course I can.

717
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,880
Five years is no time at all.

718
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,060
Time flies these days, don't you notice?

719
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:02,050
Do you want me to buy a
star and name it after you?

720
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:04,810
Whenever you look
up, you'll think about me.

721
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,800
I don't need such a grand gesture.

722
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,050
I don't want to be up there in the sky.

723
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:15,150
I want to be right in here.

724
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,870
What are you doing?

725
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,550
Well…

726
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:35,150
I gotta make sure no kids
are getting in our way again.

727
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:47,970
There's no one around.

728
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,750
Show me the Milky Way.

729
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,320
You're funny.

730
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:09,840
Look at that.

731
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:10,460
There.

732
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,150
I chose to tell my stories to strangers

733
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,100
because I didn't want to be
an emotional burden to anyone.

734
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,640
What do you mean?

735
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:38,930
When you don't know them,

736
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,410
you don't really care
about them much, do you?

737
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,660
I don't want anyone to worry about me.

738
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:53,050
But I just learned what
it's like to share my sorrow.

739
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,200
I don't feel so sad anymore.

740
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,860
I'm happier.

741
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,020
You're way too deep, you know that?

742
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,970
I personally think I have no layers at all.

743
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,020
I'm pretty boring.

744
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:10,530
No layers?

745
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,050
But you're so sensitive.

746
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,310
You just mask it all under your jokes.

747
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:19,970
Everyone has their own way
of dealing with sadness, right?

748
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:23,090
You pretend it doesn't hurt.

749
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:25,230
I bury it under my positivity.

750
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:30,740
But I don't want you to think
you're a burden to anyone.

751
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:34,700
Whatever you're feeling,

752
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,300
I'm here if you need to dump it on someone.

753
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,200
Whatever I'm feeling?

754
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,220
Whatever you're feeling.

755
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,640
If I get sad?

756
00:53:58,330 --> 00:53:59,720
I'll cry with you.

757
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,610
I'll wipe your tears.

758
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,980
If I'm happy?

759
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,440
I'll laugh with you.

760
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,840
If I…

761
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:21,480
I'll help.

762
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,830
I won't get to kiss you
like this for five long years.

763
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,320
Let me get my fill of it for the future.

764
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:40,610
Did we come here just so
you can teach me to cook?

765
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,460
It's what I want to do.

766
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,780
I want to cook with my lover.

767
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,400
Do what I love with who I love.

768
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,880
It makes me happy.

769
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:01,550
I've actually opened so
many different restaurants.

770
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:05,920
Thai food, Japanese, Korean, Italian…

771
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:08,460
But as it turned out,

772
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,460
I like this one the best.

773
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:16,280
I like it so much that I even thought
when I quit being a hired gun,

774
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,340
I might even do this seriously.

775
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,990
Who'd have thought…

776
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:36,660
Hey.

777
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,340
You want me to run this
place while you're gone?

778
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,500
Just focus on your garage.

779
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,370
I don't want this place to
go out of business just yet.

780
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,900
Oh, you underestimate me.

781
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:53,050
With a little training,
I can do it, you know?

782
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:03,980
You don't need to.

783
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:12,360
Here. For you.

784
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,920
But you love it so much, don't you?

785
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,340
That's exactly why

786
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:22,770
I want you to take care of it.

787
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,260
Come on.

788
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,390
I'll put it here.

789
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,110
Okay.

790
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,050
Looks good.

791
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,100
It suits you.

792
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:57,850
It feels really safe
when you're by my side.

793
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,500
What is that, all of a sudden?

794
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:03,840
Gives me the creeps.

795
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,540
Now start cutting those onions.

796
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:06,740
Wow.

797
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,940
I want our last dinner to be special.

798
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:15,170
Don't say “last dinner.”

799
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:18,630
We'll be together when
you're out of prison.

800
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,630
I don't know what the future holds.

801
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,470
I just want to make
the most out of tonight.

802
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,770
Let's plan our life, then.

803
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,340
What do you mean?

804
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,380
Let's plan how we're
going to make this work

805
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,600
while you're in prison.

806
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:36,500
How are we going to do that?

807
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,900
You'll be here while I'm there.

808
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,450
Style…

809
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,970
You don't have to wait for me.

810
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:47,840
Just do what you want to do.

811
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:52,100
Think of our time together…

812
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,980
as a fun period of your life.

813
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,660
No.

814
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,970
It doesn't have to be a big deal.

815
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,820
I can visit you every week.

816
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,320
I'll just be a burden to you.

817
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,670
What burden?

818
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,820
I'm willing to take it.

819
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,740
At first, you will.

820
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,900
But you won't always be able to.

821
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:20,400
You're out here, you will
meet a whole lot of people.

822
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:22,860
Are you…

823
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:25,980
scared of being forgotten?

824
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,950
What else can I do?

825
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,580
When I'm in there, all I'll do is think…

826
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,070
if you forget me already.

827
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,980
How could I forget you?

828
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,560
You're my first boyfriend.

829
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:55,910
You dragged me out of this place.

830
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:57,640
We ran away from gunshots hand in hand.

831
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,430
We slept together in the woods

832
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:02,700
and kissed in the ocean.

833
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,980
Those aren't something
I'll have with just anyone.

834
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:11,300
I can't forget you.

835
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,920
I'll believe you.

836
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,880
Let's just eat.

837
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,610
I'm getting hungry.

838
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:35,540
Alright.

839
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:37,810
Here.

840
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,330
Let me do it, too.

841
01:01:57,970 --> 01:01:58,570
Is it good?

842
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:07,490
I won't ever forget the taste.

843
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,060
It's messy.

844
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:34,330
It's good, huh?

845
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:44,920
Give me a tattoo.

846
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:47,960
No way.

847
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,510
How could I?

848
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,820
I only had one lesson.

849
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,490
You can do it.

850
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,340
I trust you.

851
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,810
No can do.

852
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,810
I don't even trust myself.

853
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,810
Do you want an ugly tattoo or something?

854
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,050
I don't mind.

855
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,530
Even if it comes out ugly,

856
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:08,460
it's going to be something
to remember you by.

857
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,180
You need to give me one, too.

858
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:26,320
I gotta look menacing
with a cool tattoo in prison.

859
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:27,730
Sure thing.

860
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:29,430
What tattoo do you want?

861
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,990
Puffin.

862
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,510
Puffin?

863
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,510
That's not menacing at all.

864
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:40,400
On the contrary, I think
it'll only attract admirers.

865
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,280
Who knows?

866
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,740
Maybe I'll scare them off.

867
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:46,450
If you're getting a puffin tattoo,

868
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,890
then I want…

869
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:51,980
a penguin tattoo.

870
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:58,600
Don't get mad at me when it's ugly.

871
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:00,890
I won't.

872
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,540
But I'll get even with
you, even if in prison.

873
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:13,760
Apply that first.

874
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:53,980
It's pretty.

875
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,770
You can easily steal my job.

876
01:04:56,790 --> 01:04:58,120
Don't exaggerate.

877
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:59,580
The lines aren't even that good.

878
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:02,240
But I love it.

879
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,640
Imperfections are
charming in their own way.

880
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:19,640
I'm looking forward to making
more tattoo stories with you.

881
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,560
The story of you and me

882
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:28,660
will be etched on my skin forever.

883
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,090
I'll miss you, Kant.

884
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:39,600
Get up here.

885
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:26,560
Hey.

886
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:31,970
I didn't know 24 hours would go by so fast.

887
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:38,670
Take care of yourself.

888
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,020
Don't drive too fast.

889
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:44,110
Don't drive when you've been drinking,

890
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,580
and don't be on your phone.

891
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,870
Eat something nutritious
every once in a while.

892
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,250
I know.

893
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:52,640
Be patient when you're in there.

894
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,280
Let things slide when
someone tries to mess with you.

895
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:57,370
There are criminals way
more ruthless than you in there.

896
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,690
They're not kind like you.

897
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,140
Be patient until you get out of there.

898
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:04,500
Are you telling me not to put up a fight?

899
01:07:05,348 --> 01:07:06,177
I'm not stopping you.

900
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,982
I know I can't stop you.

901
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,980
You're a fighter, after all.

902
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:14,268
Just don't die in there.

903
01:07:17,942 --> 01:07:19,217
You, too, alright?

904
01:07:19,737 --> 01:07:21,560
Don't get on people's nerves.

905
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:24,657
Stay alive and come
out of there in one piece.

906
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,245
What?

907
01:07:26,268 --> 01:07:29,977
I've gotten way more mellow
since I met you, you know?

908
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,440
Let me know if you need anything.

909
01:07:39,811 --> 01:07:41,091
I'll send you money.

910
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:43,771
I'll visit all the time.

911
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:46,491
You don't have to.

912
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,674
The prison is way too far from your house.

913
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,211
Once a month is often enough.

914
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:54,988
No.

915
01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:00,354
If I could go every day, I would.

916
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:02,120
Don't.

917
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,640
Just focus on working and living your life.

918
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,480
No.

919
01:08:07,508 --> 01:08:08,914
You can't stop me.

920
01:08:09,828 --> 01:08:11,820
I've got my future planned out for you.

921
01:08:15,662 --> 01:08:16,200
Alright?

922
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:23,365
Take care, alright?

923
01:08:24,211 --> 01:08:25,228
Of course.

924
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,205
Time to go.

925
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,977
Take care of him, will you?

926
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:43,005
Of course.

927
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,634
He's my pal.

928
01:08:44,657 --> 01:08:45,805
I can never leave him.

929
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,674
Take care of Kant, Style.

930
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,154
Make sure he eats properly.

931
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,617
I'll keep an eye on him.

932
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:05,342
Bye.

933
01:09:17,782 --> 01:09:18,405
Bye.

934
01:09:52,611 --> 01:09:53,308
We're good to go.

935
01:10:07,217 --> 01:10:08,165
You okay?

936
01:11:02,571 --> 01:11:03,500
It's okay, bud.

937
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:05,702
It's okay.

938
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:23,485
(Next Week)
You sure you're alright in there?

939
01:11:23,502 --> 01:11:24,600
Of course.

940
01:11:24,834 --> 01:11:25,994
Don't worry.

941
01:11:26,228 --> 01:11:27,828
I miss you.

942
01:11:27,862 --> 01:11:30,851
Come visit when you miss me.

943
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,645
I can't take this anymore!

944
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,771
I can only see him, but can't touch him.

945
01:11:34,794 --> 01:11:36,428
It feels like he's even further away.

946
01:11:36,748 --> 01:11:37,982
I have an idea.

947
01:11:38,222 --> 01:11:38,851
What?

948
01:11:39,091 --> 01:11:41,028
You want me to put you in jail?

949
01:11:41,428 --> 01:11:42,611
Hey, pretty boy.

950
01:11:42,634 --> 01:11:43,588
You looking for trouble?

951
01:11:45,874 --> 01:11:47,580
We have to be here for five years.

952
01:11:47,977 --> 01:11:49,194
Get used to it.

953
01:11:49,217 --> 01:11:51,994
Seeing you makes me happy.
