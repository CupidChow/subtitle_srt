1
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,820
Hello, sir.

2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,510
What are you looking for tonight?

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,710
We’ve got several newcomers this week.

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,700
Some of them just got here, even.

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,370
Whatever it is you want, I’m sure we have it.

6
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,370
88, you’re up.

7
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,170
Your drink, sir.

8
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,710
You must have been tired
after a long day on the road.

9
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,360
Sure am.

10
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:05,990
Traffic was bad today.

11
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,220
It always is.

12
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,400
My leg’s so worn out from hitting the brake all day.

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,700
Why don’t you let me…

14
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,210
give you a little massage?

15
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,710
Not too fast, sir.

16
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,570
Let’s wait for the food to arrive.

17
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,810
We can go all out with no interruptions after.

18
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,800
Sing with me, then.

19
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,270
How are you feeling?

20
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,970
It feels so good.

21
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,579
Do you like it rough or do you
prefer something gentle?

22
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,710
I don’t mind both ways.

23
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,820
I think your food is here.

24
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,370
Go take a look.

25
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,910
You’re always right on time, man.

26
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:17,130
What?

27
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,630
You two know each other?

28
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,829
We do.

29
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,280
A bit too well, I suppose.

30
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,820
Who the hell are you people?

31
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,810
We’re the guys who’ll take you to heaven, sir.

32
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,530
How many times did I tell you

33
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,460
not to dress up on the job?

34
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,460
You stand out like a sore thumb.

35
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,910
But I like it.

36
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,510
We’re off duty so I can just be myself.

37
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,750
Not everyone wants to dress like
it’s always a funeral like you do.

38
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,010
Well, black makes me blend in easily.

39
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,200
If you sneak around in the color you’re wearing,

40
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,800
people would recognize you right away.

41
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,950
What’d you do if you got caught?

42
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,370
Don’t worry about me.

43
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,910
Worry about your job.

44
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,360
Did you check the security camera?

45
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,010
I always get my job done, don’t I?

46
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,770
’Kay.

47
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,140
I’m off, then.

48
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,170
It’s Friday.

49
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,350
I’ve got plans.

50
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:33,980
Plans?

51
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,830
You going out?

52
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,480
We literally just clocked off.

53
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,220
Shouldn’t you be laying low?

54
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,909
Are you my brother or my father, Fadel?

55
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,230
You nitpick too much.

56
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,990
Because you give me so many reasons to.

57
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,270
The streets are littered with cops out there

58
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,570
and you don’t give a damn.

59
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,810
What’d you do if you got caught?

60
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,060
Have I been?

61
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,030
I never make mistakes, do I?

62
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,270
I do what I have to do.

63
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,300
Now I want to do what I want to.

64
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,040
Can’t I just live a little?

65
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,710
Fine.

66
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,710
Just be careful.

67
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,630
’Kay.

68
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,510
Bye.

69
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,840
My ride’s here.

70
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:17,890
Hey.

71
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,770
Hit it.

72
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,270
Bye-bye.

73
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,130
[OLD FART]

74
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,120
Hey.

75
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,740
What’d you think of this tattoo?

76
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,830
Ain’t it a classic?

77
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,220
Are. You. Listening. To. Me?

78
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,510
The hell’d you do that for?

79
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,610
Should I get this tattoo?

80
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,610
It’s not bad.

81
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,080
I can make it look better, though.

82
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,909
It looks a bit too cartoonish here.

83
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,640
I guess.

84
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,370
What’s with you tonight?

85
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,560
You’re with your best friend,

86
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,920
but you keep looking around
for your next body count.

87
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,350
Aren’t you a damn player?

88
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,500
For real, man.

89
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,830
Quit it with your one-night-stands
and just get a real lover.

90
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,620
But I’m not looking to commit.

91
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,770
I’ve got my hands full as it is.

92
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,810
I’d rather someone I can just chat with,

93
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,320
someone I can count to split in the morning.

94
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,210
It’s easier that way.

95
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,460
But you’re in no position to call me out

96
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,670
when you’ve been playing around just the same.

97
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,610
This is why we’re friends, man.

98
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,930
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

99
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,360
I’m just making sure
I’m still at the top of the game.

100
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,900
That guy’s cute.

101
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,670
Which one?

102
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,210
The shortie in red.

103
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,110
What are you waiting for, then?

104
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,800
Go for it.

105
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,760
Be right back.

106
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,570
Left behind, once again.

107
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,510
Shift the weight to your other leg just a bit,

108
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,510
and I bet you could have made it a strike just now.

109
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,100
Thank you…

110
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,670
for the unsolicited advice.

111
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,980
Feels like I just got politely told to get lost.

112
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,230
I’m sorry.

113
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,100
I’ll be straightforward.

114
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,820
I was just making small talk

115
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,030
because I thought you’re cute.

116
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,530
See, that ain’t so hard, right?

117
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,170
No need to be patronizing.

118
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,620
Weren’t you trying to teach me how to hit a strike?

119
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,330
A bit close, huh?

120
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,650
Thought you wanted to throw a strike.

121
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:07,980
See?

122
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,010
Alright.

123
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,920
I’ll admit you’re good at bowling.

124
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,620
Anything else to show off?

125
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,620
Why don’t you come with me and find out?

126
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:18,940
Your place?

127
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,660
Can’t. I live with my little brother.

128
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,400
How about your place?

129
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,110
Can’t. I live with my big brother.

130
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,620
We’ll book a hotel, then.

131
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,970
Okay.

132
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:31,890
Deal.

133
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,380
(Sorry, man.)

134
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,640
(I’ll see you at your garage.)

135
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,500
(The tattoo’s on me.)

136
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,950
Oh, bastard.

137
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,310
Shit!

138
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,360
Ugh, shit.

139
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,250
You alright?

140
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,510
I am.

141
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,210
My car isn’t.

142
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,510
Were you distracted or something?

143
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,920
I’m sorry.

144
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,330
Are you drunk?

145
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,610
I’m not.

146
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,510
I literally had one can of beer.

147
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,620
Hey, that’s already one too many.

148
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,470
You shouldn’t even be behind the wheel.

149
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,160
But I’m really not drunk.

150
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,160
I was just texting my friend.

151
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,260
Texting?

152
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,430
You were on the phone while driving?

153
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,050
Be considerate for everyone else
on the road, will you?

154
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,760
Do you even have a driver’s license?

155
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,010
Of course I do!

156
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,780
Will you calm down?

157
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,500
How about this?

158
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,720
I’ll take responsibility for your—

159
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,550
It’s okay.

160
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,910
I got it.

161
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,230
No can do.

162
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,890
It ain’t like me to hit and run.

163
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,280
I’ve fixed the same model before.

164
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,400
I’ll get that tail light replaced

165
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,510
and throw a free checkup in for you.

166
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,100
Let me see.

167
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,200
Are you a mechanic?

168
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,100
Yeah.

169
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,170
My garage is called Style Auto.

170
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,430
Look it up.

171
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,370
Will you just let me take a look at the damage?

172
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,680
What’s your problem?

173
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,040
Let me assess the damage.

174
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,200
How else would I repair it?

175
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,980
The parts for your model aren’t easy
to come by, you know?

176
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:20,770
Listen.

177
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,320
I’m in a rush here.

178
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,330
I don’t have time for this.

179
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,620
I’ll bring it to your garage
when I can later, alright?

180
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,550
Come on.

181
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,630
It takes no time at all so let me—

182
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,980
I said I’m in a rush!

183
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,080
Fine.

184
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,650
I’ll see you at the garage.

185
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,620
Drive carefully.

186
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,220
You’re not the only guy on the road.

187
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,940
Thanks for the lecture, Dad!

188
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,510
Are we kissing before we even
know each other’s names?

189
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,410
Do we need to?

190
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,470
We’ll forget it tomorrow anyway.

191
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,420
Okay, then.

192
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,350
Perfect for me.

193
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,020
You got it?

194
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,470
You’re not doing this solo, you know?

195
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,350
Babe.

196
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,410
What time is it?

197
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,510
Don’t you have cram school?

198
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,470
Well, what time is it?

199
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,800
Why did you just come home?

200
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,480
I don’t mind, actually.

201
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,670
Do what you want.

202
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,640
You’re at that age, after all.

203
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,810
Just be sure to use protection, alright?

204
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,290
I don’t wanna be an uncle yet.

205
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,870
Think you’re funny, huh?

206
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:30,910
What are you reading?

207
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,350
Shakespeare.

208
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,210
You read everything he wrote?

209
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,960
No and not soon.

210
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,710
He wrote way too many books.

211
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,910
I’ll just keep reading until I get to see
one of his plays in the UK one day.

212
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,980
Determined, aren’t you?

213
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,660
Yeah.

214
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,280
I’m off to school.

215
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,610
Alright.

216
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,710
I ain’t picking you up.

217
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,410
Don’t come home so late.

218
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,870
You’re one to talk.

219
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,640
Who the hell did you take that tongue after, idiot?

220
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,580
Our gig last night.

221
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,820
[CRIME BOSS SHOT DEAD AT MASSAGE PARLOR]

222
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,860
We made headlines.
[CRIME BOSS SHOT DEAD AT MASSAGE PARLOR]

223
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,770
[CRIME BOSS SHOT DEAD AT MASSAGE PARLOR]

224
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,980
Crap.

225
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,550
Ain’t that cool?

226
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,420
Do they know we did it?

227
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,660
The point is to make sure nobody knows that, right?

228
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,010
Cops will just swamp here otherwise.

229
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,360
What’s with you?

230
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,260
You seem so bummed.

231
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,010
This place is ours, you know?

232
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,110
What cops are you even talking about?

233
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,140
Did you forget

234
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,960
who and why we had to move
our house and business here?

235
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,100
Hey, one, two, three, I ain’t a player.

236
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,480
I ain’t no player, but I sure am looking for trouble!

237
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,870
Yeah.

238
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,470
I know I’m a troublemaker.

239
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,530
But if being hitmen makes it so hard to live,

240
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,870
shouldn’t we just quit?

241
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,590
Do you honestly think quitting is easy?

242
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,420
So?

243
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,810
Are we supposed to live like this until we die?

244
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,220
I don’t want to kill people for a living my whole life.

245
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,450
Mother only wants us to kill bad people.

246
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,720
Those money laundering,
drug and human trafficking scums.

247
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,770
They deserve to die.

248
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,230
Please, Fadel.

249
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,410
After we get the next gig done,

250
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,230
let’s ask Mother for a little break.

251
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,110
I’ll take as little as a year.

252
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,030
I just want to live my life.

253
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,760
Please.

254
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,980
Keep dreaming.

255
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:55,900
Go clean the window.

256
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,310
Take the trash out.

257
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,910
Make sure to separate them.

258
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,310
Hey.

259
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,120
What’s happened to your car, man?

260
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,340
Shaky brakes, broken clutch, messed up gears.

261
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,600
It ain’t worth fixing.

262
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,820
Just sell it to me.

263
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,740
You’re not fooling me.

264
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,950
I told you one too many times this ain’t for sale.

265
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,860
My Dad left this for me.

266
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,750
Ain’t no way.

267
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,410
Didn’t you steal this car?

268
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,770
No.

269
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,520
I’ve cleared my name of car theft.

270
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,470
Look.

271
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,800
My hands are so damn clean now.

272
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,720
Yeah.

273
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,330
Well, how was last night?

274
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,920
Spill the tea, man.

275
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,310
Was he good?

276
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:53,840
Yeah.

277
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,520
I literally passed out afterwards.

278
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,420
Crap.

279
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,120
Lucky you.

280
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,540
Meanwhile, I hit some
jerk’s back bumper last night.

281
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,920
You alright? Everything okay?

282
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,660
I’m fine.

283
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,410
But now I gotta fix his car.

284
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,750
Let’s get back to your story.

285
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,070
Where were we?

286
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:12,860
How was it, again?

287
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,110
Everything was great.

288
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,260
But he just disappeared the next morning.

289
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,910
I didn’t even get his name.

290
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,960
I might as well have slept with a ghost.

291
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,270
It’s like he’d be real only in my memory.

292
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,780
Ain’t that weird?

293
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,150
You sure he didn't rob you last night?

294
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,100
Nah.

295
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,850
I’ve still got all my stuff.

296
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:37,900
Oh?

297
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,380
Oh, who’s that?

298
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,720
Is it the guy from last night?

299
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:41,550
Is it him?

300
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,120
Let me see.

301
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,990
It’s not.

302
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,220
Then who is it?

303
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,640
You keep secrets from your best friend now?

304
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,670
Stop it.

305
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,840
Yes, Captain?

306
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,400
You do know I’m not one
of your officers, Captain Chris?

307
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,820
You can’t keep making me work for you.

308
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,890
Last time you told me

309
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,360
that if I got you the drug dealer,

310
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,320
you’d finally cleared my name.

311
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,860
I did.

312
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,270
I swept all your car theft cases under the rug.

313
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,600
No one will bother you with that again.

314
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,080
But I’ve got another job for you.

315
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,270
If you get this done for me,

316
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,910
not only will your criminal record be swept away,

317
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,390
I’ll wipe it clean.

318
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,050
What do you say?

319
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,310
Hey, what you got there?

320
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,500
- Crap!
- Follow him!

321
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,750
Shit!

322
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,110
Halt!

323
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,330
Stop!

324
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,140
Stop!

325
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,840
Hands behind your back.

326
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:34,630
Stay still!

327
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,150
Stay!

328
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,360
If you refuse,

329
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,810
I might just reopen these cases.

330
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,370
You’re twisting my arm, Cap.

331
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,320
Think about it.

332
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,870
If you go to jail,

333
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,170
who’d take care of your brother?

334
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,320
As if I even had a choice.

335
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,920
What do you need me to do?

336
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,810
Get close to some hitmen.

337
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,810
Hitmen?

338
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,120
You think I’m James Bond or something?

339
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,170
How’d I even fight them?

340
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,870
I don’t want you to fight them.

341
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,740
I want you to learn about them.

342
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,810
I’m suspecting these two are responsible

343
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,420
for many recent politician and
business mogul kills.

344
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,470
If you know that much,

345
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,320
why not just go and arrest them?

346
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,630
No can do.

347
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,920
I need the bigger fish.

348
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,200
I want you close to them.

349
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,920
Do whatever is needed to get them to spill.

350
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,100
I believe you can do it.

351
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,320
Here’s their address.

352
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,350
Take a look.

353
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:06,760
Holy crap.

354
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,100
It’s the one-night ghost.

355
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:34,370
Tyle.

356
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,410
Tyle.

357
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,910
- Tyle, you idiot.
- Ouch, Dad!

358
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,970
What was that for?

359
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,970
With that loud music,

360
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,040
no wonder you couldn’t hear me.

361
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,330
Well, you didn’t call me by my name, huh?

362
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,850
It sounds like, “Die, die, die!”

363
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,730
Why’d you name me Style

364
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,050
if you’re not gonna call it?

365
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,910
So it was my fault for naming you so cool?

366
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,480
Look after the garage for a bit.

367
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:07,920
I gotta head out to buy some parts for a client.

368
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,480
Don’t just listen to music, okay?

369
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,020
Yeah.

370
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,800
Oh, it’s you.

371
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,100
How long have you been here?

372
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,610
Long enough to see you dance to the whole song.

373
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,410
Well?

374
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,820
What do you think?

375
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,450
Was I cool?

376
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,820
So.

377
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,640
Cool.

378
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,160
Fine.

379
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,440
I’m not messing with you anymore.

380
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,100
I almost thought you wouldn’t show up.

381
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,420
I just hope you can fix it like you said you could.

382
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,480
Of course I can.

383
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,730
Where’s your insurance claim?

384
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,820
I don’t have one.

385
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,200
Then how am I supposed to fix it?

386
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,460
You want me to pay for the whole repair?

387
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,840
You were drunk and on the phone
during the accident.

388
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,970
It’s your responsibility to pay for that.

389
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,180
Good thing it was just a rear bumper.

390
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,430
If it had been a man you hit, what would you do?

391
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,320
Relax.

392
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,460
I’ll fix it alright.

393
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,830
Give me your vehicle registration.

394
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:55,500
You got that?

395
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,220
No.

396
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,510
No insurance.

397
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,250
No registration.

398
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,000
Ain’t that suspicious?

399
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,300
How so?

400
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,500
It could be a stolen car.

401
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,610
How I came to have this car...

402
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,910
is my business.

403
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,120
Your business is to fix it.

404
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,590
I doubt it.

405
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,970
Don’t wanna get involved with some shady business.

406
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,700
Oh?

407
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,110
Is this your excuse to get out of this?

408
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,420
Relax.

409
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,350
I was just making sure.

410
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,480
I’ll fix it alright.

411
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,440
It will be as good as new.

412
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,930
Heart Burger?

413
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,820
Hello.

414
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,930
Welcome—

415
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,080
Oh?

416
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,300
That was amazing.

417
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,400
What a shame.

418
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,699
We won’t see each other again.

419
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,159
Welcome.

420
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,790
You work here?

421
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,380
Yes.

422
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,409
I own the place.

423
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,120
I must be the luckiest man alive
to run into you again.

424
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:35,210
To wake up to an empty bed that morning…

425
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,170
I thought I’d slept with a ghost.

426
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,159
Sorry.

427
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,670
I was in a rush.

428
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,130
It’s okay.

429
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,130
It’s karma, really.

430
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,710
I did that to so many people.

431
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:51,130
A taste of my own medicine, I suppose.

432
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,980
Isn’t it too much of a coincidence

433
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,810
that you just walked into my place?

434
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,080
My tattoo parlor is also in this area.

435
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,330
I see there’s a new burger joint

436
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,520
so I thought I’d try it.

437
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:08,410
Who’d have thought I’d run into someone…

438
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,520
so memorable?

439
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,160
What’s your signature dish?

440
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,930
Everything on the menu is great.

441
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,680
But our burgers are top notch.

442
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,120
We also have pastas and steaks.

443
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,420
One cheeseburger, please.

444
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:30,820
Hey.

445
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,530
What’s your name?

446
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,420
I might become a regular soon, you know?

447
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:41,980
Bison.

448
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,460
Cool name.

449
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,720
I’m Kant.

450
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,290
Take it. Take it. Take it.

451
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,280
Ugh, Fadel!

452
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,270
You’ve been gone too long!

453
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,200
Why didn’t we open an omelette restaurant instead?

454
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,130
Alright!

455
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,660
Oh, crap!

456
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,930
Shit!

457
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,030
Bon appetit.

458
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,130
It looks great.

459
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,720
Careful.

460
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,790
It’s sharp.

461
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,120
Thank you.

462
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,300
You can let go now.

463
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,800
You could’ve let me know you didn’t want the veggies.

464
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,000
It’s alright.

465
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,840
Just think of this as getting to know more about me.

466
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,320
Do you have delivery?

467
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,870
I might need to order this later.

468
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,400
Currently we don’t.

469
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,910
But if you want it,

470
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,010
I’ll be right at your door.

471
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:45,540
How about that?

472
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:48,870
I’ll take you up on that offer.

473
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,190
There’s one more thing I wanna ask you, though.

474
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,170
Yeah?

475
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,060
Will you go on a date with me?

476
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,470
You’re new in this area.

477
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,910
You might not know the place.

478
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,710
I’ll show you around.

479
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,510
You got ulterior motives or something?

480
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,150
If I said I wanted to be your boyfriend,

481
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,360
would you think it’s too soon?

482
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:10,920
A bit.

483
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:14,710
I appreciate the straightforwardness, though.

484
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,130
I like it.

485
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,170
Bon appetit.

486
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,710
Thank you.

487
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,450
There’s nothing to worry about that guy.

488
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,270
I’ve checked.

489
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,310
How could you be sure?

490
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,510
Did you check his household registration?

491
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,870
And why were you so close just now?

492
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,660
Of course I’ve checked him.

493
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,550
Inside…

494
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,780
and out.

495
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,520
Several positions, really.

496
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,770
You slept with him once and you let him come here?

497
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,770
You know damn well
how important this place is for us.

498
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,820
It was all a coincidence.

499
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,530
His tattoo parlor is in the neighborhood.

500
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,020
Coincidence, my ass.

501
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,430
Look.

502
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,470
He ate half of this burnt crap.

503
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,620
If he didn’t want to take you out,

504
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,430
he wouldn’t have forced himself to swallow this.

505
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,620
Take me out?

506
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,360
No way!

507
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,790
You think so?

508
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:03,770
Bison.

509
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,400
Listen to me.

510
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,910
Don’t trust anyone.

511
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,370
In our profession,

512
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,330
when someone approaches us,
it is wise to assume they want something.

513
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,270
Don’t be their victim.

514
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,980
You overanalyze everything, you know that?

515
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,240
Come on.

516
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,010
No need for a thorough checkup.

517
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,320
I always do a good job.

518
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:05,010
I guarantee it’s as good as new.

519
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,550
Actually, it might even be better than that.

520
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:09,810
I changed the parts for you, you know?

521
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,320
Why?

522
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,320
I liked the old ones.

523
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,930
I didn’t ask you to do that.

524
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,580
What?

525
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,200
I meant well

526
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,920
and you have a problem with that?

527
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:23,980
Fine.

528
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,810
Give me my car key back.

529
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,180
This?

530
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:40,770
Hey.

531
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,420
I think you left something in the car.

532
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:49,990
What is it?

533
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,820
What are you doing?

534
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,120
Why–Why are you taking off your shirt?

535
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,010
What are you, a pervert?

536
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,870
That’s a spare pin of my burger joint.

537
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:20,960
Give it back.

538
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,560
You flip burgers?

539
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,780
You certainly don’t fit the look.

540
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:28,910
What should we look like? With a bun on our head?

541
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,340
You do everything yourself?

542
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:32,370
Yes.

543
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,720
I do.

544
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,210
Now give me back my pin.

545
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:40,270
I need to get back to my restaurant.

546
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,480
I want to try your burger.

547
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,720
I bet it tastes divine.

548
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:51,000
Listen.

549
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:53,270
I don’t have time for this.

550
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,570
Give that back to me right now.

551
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,610
You want this?

552
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,050
Take it from me.

553
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:18,810
Fine.

554
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,160
Hey.

555
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,600
Careful with my nipples.

556
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,910
They’re sensitive.

557
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:34,830
Of course.

558
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:46,140
Hey!

559
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,370
That hurts!

560
00:44:58,790 --> 00:44:59,380
Hey!

561
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:01,870
Come back for our service!

562
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:04,110
Messing with you is so much fun.

563
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,960
From your car and how you dress,

564
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,030
you don’t look like
a typical tattoo artist, you know?

565
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,920
More like…

566
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:23,980
those uppercrust tattoo artists.

567
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,340
Hardly.

568
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,020
I just have enough to get by.

569
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,680
Oh, hey, can I ask you something?

570
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:33,720
Hmm?

571
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,170
How old are you?

572
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:37,880
29.

573
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:39,970
For real?

574
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:42,300
Should I address you differently?

575
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:43,620
I’m only 24.

576
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,230
If you want to, go ahead.

577
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,450
But if you do,

578
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:51,270
I should call you little brother.

579
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:52,820
It’s cute.

580
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:55,720
Nah.

581
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,270
I don’t know you well enough.

582
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,910
I’ll just call you what I call you right now.

583
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,150
It’s better that way.

584
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,200
Well…

585
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,110
Let’s get to know each other better today, shall we?

586
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,520
Are you more of a beach person or mountain person?

587
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,110
Beach.

588
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:18,840
We used to live near the ocean.

589
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:20,480
I love swimming.

590
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,270
Would you believe me
if I told you I’m afraid of the ocean?

591
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:27,710
Why?

592
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,620
Something happened when I was a kid.

593
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,720
I almost drowned.

594
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,420
Now I’m still afraid of it.

595
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:40,270
It’s understandable.

596
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,120
It must have been traumatizing.

597
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,710
I’m alright now.

598
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,310
You have a tattoo behind your ear?

599
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,820
Can I see?

600
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:03,510
K-A-N-T.

601
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,910
That’s how you spell your name?

602
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,070
Not really.

603
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:08,910
Originally it was spelled differently,

604
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:10,720
but I prefer this one.

605
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:13,140
Because it’s also the name of a philosopher.

606
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,480
It makes me look cool and smart as hell.

607
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,280
You know what Kant means in Thai?

608
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:30,310
It means, “the beloved.”

609
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,310
Too bad I have no one who loves me right now.

610
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,560
Hey!

611
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,970
This is mine.

612
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,330
Eat yours!

613
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,900
Thanks for the tour.

614
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,770
My pleasure.

615
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,730
I love being a good neighbor.

616
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:05,660
If I want you to show me around again…

617
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:07,000
My tattoo parlor is always open.

618
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,700
You can come over anytime.

619
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:11,280
And if I get hungry,

620
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:12,810
I’ll show up here.

621
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,300
What if…

622
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,560
I want to do what we did that night,

623
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,720
where should I go to?

624
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,120
What did we do?

625
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:28,700
I must have been way too drunk that night.

626
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,250
I hardly remember anything.

627
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,230
Well…

628
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:35,870
Let me give you a little reminder.

629
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,660
What the hell are you doing?

630
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,510
What?

631
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,470
We’re not doing anything.

632
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,330
Kant just gave me a tour of the neighborhood.

633
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,370
I told you he owns a tattoo parlor around here, right?

634
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,110
Hello.

635
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:06,440
Take these inside.

636
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,310
Put these in the fridge.

637
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,010
Why don’t you do it yourself?

638
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:19,250
Go.

639
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:25,510
See you around.

640
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:26,670
See you.

641
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,310
Come on in.

642
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:32,550
You go on ahead.

643
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:34,120
Fadel.

644
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,300
Go on ahead.

645
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,920
Well, excuse me.

646
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:49,720
Wait.

647
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:52,870
Yes?

648
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,330
Are you hitting on my little brother?

649
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:59,120
Yes.

650
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:00,810
Is that not allowed?

651
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,310
Why?

652
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,460
What do you want?

653
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:06,410
You already slept with him.

654
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,350
That should be more than enough.

655
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:12,630
My brother doesn’t need a boyfriend.

656
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,350
But he seems to like me just fine.

657
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,710
You’re full of yourself, aren’t you?

658
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:23,710
A bit, yeah.

659
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,030
He may like you,

660
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:29,480
but I don’t.

661
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,480
If you want him,

662
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:33,820
you get through me.

663
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:51,060
There’s no lead yet, Cap.

664
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:51,820
(Hey.)

665
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:54,470
(Why’d you sound so discouraged so soon?)

666
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,180
(You need to hurry up, though.)

667
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:58,920
(They just made another kill.)

668
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,150
Is it too late for me to back out now?

669
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,270
(You can’t.)

670
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:06,720
(Keep your eyes on your and your brother’s future.)

671
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:08,180
(You’re a smart brat.)

672
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:09,920
(You’ll find a way.)

673
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,870
(I know you can do it.)

674
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,710
Ugh, I know.

675
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,600
Bye.

676
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,570
Oh, hey.

677
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,160
Are you closed?

678
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:38,710
Yes.

679
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,330
But seeing you’re more special than the rest,

680
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,400
I’ll keep the place open all night long.

681
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,970
I’m just here to give you this burger.

682
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,150
I messed up the one I made for you the other day.

683
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,820
Fadel made this, so it’s going to taste great.

684
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:59,780
Is he likely to poison me?

685
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:01,440
No way.

686
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,040
He didn’t know it was meant for you.

687
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:04,820
No veggies, of course.

688
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,360
Hey, this is really good.

689
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,470
Unlike the one you made last time.

690
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:22,230
Speaking of which,

691
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,610
you and Fadel can’t be more different.

692
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,720
You don’t look anything like each other, either.

693
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:28,970
Honestly,

694
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:30,750
are you sure you guys really are brothers?

695
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,270
We are.

696
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:36,400
We have the same mom, but different dads.

697
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,290
It’s not weird that we don’t look alike, right?

698
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,410
Does Fadel hate all of your boyfriends?

699
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:50,430
I wouldn’t know.

700
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:51,970
I never have one.

701
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,270
Really?

702
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,410
Yeah.

703
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,090
You want me to believe
you’ve never had one boyfriend?

704
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:58,550
Yeah.

705
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,420
I never dated anyone seriously.

706
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,870
But the guys I hanged out with, like you,

707
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:04,160
I enjoyed their company.

708
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:13,110
What do I have to do if I want to be
the first guy to take you out?

709
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,070
Win Fadel over.

710
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:20,230
How should I proceed?

711
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:21,670
It’s impossible.

712
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:23,920
Fadel doesn't trust anybody.

713
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,620
He has no friends.

714
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,930
He doesn’t believe in love.

715
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,180
As long as he’s single,

716
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:30,620
so am I.

717
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,710
What I hear is…

718
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,120
if your brother has someone,

719
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,530
it’s possible between us.

720
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:43,220
I guess.

721
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,020
But whoever is going to take him out

722
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:47,810
has gotta be real crazy and bold.

723
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:53,010
What if I were to say

724
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56,350
I know someone exactly like that?

725
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:59,220
Are you gonna ask someone to hit on my brother?

726
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:00,970
Yeah.

727
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:03,990
I’ll do anything

728
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,870
if it means we end up together.

729
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:22,790
Kant?

730
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:24,970
Oh, sorry.

731
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:30,400
Babe.

732
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,810
This is Bison.

733
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:35,000
Hi.

734
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,310
Hey.

735
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:39,000
That’s Babe, my little brother.

736
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,570
Ignore me, guys.

737
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:44,050
I’m just here to pick up my books.

738
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:07,410
What?

739
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:09,760
You want me to hit on that jerk?

740
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,120
That’s the guy I had the accident
with the other night.

741
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,410
That guy?

742
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:20,890
Yeah.

743
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,910
He’s your crush’s brother?

744
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:24,070
Yeah.

745
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:26,670
He’s in my way.

746
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:28,920
You need to help me.

747
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,120
You know I don’t usually feel
this way about someone.

748
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:34,410
No can do.

749
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,670
I don’t want to waste my time.

750
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,820
What a freaking poser.

751
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,600
He’s like a vicious dog.

752
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,230
I probably need to get
a rabies shot before getting near him.

753
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:42,660
No way.

754
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,600
I’m outta here.

755
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,550
Hey, hold on.

756
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:51,580
What do I have to do for you to help me out?

757
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,810
Should I pay you?

758
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,420
No way.

759
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:57,720
A man like me can’t be bought.

760
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,010
Unless…

761
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,470
Unless what?

762
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,710
Give me your dad’s car.

763
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,370
Oh, jerk.

764
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:13,860
Well?

765
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,610
If you’re okay with that, it’s a deal.

766
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:24,430
Fine.

767
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:25,760
I’ll do it.

768
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:27,470
Under one condition.

769
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:31,320
You have to make him
head over heels in love with you.

770
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,910
You sure about this? Are you?

771
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,600
That car’s your treasure, ain’t it?

772
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:41,990
Well?

773
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:43,460
If you get him out of the way,

774
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:44,610
it’s worth it.

775
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:51,730
I’ll do it.

776
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:54,210
Not just for the car,

777
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,030
but someone like him

778
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:57,730
needs to be humbled by someone like me.

779
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,420
Deal.

780
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,320
Deal.

781
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:17,330
Thank you.

782
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:29,980
We’re closed.

783
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:35,620
Not so fast.

784
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,510
I haven’t made my order yet.

785
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,610
How’d you find this place?

786
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,530
Nothing is out of my reach...

787
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:56,210
if I really want it.

788
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:01,470
Wow.

789
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:04,870
American dining interior design…

790
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,530
I love it.

791
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:12,580
Hey, why don’t you buy me a burger in exchange?

792
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,380
In exchange for what?

793
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:17,270
For the repair, duh.

794
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:19,680
Aren’t you shameless?

795
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:22,860
You hit me and then ask me to treat you to a meal?

796
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:25,850
It doesn’t hurt to be generous.

797
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:27,210
My kitchen is closed.

798
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:29,210
I’ll have a beer.

799
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,710
We have time for that, right?

800
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:33,570
If you want a drink,

801
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,110
go to a bar.

802
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:38,050
No.

803
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:40,820
It just isn’t the same.

804
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,570
This place has some cool music,

805
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,390
and a really cool owner with a good taste.

806
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,750
One beer, boy.

807
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:02,490
Chop-chop.

808
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:39,890
Hey.

809
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,090
One more.

810
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:49,980
Hey.

811
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,220
One more beer.

812
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,590
Won’t you join me, handsome?

813
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,290
One more, please.

814
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:20,730
You’re drunk.

815
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:24,290
I’m not.

816
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:26,130
I’m just tipsy.

817
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,890
Enough to make me so bold.

818
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:34,160
If we were in a club,

819
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,480
I’d be dancing so close to you.

820
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:41,170
I’d be dancing around you like this,

821
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:43,490
and then whisper in your ears:

822
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:46,680
“Wanna come home with me?”

823
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:54,420
That’s enough.

824
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,470
You’ve tested my patience.

825
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,070
I’ll send over the bills to your garage.

826
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:01,220
Now go home.

827
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:03,010
No.

828
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,070
If you want me to go,

829
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:08,400
give me a ride home.

830
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:09,980
You won’t go?

831
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:11,430
No.

832
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:15,650
Fine.

833
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:20,180
Still no?

834
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:22,600
No.

835
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,230
Then I’ll take you home.

836
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:41,010
What?

837
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,360
Let go!

838
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,420
Hey, what are you doing?

839
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:46,240
Let go of me.

840
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:47,550
Let go.

841
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:50,210
Hey, how could you treat me like this?

842
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:51,310
Let go of me!

843
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,390
Stop it!

844
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:54,170
Hey!

845
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:55,920
You can’t do that!

846
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,180
I’m a customer!

847
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,820
Hey, let go of me!

848
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:05,040
Let go!

849
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:15,270
Hey!

850
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,110
You can’t do this to me!

851
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,220
I’m a customer!

852
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,470
We’ll see!

853
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:27,090
I’m gonna take you out!

854
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:32,840
Shit!

855
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,020
You’re friends?

856
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,710
You promised you’d help me.

857
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:09,350
Find out what that crazy dog likes to do.

858
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:10,480
I’ll find a way to get to him.

859
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:12,920
You sure your friend knows what he’s doing?

860
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:15,770
I don’t believe anyone is
more shamelessly bold than he is.

861
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,120
Good morning.

862
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:19,990
Who sent you?

863
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:21,020
I like you.

864
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,660
It was love at first sight.

865
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:24,410
Ain’t that romantic?

866
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:25,570
Like we’re in a movie.

867
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:27,200
Let’s talk about us.

868
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:28,710
Are you asking me out?

869
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:30,570
What do you want me to be if not your boyfriend?

870
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:31,680
You have a lot to prove first.
