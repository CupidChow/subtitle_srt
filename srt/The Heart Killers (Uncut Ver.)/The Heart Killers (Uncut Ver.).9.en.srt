1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,410
Where are you guys heading to, anyway?

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,100
We’re heading south.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,640
Kinda hoped it was going to be a romantic road trip date.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,230
Just do it.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,810
Just knock me out and leave.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,330
I can’t do that.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,900
I love you, Bison.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,890
With all my being.

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,570
You’re not fooling me again, are you?

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,590
As long as I’m alive,

11
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,310
I’ll make you kiss me again.

12
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,170
I think I know now where Bison is.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,390
You like The Beatles?

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,340
My father did.

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,650
He had a big collection of them.

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,650
You know,

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,860
when we used to come here,

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,060
my dad loved playing frisbee.

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,750
He would throw it in the ocean,

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,610
and made me fetch it.

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,880
I felt like a puppy.

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,710
You really are like a puppy.

23
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,840
My parents loved traveling.

24
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,280
I went abroad with them a lot when I was a kid.

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,590
When the plane went down,

26
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,650
we were on our way back from Europe.

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,450
Babe was very young at the time,

28
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,720
so we didn’t take him with us.

29
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,740
I honestly can’t say

30
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,600
that I was lucky to have survived.

31
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,860
God must have wanted you to live.

32
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,340
For Babe.

33
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,090
For you, too.

34
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,610
You know

35
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,000
what’s another thing
that I really miss?

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,000
What?

37
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,850
My childhood.

38
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,329
I remember, after my parents died,

39
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,420
I was so depressed and lonely.

40
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,500
It stayed that way for a long time.

41
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,680
I barely got to go out and play like the other children.

42
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,110
It’s fine now, isn’t it?

43
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,300
I was like that, too.

44
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,440
I forced myself to be mature
	just to take care of Babe.

45
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,630
You know, I’m only 29,

46
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,100
but I keep being told I dress like I’m in my 40’s.

47
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,700
Do I look old?

48
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,030
Not at all.

49
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,140
It’s pretty cool.

50
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,990
What’s wrong with being 40 anyway?

51
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,030
Kinda hot, really.

52
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,640
You can be my daddy.

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,020
Okay, then, baby.

54
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,650
We have a lot in common, don’t we?

55
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,520
I guess we’re just perfect for each other.

56
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,320
Can’t argue with that.

57
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,340
Oh, hey.

58
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,670
If the cops want to reopen your cases,

59
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,310
what are you gonna do?

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,880
I don’t know.

61
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,980
All I know is I gotta have everything in order.

62
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,860
If I ever get go to jail one day,

63
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,650
I want Babe to be able to take care of himself.

64
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,250
Why don’t we just get locked up together?

65
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,070
I don’t want to go anywhere without you anymore.

66
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,970
You’re my home, Kant.

67
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,470
Hey.

68
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,370
Alright.

69
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,500
You’re home now.

70
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,040
Oh?

71
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,790
Ow, come on!

72
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Does he have any CDs?

73
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,330
We–Well?

74
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,320
How do I drive?

75
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,700
You seem to sleep pretty well.

76
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,650
Are we there yet?

77
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,860
Almost.

78
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,820
I’m keeping up the speed.

79
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,820
Are you sure they’re there, though?

80
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,390
Yes.

81
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,920
Bison told me his parents had a house on an island.

82
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,190
That was before they got murdered.

83
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,120
If you’re sure, then alright.

84
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,740
I just hope Kant is still alive.

85
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,250
I can’t guarantee that.

86
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,120
You’ll have to find out for yourself.

87
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,480
Oh, jerk.

88
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,920
Can’t you at least lie to make me feel better?

89
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,180
Hey.

90
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,870
Can I ask you something?

91
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,290
Can we get me some new clothes?

92
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,470
I’ve been wearing yours this whole time,

93
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,220
and it’s getting disgusting.

94
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,320
We can just stop by around here somewhere.

95
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,240
You sure make a lot of requests.

96
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
You think we’re on a road trip or something?

97
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,380
No.

98
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,030
We are not stopping anywhere.

99
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,770
Oh, come on.

100
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,770
If you’re gonna kill me,

101
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,840
can I at least die in something that’s actually my style?

102
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,390
I want my corpse to look good.

103
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,250
Gotta look presentable on the news.

104
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,770
“Gorgeous man with clear skin found dead in a crop top.”

105
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,340
My dad will recognize me right away.

106
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,340
Whoa.

107
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,640
These look pretty good.

108
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,340
Oh, this is nice.

109
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,660
Hey, what do you think of this?

110
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,750
Think I can match it with something.

111
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,850
Hurry up and grab what you want.

112
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,000
We need to keep going.

113
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,680
I hardly feel like a hostage right now.

114
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,400
I feel like a boyfriend.

115
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,390
This feels like going shopping with my boyfriend.

116
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,950
Listen to me.

117
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,500
You are not a hostage.

118
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,320
And I’m not using you as leverage for anything.

119
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,300
You don’t matter enough for that.

120
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,820
I’m just letting you find a little joy before I kill you.

121
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,419
Well…

122
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,710
Can I ask for one more thing?

123
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,800
You think I’m a wish granter or something?

124
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,410
You’re going to die soon,

125
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,750
what else do you want?

126
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,350
When you dispose of my body,

127
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,350
can you choose somewhere nice?

128
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,470
The beach or the mountain, for example.

129
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,530
At least my ghost will haunt beautiful places,

130
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,810
like the ocean or the mountain.

131
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,990
I don’t want my ghost to haunt some dumpster.

132
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,000
If you don’t choose something right now,

133
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,770
the only place you’re haunting is this damn secondhand store.

134
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:38,860
Well?

135
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,790
How about this?

136
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,670
What a beauty.

137
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,910
I’m going with this one.

138
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,840
I’m gonna try it on.

139
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,360
Well?

140
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,500
What do you think?

141
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,000
Now this is more like me.

142
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,000
I never saw you in stripes before.

143
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,660
Oh?

144
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,660
Been observing me, haven’t you?

145
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,440
You can’t kill me.

146
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,150
You love me.

147
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,770
Style, duck!

148
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,330
Who the hell is that?

149
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,750
How would I know?

150
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,690
Is he here to kill you or me?

151
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,070
Should I go and ask him?

152
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,160
Go, go.

153
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,520
Go, go, go!

154
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,020
I’m out of bullets.

155
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,510
Shit, that’s in the car.

156
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,720
This is all because of you.

157
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,800
I forgot everything.

158
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,560
Why are you blaming me?

159
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,560
How should we fight him?

160
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,800
I’ll run over there.

161
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,840
I’ll distract him.

162
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,250
Are you out of your mind?

163
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,280
How the hell will you outrun bullets?

164
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,520
Trust me.

165
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,540
I’m fast.

166
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,120
Style.

167
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,340
Style, Style!

168
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,690
Shit.

169
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,800
Who the hell are you?

170
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,450
Who sent you?

171
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,550
Style?

172
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,010
Style!

173
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,210
Crap!

174
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,510
Style.

175
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,660
I’m alright.

176
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,240
It’s just a graze.

177
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,560
Shut your trap.

178
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,800
Look at how much you’re bleeding.

179
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,060
This is nothing.

180
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,400
Keep putting pressure on it.

181
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,150
This is gonna hurt a little.

182
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,070
Put pressure on it.

183
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,000
Crap…

184
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,270
Flip it before you burn it.

185
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,960
I am flipping.

186
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,470
It just won’t flip.

187
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,580
Let me help.

188
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,610
That’s it.

189
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,710
I told you I’d do it.

190
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,470
You nearly burned our food, you see?

191
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,380
But I just wanted to help.

192
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,900
Just do it yourself next time, then.

193
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,110
You’re stubborn, huh?

194
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,670
I’ll just root for you quietly, then.

195
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,560
Hey.

196
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,660
I’m handling hot oil, for God’s sake.

197
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,280
If we burn this, we don’t get to eat, you know?

198
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,340
Hey, stop it.

199
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,860
Young master.

200
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,620
I’m sorry.

201
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,890
I didn’t mean to interrupt.

202
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,660
It’s quite alright, Mr. Maew.

203
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,460
Is something the matter?

204
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,290
Someone just landed on our shore, sir.

205
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,230
You okay?

206
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,230
Why don’t you get in the house and lock the door?

207
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,170
I’ll be right back.

208
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,580
No.

209
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,220
I’m going with you.

210
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,280
No.

211
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,390
It’s too dangerous.

212
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,200
That’s exactly why I won’t let you do it alone.

213
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,730
Okay.

214
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,380
That’s Style.

215
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,660
Fadel!

216
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,520
Style!

217
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,240
Fadel!

218
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,450
Style!

219
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,200
What’s going on?

220
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,660
What happened to you?

221
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,270
Why are you bleeding so much?

222
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,170
Kant…

223
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,500
You’re alive.

224
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,360
I’m happy to see that.

225
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,470
You’re the one who’s barely alive, dude!

226
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,190
How did you get here?

227
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,200
Save your questions.

228
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,710
Help him first.

229
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,910
I’ll help.

230
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,750
Stay back!

231
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:57,900
Let go.

232
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:05,900
You alright?

233
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,290
Just put your weight on me.

234
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,540
Get him up here.

235
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,120
Bison, help me.

236
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,330
Gentle.

237
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,550
Careful.

238
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,710
Hey, what are you doing?

239
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,960
You’re not a doctor.

240
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,480
If I don’t do something,

241
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,480
he’s dead.

242
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,800
Have you done this before?

243
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,380
I stitched Fadel up before.

244
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:07,420
Hold on.

245
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,680
This is going to hurt a little.

246
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,560
But Bison’s here to help you.

247
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,079
If you’re not doing anything, just leave.

248
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,640
I got this.

249
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:21,819
Kant.

250
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,510
Grab some clean cloth for me.

251
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,250
I’m taking the bandage off.

252
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,250
Crap.

253
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,260
Alright.

254
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,860
Hold on.

255
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,170
You got it?

256
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,680
Hang on, alright?

257
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,320
Bite on this.

258
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,120
Hold my hand.

259
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,300
Hold it.

260
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,640
It’ll sting a little.

261
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,650
That hurts!

262
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,120
Fadel.

263
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,090
Style’s taken care of.

264
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,240
He’s out cold right now, though.

265
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,600
Good thing it was just a graze.

266
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,680
He’ll be fine.

267
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,870
He’ll be up in no time.

268
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,710
You never listen to me at all, do you?

269
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,270
How could you just run away like that?

270
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,780
I’m sorry.

271
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,780
I was enraged.

272
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,770
Really wanted him dead at the time.

273
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,440
Dead, my ass.

274
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
Am I looking at a damn ghost, then?

275
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,570
It’s not easy for me.

276
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,070
You know I love him.

277
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,030
And he told me everything.

278
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,590
He only did it because he was promised a clean slate.

279
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,970
He’s on our side now.

280
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,720
And you’re stupid enough to believe him.

281
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,770
Fine.

282
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,010
I’ll kill him myself.

283
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,640
No one will find out who dies on this remote island anyway.

284
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,760
Go on!

285
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:15,900
Go ahead.

286
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,280
Do it.

287
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,870
Why don’t you just kill Style as well?

288
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,670
He fooled you, didn’t he?

289
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,740
Do it for me
	since I don’t have the guts to do it.

290
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,260
Don’t try me.

291
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,360
I’m not.

292
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,110
I just know you can’t do it.

293
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,840
The way you were holding his hands,

294
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,530
and the look in your eyes as you stared at him.

295
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,940
I’ve never seen you worry about someone like that before.

296
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,620
If you can do it, go on.

297
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,410
Be my guest.

298
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,080
He’s just over there.

299
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,260
Can we forget about those two for now?

300
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,800
Just tell me
	who followed us here.

301
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,170
Probably one of Ruerat’s hires.

302
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,280
We messed up our last mission.

303
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,880
They’re probably after us as payback.

304
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,040
For real?

305
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,910
Should we tell Mother?

306
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,720
I don’t think so.

307
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,410
I got this.

308
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,280
But we gotta make sure it’s them.

309
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,110
Okay.

310
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,370
How’s your wound?

311
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,860
Now that you mention it, it still hurts.

312
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,970
Want another stab wound?

313
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,710
Careful when you get up.

314
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,860
The stitches are still fresh.

315
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,580
It was amazing I didn’t die from shock on that table.

316
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,290
Take some painkillers.

317
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,190
Bison told me to give them to you.

318
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,200
Thanks.

319
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,600
I honestly thought I’d come here to see your dead body.

320
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,910
Almost.

321
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,900
I told him the whole truth.

322
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,650
So he knows everything?

323
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,050
Then how are you still alive?

324
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,570
He loves me.

325
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,260
The power of love, alright.

326
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,700
I love him, too.

327
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,370
I’ll do anything to keep him alive.

328
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,900
And how are you going to do that?

329
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,430
This mess is getting out of hand.

330
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,560
It’s not just the cops who are after them,

331
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,100
but someone else clearly wants them dead.

332
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,480
I don’t know,

333
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,890
but my heart is already in this.

334
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,840
So you’re safe now, huh?

335
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,980
Meanwhile, my chances are 50-50.

336
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,210
He’s hot and then cold.

337
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,830
He loves me and then he doesn’t.

338
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,490
I honestly can’t keep up with him.

339
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,490
You think?

340
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,200
But from what I saw,

341
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,200
he had your hands clasped in his so tightly.

342
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,720
And the way he looked at you
	was exactly how I looked at Bison at the hospital.

343
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,040
Thanks, though,

344
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,460
for risking your life looking for me.

345
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,380
I don’t need your gratitude.

346
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,080
I’m here mostly because Fadel dragged my ass here.

347
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,100
Fine, fine.

348
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,370
You can’t just say you love me like a normal person, huh?

349
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,970
I love you soooo—

350
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,210
Ow! It still hurts!

351
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,970
My bad, dude.

352
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,760
Hey.

353
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,160
When he had my hand in his,

354
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,730
how did he look at me?

355
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,080
Let me show you.

356
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,790
He clasped your hands like this,

357
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,260
and looked at you with worries…

358
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,370
Then he said, “Hold on, Style.”

359
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,320
“I won’t lose you.”

360
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,750
He did?

361
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,610
He moved in closer…

362
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,210
Eww!

363
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,620
Gives me the creeps.

364
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:18,750
Yeah, that was it.

365
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,140
He was clearly worried about you.

366
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,560
What are we making today?

367
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,670
Oh, hey.

368
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,200
I’m blanching some vegetables.

369
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,090
What’s the matter?

370
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,690
The hell did you do that for?

371
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,480
Fadel!

372
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,260
Fadel, stop it.

373
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,450
Stop!

374
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,140
You brought all this on us!

375
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,530
Fadel!

376
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,010
I’ve talked things out with him!

377
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,310
But I don’t!

378
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,030
Fadel.

379
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,150
No.

380
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,520
Fadel!

381
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,170
You’re turning a gun on your own brother for him?

382
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,720
But it’s my life.

383
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,590
You don’t get to decide for me.

384
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,420
Fadel!

385
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,650
Don’t hurt Kant!

386
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,730
He’s sorry for what he did.

387
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,710
It’s okay.

388
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,570
Fadel’s right.

389
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,180
I brought all this on us.

390
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,280
If this is how it ends,

391
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,830
let it end with me.

392
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,340
If you’re going to kill me,

393
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,160
go right ahead.

394
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,730
But Style has nothing to do with this.

395
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,080
I lied to get him roped into this.

396
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,120
Don’t you dare take all the credits.

397
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,290
If you’re going to kill him,

398
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,080
kill me, too.

399
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,230
Nobody forced me into this.

400
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,890
I agreed to it willingly.

401
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,490
Don’t you have a little sympathy?

402
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,870
We’ve been through all these things together.

403
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,540
Why did you bother stitching me up
	if you’re going to end up killing me anyway?

404
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,040
Why didn’t you just let me die?

405
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,640
I’m happy to have called you a friend.

406
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,250
Thank you

407
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,680
for making my life such an adventure.

408
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,290
It’s been so goddamn fun, you know that?

409
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:39,600
How can we be sure you’re not just fooling us again?

410
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,260
You think I’d risk my life for all this

411
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,130
if I didn’t really have feelings for you?

412
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,130
People make mistakes.

413
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,650
Won’t you give me a chance?

414
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,060
I really love your brother,

415
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,080
and my friend really loves you.

416
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:24,300
The two of us will do anything
	to make sure the two of you get the life you want.

417
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,310
You alright?

418
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,790
Are you?

419
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,110
I’m fine.

420
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:51,850
Are you hurt?

421
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,000
Any of you allergic to seafood?

422
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,690
Let me help.

423
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,370
You’re a hitman, a doctor,

424
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,660
and a househusband all in one, huh?

425
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,880
I’m literally just hanging up laundry.

426
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,170
This is for Fadel and Style in the guest bedroom.

427
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,080
Will your brother agree to that?

428
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,030
I don’t know.

429
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,630
I gotta admit he’s got his ego.

430
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,960
Can’t blame him, though.

431
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,960
His trust was betrayed.

432
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,140
It’s gonna take a little time to heal.

433
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,950
Well…

434
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:02,040
How is the trust
	between you and me?

435
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,540
You gotta admit
	the cut was deep.

436
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,850
It’s going to be difficult to completely heal.

437
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,180
I’m still arguing with myself
	if I made the right decision.

438
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,250
You did.

439
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,750
I won’t let you down again.

440
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,050
Okay, then.

441
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,460
Our trust is alright now.

442
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,610
But those two…

443
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,310
What should we do?

444
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,140
I have a plan.

445
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,480
I know you have been through something painful

446
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,570
and you lost your parents at such a young age.

447
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,670
But don’t worry.

448
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,400
You’re going to have a new family,

449
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,070
and we’re going to build it ourselves.

450
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:48,280
I… will be your everything.

451
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,730
Call me Mother.

452
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,200
Mother.

453
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,930
Why do we have to learn how to use a gun?

454
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,880
The world is full of people who want to hurt us.

455
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,930
I want you to know how to defend yourselves.

456
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,360
It’s a skill.

457
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,880
You will get to use it one day.

458
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,890
This is the guy
	you want us to kill?

459
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,260
Yes.

460
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,600
He’s a bad person.

461
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,040
He needs to be eliminated.

462
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,920
He kills people and abuses women.

463
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,560
He leaves behind widows and orphans everywhere he goes.

464
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:03,610
Why not let the law or the police deal with him?

465
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,420
Oh, Bison.

466
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,650
You’re naive, baby.

467
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,140
We can’t trust the law.

468
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,830
I have to deal with this myself.

469
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,670
But I can’t do it alone.

470
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,470
I need all of you.

471
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,460
Remember.

472
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,730
The world is made up of good people
	and bad people.

473
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,820
Our job
is to kill the bad guys.

474
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:57,840
Come in.

475
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,280
Where are we on that matter I asked you to take care of?

476
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,630
I…

477
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,179
I…

478
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,250
What is it?

479
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,250
Stop mumbling and just tell me.

480
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,620
I messed up.

481
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,659
Of course you did!

482
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,699
I knew it.

483
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:30,540
This is why I never trusted you to take care of these things.

484
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,350
I knew I was only going to be disappointed.

485
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,770
Now that you’ve alerted them,

486
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,659
I bet they’re out of reach now.

487
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,659
They have been dying to quit this job.

488
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,889
No.

489
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,679
I…

490
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,900
I think they still want to get even with Ruerat.

491
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:51,179
They will come back.

492
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,690
You’re right.

493
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:03,580
We should hire someone else to do this.

494
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,490
They will take care of it.

495
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,270
Yes.

496
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,040
Hire someone.

497
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,390
Maybe the one we hired two years ago.

498
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,620
As for you,

499
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,620
get back to the job you’re more well equipped for.

500
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,760
Don’t try to do something you’re no good at.

501
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:30,800
Now go.

502
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,570
Hey, Dad.

503
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,170
I’m at the beach with some friends.

504
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,670
Yeah, I’ll be back soon.

505
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,330
Don’t worry.

506
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,950
My phone’s dead.

507
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,200
I’m calling from my friend’s number.

508
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:55,990
Right.

509
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,500
Eat properly, you.

510
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,360
See you.

511
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,670
Thanks, Bison.

512
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,690
I didn’t want my dad to worry.

513
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,550
No problem.

514
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,040
But wouldn’t he be mad
	if you showed up at home like this?

515
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,970
It’s alright.

516
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,810
Don’t worry.

517
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,070
I’ll just come up with some badass stories.

518
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:25,320
Maybe some superhero stories, even.

519
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,170
I promise not to let loose on you and Fadel.

520
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,760
I didn’t mean that.

521
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,600
I know you’re good at making up stories.

522
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,430
Kinda sounds like an insult.

523
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,570
It’s not.

524
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,790
Oh.

525
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:42,440
Yeah?

526
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,810
Fadel wants to talk to you.

527
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,620
About what?

528
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,000
I don’t know.

529
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,960
He just said you should meet him at the beach.

530
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,030
Crap.

531
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:02,660
Maybe he changes his mind
	and wants me on my knees

532
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,360
with a gun to my head
	before shooting me dead into the ocean.

533
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,120
What?

534
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,460
No way.

535
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,980
The worst he’d do would be trying to drown you.

536
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,680
Kidding.

537
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,910
He won’t do that.

538
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,660
I bet your brother would actually do that.

539
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,880
Can I ask you something?

540
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,100
Do you really like Fadel?

541
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,850
Whatever Kant feels about you,

542
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,240
that’s how I feel about your brother.

543
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,330
If you understand him,
	you should be able to understand me.

544
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,790
If you really like him,

545
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,180
you need to prove it to him.

546
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,710
He acts all tough and rough on the outside,

547
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,470
but on the inside, he’s just a softie.

548
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,330
Really!

549
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,750
He never hesitates when he kills.

550
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,320
So if you’re still alive,

551
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,180
that means he’s got a soft spot for you.

552
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,680
You think…

553
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,330
I have a chance?

554
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,980
Go for it.

555
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,120
After all you’ve risked your life for,

556
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,570
what else do you even have to be scared of now?

557
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,380
Am I right?

558
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,120
What the hell are you doing here?

559
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,940
Bison asked me to give you the toiletry bag.

560
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,100
Put it there.

561
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:09,800
What?

562
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,760
Thank you for giving me a chance.

563
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,550
I won’t let you down.

564
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,440
I don’t need your promises.

565
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,550
If you don’t live up to what you said,

566
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,210
I’ll just kill you.

567
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,880
Okay.

568
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,880
Don’t take it out on Style.

569
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,220
I asked him to take you out in exchange for my car.

570
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,630
What did you just say?

571
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,390
Take me out?

572
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,710
For your car?

573
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,740
Yeah.

574
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:45,010
I gotta dangle some reward to lure him in.

575
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,280
But you know,

576
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,750
he’s long forgotten about my car.

577
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,030
I think he loves you.

578
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,310
I don’t need to know what you think.

579
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,310
Well, I don’t know.

580
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,600
He and I have been friends for a long time.

581
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:03,210
He’s got a lot to look forward to in life.

582
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,820
If he’s not serious about you,

583
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,380
he wouldn't have left any of that to be here with you.

584
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,230
Also…

585
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,340
Bison said he needs to talk to you.

586
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,190
He’s waiting at the beach.

587
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,550
Why isn’t he here, then?

588
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,100
Why did he send you?

589
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:26,780
I don’t know.

590
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,820
Maybe it’s about something he doesn’t want me to know.

591
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,770
Bye.

592
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,380
What are you doing here?

593
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,660
Where’s Bison?

594
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,660
Why would Bison be here?

595
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,430
He told me you had something to talk to me about.

596
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,860
Hey.

597
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,470
Don’t go.

598
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,220
I’m here, so talk to me.

599
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,000
What the hell?

600
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,230
I can’t sleep unless I talk to you.

601
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,540
Say what you want.

602
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:30,670
Here.

603
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,260
Take it.

604
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,180
What is it?

605
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,850
A list of all my relatives.

606
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,940
I want you to be sure that I’m not lying to you again.

607
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,600
If I ever do that,

608
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:53,460
you can kill me and my entire extended family.

609
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,050
Are you insane?

610
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,510
You’re selling your whole family out for this?

611
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,880
And you said you’re a family man.

612
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,130
Because I know for a fact
that I won’t ever lie to you again.

613
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,570
Words are cheap.

614
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,070
I’m only worth as much as one car to you.

615
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,700
From what you did to me,

616
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,820
I just hope that car’s a real beauty.

617
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:26,820
Did… Did Kant tell you that?

618
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,090
Yeah.

619
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,250
Your best friend sold you out.

620
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,060
How are you gonna defend yourself now?

621
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,160
Well…

622
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,060
That was in the past.

623
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,010
I admit I started off with the wrong intention.

624
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,800
But after spending time with you,

625
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,110
I’ve changed.

626
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,740
I never let anyone get the better of me.

627
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,610
But for you, I’d do it again and again.

628
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,480
I think we get along well.

629
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,620
The only thing I can do right now
	is promise you that I’ll be by your side.

630
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,490
But if you give me a chance,

631
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,310
I can show you I mean every word.

632
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,090
You don’t believe me?

633
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,260
Fine.

634
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:35,500
A guy like me
	is a man of my word.

635
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,250
What are you doing?

636
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:45,940
Style!

637
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:47,700
What the hell are you doing?

638
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:51,860
I’m going to keep walking until you give me a chance.

639
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,620
You’re only going to get an infection!

640
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,900
And I will die of that, too!

641
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:58,650
Style!

642
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,610
I’m gone.

643
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,810
Bye-bye.

644
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,470
Oh, it’s pretty deep around here.

645
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,470
No, wait, I just stepped on some seashells!

646
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,240
Ow!

647
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:07,270
Fine!

648
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,420
I’ll give you a chance.

649
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:13,180
You will?

650
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,460
Nah, I’m gone.

651
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,210
There’s no way you mean it.

652
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,240
Style!

653
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,790
What the hell are you doing?

654
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:28,330
What are you doing?

655
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,240
I promise you that, from now on,

656
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,670
you’ll only see the 100% real me.

657
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:39,160
Besides work,

658
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,530
I’ve been real to you from day one.

659
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,430
If you don’t stay true to me after this,

660
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,610
you’ll find out how I deal with liars.

661
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:56,260
Now come on
	before you infect your wound.

662
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,260
Even when you’re threatening me,

663
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,500
you’re worried about me.

664
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,710
How adorable.

665
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:06,790
I can be worse.

666
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:08,520
You want that?

667
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:10,340
No.

668
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:14,070
From now on, I just want to see you being lovey-dovey.

669
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:16,820
How so?

670
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,230
Well…

671
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,630
In a situation like this,

672
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:24,530
if we weren’t fighting,

673
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:27,470
what would you like to do to me?

674
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,090
They’re cute, aren’t they?

675
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:47,100
Took them long enough.

676
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,870
I always knew Fadel needed to find someone stubborn like that.

677
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,680
I did my part, didn’t I?

678
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:56,920
I tried so hard he punched me square in the face.

679
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:59,270
Oh, poor you.

680
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,310
Hey.

681
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,410
Won’t you just let Ruerat go?

682
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,110
It will only add fuel to the flames.

683
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,990
Someone is hunting you guys down.

684
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,120
If you kill him,

685
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,270
he will just come back and kill you.

686
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:28,910
He destroyed my family.

687
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,500
But it will just keep going in a loop.

688
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,950
All you’ll get is satisfaction.

689
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,820
That’s exactly what I want.

690
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:44,680
I’ve lived my whole life with this grudge.

691
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,090
Now that I have it within my grasp,
you want me to let it pass me by?

692
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,760
I told you
	this would be the last mission.

693
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,210
It won’t be.

694
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,300
If you do it now, you’ll do it again.

695
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,990
I understand how you feel.

696
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,810
I’m just worried about you.

697
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,900
You see?

698
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:35,690
I told you hitmen aren’t made for love.

699
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:38,870
You’re giving me false hopes.

700
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:41,820
I’m not.

701
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:46,430
The future we picture together is more than possible.

702
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:51,210
Then tell me what this future looks like.

703
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,350
We’d be living on an island.

704
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,230
I’d have a tattoo parlor.

705
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:04,520
When we have a lot of customers,

706
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,520
you have to take care of them.

707
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,760
Sounds boring.

708
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,840
I want to do something else.

709
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:14,560
What do you want to do, then?

710
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:16,780
Designing?

711
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:19,290
Do you want to be a doctor?

712
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,850
You seemed pretty adept when you stitched my buddy up.

713
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,380
Sounds interesting.

714
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,530
Anything is possible

715
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,980
as long as we’re together.

716
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,690
Careful.

717
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:57,320
Sorry.

718
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,870
Be gentle.

719
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,120
Don’t do something like this again.

720
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,430
But I gotta pull some dramatic stunt for someone like you.

721
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,270
Hey.

722
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,310
Can I ask you something?

723
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:25,900
What is it?

724
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,290
There’s a photo of a man in the glove compartment of your car.

725
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,010
Who is he?

726
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,470
I’m sorry for prying.

727
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,490
If you don’t want to tell me, I understand.

728
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,080
He’s my ex.

729
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,370
How long were you together?

730
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:06,100
Two-ish years, I guess.

731
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:10,890
Why did you break up?

732
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:17,460
He and I were going to start a life together.

733
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:31,180
Hey.

734
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:38,180
I’ve asked Mother about quitting my job

735
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,710
and moving to the South with you.

736
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,160
Well, did she give you the greenlight?

737
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:47,210
Of course.

738
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,840
I’ve worked for her for a long time.

739
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:50,790
She’s fine with it.

740
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,060
She told me she wanted me to find love

741
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,600
and live a normal life.

742
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:01,510
What exactly do you do for a living?

743
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,490
You never told me.

744
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:10,400
What kind of work doesn’t allow you to find love
	or live a normal life?

745
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,170
You don’t have to think about that right now.

746
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:20,020
Let’s focus on our future.

747
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:40,520
Do you dance?

748
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:42,630
Not very well.

749
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I’ll teach you.

750
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,360
Don’t step on my foot.

751
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:05,750
Sorry.

752
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:15,000
But one day, he’s just gone.

753
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,350
Like he’s completely disappeared.

754
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,370
He probably just didn’t want to confront me,

755
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,770
so he just disappeared.

756
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:37,380
Couldn’t he at least tell me straight up
	if he didn’t want to be with me anymore?

757
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,780
Ghosting me was just nasty.

758
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,170
Maybe he was scared of me,
	thinking I’d kill him if he broke up with me.

759
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,690
I’m not scared of you anymore

760
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,200
ever since you saved that woman’s life at the bowling alley.

761
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:17,530
You risked your life for a total stranger.

762
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:22,540
I know I’m in love with the right man.

763
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,020
Hey.

764
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,120
You alright?

765
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,780
What’s on your mind?

766
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:12,840
It’s nothing.

767
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,700
I’m just thinking about work.

768
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,670
You should leave work behind
	when you’re with me.

769
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,970
You told me you’d quit your job and be with me.

770
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,400
Wait a little longer.

771
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:30,620
Wait until everything’s settled down.

772
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,570
We won’t have to sneak about to see each other again.

773
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,590
Don’t make me wait so long.

774
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:05,940
Dad!

775
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,450
Dad!

776
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:17,440
Mom!

777
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:19,100
Help me!

778
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:20,300
Dad!

779
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:21,910
Dad!

780
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:23,660
Mom!

781
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:28,810
Are you still scared?

782
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,210
I keep getting flashbacks to that day.

783
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,730
I understand.

784
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:43,260
It left a gaping hole in your heart,

785
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:44,540
of course it’s going to be hard to forget.

786
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,230
You don’t have anything you’re scared of?

787
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:52,420
Of course I do.

788
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,390
I used to be so scared of the sound of gunshots.

789
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,580
But I got over it with… pure grudge.

790
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,030
I want to avenge my family

791
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,790
so I learned how to use a gun.

792
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,290
“Pew, pew, pew!”

793
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,250
And I got over it.

794
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,390
That’s a gunshot?

795
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:17,400
“Pew, pew”?

796
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:18,780
That’s how it sounds when the shooter’s cute.

797
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:20,870
Okay.

798
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:25,050
You’re telling me I need a reason to get over it, then?

799
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,540
I guess so.

800
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,320
I want you to be the reason.

801
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:32,990
How would that work?

802
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:35,930
I know how much you love the ocean.

803
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,080
If I want to be with you,

804
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:40,360
I have to overcome this fear.

805
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,140
Alright, then.

806
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,540
It shouldn’t be too scary when…

807
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:56,320
Here.

808
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,730
Just a little further.

809
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:06,900
I won’t let you go.

810
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:07,870
Let’s keep going.

811
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:30,610
I think this is far enough.

812
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:35,670
Baby steps, huh?

813
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,510
One day,

814
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,210
I’ll be swimming with you in the middle of the ocean.

815
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:47,380
You don’t have to spoil me so much, you know?

816
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,440
Both in bed and about traveling,

817
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,040
if you spoil me so much,

818
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,050
it gets boring, you know?

819
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,310
You gotta oppose me sometimes.

820
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:56,090
Don’t take it back.

821
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:56,920
I’m definitely taking your word for it.

822
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:57,910
Go for it.

823
00:58:57,930 --> 00:58:59,210
You’re in my turf.

824
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:00,890
Okay!

825
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:02,490
Hey!

826
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:08,660
Hey!

827
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:09,770
Hey!

828
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,050
Stop.

829
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:13,990
Hey!

830
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:26,700
Hey.

831
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,640
You’re going to turn saltwater into syrup at this rate.

832
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,830
Wanna play frisbee?

833
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:35,480
I’m not playing.

834
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:36,920
I ain’t a kid.

835
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:40,730
Being a kid every once in a while is fun, you know?

836
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:41,960
Come on.

837
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:43,970
What do you say?

838
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:46,020
We’re in.

839
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:48,370
Okay.

840
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,610
Get ready, then.

841
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,660
Back when I was a kid,

842
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:01,650
I used to love just sitting here with my parents.

843
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:04,620
I never thought I’d get to do that with my boyfriend one day.

844
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:10,890
It’d be a shame to leave.

845
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,300
Why not just stay?

846
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:17,180
Just become an islander.

847
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:19,590
Don’t be ridiculous.

848
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,610
We still have a job to finish.

849
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:29,220
Do you think we’d get to come back here again?

850
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,390
Of course.

851
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:37,280
Once we wrap up the last mission,

852
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:41,900
we can go anywhere and do anything.

853
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,990
Not sure if they’d come with us, though.

854
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,970
Just tell me where, and I'll go with you.

855
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:54,800
My engine’s hot and ready.

856
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,720
Style, you fearless jerk.

857
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:02,790
This is probably the first time I’ve seen my brother-in-law laugh.

858
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,190
Brother-in-law?

859
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:07,950
Bold.

860
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,540
Hello, brother-in-law.

861
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,760
Let’s not get in touch for a while
	for everyone’s safety.

862
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:32,070
In the end, we can only wait for them to come back to us.

863
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:35,370
Didn’t you say we should stay away for a while?

864
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,330
I got worried about you.

865
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:38,210
You need to let me help with your last mission.

866
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:40,180
I’ll help you start over with me.

867
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,340
You have me watching your back.

868
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:43,380
Don’t worry.

869
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,030
You and I will be alright.
