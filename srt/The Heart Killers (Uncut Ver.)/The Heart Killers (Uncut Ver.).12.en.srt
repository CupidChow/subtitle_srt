1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,820
(Previously)
Kant.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,790
I'm done running.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,900
Five years behind bars…

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,560
That's still better than
running all our lives.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,560
We have one day together.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,840
I want to make the most out of it.

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,930
Let's do something that
will become good memories.

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,200
What you want to do,
where to go, what to eat,

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,160
just let me know.

10
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:48,840
YEAR 1

11
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,510
What's wrong?

12
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:37,960
No energy?

13
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,990
Yeah.

14
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,890
How'd I have any
when I barely got any sleep last night?

15
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,970
The guy next to me kept
putting his leg on me all night.

16
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,550
We have to be here for five years.

17
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,500
Get used to it.

18
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,880
If he puts his leg on you,

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,740
just do the same to him.

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,740
Easier said than done.

21
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,030
Dude looks super scary.

22
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,190
Just exhaust yourself with exercises.

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,010
It'll help you sleep at night.

24
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,970
Hey.

25
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,710
That's my place.

26
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,600
Come on.

27
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,520
The equipment is for everyone, isn't it?

28
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,900
What, pretty boy?

29
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,590
You wanna get in trouble?

30
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,590
It's my workout time.

31
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,370
It's not like you can book this in advance,

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,420
can you?

33
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,380
I don't see anyone's name on these things.

34
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,780
Or did your daddy book it ahead for you?

35
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,120
Hey, newbie.

36
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,660
You run your mouth.

37
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,970
Just watch your back.

38
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,130
A petite pretty boy
like you is just my type.

39
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,230
You should be my plaything.

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,230
Let's stay out of each other's way.

41
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,220
You can exercise here all you want.

42
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,060
Why'd you let him have it?

43
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,200
It'll just get to his
head that he's all that.

44
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,060
It's not worth it.

45
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,020
We have to be here for another five years.

46
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,010
Don't get yourself an enemy so fast.

47
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,400
How are you?

48
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,580
You have bags under your eyes.

49
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,310
Do you get any sleep at all?

50
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,310
Hardly.

51
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,910
I can't really sleep much.

52
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,490
I'm worried about you…

53
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,590
Are you sure you got this?

54
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,490
Of course.

55
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,800
Don't worry about me.

56
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,740
I'm just not used to it yet.

57
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,910
It'll take some time.

58
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,540
What about you?

59
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,460
How are you?

60
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,970
I'm so-so.

61
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,480
Some TV star got a tattoo
from me and posted it online.

62
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,030
People showed up at my studio after that.

63
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,410
So I've been busy lately.

64
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,890
But that's good.

65
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,100
It's making really good money.

66
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,980
You're a celebrity tattoo artist now.

67
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,190
Don't forget me when you're famous.

68
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,770
I won't.

69
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,770
How could I?

70
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,420
You have my heart and my body…

71
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,310
Penguin.

72
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,290
Babe asked me to give you a book.

73
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,440
He said it'll keep you
company when you're bored.

74
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,720
Thank him for me.

75
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,160
How are you?

76
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,500
I'm okay.

77
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,650
It's not that bad here.

78
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,500
I'll get by.

79
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,980
Really?

80
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,300
You sure you're not saying
that just to make me happy?

81
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,140
I've seen some interviews,

82
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,920
and the people who have
been here said it was awful.

83
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,220
It's not that bad.

84
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,790
I really miss you, though.

85
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,570
When you do, just come visit.

86
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,160
How's the garage?

87
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,480
It's been busy.

88
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,240
Dad's pretty much retired,

89
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,900
so I'm taking over everything.

90
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,740
Do you know how my burger joint is?

91
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,220
The landlord sold the place.

92
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,540
But it's still a burger joint.

93
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,340
Not a thing has changed.

94
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,330
Except the name, though.

95
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,250
I'll find a way to buy it
back when I'm out of here.

96
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,250
We can deal with that later.

97
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,780
If you can't get the place back,

98
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,080
I'll help you find another location.

99
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,890
Is there anything you want?

100
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,460
I'll leave it with the warden.

101
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,490
I don't want anything.

102
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,930
Just seeing your face
will last me a whole month.

103
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,660
What did they feed you in there?

104
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,370
You're way too sweet.

105
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,120
If you say such sweet things,

106
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,220
it'll only make me want to hold you

107
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,800
and kiss you even more, you know?

108
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,540
Kant, I can't do this.

109
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,760
Who'd be able to just watch
their boyfriend go to jail, really?

110
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,990
The worst part is only getting
a few minutes to talk to him.

111
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,130
I see him but I can't touch him.

112
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,820
We're so close but it feels so far.

113
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,850
I get your drift.

114
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,250
I wanna break through
the bars just to get to him.

115
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,300
It makes me feel bad just
seeing the look in his eyes.

116
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,100
Is there no way we could
hold them in our arms again?

117
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,330
There's a special visit
day, but only once a year.

118
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,270
Once a year is hardly enough.

119
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,410
I think I have an idea
that will give us more than just a hug.

120
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,420
What are you thinking?

121
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,700
"The Heart Killers"
(Episode 12)

122
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,490
Hey, pretty boy.

123
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,500
Where are you off to?

124
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,610
Let's have a little chat.

125
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,970
What do you wanna chat about now?

126
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,420
I gave you back your dumbbells, didn't I?

127
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,430
They're all yours.

128
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,970
I'm done lifting weights.

129
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,110
I want a different kind of exercise,

130
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,460
something strenuous and sexy.

131
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,420
Will you just leave me alone?

132
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,620
Be my baby,

133
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,570
and I'll take you under my wing.

134
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,240
I promise you your life
here will be damn comfy.

135
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,980
Not interested.

136
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,810
I have a boyfriend,

137
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,840
and he's waiting for me out there.

138
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,930
He already takes good care of me.

139
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,000
How lovely.

140
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,980
Whatever your boyfriend can't do,

141
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,420
I'll do it.

142
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,360
Hey.

143
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
Let go of me!

144
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,230
Don't think you can just make me your baby!

145
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,920
If you want a lover, then be
nice and don't force it on them!

146
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,980
I know I'm cute, but I
can't be messed with!

147
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,340
Hey, what's going on here?

148
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,350
What are you doing?

149
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,000
He was trying to force
me, but I wouldn't let him.

150
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,000
They'll leave you alone
from now on, I take it?

151
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,480
Being smashed by a dipper
repeatedly did the job, I guess.

152
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,200
You're lucky the warden was understanding.

153
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,370
Or else you'd have been locked up alone.

154
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,730
As if a man like me would
let just anyone have me,

155
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,130
and he ain't even good-looking.

156
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,390
Hey, you two.

157
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,110
I heard you worked in a
restaurant when you were outside.

158
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,330
Yes.

159
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,090
I worked at a burger joint.

160
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,450
The kitchen is short-staffed right now.

161
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,340
Can you cook Thai food?

162
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,280
Yes.

163
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,280
I can make the basics like
stir fried dishes and soups.

164
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,580
Good.

165
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,200
Go help out in the kitchen, then.

166
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:56,980
Of course.

167
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,980
Can I bring my brother with me?

168
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,980
I think I'll need an extra pair of hands.

169
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,800
Fine.

170
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,170
Don't let me see you two slacking off.

171
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,700
If you don't do your job,

172
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,520
I'm putting you on crap-cleaning duty.

173
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,780
Oh, I won't slack off at all, sir.

174
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,370
I'll be the perfect sous chef.

175
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:17,980
Yes, chef!

176
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,440
Good.

177
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,260
Before you go to the kitchen,

178
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,640
make sure the floor's clean.

179
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,450
Yes.

180
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,210
Of course.

181
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,200
Yes, chef.

182
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,510
Yes, chef.

183
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,600
Yes, chef.

184
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,170
Do your job.

185
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:41,970
What?

186
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,850
You want me to put you in jail?

187
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,600
Yes, Cap.

188
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,880
We want to go to jail.

189
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,400
You dimwits.

190
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,210
What do you want to go there for?

191
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,750
I wanna see my boyfriend.

192
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,770
You two are crazy.

193
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Can't you just visit them?

194
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,240
It's not enough.

195
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,980
All we can do is talk to
them through a glass window.

196
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,620
I want to touch him,

197
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,520
to feel him,

198
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,640
to hold him,

199
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,080
to kiss him.

200
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,870
And I want to…

201
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,580
You're one lovesick bastard.

202
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,920
So?

203
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:39,340
You're gonna steal, kill, and
sell drugs just to get locked up?

204
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,970
Think about it.

205
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,290
I literally just helped
you wipe your slate clean.

206
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,290
That's not what I have in mind.

207
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,500
I have a better way.

208
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,690
I just need you to pull
some strings for us.

209
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,650
Do you know someone on the inside?

210
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,490
A few.

211
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,440
Don't tell me you want me to
help you reenact Prison Break?

212
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,130
Do you have a tattoo of a map or something?

213
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,300
You watch too much TV, Cap.

214
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,290
My plan is even better than that.

215
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,900
It's so much better in the
kitchen, don't you think?

216
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,770
I can easily get through five
years if we're here all the time.

217
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,360
At least it's something I'm good at.

218
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,920
You're right.

219
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,020
I miss your cooking.

220
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,020
The last guy was too
heavy-handed on the salt.

221
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,970
Thought I'd have to get my
kidney replaced when I'm out.

222
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,910
Am I right?

223
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Get your hands busy, not your mouth.

224
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,390
The prisoners will be here soon.

225
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,980
And don't get too giddy,

226
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,980
'cause you won't get to
be in the kitchen all day.

227
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,490
You're taking vocational training, too.

228
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,610
What kind of vocational training?

229
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,280
All sorts of kinds.

230
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,380
There's carving, fortune
telling, drawing, fixing cars.

231
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,010
All sorts of things for you to choose from.

232
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,010
Hurry up and finish it.

233
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:10,610
Yes.

234
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,300
I think I'll go for drawing.

235
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,610
You wanna join me?

236
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,610
I don't like drawing.

237
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,770
You go for it.

238
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,580
What will you do?

239
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,010
Just sit around being bored?

240
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,660
Don't worry about me.

241
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,590
I'll find something to do.

242
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,040
[VOCATIONAL TRAINING FOR PRISONERS: ART]

243
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,210
Hey, is this seat taken?

244
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:56,770
Nah.

245
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,570
You can sit.

246
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,320
Hey.

247
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,980
Where's the teacher?

248
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,590
Are we allowed to just
paint whatever we want?

249
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,700
He went to get more supply.

250
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,970
He'll be back soon.

251
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,160
Sorry, guys.

252
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,440
I had to get us more supply.

253
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,600
Kant?

254
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,180
We'll draw some flowers and vases today.

255
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,940
We'll learn about light and shadow.

256
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,940
Has anyone taken an art course before?

257
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,420
So everyone has, except you.

258
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,040
Why did you want to study art now?

259
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,720
I think I'm too rough around the edges
and too brutish.

260
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,140
I think art might be able to soften me up.

261
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,690
Alright.

262
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,020
I guess I'll have to pay attention to
you especially so you know all the basics.

263
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,060
[THE INSIDE OF AN ENGINE]

264
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
…It's pretty exciting.

265
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,080
It makes you feel energetic and happy.

266
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,800
I'll be teaching you the basics
of auto repair today, though.

267
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,570
Let's save dancing for later.

268
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,580
Oh, hey.

269
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,990
Don't just stand there.

270
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,050
You wanna join this class or what?

271
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,690
I do want to join.

272
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,760
Is it okay if I don't know the
first thing about fixing cars?

273
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,060
It's alright.

274
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,860
You'll get to learn all about it.

275
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,740
If you want to, that is.

276
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,590
I'll show you every
nook and cranny of a car.

277
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,420
You'll definitely find some
use for what you learn from me.

278
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,410
But if you still can't fix cars after that,

279
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,850
I'll fix them for you.

280
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,960
You said you didn't know the basics,

281
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,460
but you nailed this
light and shadow lesson.

282
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,210
I have a gift for it, I guess.

283
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,910
There's something you're
just good at without learning.

284
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,600
I guess I have nothing to teach you, then?

285
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,930
Do teach me.

286
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,940
I still need some advice from a pro.

287
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,730
Follow me.

288
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,760
You seriously broke your pencil?

289
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,840
Oh…

290
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,760
Yes.

291
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,770
I must have used too much
strength when I was drawing.

292
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,950
It's quite okay.

293
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,740
But we're out of pencils right now.

294
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,970
I'll go get some from
behind the meeting room.

295
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,750
Sir.

296
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
I'm going to get some
pencils for the students.

297
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,430
Yes.

298
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,000
Thanks.

299
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,980
Warden, may I go to the toilet, please?

300
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,970
I'll be back to finish my drawing.

301
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,400
Told you I'd never stay away, didn't I?

302
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,510
I thought you'd do something
illegal just to get in here.

303
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,000
This is way better.

304
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,780
I get to be close to you
and to touch you just like I wanted to.

305
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:43,860
Style!

306
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,650
You'll be in trouble if the guard sees you.

307
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,330
So?

308
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,690
Why would I come here if I don't
get to do anything with you at all?

309
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,970
I can't help you.

310
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,480
You said you'd be patient,

311
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,760
and you're already losing it?

312
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,690
A guy has wants and needs, you know?

313
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,940
Guys.

314
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,940
Do you mind putting the tools
back in place when you're done?

315
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,520
That's all for today.

316
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,230
I'll see you again next week.

317
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,230
I'll make sure you can
all run a garage one day.

318
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,650
Kant.

319
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,600
How'd you get here?

320
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,660
Let's say I have some strings I could pull.

321
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,570
But you won't get into any
trouble for this, will you?

322
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,510
I'm worried about you.

323
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,730
Don't be.

324
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,140
Captain talked to some people for me.

325
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,970
We just can't be too obvious about this.

326
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,510
I'll be coming here to teach from now on.

327
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,260
But... won't it be a waste of time for you?

328
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,500
Seeing you will make me happy.

329
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,500
I'll get to meet you,

330
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,600
and touch you just like this.

331
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,000
I've been dying to do that
since the moment I saw you.

332
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:16,900
You're crazy.

333
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,790
Love will make people do crazy things.

334
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,420
Save your sweet words.

335
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,470
How did you get in here?

336
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,730
It's thanks to Kant's connections.

337
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,470
I'll be teaching here regularly.

338
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,290
So I'll see you every week.

339
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,670
You know…

340
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,980
You don't have to do this.

341
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,640
I don't mind seeing you once a month
or once every three months.

342
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,670
I did everything I could
to be with you, you know?

343
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,420
You don't appreciate that?

344
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,710
Or did you already find someone here?

345
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,280
I'd expect it of a popular guy like you.

346
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,000
Come here.

347
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,730
No matter where I am,

348
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,110
you're the only one for me.

349
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:50,370
Once you're done cleaning that,

350
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,730
put it back where it comes from.

351
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:53,810
Yes, sir.

352
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,620
I'll see you again next week.

353
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,100
I'm counting on ya.

What are you reading?

357
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,600
It's the book Babe gave me.

358
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,600
It's got a way to escape prison, you know?

359
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,220
And what are you gonna do with it?

360
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,420
Break out of jail?

361
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,420
I've been thinking about it.

362
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,440
Maybe I'll escape through the
toilet sewage on a rainy night,

363
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,410
like in a movie.

364
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:04,940
What do you think?

365
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,700
That's positively unhygienic.

366
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,320
Don't count me in if
you're serious about that.

367
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,690
You're on your own.

368
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,690
I want to barf just thinking about it.

369
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,790
Happy birthday.

370
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,880
Whoa, Fadel.

371
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,250
I can't make you an actual cake,

372
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,520
so you're only getting a banana muffin.

373
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,310
It's alright.

374
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,170
I've been in here so long that
the days blur into each other.

375
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,640
Birthdays no longer matter.

376
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,310
But it feels great when
someone remembers, though.

377
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,530
Thanks.

378
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,300
You're really…

379
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,650
The best brother ever.

380
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,210
That's enough.

381
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,920
I'm going to go work out.

382
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,800
Wash my clothes, will you?

383
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,800
Oh, you jerk.

384
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,460
Were you being nice just to use me?

385
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,350
Don't forget to hang them out to dry.

386
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,200
Sis. Big sis.

387
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,320
Hmm?

388
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,890
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

389
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,980
See what?

390
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,690
Behind the clothes line.

391
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,780
Oh, it's all normal around here.

392
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,220
We gotta be discreet about doing it.

393
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm keeping watch, actually.

394
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,530
And I was nice enough to ask for
only a pack of cigarettes in return.

395
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,220
Really?

396
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,020
Yeah.

397
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:58,650
It kinda feels like you're
a dingy motel owner,

398
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,920
like a small business kind of thing.

399
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,980
It kinda feels fulfilling, really,

400
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,050
to see people have fun and be happy.

401
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,800
I've been here forever
and I never have anyone.

402
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,530
What about you?

403
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,320
You're very pretty.

404
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,450
Don't you have anyone?

405
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,090
Of course I do.

406
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,210
He's outside.

407
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,980
There are other people outside,
as there are inside.

408
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,420
Who'd wait for you when
your sentence is so long?

409
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,560
I'm sure he has someone
else who gets his needs met.

410
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,510
Don't stare at them so much.

411
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,780
I can see the look in your eyes.

412
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,780
Don't make fun of me.

413
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,860
We're painting outside
today for a change of scenery.

414
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,320
Maybe it'll give you guys
some new ideas, am I right?

415
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,970
Yes.

416
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:07,960
Happy birthday to you.

417
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,400
You remember?

418
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,880
Of course.

419
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,880
I remember everything about you.

420
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,940
Too bad.

421
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,930
If we were outside,

422
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,620
I might have surprised you
with a northern light hunting trip.

423
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,530
I don't dream much.

424
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:32,170
Just seeing your face today is already

425
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,970
a happy birthday to me.

426
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,660
I'll give you your present
once you get out of here.

427
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,120
Hey.

428
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,200
Can I… ask you something?

429
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,330
When you…

430
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,760
get…

431
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,080
get that kind of feeling,

432
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,290
what do you do?

433
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,810
What do you mean by “that kind of feeling”?

434
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,960
Well, you know…

435
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,680
This.

436
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,960
What do you mean?

437
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:20,940
Well…

438
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,450
Oh, you mean that kind of feeling.

439
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,990
I have myself to count on, don't I?

440
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,890
Does it always work?

441
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,170
I wouldn't mind if you
find someone, you know?

442
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,260
It's physical-only, of course.

443
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,600
Don't you get your heart involved.

444
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:53,820
No.

445
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,130
I belong to you, with
my whole heart and body.

446
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,690
Hey.

447
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,220
Harassing a prisoner is illegal, you know?

448
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,540
Alright.

449
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:13,620
I'll go to court and defend myself that
the prisoner is simply too irresistible.

450
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:20,840
Hey.

451
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,200
Listen.

452
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,210
I know what I want.

453
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:32,370
You can give it to me
right here and right now.

454
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,320
Sis.

455
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,220
I'm counting on you.

456
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,220
Is this how things are done around here?

457
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,500
Yeah.

458
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,330
When an urge arises, it's gotta
be done behind the clothes line.

459
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:12,460
Well, what are we doing that needs hiding?

460
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,040
I want my birthday present.

461
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,420
What birthday present?

462
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,380
Didn't you say you were
happy just seeing me?

463
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,610
Come on.

464
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,980
You know that won't be
enough for someone like me.

465
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:40,330
Didn't you threaten me with a trip
to the court just for a kiss just now?

466
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,980
If I do anything more than that,

467
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,620
you sure I won't be sentenced for life?

468
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,480
Why, you scared?

469
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,720
YEAR 4

470
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,310
This is called a breaker bar.

471
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,360
It comes with different size sockets.

472
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:54,750
There's the 17mm, 21mm, 23mm, and 19mm.

473
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,780
There's also…

474
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,650
Are you here for class?

475
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,050
No.

476
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:05,370
Babe.

477
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,910
They told me someone is here to visit you.

478
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,340
Thanks.

479
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,060
Sure, babe.

480
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,620
What were you doing?

481
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,850
Took you forever.

482
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,260
I went to see you at the
garage but you weren't there.

483
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,290
I'm sorry.

484
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,200
I've been super busy these days.

485
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,040
I might not be able to
come here so often now.

486
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,260
Why?

487
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,930
I told you.

488
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,660
Since Dad's been retired,

489
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,500
I have to take care of
everything by myself.

490
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,170
I'm also thinking of
expanding the business.

491
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,820
I've got a lot of projects going on,

492
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,230
and I got to meet so
many people in the industry.

493
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,890
It's been eye-opening.

494
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,400
That's good.

495
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,780
It's alright.

496
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,570
I understand.

497
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:20,610
You don't have to come
here to teach, you know?

498
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,880
Don't worry.

499
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,880
I'll make time for it.

500
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:30,180
But if I can't, I'll just
come visit you instead.

501
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,600
Is that okay?

502
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,210
What's wrong?

503
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,390
Are you mad at me?

504
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,930
No.

505
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,970
I understand you have to live your life.

506
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:03,160
I'm in here so there's
nothing I can do but wait.

507
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,840
Style, I think…

508
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,490
Our timing just wasn't right at all.

509
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,990
What are you talking about?

510
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,600
I think you should focus on your future.

511
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,960
Coming here to see me,

512
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,800
with such a long way to travel,

513
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,560
it's just a waste of your time.

514
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,000
Working here doesn't
pay you a dime, does it?

515
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,090
It doesn't compare to fixing
some expensive cars, you know?

516
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,920
You shouldn't waste your time on me.

517
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,000
It's not a waste of time.

518
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,260
You're my boyfriend.

519
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,980
I will always make time for you.

520
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,190
Work is important, but
you're also important to me.

521
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,080
Before you went to jail,

522
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,480
you told me to focus on my own life.

523
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,490
Now that I'm doing exactly that,

524
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,600
are you sulking?

525
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,410
I'm not sulking.

526
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,140
Just do what you want.

527
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,630
Don't take me into account.

528
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,380
Hey, Fadel.

529
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,200
Wait.

530
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,180
I have work in the kitchen.

531
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,590
Don't want these prisoners to starve.

532
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,700
Thank you.

533
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:38,130
Think of Style Auto
when your car is in trouble.

534
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,000
Thank you.

535
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,330
You always only fixed a few cars a month.

536
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,340
What's going on?

537
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,260
Are you in need of money or what?

538
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,230
Not really.

539
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,530
I just want to save up some, is all.

540
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,270
What for?

541
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,520
You buying a new car?

542
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,180
Why would I want a new one?

543
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,180
I just finished upgrading
the one I have, didn't I?

544
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,370
Wait. Don't tell me…

545
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,410
You're thinking of buying a love nest?

546
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,410
Are you getting married?

547
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,600
I'm not.

548
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,300
You're jumping to conclusions.

549
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,020
Aren't you glad I work hard?

550
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Where's Fadel been, though?

551
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,820
He's… going to culinary school abroad.

552
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,620
He'll be back.

553
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,600
Good.

554
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,040
I'm rooting for him.

555
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,510
You need a lot of trust when it
comes to long distance relationships.

556
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,000
Be patient, son.

557
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,000
You'll be back together soon.

558
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,710
What's that you're eating?

559
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:56,740
Pad kaprao.

560
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,650
You want some?

561
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,460
Nah. All yours.

562
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,640
Kant.

563
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,460
I want a tattoo.

564
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,970
Will you do it for me?

565
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,200
What gave you that idea?

566
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,310
Well, life has been memorable lately.

567
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,490
Well said.

568
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,490
What kind of tattoo do you want?

569
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,510
I want a tattoo of your name.

570
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,440
No way.

571
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,020
People will make fun of you for that.

572
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,050
People have their parents'
names tattooed all the time.

573
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,190
Why can't I have the name of the
most important person in my life tattooed?

574
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,440
Fair warning…

575
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,080
Once you get your first tatt,

576
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,290
one won't be enough.

577
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,780
Don't you want a tattoo anymore?

578
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,440
Follow me.

579
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,240
Sit still.

580
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,040
But it hurts.

581
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,910
You sure you're not messing it up?

582
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,910
I've been doing this
for years, come on now.

583
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,620
You sure the spelling is correct?

584
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,550
Yeah.

585
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,370
As if I'd misspell my own name.

586
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,340
You're funny.

587
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,580
You complain a lot, don't you?

588
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,830
And you're prissy.

589
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,820
Other artists never take as
long as you for one tattoo.

590
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:34,580
You wanna finish the rest yourself?

591
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,160
I don't know how.

592
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,990
Then keep quiet.

593
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,520
Won't you go and see Style?

594
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,570
He's here twice a week
and you refuse to go to class.

595
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,290
You refuse his visit when he's here, too.

596
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,210
I'm busy.

597
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,720
I don't have time.

598
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,390
“Don't have time,” my foot.

599
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,290
You're in here only during mealtimes.

600
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,320
What do you even do the rest of the day?

601
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:14,500
I don't want to learn
how to fix cars anymore.

602
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,950
I want to try my hand at massaging.

603
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,580
Massage?

604
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,580
You, learning how to massage?

605
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,140
You'll break someone's bones.

606
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
You'll be my first client,
and I'll do it with my foot.

607
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,450
Shut your trap

608
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,480
or I'll tell the guard you
want to be on toilet duty.

609
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,860
Fine. Fine.

610
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,120
I'll leave you alone.

611
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,180
Style asked me to give you this, though.

612
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,260
He said he got it from someone
who takes origami training.

613
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:47,380
I'm gone.

614
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,760
Chop the rest of the pork, will you?

615
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,410
Thought you'd never see me again.

616
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:33,990
What do you want?

617
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,810
What are you mad at me about?

618
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,010
I'm not mad at you.

619
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,030
I told you

620
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,200
I don't like expectations because
I don't want to be disappointed.

621
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,620
But I didn't do anything to disappoint you.

622
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,500
Coming to see me regularly,

623
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,420
getting me used to seeing you,

624
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,720
making me miss you,

625
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,020
and suddenly disappearing…

626
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,460
How do you think that made me feel?

627
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,160
If you can't do it, don't
promise me anything.

628
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:14,390
Do you know how easy it is
to overthink when I'm here?

629
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:18,960
If you have something
important to do, just focus on it.

630
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,840
I don't want to slow you down.

631
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,370
You're the most important thing to me.

632
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,310
I'm doing something
for both of our futures.

633
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,740
What are you doing?

634
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,990
Can you tell me?

635
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,690
Can you wait a little longer?

636
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,010
I want to be certain about it first.

637
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,090
I want to make sure I really can do it.

638
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,570
You really love surprising me, don't you?

639
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,900
Come back to class.

640
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,990
I've been taking the course for years,
and I still don't know how to fix anything.

641
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,400
All you do is yap.

642
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,210
But that's exactly what
you love about me, isn't it?

643
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:28,160
This…

644
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,420
It's cute.

645
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,920
Help me clean the blackboard.

646
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,620
And now you're ordering me around.

647
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,560
YEAR 5

648
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,800
I've missed you.

649
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:13,970
I see you so often, and you still miss me?

650
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:15,930
Of course.

651
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:18,320
Even one minute away
from you makes me miss you.

652
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:19,410
Hear that?

653
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,680
He said he missed him and all that.

654
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,120
Did you miss me at all?

655
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,330
I'm not saying it.

656
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,840
Come on, Fadel.

657
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,370
Easy, man.

658
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,180
I'm showing it.

659
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,330
What do you want to do now?

660
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,600
Go straight home or do
you wanna go somewhere?

661
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,780
I don't have a home to go back to.

662
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,890
There's always my place.

663
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:04,140
Let's do that later.

664
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,820
I want to go out and about.

665
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,170
Savor this freedom.

666
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:08,610
If you want.

667
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,480
Hey, can you guys drop
me off near my place first?

668
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:16,480
Of course.

669
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,400
What do you mean, “your place”?

670
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,220
The garage?

671
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:22,330
You'll know soon.

672
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:24,080
Let's get in.

673
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:29,990
Please.

674
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,900
Hey, watch my leg.

675
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:40,960
You alright?

676
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,180
Is this how fast you can go?

677
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,470
Oh, dang.

678
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:44,260
Take that!

679
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:52,610
Is it getting familiar now?

680
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:55,450
Are we there yet?

681
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:56,910
Yes.

682
00:47:58,650 --> 00:47:59,490
Ready?

683
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,980
In three, two… one.

684
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,000
You said it was sold to someone.

685
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,980
I bought it back.

686
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,510
You didn't have to.

687
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:43,690
I worked my ass off to
buy this place back for you.

688
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:48,590
That means…

689
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,380
When you weren't coming to see me,

690
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,290
you were…

691
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:56,700
Yeah.

692
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,660
I wasn't sure I could
do it so I didn't tell you.

693
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,970
But the image of you
being back in this restaurant

694
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,610
gave me this great strength
to fix at least a hundred cars.

695
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,180
Thank you for doing this
for me and for waiting for me.

696
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:24,890
Well, I love you.

697
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,300
Of course I can wait.

698
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:33,080
Whether it's five, ten, or twenty years,

699
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,190
I'll wait for you.

700
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:52,800
I'll work hard to pay you back.

701
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:54,060
No.

702
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,020
This place isn't mine alone.

703
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,100
It's ours.

704
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,730
I'm here to support you in all your dreams.

705
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,440
I sure am a lucky guy.

706
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,060
I've been doing bad things my entire life,

707
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,980
but I have the best boyfriend in the world.

708
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,970
It's all thanks to Kant
for daring me to take you out.

709
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:48,640
From now on,

710
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,220
everything is yours.

711
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:04,870
Let's go.

712
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,220
Freedom sure smells so fresh.

713
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,090
I doubt it.

714
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,750
I checked and it said
the pollution is bad today.

715
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:27,040
Come on.

716
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,400
Cut me some slack.

717
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:29,900
I've been in prison for years, you know?

718
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,230
It smelled depressing there.

719
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,640
What are you going to do now?

720
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,280
The house you and Fadel used
to live in was seized by the police.

721
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:45,620
I don't know.

722
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,090
I guess…

723
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,440
I'm starting over from zero.

724
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,260
It's not zero.

725
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,420
You have me.

726
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:05,190
With me by your side,
you're starting from five.

727
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:09,400
We'll build the rest together
until we're back to ten.

728
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,230
How about that?

729
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:23,200
Move in with me.

730
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,750
No way.

731
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:28,670
I can't do that.

732
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:29,980
I can't impose on Babe like that.

733
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,400
Babe won't be there for you to impose on.

734
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,400
He just won a scholarship to study abroad.

735
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:37,810
Once he's there, I'm all alone.

736
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,850
I'll be super lonely.

737
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,240
You must make me pay rent.

738
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,370
How much rent is due?

739
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,820
It won't be too costly.

740
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:48,890
How about some…

741
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,940
hugs and kisses every day?

742
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,350
Sure thing.

743
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:59,170
Move in with me.

744
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:00,420
Alright.

745
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,060
But only till I'm back on my feet.

746
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:07,460
I don't want to depend so much on you
or Fadel, for that matter.

747
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,460
He should be focusing on his restaurant.

748
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:13,860
As for someone who doesn't
know what he wants, like me,

749
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,450
I'll just be looking for it for a while.

750
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:19,040
Alright.

751
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:24,290
But if you ever need my
help, you gotta let me know.

752
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,660
I'm here for you.

753
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,570
Thank you.

754
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:36,630
Oh, the fish are gigantic.

755
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,070
The door's unlocked.

756
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:05,990
Babe, you know you left the door unlocked?

757
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,890
What happened?

758
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,380
Why is the place all messy?

759
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,600
Babe!

760
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:19,560
Babe!

761
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,400
Babe!

762
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,290
Babe!

763
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,400
Maybe he's with some friends?

764
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,250
Hey, Knot.

765
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:44,260
It's Kant.

766
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:46,250
Is Babe with you?

767
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:48,660
Okay.

768
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:51,050
If you see Babe, can you call me?

769
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:56,470
This doesn't seem right.

770
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,170
Dad.

771
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,170
Dad, Fadel's here to see you.

772
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,140
Oh, where's my dad?

773
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:11,160
I haven't seen him, sir.

774
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,240
By the way…

775
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,810
Someone left this for you.

776
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,960
Who?

777
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:22,830
A woman with long hair.

778
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,040
She looked really fierce.

779
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:27,350
I think she's loaded. She
was driving a Mercedes.

780
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,760
She's probably some bigshot.

781
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,670
“Dinner with Mom.”

782
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,620
Whose Mom?

783
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:13,460
I think I know.

784
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:30,350
Give up your guns.

785
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,090
Babe.

786
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,200
Kant, help me!

787
00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:58,800
Dad.

788
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,180
Tyle.

789
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:01,590
What's going on?

790
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:02,940
What is this all about?

791
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,110
I'll tell you soon.

792
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,800
Guys, why don't you sit down?

793
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:44,300
You probably don't know,

794
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,300
but your son,

795
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,470
and your brother,

796
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:52,370
together with my sons,

797
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,370
threw me in jail.

798
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:57,420
They probably thought
I'd be in there for life.

799
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:04,530
They must have forgotten that
money can buy even freedom.

800
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:08,730
What the hell do you want now?

801
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:11,990
Is that how you talk to your mother, Fadel?

802
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:19,980
I lost everything because of you.

803
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:22,640
My reputation, the trust I built,

804
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:24,260
my connection,

805
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,330
even my employees…

806
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,180
Everything was ruined because of you.

807
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:30,770
As it should be.

808
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,980
You don't deserve anything.

809
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,100
Let them go and deal with me!

810
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,020
What satisfaction would that give me?

811
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,020
It was me who exposed you.

812
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:54,320
I masterminded the whole thing.

813
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,890
If you want to kill someone,

814
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,140
kill me.

815
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:06,760
Just let my brother go.

816
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,180
Kant was right.

817
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:13,970
Let my Dad go.

818
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,250
He doesn't know anything.

819
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,250
I don't care what you do to me.

820
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,651
So it was your hero complex

821
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:29,057
that made Fadel and Bison
fall head over heels for you.

822
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:32,371
Don't worry.

823
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:36,862
I prepared some drinks for everyone.

824
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:40,291
You will all…

825
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:43,828
die here together.

826
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,188
Don't be afraid, Babe.

827
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:56,902
Dad.

828
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:00,582
I'm sorry.

829
01:00:02,611 --> 01:00:04,580
If you're being tricky,

830
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,771
I don't guarantee these
two will walk free afterwards.

831
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,691
Please.

832
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:17,228
Give us another chance

833
01:00:19,045 --> 01:00:21,040
to help you build back what's yours.

834
01:00:25,502 --> 01:00:27,040
Just please let them go.

835
01:00:32,017 --> 01:00:34,010
I'll kill for you again, Mother.

836
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:42,422
I'll listen to everything you say.

837
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,811
But please let them go.

838
01:00:49,994 --> 01:00:50,748
Mother.

839
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:53,377
Of course.

840
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:02,280
But after you give these two the drink.

841
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:07,125
I'll let you, and your boyfriends, go.

842
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,222
Can you do that?

843
01:01:24,971 --> 01:01:25,697
Yes.

844
01:01:26,154 --> 01:01:26,931
Yes.

845
01:01:27,754 --> 01:01:28,588
Hey.

846
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,777
Bison.

847
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:33,377
Take your pick.

848
01:01:34,697 --> 01:01:35,720
A drink

849
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:38,262
or a bullet.

850
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:56,114
Hey.

851
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,925
Kill me.

852
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,217
End it here.

853
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,548
Oh, I will.

854
01:02:37,994 --> 01:02:38,805
No question.

855
01:02:40,862 --> 01:02:41,971
Don't, Bison.

856
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,970
You did your time in prison.

857
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,434
Don't go back there.

858
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:52,548
I'm calling the cops right now.

859
01:02:52,577 --> 01:02:53,977
She won't get away this time.

860
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:55,291
Style.

861
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:57,828
Don't.

862
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:04,348
She'll die by my hand today.

863
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,880
If it doesn't end like this,

864
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:10,577
she's only coming back again later.

865
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,680
Don't you worry.

866
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:17,685
I won't kill you now.

867
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:22,994
Your death will be slow, torturing,

868
01:03:25,017 --> 01:03:25,982
and all alone.

869
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,097
Bison.

870
01:03:56,428 --> 01:03:57,022
Drink.

871
01:04:07,451 --> 01:04:08,268
Drink it.

872
01:04:10,148 --> 01:04:11,165
Drink it all!

873
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:17,068
You know, in prison,

874
01:05:17,085 --> 01:05:19,060
this was the image I always dreamed of.

875
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:21,828
What image?

876
01:05:22,674 --> 01:05:25,417
Being in your arms like this.

877
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,680
I just hope there's nothing
more for us to worry about.

878
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:33,120
Don't worry.

879
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:36,931
I even made my way to you
when you were in prison, didn't I?

880
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:39,097
I know you're great and all that.

881
01:05:39,114 --> 01:05:40,680
But I can't take that anymore.

882
01:05:40,714 --> 01:05:42,497
I don't want to be away from you anymore.

883
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,302
You won't have to.

884
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,300
If anyone hurts you from now on,

885
01:05:46,337 --> 01:05:47,977
I'll shoot them all in the face.

886
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,970
Pew, pew, pew!

887
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:52,942
You watch too many films.

888
01:05:58,350 --> 01:05:59,148
Oh, hey.

889
01:06:00,891 --> 01:06:01,640
What is it?

890
01:06:05,931 --> 01:06:06,731
What?

891
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:18,394
Plane tickets to Iceland?

892
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:20,268
Really?

893
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:21,514
Yeah.

894
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,634
When did you buy these?

895
01:06:27,068 --> 01:06:29,060
Just before you got out.

896
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:31,600
We'll finally get to be there together.

897
01:06:38,954 --> 01:06:41,240
You spoil me too much, you know?

898
01:06:41,274 --> 01:06:44,228
I won't ever want to leave.

899
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:45,971
Well, then, don't leave.

900
01:06:46,005 --> 01:06:47,360
Stay with me right here.

901
01:06:47,725 --> 01:06:49,977
I'll make all your dreams come true.

902
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:52,794
Wait, let me say that again…

903
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,234
I'll make all our dreams come true.

904
01:07:17,165 --> 01:07:18,234
Thank you, Kant.

905
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,862
We're going to Iceland!

906
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,857
Iceland!

907
01:07:26,914 --> 01:07:27,571
Hey!

908
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:37,982
Should I change the name of the restaurant?

909
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,742
Why?

910
01:07:42,057 --> 01:07:43,702
The name Heart Burger is fine.

911
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,260
It's our restaurant now.

912
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:51,211
I want you to be a part of it.

913
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,245
I don't think it needs much change.

914
01:07:57,130 --> 01:08:00,234
Just add an S and a heart.

915
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:04,291
That'll make a better version.

916
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:08,937
With another heart, that is.

917
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,228
Good.

918
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,240
That sounds like a good idea.

919
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:28,651
What's that?

920
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:31,965
Kant's car key.

921
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,388
It's mine now.

922
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:39,828
Because you took me out?

923
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,840
It was a deal, after all.

924
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:49,017
If I could make you fall
crazy in love with me,

925
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,120
I'd get his car.

926
01:08:51,234 --> 01:08:53,230
Then you should give the key back to Kant.

927
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,365
I'm not in love with you like that.

928
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:10,902
Are you sure

929
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,531
that you're not head
over heels in love with me?

930
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,548
How much do you love me?

931
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,440
Only 30%.

932
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,982
How much do you love me?

933
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:44,262
60% now.

934
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:27,114
How much do you love me?

935
01:10:33,788 --> 01:10:34,817
100%.

936
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:50,457
You know what?

937
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:53,811
Having you is worth
more than winning that car.

938
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,400
Let me know if you get sleepy or tired,

939
01:11:36,422 --> 01:11:37,474
we'll switch.

940
01:11:39,348 --> 01:11:40,514
It's alright.

941
01:11:40,548 --> 01:11:41,954
I love driving.

942
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:44,748
You can take a nap if you want.

943
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:47,765
Nah. I'd rather keep you company.

944
01:11:47,794 --> 01:11:49,594
You've been driving for hours, after all.

945
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,377
I won't get sleepy.

946
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:54,005
Your playlist really keeps me entertained.

947
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:57,690
I've put so much thought into it, you know?

948
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:00,080
There's a playlist for just chilling,

949
01:12:00,108 --> 01:12:01,708
for when you're sleepy,

950
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,085
even for when we're fighting.

951
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,114
Why would we fight?

952
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:10,474
Who knows?

953
01:12:10,885 --> 01:12:13,725
Maybe I get hungry and moody,

954
01:12:14,108 --> 01:12:17,120
or I give you wrong directions.

955
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:23,508
They said travelling is when you
really can tell if a couple will make it.

956
01:12:23,542 --> 01:12:24,960
It tests how much we
can tolerate each other.

957
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:26,222
I see.

958
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:29,182
But we got through
wanting to kill each other.

959
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,531
You don't think we'd make
it after something like that?

960
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:46,245
Hey.

961
01:12:46,891 --> 01:12:48,251
We've been driving a long time,

962
01:12:48,268 --> 01:12:49,657
and still haven't seen the northern lights.

963
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,325
I think we need to keep driving.

964
01:12:53,348 --> 01:12:56,617
Go somewhere out of
town with no light pollution.

965
01:12:57,222 --> 01:12:59,220
I think it'll be better
around where we camp.

966
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,308
Let's just hope we find it.

967
01:13:14,228 --> 01:13:15,171
Hey, look.

968
01:13:15,194 --> 01:13:17,170
It's below freezing out there.

969
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,760
I think we're going to get
frozen instantly if we go outside.

970
01:13:19,794 --> 01:13:21,988
Let's just cuddle to keep warm.

971
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:34,291
Are you going to be sad if we
don't see the northern lights?

972
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:38,400
A little.

973
01:13:38,428 --> 01:13:41,388
But if we don't see
them here, I'll keep going.

974
01:13:41,422 --> 01:13:44,308
If we don't see them in
Iceland, I'll go to Sweden,

975
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:47,422
Greenland, and Alaska.

976
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:49,420
I'll go anywhere in the
world until I find them.

977
01:13:49,697 --> 01:13:52,891
I guess I'll be there with
you every step of the way.

978
01:13:59,611 --> 01:14:00,257
Hey.

979
01:14:03,725 --> 01:14:04,405
What?

980
01:14:06,565 --> 01:14:07,657
Hey, come out and see!

981
01:14:16,817 --> 01:14:17,760
It's gorgeous.

982
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,897
It's worth all the miles
we've come, don't you think?

983
01:14:21,908 --> 01:14:22,600
Yeah.

984
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:32,771
You know, each culture has their
own myth of the northern lights.

985
01:14:35,045 --> 01:14:36,171
Do they?

986
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,245
Tell me.

987
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:44,582
Eskimo believes the northern lights are
a path of connection to their ancestors.

988
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:51,674
Finnish believe the northern lights occur
because a fox runs across the sky,

989
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:55,428
and his tail grazes the mountains,

990
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:58,011
making sparks that
become the northern lights.

991
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:01,982
You know…

992
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,834
This is so different from what I imagined.

993
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:06,891
How so?

994
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,588
In my head,

995
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:14,331
I'd be standing here watching
the northern lights all by myself.

996
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,760
But now you're here.

997
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:21,405
Getting to share my
dreams with someone I love,

998
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,302
it feels even better than
anything I ever imagined.

999
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,920
I made your dream come true.

1000
01:15:36,948 --> 01:15:40,622
But do you know that you've fulfilled
the meaning of life for me as well?

1001
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:42,537
What do you mean?

1002
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:43,731
Well…

1003
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,937
Kant means “the beloved,” right?

1004
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:51,120
Now I have someone
who calls me his “beloved,”

1005
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:54,194
and I also freaking love him.

1006
01:16:16,782 --> 01:16:17,611
Are you warm?

1007
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:32,902
It's Style.

1008
01:16:33,377 --> 01:16:34,211
Take the call.

1009
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:38,777
Hey, bud. What's up?

1010
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:40,097
Hey.

1011
01:16:40,411 --> 01:16:41,988
You guys seen the northern lights yet?

1012
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:42,811
Yeah.

1013
01:16:42,828 --> 01:16:43,760
Look.

1014
01:16:43,788 --> 01:16:44,982
It's beautiful.

1015
01:16:45,011 --> 01:16:46,668
We wish you were here.

1016
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:48,274
What are you doing?

1017
01:16:48,777 --> 01:16:50,270
Taking your car for a little drive.

1018
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:53,451
Rubbing it in my face, aren't you?

1019
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:55,640
Style.

1020
01:16:55,994 --> 01:16:56,520
Hey.

1021
01:16:56,542 --> 01:16:57,468
Where's Fadel?

1022
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:00,211
Say hello to your brother.

1023
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:02,405
Hey.

1024
01:17:02,434 --> 01:17:04,400
Have fun and be careful on your trip.

1025
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:05,914
Don't worry about me.

1026
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,440
I've got a boyfriend to take care of me.

1027
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,594
Hey, I have to go.

1028
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:16,462
Let's talk later.

1029
01:17:16,491 --> 01:17:17,994
Take lots of photos for us.

1030
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:19,588
Of course.

1031
01:17:19,897 --> 01:17:20,840
See you.

1032
01:17:21,411 --> 01:17:22,531
Bye.

1033
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:30,200
You wanna take a long trip like them?

1034
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:31,982
Of course.

1035
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,845
I usually travel with my Dad.

1036
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:37,810
Never done it with my boyfriend before.

1037
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:42,291
Let's plan something later, then.

1038
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:48,908
Now that your father knows
about my being a former hitman,

1039
01:17:48,931 --> 01:17:50,320
and a locked up criminal,

1040
01:17:50,851 --> 01:17:51,811
is he alright with it?

1041
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:54,560
He sure is.

1042
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:58,908
He said I need someone with
a past like yours to tie me down.

1043
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:02,531
You know,

1044
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:06,371
I still remember what I promised
your dad before I went to jail.

1045
01:18:07,674 --> 01:18:08,754
What did you promise?

1046
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,777
I told him I'd go talk
to him after five years.

1047
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,251
You're serious?

1048
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:19,371
I am.

1049
01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:21,822
I never go back on my words.

1050
01:18:22,937 --> 01:18:24,930
I'll do it after the
restaurant is back to normal.

1051
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:28,297
No need to hurry.

1052
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:31,531
I think the pace we're
going is already good.

1053
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:32,868
No need to push yourself.

1054
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:36,782
After everything that we've been through,

1055
01:18:36,817 --> 01:18:40,331
still staying together is already
beyond anything we expected.

1056
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:43,160
You're right.

1057
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,291
I thought I'd die alone.

1058
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:49,434
We'll die one day,

1059
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:52,931
but we'll die together of old age.

1060
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,171
You're so cheesy.

1061
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,068
Fadel, I'm driving!

1062
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:06,251
Hey, I'm driving!

1063
01:19:10,628 --> 01:19:11,977
Cuddling you is really warm.

1064
01:19:12,011 --> 01:19:12,931
Clearly.

1065
01:19:16,445 --> 01:19:18,434
You really are something, huh?
