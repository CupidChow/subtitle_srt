1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,730
Make them fall in love with us.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,970
That’s when we kill them.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,820
Cheers!

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,380
Bison!

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,660
We still have to see the northern lights together.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,790
I quit.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,840
If you don’t want to get in trouble,

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,550
go home and be with your little brother.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,240
Untie me and I’ll help you look for your brother.

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,940
I know you work for the police.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,970
Jump!

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,410
Once I find my brother,

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,990
I’m going to kill you and your friend.

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,170
Pull over here.

15
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,160
Why are we at a motel?

16
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,510
Did you get turned on while we were on the way or what?

17
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,870
Stop talking and hop off.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,140
What?

19
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,550
I’m just curious so I know what to expect.

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,270
It’s not like I can just turn the switch on, you know?

21
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,100
I’m not sleeping with you.

22
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,100
This is where I told Bison to go.

23
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,650
Now get off.

24
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:35,500
I’ll wait here.

25
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,590
No.

26
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,360
You come with me.

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,680
Walk ahead of me, actually.

28
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,130
Get off.

29
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,660
He used to come here,

30
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,660
but I haven’t seen him in a while.

31
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,390
Oh, you were always here with him.

32
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,810
You were, last time, too.

33
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,260
I want to know if he was here recently.

34
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,480
No.

35
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,820
I don’t think so.

36
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,640
Did something happen?

37
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,290
Did he run away from home?

38
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,960
Yes, actually.

39
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,710
He’s my boyfriend’s brother.

40
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,980
He’s a troubled kid so he ran away.

41
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,550
Ran off with a dude.

42
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:46,300
We’re worried about him so we’re looking for him.

43
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,700
I see.

44
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,030
He didn’t come this way.

45
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,550
And don’t waste your time looking for him.

46
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,630
You ought to let these kids have fun all they want.

47
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,490
They’ll come back when they’re sick of each other.

48
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,680
We parents can only do so much to take care of them,

49
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,550
but their hearts are out of our control.

50
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,720
Well, what about you two?

51
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,100
Need a room?

52
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:09,980
Yes.

53
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,760
No.

54
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,490
Hey.

55
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,200
Come on.

56
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,200
I’ve been driving all this way.

57
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,200
Can’t we just take a rest for a night?

58
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,060
It’s not like we’ll find your brother soon.

59
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,329
Isn’t it better to just get our sleep and think?

60
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,050
We can’t waste time.

61
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:25,860
We need to go.

62
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,180
We need to go?

63
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,210
My arms are sore from driving.

64
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,380
I can’t possibly drive like this.

65
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,150
Come on.

66
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,570
Just stay for the night.

67
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,970
Don’t you feel sorry for your boyfriend?

68
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,190
He’s literally begging.

69
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,090
He’s not my boyfriend.

70
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,720
He’s not?

71
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,340
It’s alright.

72
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,560
Let me put you up in the suite.

73
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,800
I’ll even give you free condoms and lube.

74
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,840
The narc habits are hard to kick, huh?

75
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,710
Your house?

76
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,190
Yeah.

77
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,210
Got a problem with that?

78
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,470
No.

79
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,100
You’re one hell of a wimp for a snitch.

80
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,720
Were you actually weak or faking it?

81
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,420
I wasn’t faking.

82
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,440
I just really don’t like the ocean.

83
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,770
I need a better excuse than that.

84
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,770
People have their fears, you know?

85
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,120
You didn’t seem to fear anything when you decided to fool me.

86
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,770
Think I’m easy, huh?

87
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,090
You don’t know me, Kant.

88
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,450
Give me a chance to explain.

89
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,780
I have my reason.

90
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,780
What the hell is that?

91
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,610
The only reason is that you’re an asshole.

92
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,040
I’ll tell you everything.

93
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,130
But please give me a chance.

94
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,570
Your chance has run out.

95
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,800
The rest of your life
	is to spend making up to me

96
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,060
for the way you made me feel.

97
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,110
And what did I make you feel?

98
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,700
Say it.

99
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,130
Say what you feel for me.

100
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,330
Give me a chance to explain myself.

101
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,250
And after that,

102
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,080
you can do whatever you want to me.

103
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,690
You’re in no position to negotiate.

104
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,350
The rest of your life belongs to me.

105
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,500
You’re going to die here.

106
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,809
Your wound still hurts?

107
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:41,789
Be careful.

108
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,980
Stay out of my business.

109
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
So we got out of one car to sleep in another?

110
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,200
Don’t you have any other room?

111
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,900
No, I don’t.

112
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,980
The place is fully booked.

113
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,750
I don’t know what’s in the air today,
	but it seems everyone just wants to get laid tonight.

114
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,880
It’s alright.

115
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,500
I love the theme.

116
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,770
Fast.

117
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,340
Hard.

118
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,390
Furious.

119
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,050
Well, get comfy, then.

120
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,370
Here’s the complimentary gifts.

121
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,440
I’ll put them here.

122
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,500
Damn.

123
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,470
I’ve never been to a motel like this,

124
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,800
and I’ve never had sex in a car as well.

125
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,400
Kinda like a fantasy, don’t you think?

126
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,380
Doing it in a car

127
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,720
with a mechanic.

128
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,210
You like that?

129
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,050
What the hell?

130
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,050
I ain’t running away, you know?

131
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,980
I don’t trust you.

132
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,620
And if I need to take a piss?

133
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,930
Tell me and I’ll uncuff you.

134
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,450
What about these complimentary gifts?

135
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,390
Not gonna use them?

136
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,340
How about… chains and whips?

137
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,800
I’m all in.

138
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,980
Didn’t you say you’re tired?

139
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,670
I bet it’s because you run your mouth too much.

140
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,570
Shut up and go to sleep.

141
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,390
Before you kill me,

142
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,690
can you do me a favor?

143
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,210
Tell my dad I love him.

144
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,250
Tell him to take care of himself.

145
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,070
If the garage becomes too taxing on him,
	tell him to quit it.

146
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,000
Tell him to spend his savings on traveling and fishing trips.

147
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,100
When I die,

148
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,760
I’ll probably see my mother.

149
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,660
She died when I was a kid.

150
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,130
And just tell Dad…

151
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,240
I’ll take care of her up there.

152
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,100
Are you crying?

153
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,480
Duh.

154
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,160
I know I talk all big,

155
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,200
but even I am afraid of death.

156
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,720
Stop being dramatic and just go to sleep.

157
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,960
I don’t want to hear your sob story.

158
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,310
What is this?

159
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,360
Don’t you know what a fishing net is?

160
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,800
Of course I do.

161
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,020
I’m asking what you want me to do with it.

162
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
I’m hardly asking you to tailor a suit out of it, am I?

163
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,010
Oh, come on.

164
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,310
It’s not unheard of.

165
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,490
I’ve seen it done before.

166
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,960
Don’t mess with me.

167
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,420
Catch some fish.

168
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,690
Hey.

169
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,900
I’m no fisherman.

170
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,910
And you know…

171
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,320
I can’t get in the water.

172
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,320
Then you’re going to starve to death.

173
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,320
I’m not here to feed you.

174
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:09,710
Okay.

175
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,800
I’ll try.

176
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,020
But can you at least let me call my brother?

177
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,140
I don’t want him to worry about me.

178
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,600
You ain’t in no place to make requests.

179
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,930
Know how generous I am to spare your brother.

180
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:21,740
Hey.

181
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,930
Don’t hurt him.

182
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,710
This is entirely on me.

183
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,690
My brother and my friend have nothing to do with this.

184
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,930
If you’re going to blame someone,

185
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,830
blame it on me.

186
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:35,990
Cool as hell.

187
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,300
Too late, though.

188
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,470
If you really loved your brother,

189
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,880
you shouldn’t have said yes to this job.

190
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,590
That’s exactly why I took it.

191
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,010
If I didn’t,

192
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,310
Captain was going to reopen my cases.

193
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,330
And if I went to jail,

194
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,400
Babe wouldn’t be able to live.

195
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,240
I’m all he has.

196
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,540
You don’t have to feel sorry for me.

197
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,980
But please think about Babe.

198
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,200
I don’t freaking care.

199
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,040
It’s a poor excuse.

200
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,040
You’re going to die here.

201
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,040
Don’t think you’ll ever see Babe again.

202
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,900
Maybe I’ll be generous, after all.

203
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,610
I might burn you to the ground and send the ashes to your brother.

204
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,380
Pick it up and catch some fish.

205
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,500
Do it!

206
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,100
Get in the water.

207
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,220
You’ll never catch anything in shallow water.

208
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,680
Can’t we just eat something else?

209
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,599
I really can’t do this.

210
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,319
Sure.

211
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,510
What would you like?

212
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,079
Kurobuta pork?

213
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,240
Wagyu beef?

214
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,589
Salmon?

215
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,599
Really?

216
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,990
I love salmon.

217
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,329
Sure.

218
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,140
I’ll send it as an offering.

219
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,290
You’ll be fed when you’re in hell.

220
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:26,930
How about that?

221
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,220
Keep going.

222
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:09,960
Hey.

223
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,940
There ain’t no fish around here.

224
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,600
Only trash and plastic bottles.

225
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,260
How irresponsible to throw these bottles into the ocean.

226
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,410
What if it killed Nemo?

227
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,670
This is no time to be environmentally conscious.

228
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,980
Catch some fish!

229
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,360
And pick up the trash.

230
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,260
Yeah, as if I’d catch anything.

231
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,460
What did you say?

232
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,930
This won’t be enough to feed anyone.

233
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,280
Of course it will.

234
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,400
It’s just the two of us.

235
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,800
Unless you expected me to catch a shark for a whole village?

236
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,000
Now light a fire.

237
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,070
Thought you had a stovetop?

238
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:14,940
No cooking gas.

239
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,860
You’re welcome to swim to the mainland to buy some.

240
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,370
Here.

241
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,330
They’re wet.

242
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,370
How should I even light a fire with this?

243
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,990
Do it.

244
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,770
If a caveman did it once, you can do it, too.

245
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,350
If Tom Hanks can make it out alive in that movie,

246
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,390
so can I.

247
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,110
Wilson.

248
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,120
Wilson.

249
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,620
The hell are you saying?

250
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,620
That’s your name.

251
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,810
In that Tom Hanks movie,

252
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,310
he’s got a volleyball for a friend called Wilson.

253
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,950
Your face is as round as a ball.

254
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,150
Never watched it.

255
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,980
It’s okay.

256
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,980
Wilson isn’t supposed to answer anyway.

257
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,200
He only listens.

258
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,140
Wilson.

259
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,530
You hungry?

260
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,210
I don’t know if we’ll get to eat today.

261
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,850
But don’t worry.

262
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,270
I’ll do my best.

263
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,910
It’s all my fault.

264
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:35,950
I’m sorry.

265
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,360
I’ll light a fire for us.

266
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,420
Root for me.

267
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,370
Smile.

268
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,070
Don’t get hangry now.

269
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,210
What, are you hurt?

270
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,980
Why didn’t you just give me this in the first place?

271
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,330
I just wanted to see you fooled for once.

272
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,710
You’re so mean, Wilson.

273
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,990
I forgot to tell you.

274
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,200
We don’t have rice.

275
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,960
And?

276
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,820
You want me to grow some?

277
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,460
Don’t get funny with me.

278
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,900
I’ll fetch some rice.

279
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,860
You cook it.

280
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,470
Okay.

281
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,720
For that cut on your hand.

282
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,400
It’s unhygienic when you cook.

283
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,570
I don’t want to taste your stupid blood.

284
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,200
Just admit you’re worried about me.

285
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,510
No need to hide it behind hygiene and stuff.

286
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,600
Does your wound still hurt?

287
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,820
You should take a rest.

288
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,440
Don’t worry about me.

289
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,660
Just focus on your task.

290
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,630
Did you change the bandage?

291
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,560
Do you need my help?

292
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,400
No.

293
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,390
Just do what you’re here to do.

294
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,300
I can take care of myself.

295
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,980
Hello, sir.

296
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,900
Is the young master home?

297
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,590
Young master?

298
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,720
Young master who?

299
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,740
Mr. Bison, of course.

300
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,150
I took you both here on a boat.

301
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,210
Oh.

302
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,190
He’s inside.

303
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,540
Can I leave this with you to pass to him?

304
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,690
I believe it should be enough for two people.

305
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,580
Oh, sure enough.

306
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,050
You save us.

307
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,000
Thank you.

308
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,720
Sir.

309
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,300
Can I ask you something?

310
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,480
Of course.

311
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,270
Have you been working here long?

312
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,490
Yes,

313
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,000
ever since his parents were still alive.

314
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,980
I used to work at the hotel they owned.

315
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,710
When they were murdered,

316
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,900
I had nowhere to go.

317
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,740
I remembered they had a house here,

318
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,860
so I asked him to take me in.

319
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,640
Luckily no one claimed this place.

320
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,310
Did you say the young master—

321
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,600
I mean, Bison’s parents—were murdered?

322
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,200
It was all over the news.

323
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,980
All because they refused to sell their lands.

324
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,440
Even now, they still haven’t caught the people who did it.

325
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,610
The young master always looks so sad
	when he comes to visit.

326
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:44,240
And he only rarely visits.

327
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,510
I’m happy he’s here with a friend this time.

328
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,270
Maybe he won’t be so lonely.

329
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,790
I have to go.

330
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,710
Call me if you need anything.

331
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,710
I live in a cottage just over that hill.

332
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,180
Of course.

333
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,310
Thank you.

334
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,320
What the hell are you playing at?

335
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,500
I’m not doing anything.

336
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,950
Something’s wrong with your car.

337
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,690
Crap.

338
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,430
Oh, no.

339
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,600
Crap.

340
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,930
I don’t think it can keep going.

341
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,810
The radiator’s broken.

342
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,490
Can’t you fix it?

343
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,800
What kind of a mechanic are you?

344
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,990
Give me some tools and I’ll do it.

345
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,490
I can’t otherwise.

346
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,020
It ain’t no magic fixing cars, you know?

347
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,840
I’m no Harry Potter.

348
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,220
No service.

349
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,890
And I don’t think there’s a garage around here.

350
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:49,140
I told you to use the main road.

351
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,430
You insisted we took a shortcut.

352
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,300
Because you could tip the police off if we ran into them.

353
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,400
What are you worrying about?

354
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,110
I told you I wouldn’t run.

355
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,110
What do I have to do for you to trust me?

356
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,410
I can no longer trust a single word that comes out of your mouth.

357
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,540
What do you want to do?

358
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,920
Wait until some car passes by?

359
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,040
Or what?

360
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,680
You push it.

361
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,380
What?

362
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,410
Are you insane?

363
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,800
Push it where?

364
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,960
Just push it until we find a house or something.

365
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,330
No way.

366
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,000
I can’t do it alone in this heat.

367
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,860
We haven’t had anything to eat.

368
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,320
What if I passed out?

369
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,220
I’ve never felt so weak before in my life.

370
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,840
It’s so hot today.

371
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,200
I’m so hungry.

372
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,120
I’m literally dying.

373
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,150
No way, not doing it.

374
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,400
Stop whining.

375
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,450
I can’t help you.

376
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,760
I’ve only got this one hand right now, haven’t I?

377
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,680
Fine.

378
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,810
Okay.

379
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,940
I’ll just die of exhaustion before I ever meet your bullet.

380
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,630
Shut up and push it.

381
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,410
Yeah.

382
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,410
It’s hot as hell.

383
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,640
Push harder.

384
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,410
I’m pushing.

385
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,730
We’ll never find a house at this rate.

386
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,460
We’ll never find a house in the first place, dude.

387
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,620
Go!

388
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,780
I can’t do it anymore.

389
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,890
I’m gonna take a rest.

390
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,070
Take it.

391
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,490
Thought you’d let me die of thirst.

392
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,810
Either a hitman like you still have his humanity,

393
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,670
or you’re in love with me.

394
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,110
You’re well prepared, huh?

395
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,360
To think you packed snacks and drinks.

396
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,740
I am always well prepared.

397
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,210
I have plans for everything.

398
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,400
If it wasn’t for you and your friend,

399
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,960
my brother and I
would have had our long-awaited break already.

400
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,070
Hey, what happened happened.

401
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,350
Let it go.

402
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,200
Shouldn’t you be looking forward to the future?

403
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,870
Focus on the future.

404
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:21,960
Let go of your grudge.

405
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,400
What good would a grudge do—

406
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,440
Eat.

407
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,250
That will shut you up.

408
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,430
Couldn’t you have been more gentle?

409
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,950
I’m getting paranoid, though.

410
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,100
We broke down in the middle of the woods.

411
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,640
This is just like the beginning of a horror film.

412
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,200
A murderer is gonna come after us in a minute.

413
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,800
The first to get murdered would be a yapper like you.

414
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,600
I honestly can’t keep pushing the car.

415
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:53,920
No.

416
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,540
You have to.

417
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,560
I can’t leave the car here.

418
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,330
Just lock it and leave it here.

419
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,640
Who’d steal it?

420
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,800
Not even a dog passes through this part.

421
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,290
We can come back for it later.

422
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,860
If my car was stolen,

423
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,830
not only would I kill you,
	I’d take a car from your garage.

424
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:14,640
Take it.

425
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,670
Take them all.

426
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,710
You own my life.

427
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,320
Take my cars,

428
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,240
my body,

429
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,720
my heart.

430
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,870
Take everything.

431
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,750
You have your food,
	but still made me find fish and make fire.

432
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,220
Now you have me tied up and starving, too?

433
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,280
I’m hungry.

434
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,200
Won’t you let me join you?

435
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,340
Hey.

436
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,490
I can’t eat when my hands are tied.

437
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,670
Well?

438
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,050
You wanna help me with that?

439
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,990
Pork, too, please.

440
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,230
You’ll have to wait until I’m done eating.

441
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,920
For my leftovers.

442
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,700
He made enough for me, too, you know?

443
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,250
Hey.

444
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,620
Please, untie me.

445
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,050
I’m dying over here.

446
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,200
I’m starving.

447
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,400
I’m thirsty.

448
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,970
You might as well just shoot me.

449
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,310
Let’s waste nobody’s time.

450
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,210
Thirsty, you said?

451
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,760
What do I have to do

452
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,969
for you to believe me I was forced into it by that captain?

453
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,179
I didn’t have a choice.

454
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,600
Everyone has a choice.

455
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,690
You chose to betray me.

456
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,690
What did he order you to do?

457
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,970
He wanted to know who’s behind your operation.

458
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,530
Did you tell him?

459
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,000
No.

460
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,110
I never found out.

461
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,400
I thought I was going to see the mission through

462
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,590
and wipe my criminal record for good.

463
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,590
But who’d have thought

464
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,400
that I’d fall for you?

465
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,780
I really do love you, Bison.

466
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:37,040
Everything that happened between us
	was real.

467
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,100
I just never found the right moment to confess.

468
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,290
If you really did love me,

469
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,600
you wouldn’t have let me find out like this.

470
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,800
I’m sorry.

471
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,290
I really am ashamed.

472
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,320
You never trusted anyone.

473
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,100
I let you down.

474
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,410
Shut up.

475
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,820
You remember the trip we planned together?

476
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,320
Shut up.

477
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,940
I still want it to happen.

478
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,080
Shut up!

479
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,450
Let’s go to Iceland together.

480
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,010
I said shut up!

481
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,500
Penguin.

482
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,320
Penguin.

483
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,190
Penguin.

484
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,350
Penguin.

485
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,720
Hey.

486
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,290
There's a house.

487
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,670
The plot thickens.

488
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,560
Car breaks down.

489
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,980
Finds a random house.

490
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,310
Bet there’s a family of cannibals inside.

491
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,410
Good.

492
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,760
I’ll ask them to cook you.

493
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,320
I’m getting hungry.

494
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,540
Don’t say that.

495
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,650
It’s scary.

496
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,240
Should we get back on the road?

497
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,980
Stop being ridiculous.

498
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,690
There’s no murderer.

499
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,680
I’ll shoot them in the face if there’s one.

500
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,680
Hello.

501
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,910
Is anyone home?

502
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,960
Hello.

503
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,420
Hey, it’s not too late to turn back.

504
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,600
Hello.

505
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,840
Excuse me.

506
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,410
We need help.

507
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,620
This is getting scary.

508
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,980
What are you doing?

509
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,080
Hey.

510
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:15,480
You’re trespassing.

511
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,700
I don’t care.

512
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,560
Hello.

513
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,520
Hey, is anybody home?

514
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,230
Excuse me.

515
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,670
Baby, no!

516
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,210
Jimmy.

517
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,620
Stop running!

518
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,300
What do you want?

519
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,290
Should we just call it quit?

520
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,730
Baby, calm down.

521
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,450
I didn’t mean to lie to you, Popcorn.

522
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,690
“Didn’t mean to”?

523
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,200
What did you mean to do then?

524
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,060
You made me a fool.

525
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,660
Die, you jerk.

526
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,380
Hold it. Calm down!

527
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,690
Let’s just talk it out, alright, sir?

528
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,540
Who are you?

529
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,180
Who are you?

530
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,530
How did you get into my house?

531
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,200
I…

532
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,370
Are you his other side bits?

533
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,470
- No!
	- Of course not!

534
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,730
Die, you jerk!

535
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,610
Oh, a gun…

536
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,940
Baby. He has a gun.

537
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:08,900
Let go.

538
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:09,850
Baby!

539
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:10,360
Leave me!

540
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,010
Baby, I love you.

541
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:11,820
- Stop pulling!
	- I love you!

542
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,470
- Let me go.
	- We’re in love, baby!

543
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,270
Stop it.

544
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,780
If you’re done, go look for what you need.

545
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,830
Hurry up.

546
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,070
Sir, please, don’t hurt me.

547
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:28,210
I don’t have anything valuable here.

548
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,550
The only thing I have that’s worth anything is my heart.

549
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:37,980
And even that is shattered into little pieces by this jerk!

550
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:38,950
Hey.

551
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,000
Pull yourself together.

552
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,290
Don’t provoke them.

553
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,640
Hey, we’re no thieves.

554
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,740
It was you who threatened to hurt us.

555
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,920
We just…

556
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,610
needed help.

557
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,220
Don’t you dare lie!

558
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,670
I know you’re his lovers!

559
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,480
Delivery guys and postmen and whatnot.

560
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,480
Don’t think I don’t know he’s into all that.

561
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,040
Jimmy, for real.

562
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,650
Is your brain between your crotch or something?

563
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:06,630
Hey.

564
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,630
They all meant nothing to me.

565
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,050
You and I are getting married.

566
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,540
Can you please just let this go?

567
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,260
You’re the only one I’m serious with.

568
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,260
“Serious with,” my bum.

569
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:18,740
You were never serious with me!

570
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,430
You made me fall for you and then betrayed me.

571
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,500
You lying bastard, you jerk.

572
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,990
Popcorn.

573
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,980
Give me another chance.

574
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,100
The likes of you don’t deserve second chances.

575
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:36,600
The likes of you who lead people on
	deserve nothing but death!

576
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,780
You want him dead?

577
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,790
I’ll kill him.

578
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,760
Fadel!

579
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,630
Calm down.

580
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,780
Don’t kill them.

581
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,280
I was just being dramatic…

582
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,890
Of course I don’t really want him to die.

583
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,610
But he lied to you.

584
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,870
Well, we bicker all the time.

585
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,500
But I never want him to die.

586
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,880
Do it.

587
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:05,280
Kill me.

588
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,510
Just please let Popcorn go.

589
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,580
I know I’m a jerk.

590
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,340
Blame it all on me.

591
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,390
He has nothing to do with it.

592
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,210
I love him.

593
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,820
If you love him, why did you fool him?

594
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,130
I’m sorry.

595
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,550
I’ve been lying to you, yes.

596
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,230
But you’re the only one I truly love.

597
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,310
How could I believe you?

598
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,860
If you don’t believe me,

599
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,660
just let this gentleman shoot me dead.

600
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:44,350
No, no.

601
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,450
- I’ll die here in our house.
	- Don’t say that.

602
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,910
- I’ll be with you forever, baby.
	- No. No.

603
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:55,980
I know I ruined our wedding.

604
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,310
Before you kill me,

605
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,280
I’ll be glad to know we have each other.

606
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,730
Shoot me.

607
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,190
No, don’t.

608
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:23,670
I know I nitpick

609
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,380
and that I talk too much.

610
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,430
But I do it all because I love you.

611
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:33,090
I left everything behind to be with you,

612
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,760
which I’m not even sure if it will work out, by the way.

613
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:38,660
But…

614
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:41,740
Let’s try it.

615
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:44,840
Love is a risk, isn’t it?

616
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,250
Popcorn.

617
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,060
I know I’m a loser.

618
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,060
But I will try to be a better man,

619
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:00,850
not for me.

620
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:03,980
For you.

621
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,460
I know the future is scary,

622
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:10,090
but we will brave it together.

623
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,200
Do you take Popcorn as your husband,

624
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,200
to be true to him and only him?

625
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,760
Yes.

626
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,240
Of course, I do.

627
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,240
And I will do my best to be true to him.

628
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:29,830
Do you take—

629
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:31,080
I do.

630
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:33,500
And if he ain’t true for a moment,

631
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,310
will you do me the honor of shooting him?

632
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:38,180
Baby!

633
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,470
You may kiss the groom.

634
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,460
Slow down, you guys.

635
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,520
The client who ordered a hit on Ruerat

636
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,890
is currently very unhappy with our failed operation.

637
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,480
They said if they don’t get a refund,

638
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,710
they’ll take us down, too.

639
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,180
One miss, and they dare threaten us?

640
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,980
We can’t give them a refund.

641
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:47,140
The only solution is to take Ruerat out.

642
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,470
Have Fadel and Bison made any contact yet?

643
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,460
Not at all.

644
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,970
And we can’t reach them, either.

645
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,400
They’ve disappeared.

646
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:03,810
Where could they have gone?

647
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,530
It’s strange that they don’t contact us at all.

648
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,800
Maybe they’ve run away.

649
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:15,790
Maybe they’ve decided to wash their hands clean of this job.

650
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:22,470
They have been asking you to make this their last mission.

651
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,900
But since their operation fell through,

652
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,010
they could have just made a run for it.

653
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,080
Oh…

654
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,280
I heard they have boyfriends.

655
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:33,700
They do?

656
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,450
Both of them?

657
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:36,230
Yes.

658
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:37,500
I saw them.

659
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,120
I guess they really wanted to quit.

660
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,570
But they could have just told me.

661
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,210
There was no need to take off like that.

662
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:54,540
I’m quite sad that they chose to do this.

663
00:46:56,030 --> 00:47:00,040
They abandoned their Mother, after all.

664
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,850
They’ve become negligent and self-centered.

665
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,810
I guess this was why they failed their last mission.

666
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:08,680
I think it could be.

667
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:15,990
Keen.

668
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,810
I might have to do something I don’t want to.

669
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,410
But those two must come back to take responsibility for their actions.

670
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,980
They’ll ruin us otherwise.

671
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,510
I can’t let everything I’ve built crumble to the ground.

672
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:35,770
If we just let them go,

673
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:38,810
they could come back and hurt us, dear.

674
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,890
Will you let me handle this, Mother?

675
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:49,980
Okay.

676
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,840
I give you my permission.

677
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,790
Whether you do it yourself,

678
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,500
or hire someone to do it,

679
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,780
the decision is yours.

680
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,150
Yes, Mother.

681
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,630
You’re my only hope now, Keen.

682
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,460
Bison.

683
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,200
Won’t you please untie me?

684
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,330
Just do it.

685
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,530
Just knock me out and leave.

686
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,420
I can’t do that.

687
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:35,980
Stupid.

688
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:39,360
But I don’t want to go.

689
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,620
If I wanted to,

690
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,970
I wouldn’t have let myself get to this point.

691
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,990
Can we talk?

692
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,200
Please?

693
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,410
What lies are you going to feed me now?

694
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,370
Think I can’t kill you, don’t you?

695
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,770
If you want to kill me,

696
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:40,410
just do it.

697
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:44,700
I deserve it.

698
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,560
It was my job to fool you.

699
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:55,980
But…

700
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,380
In the end, I only fooled myself.

701
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,620
I was really happy

702
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,580
to have spent time with you,

703
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,090
to have hanged out with you,

704
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,670
to have made plans together.

705
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:27,560
But that happiness was…

706
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,340
ridden with guilt.

707
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:34,540
I wasn’t fully myself

708
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:39,080
when I really wanted to be.

709
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:43,900
I wanted you to see the real me.

710
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,590
When you got stabbed,

711
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,970
just thinking you could die,

712
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:56,940
did you know…

713
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,320
the thought nearly killed me?

714
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,920
If I were to lose you

715
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,790
without letting you know my feelings,

716
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,180
it would have been the worst thing ever.

717
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,080
I love you, Bison.

718
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,730
I love you.

719
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,240
With all my being.

720
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:50,180
You’re not fooling me again…

721
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:55,800
You’re not fooling me again, are you?

722
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,570
No, I’m not.

723
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:39,480
Do you believe me now that I’m not lying?

724
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:26,520
Eat your fill, you guys.

725
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:30,520
We prepared the food for the guests at our wedding,

726
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,860
but someone had to go and ruin it.

727
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:34,280
Baby.

728
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,610
Baby.

729
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,250
Thank you for being here.

730
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,970
Help us finish all this.

731
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,030
Popcorn made all this, you know?

732
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,180
I guarantee he’s an amazing cook.

733
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:47,720
He is?

734
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:50,520
My boyfriend is also good in the kitchen.

735
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:53,610
His burgers are to die for.

736
00:55:59,290 --> 00:55:59,960
Here.

737
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:00,820
Eat something.

738
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:05,400
Say “ah…”

739
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,390
Good boy.

740
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:11,940
Excuse me, but…

741
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,980
Why did you guys live so far out of town?

742
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,970
Did you know you’re the only house around here?

743
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,970
Don’t be nosy.

744
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:20,260
I’m just curious.

745
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,980
It’s alright. We don’t mind.

746
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,820
We used to live in the city, like typical salarymen.

747
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,450
But I happened to fall in love.

748
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,440
We moved here because Jimmy loves nature.

749
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,170
So ’m no longer an uptown girl.

750
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:36,570
Now I’m just a regular farm girl.

751
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:38,470
There it is.

752
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:41,040
It took us a long time,
	but we made it work.

753
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,820
Very romantic.

754
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,860
You left everything behind for him.

755
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:54,570
He did all that for you
	and you still cheated on him?

756
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:59,310
It’s a human thing to be lost,

757
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,420
but at the end of the day, I’ve come home.

758
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,690
Only because you take him for granted.

759
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,140
Well…

760
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:14,130
No need to be mad on my behalf…

761
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,200
I forgave him.

762
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:23,320
Where are you guys heading to, anyway?

763
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,820
We’re heading south.

764
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,460
Kinda hoped it was going to be a romantic road trip date.

765
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:32,870
That’s cute.

766
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,350
You two look really good together.

767
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:36,580
How did you meet?

768
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:41,130
I was kinda dared into taking him out,

769
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,470
but then I actually fell for him.

770
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,660
Oh, you did, huh?

771
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,510
Such is love, isn’t it?

772
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,560
It can start from deceit,

773
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:52,450
but it zigzags its way

774
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,170
into something beautiful at the end.

775
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,970
It’s only normal, right?

776
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:02,000
You bicker,

777
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:03,030
you fight,

778
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,550
then you bone.

779
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:08,310
It’s all part of the process for any couple.

780
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,000
Since we already bickered today,

781
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,530
and we already fought…

782
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,070
I guess the only thing left to do is to bone.

783
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,200
Oh, baby.

784
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:30,170
This is our song, do you remember?

785
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:33,620
It was playing when we met at the company party.

786
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,090
Of course, I do.

787
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:38,360
We sang it on stage together and then we…

788
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:42,900
♪ It’s always been you and me ♪

789
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,800

795
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,270
Just like us.

796
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,500
♪ Just overlook what is trivial ♪

797
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,480
We’re not a couple.

798
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:20,320
Didn’t you hear the chorus?

799
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,160
“Just overlook what is trivial.”

800
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,310
No?

801
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:31,440
You think what you did to me was “trivial”?

802
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:35,100
Come.

803
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,580
Dance with us.

804
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,120
Do our wedding the honor.

805
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:39,320
Let’s dance.

806
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:40,840
Let’s go.

807
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:41,530
Get up.

808
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:42,460
No.

809
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,260
Hurry up.

810
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,190
It’s their wedding.

811
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:51,120
Don’t let them down.

812
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:52,900
Get up.

813
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:53,860
Come on.

But I’m ready to do anything

826
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,300
to make you forgive me.

Fadel!

832
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,740
They may not be serial killers,

833
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:41,080
but they nearly killed us.

834
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,770
You trust people too easily.

835
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:49,100
Got swayed by their love story.

836
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,010
I’m a hopeless romantic.

837
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,270
Can’t help it that love stories touch me.

838
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,220
What are you doing?

839
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,770
Doesn’t your arm hurt?

840
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:07,120
It’s annoying.

841
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:08,370
It’s in the way.

842
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,330
Let me help.

843
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,590
How did it get to this?

844
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:32,400
I was going to kill you here.

845
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:34,850
Now look at us.

846
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:38,520
I never thought

847
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:41,260
that someone like you could kill anyone.

848
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:46,620
Grudges…

849
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,510
will make you do something you never expect you could.

850
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,820
After I kill someone,

851
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:58,330
I have to go out there and do something to forget it.

852
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:01,400
Do something fun.

853
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:03,670
Play bowling.

854
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:06,460
As for Fadel,

855
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,540
cooking is his therapy.

856
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,110
Do you plan to live two lives like this forever?

857
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:16,300
It’s exhausting, you know?

858
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:18,400
I know because I’ve done it before.

859
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:22,860
What’d you say that for?

860
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,290
You can quit

861
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:29,700
and start over.

862
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:37,040
I don’t care what kind of past you’ve been through,

863
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,170
since mine is not much better.

864
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:42,420
But if I got a second chance in life,

865
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:44,950
then, you deserve it, too.

866
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,780
How could I quit?

867
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:59,450
If I did, I’d have to keep moving.

868
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:01,710
You okay with that?

869
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:06,510
You don’t plan to stay with Fadel at the restaurant?

870
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:15,220
I don’t know if he’d keep the joint.

871
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:19,390
If he does keep it,

872
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,390
I guess this is goodbye between us.

873
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,690
Hitmen like us,

874
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,280
we can’t have a home,

875
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:28,380
family,

876
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:30,400
or a lover.

877
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,400
You have me.

878
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:40,730
If I were to quit,

879
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:43,390
I have to move somewhere where no one knows me,

880
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:44,910
like here.

881
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,550
Kant.

882
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:50,460
Hmm?

883
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:54,710
If I quit one day,

884
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:58,450
will you move here with me?

885
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:00,890
Well…

886
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:02,990
Let me think.

887
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,460
Of course.

888
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,940
I’ll go anywhere as long as I’m with you.

889
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,250
What about Babe?

890
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,620
Once he graduates, he’s on his own.

891
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:25,210
I’ve lived my life for him long enough.

892
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,070
It’s time for a new goal.

893
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:30,460
I want to live for you now.

894
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:33,020
Move.

895
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,310
Let me get in, too.

896
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:38,360
Leave me alone.

897
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:41,050
Won’t you let me relax a little bit?

898
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:46,600
I’m sick of arguing with you.

899
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,520
I’m glad you didn’t kill them.

900
01:08:36,109 --> 01:08:37,210
I told you.

901
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:39,319
I only kill bad people.

902
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:43,130
I don’t like the fact that he cheated,

903
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,990
but it was none of my business.

904
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,790
You’re pretty decent at your core, you know?

905
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:51,899
How come you’re a hitman?

906
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:56,649
Someone hires me.

907
01:08:57,330 --> 01:08:57,990
That’s it.

908
01:08:59,050 --> 01:08:59,970
No way.

909
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,970
I don’t think you’re the type to do it for the money.

910
01:09:07,529 --> 01:09:08,689
Why not?

911
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:11,420
You don’t know anything about me.

912
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,310
I might not know who you were in the past,

913
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:16,970
but I know who you are now.

914
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,680
You said you only kill bad people.

915
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,310
How can you tell who is and who isn’t?

916
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,490
Experiences.

917
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,620
It’s not your job to judge that kind of thing, you know?

918
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:37,220
Why don’t you just quit?

919
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,020
If you keep going,

920
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:41,010
it will never be over.

921
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:44,979
I don’t need a lecture.

922
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,390
I’m not lecturing you.

923
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:53,170
I just think there’s no one out there
	who wants the best for you more than I do.

924
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,280
I just need to stretch my legs.

925
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:21,430
You’re messing with me.

926
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:24,830
Just because I let you do this

927
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:27,700
doesn’t mean I won’t kill you, you know?

928
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,050
Go ahead.

929
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:33,050
Blow my head off whenever you want.

930
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,430
I’m a bad person

931
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,740
for making you fall for me,

932
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:37,800
head over heels,

933
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,530
and then betraying you.

934
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,530
I deserve to die.

935
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:45,000
Don’t be so full of yourself.

936
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:47,990
I never fell for you.

937
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,160
You might be good at cooking

938
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:57,170
and shooting,

939
01:10:57,990 --> 01:10:59,640
but you’re not very good at lying at all.

940
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:03,620
Does your arm hurt?

941
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:10,450
Let me see.

942
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,690
What are you doing?

943
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:12,780
As long as I’m alive,

944
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:16,310
I’ll make you kiss me again.

945
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,540
How about my parents’ place on that island?

946
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:38,570
We can lay low there.

947
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:48,370
I think I know now

948
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:50,870
where Bison is.

949
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,060
Why don’t you let that grudge go?

950
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:12,570
It will only make this worse.

951
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,680
But he destroyed my family.

952
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:16,520
You sure those two are there?

953
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:17,410
Style, get down!

954
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:21,550
That’s Style.

955
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,630
Fadel!

956
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,460
Style!

957
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:24,630
Fadel!

958
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:25,320
What the hell?

959
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:26,720
You started all this!

960
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,420
If you really like Fadel,
	you need to prove it to him.
