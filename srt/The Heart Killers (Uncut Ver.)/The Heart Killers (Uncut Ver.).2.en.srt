1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,520
I’ve got another job for you.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,520
Get close to some hitmen.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,680
What’s your name?

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,320
Bison

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,360
What the hell are you doing?

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,040
What do I have to do if I want to be the first guy to take you out?

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,160
Win Fadel over.

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,480
You want me to hit on that jerk?

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,680
Give me your dad’s car.

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,240
- Deal.
- Deal.

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,720
I’d be dancing so close to you.

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,760
Let go!

13
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,880
I’m gonna take you out!

14
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,600
You’re friends?

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,960
Ugh, wait.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,960
Hold on.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,680
He’s way too heavy.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,760
What the hell are you whining about now?

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,360
We’ve dealt with much heavier trash.

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,560
You’ve been slacking off.

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,840
Where’s your mind at?

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,320
Don’t blame me.

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,320
I’m neat like I always am with all my jobs.

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,640
Neat?

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,880
You forgot to bring our gloves.

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,039
Come on. It happens.

27
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,760
Don’t mix things up.

28
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,240
Please, Fadel.

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,000
Can’t you just give him a chance.

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,840
He’s just a normal harmless tattooist.

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,560
His parents are both dead.

32
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,520
Now he lives with his brother.

33
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,880
What’s so suspicious about him?

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,960
He only shows you what he wants you to see.

35
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,520
The same way he doesn’t know who you really are.

36
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,200
What if I want him to know?

37
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,320
I’ll make sure he’s dead.

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,240
Come on, Fadel.

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,560
You know damn well

40
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,000
Mother doesn’t want us getting involved with anyone.

41
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,000
So we’re just supposed to live like this?

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,280
No social life with anyone else?

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,880
What’s wrong with that?

44
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,360
You don’t need anyone else.

45
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,520
Hurry up.

46
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,240
Too bad I have an actual beating heart,

47
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,160
unlike the dead cold thing in your chest.

48
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,440
You talk too much.

49
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,240
Uncle.

50
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,720
Three sticky rice and fried pork, please.

51
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,560
Of course.

52
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,720
You mind waiting, son?

53
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,280
It’s better fresh off the stove.

54
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,440
No problem.

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,880
Excuse me. Make way.

56
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,280
Make way, please.

57
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,800
Uncle!

58
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,200
I’ll be back.

59
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,360
Can I borrow your cart?

60
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
What do you need it for?

61
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,360
I’m on my way to sell the fresh produce.

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,640
Please.

63
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,160
I’ll help you sell it.

64
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,000
I’ll sell it all.

65
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,120
Thank you.

66
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,600
Excuse me. Make way.

67
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,640
Heavy stuff incoming.

68
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,760
Make way, please.

69
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,360
Oh, I’m sorry.

70
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,360
You!

71
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,320
You’re in the way.

72
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,080
Look how you ruined my produce.

73
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,320
You work pushing carts in the market?

74
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,800
Yeah, what about it?

75
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,320
You got a problem with that?

76
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,520
Are you looking down on me?

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,320
Hey.

78
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,000
I haven’t said a thing.

79
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,360
I can see it in your eyes.

80
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,320
See how you don’t seem to help me pick them up?

81
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,240
You’re blowing my ears off.

82
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,720
When’d I have time to pick them up?

83
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,120
And I didn’t do anything wrong.

84
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,960
I was just walking when you knocked into me.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,960
If this is the best you can do with a cart, don’t bother.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,040
You’re a menace to everyone else.

87
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,080
Now how’d I sell anything today?

88
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,040
You have to take responsibility for this.

89
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,560
What are you talking about?

90
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,960
Don’t you realize every baht I make is hard earned?

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,760
How unlucky I am to run into a mean guy like you.

92
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,600
My dear fellow hardworking people,

93
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,480
listen up.

94
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,920
This guy ruined my produce,

95
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,400
and then blamed me and looked down on me.

96
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,040
This is just unacceptable!

97
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,120
Enough.

98
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,080
- My dear fellow hardworking people.
- Hey!

99
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,240
- Look at him!
- That’s enough!

100
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,440
That’s enough!

101
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,280
I’ll take responsibility for it.

102
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,240
So this is as little as you think of me?

103
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,800
Hey, take it or leave it.

104
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,480
Thank you.

105
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,960
You humiliated me.

106
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,000
Now it’s my turn.

107
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,480
We’re even.

108
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,160
Your produce are all dirty now.

109
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,080
I don’t think you can sell them like this.

110
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,720
I’ll clean them up.

111
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,280
Excuse me.

112
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,640
Yes?

113
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,400
Can I borrow this?

114
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,360
Of course.

115
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,080
Thank you.

116
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,960
Take it.

117
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,200
Thanks.

118
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:34,920
Hey!

119
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,600
You’re supposed to clean the vegetables, not me!

120
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,040
Watch out!

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,480
Hey!

122
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,200
Hey!

123
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,280
There you go.

124
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,920
Is this your cat?

125
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,760
No.

126
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,120
Just something I came up with.

127
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,680
You want a cat tattoo but you don’t have a cat?

128
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,880
That’s weird.

129
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,400
I like that they’re unpredictable.

130
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,040
Sometimes they act like they love you and want you,

131
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,200
and then go ahead and ignore you.

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,360
Treat you like a total stranger.

133
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,840
It’s challenging.

134
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,080
So you love a challenge.

135
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,799
But this is quite detailed.

136
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,919
It’s going to take some time.

137
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,520
You’re not afraid of needles, are you?

138
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,520
Pain kinda excites me, really.

139
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,120
Where would you like it done, dear customer?

140
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
I don’t know.

141
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,640
I’ll print it out and see where it fits.

142
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,720
You decide where you want it.

143
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,760
This doesn't look bad.

144
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,520
It lines up nicely.

145
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,600
I think it’s going to look great.

146
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,400
I was thinking I wanted it done on my thigh.

147
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,320
What do you think?

148
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,720
It’d peak out when I wear shorts.

149
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,520
Quite cool, isn’t it?

150
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,120
Let’s try it.

151
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,600
How about here?

152
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,720
A little higher.

153
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,880
Here?

154
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,040
A little higher.

155
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,040
Higher.

156
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,920
Hey.

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,640
Any higher than this

158
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,880
and it’s not inking we’re doing soon.

159
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,000
What are you gonna do?

160
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,360
If I start anything here,

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,120
don’t blame me, Mr. Customer.

162
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,160
Inappropriately touching a client is illegal, you know?

163
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,720
But I can’t help myself

164
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,120
when you’re literally coaxing me into it.

165
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,840
Well, then…

166
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,840
I’ll think about where I want the tattoo to be

167
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,760
and I’ll tell you.

168
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
I want it somewhere I can show it off,

169
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
but also somewhere I can hide easily.

170
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,240
I think…

171
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,160
Having it somewhere discreet might not be bad.

172
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,400
Make it exclusive for your special someone.

173
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,320
Then I guess no one will ever get to see it,

174
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,040
seeing that I don’t have someone like that.

175
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,600
It’s all up to you, then.

176
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,120
Just let me know where you want it.

177
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,840
I can do it anywhere.

178
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,920
Do what?

179
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,920
What’s on your mind?

180
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
I’m talking about the tattoo, of course.

181
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,240
Anywhere on your body, I’ll etch it.

182
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,040
Every nook and cranny.

183
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
I’m leaving.

184
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,240
See you.

185
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,200
I have to help my brother out at the restaurant.

186
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,520
Bye.

187
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,960
Ain’t no way I’m doing it.

188
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,040
Style.

189
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,600
You can’t give up now.

190
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,280
You promised you’d help me.

191
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,760
It’s impossible.

192
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
aking that mad dog out is impossible.

193
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,680
Did you know he literally threw me out of his joint?

194
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,000
He’s a damn barbarian.

195
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,160
Don’t be a puss.

196
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,400
You gotta give it a try, dude.

197
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,960
You said you’d do anything for my car, right?

198
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,120
Help me out, then.

199
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,600
Meet me halfway.

200
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,280
Find out what that mad dog does all day.

201
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,240
I’ll find a way to get close to him.

202
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,360
How’d I even know that?

203
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
I don’t care.

204
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,880
Ask your man or whatever.

205
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,400
They’re brothers, aren’t they?

206
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,200
Help me,

207
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,360
and you might get with him sooner.

208
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,400
Aww, did you miss me?

209
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,520
Look at you.

210
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,280
Bison.

211
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,240
Don’t even think about it.

212
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,040
You know cats tend to stay in one place.

213
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,560
Don’t even think about taking it in.

214
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
I’m not.

215
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,720
But look at him.

216
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,240
He’s so damn cute.

217
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,280
How could I resist?

218
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,680
Am I right, little guy?

219
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,080
If you play with him every day like that,

220
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,760
you’ll only regret it when we have to move again.

221
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,160
I don’t want to move.

222
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,960
I told you, Fadel.

223
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,840
I need a break.

224
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,400
Fine. I’ll talk to Mother.

225
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,680
But before that, come help me out inside.

226
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,960
We get a lot of customers during lunch break.

227
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,080
I can’t handle everything myself.

228
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,320
Do it yourself.

229
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,960
Right?

230
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,480
Bison!

231
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,880
Yeah.

232
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,600
I’m coming.

233
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Hurry up.

234
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,080
Yeah.

235
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,280
Let me repeat your order.

236
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,040
So there’s one cheeseburger,

237
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,240
one fries,

238
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,880
one beef burger,

239
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,080
and one carbonara.

240
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,080
One water with two ice.

241
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,520
Is that correct?

242
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,240
Yes.

243
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,320
Okay.

244
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,720
Please wait a moment.

245
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,600
Here’s the menu.

246
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,360
TOILET

247
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,040
You…

248
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,440
Kant.

249
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,800
Kant.

250
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,600
Hey.

251
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,360
What are you showing up here for?

252
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,720
Aren’t you scared of my brother?

253
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,800
Your place is crawling with customers.

254
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,720
I doubt your brother has time to welcome me.

255
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,880
Who knows?

256
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,680
What are you doing?

257
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,960
We can’t do it here.

258
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,480
But I miss you.

259
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,840
No can do.

260
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,720
What are you here for, honestly?

261
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,000
Well…

262
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,120
The friend I asked to take your brother out said

263
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
he wanted some information on Fadel.

264
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,520
He wants to know how he spends his day.

265
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,800
So he knows how to approach him.

266
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,720
What does that have to do with me?

267
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,480
I need your help.

268
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,040
Please.

269
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,400
I don’t know anything like that.

270
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,200
We might be brothers,

271
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,760
but he doesn’t tell me stuff.

272
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,600
You sure your friend knows what he’s doing?

273
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,040
This isn’t very promising.

274
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,840
Find someone else.

275
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,880
I swear no one is as shameless as this guy.

276
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,360
Give Style some time.

277
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,680
Once he gets your brother hooked,

278
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,760
we can…

279
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,720
Bison?

280
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,520
Bison!

281
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,040
Yeah?

282
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,800
What?

283
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,720
What the hell are you doing in there?

284
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,640
Hurry up and help me out.

285
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,800
We’re busy as hell.

286
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,480
Ow!

287
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,400
Ow, my tummy!

288
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,079
I’m having some stomach issues here, man.

289
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,880
Just make it quick.

290
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,560
And wash your hands.

291
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,160
Yeah, alright.

292
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,640
See?

293
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,560
You can’t see me here anymore.

294
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,920
It’s too dangerous.

295
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,160
We’ll meet outside.

296
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,360
Okay.

297
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,400
But I can’t wait to spend more time with you.

298
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,640
With no interruptions, that is.

299
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,960
Okay?

300
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,160
Alright.

301
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,800
I’ll try to look something up.

302
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,120
Okay?

303
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,280
Enough.

304
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,480
Let’s go.

305
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,320
Fadel.

306
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,840
Fadel.

307
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,680
Fadel.

308
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,920
Fadel.

309
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,320
What’s your problem?

310
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:25,920
Look at this.

311
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,560
Who the hell did this to us?

312
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,720
Who could it be?

313
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,880
Where did you get this?

314
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Someone sent it into our restaurant’s inbox.

315
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,640
I think it’s some kids in the area.

316
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,240
I’ve seen them around for a while.

317
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,800
We might need to teach them kids a lesson or two.

318
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,280
Alright.

319
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,080
Let’s go.

320
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,000
What is it?

321
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,160
My tummy hurts.

322
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,360
Since this morning.

323
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,840
I don’t know what happened.

324
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,720
Does it hurt that bad?

325
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,600
Shouldn’t you see a doctor?

326
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
I just need a little rest.

327
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,000
Why don’t you just go before they ruin our place?

328
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,560
Fine.

329
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,720
I’ll be back quickly,

330
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,120
with some medicine.

331
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,480
Bye, big bro.

332
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,920
GROCERY SHOPPING

333
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,160
You drew these?

334
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,960
You’re quite good.

335
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,440
Your brother does all these in a day?

336
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,640
That about sums him up, yeah.

337
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
He plans everything

338
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,520
down from years, months, weeks, to days.

339
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,440
Your friend has to show up

340
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,840
at exactly the time I wrote down.

341
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,960
Or else he’s going to miss him.

342
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,160
Alright.

343
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,440
I’ll tell him.

344
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,680
I think this is gonna be helpful.

345
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,360
Give your friend a fair warning.

346
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,960
Fadel’s a cautious guy.

347
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,760
If he knows your friend is there to hit on him,

348
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,560
he might just disappear.

349
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,760
You can trust him.

350
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,760
He’ll get it done soon.

351
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,360
Let’s talk about us.

352
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
Did you give it a thought?

353
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,000
Are you asking me out?

354
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,720
What else could I possibly be doing?

355
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,360
Don’t you think you get serious too soon?

356
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,600
We just met.

357
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,320
What’s the hurry?

358
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,640
You greenlit me to have my friend take your brother out.

359
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,760
Wasn’t it because you wanted us to be something?

360
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,120
I just want Fadel to let his hair down a bit.

361
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,680
I need some time to live my own life.

362
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,920
Don’t you think we should

363
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,120
just keep it casual between you and me?

364
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,800
I don’t want no casual.

365
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,640
I’m serious.

366
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,120
We jumped into bed on our first night,

367
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,320
and you want me to believe you’re serious about me?

368
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,600
But I stopped doing that

369
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,120
since the day I met you.

370
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,440
You’re the only one I’ve been chasing around.

371
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,320
Don’t you trust me at all?

372
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,120
You’ve still got a lot to prove.

373
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Is your customer gone?

374
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,760
Yeah.

375
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,040
I doubt he’s just a regular customer.

376
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,120
You guys seemed awfully close at one point.

377
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,960
Were you sneaking around?

378
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,440
Of course not.

379
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,280
This place just isn’t that big.

380
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,400
I couldn’t help it, you know?

381
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,120
Well, well.

382
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,400
So he refused to be your boyfriend?

383
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,840
Poor guy.

384
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,040
After all that effort, he said no.

385
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,920
Your Romeo day has come to an end, brother.

386
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,560
That hurts.

387
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,000
It was supposed to.

388
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,120
Might shut you up a bit.

389
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,520
Don’t you know this kind of thing well?

390
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,640
What, you got someone?

391
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,800
No.

392
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,320
I just learned these things from my books.

393
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,720
Well, then, based on your books,

394
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,240
what should I do in this situation?

395
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,800
In my books,

396
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,520
there’s always some obstacles
before they end up together.

397
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,960
Obstacles?

398
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,360
Something to overcome to show them
that you’re willing to fight for them.

399
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,440
Like in Romeo and Juliet,

400
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,520
you know their parents forbid them, right?

401
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,960
So Romeo does everything to be with Juliet.

402
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,840
When Juliet sees that,

403
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,480
she realizes that Romeo really loves her.

404
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,360
What should I do?

405
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,200
Make sure he knows he really matters to you.

406
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,160
JOGGING

407
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,760
Good morning, there.

408
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,000
Are you following me?

409
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,640
Surely not.

410
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,040
I live around here.

411
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,960
I just want to be healthy and strong

412
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,760
and take in the fresh morning air.

413
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,160
But jogging alone is kinda lonely, don’t you think?

414
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,040
Can I join you?

415
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,960
It’s jogging,

416
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,040
not badminton.

417
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,480
You can do it solo.

418
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,800
But some things are better done together.

419
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,400
Hey.

420
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,520
What are you gonna do?

421
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,120
You gonna wash me up again?

422
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
Scared?

423
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,120
Of course not.

424
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,200
I just don’t want to get soaked today.

425
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,760
If you follow me again,

426
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,000
you’re not just getting soaked next time.

427
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,560
What you gonna do to me?

428
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,600
Hey!

429
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,800
That hurts!

430
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,000
If you want to join me, catch up.

431
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,560
Wait!

432
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,960
F-A-D-E-L.

433
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,080
F-A-D-E-L.

434
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,520
Fadel, Fadel, Fadel.

435
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,520
Fadel!

436
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,240
Guys, let’s cheer him on.

437
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,000
Fadel, do your best.

438
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,720
Fadel, run that race.

439
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,440
Fadel, go chase.

440
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,440
Fadel, do your best.

441
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,960
He’s the best-best.

442
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,720
Fadel’s the best-best.

443
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,000
Better than the rest!

444
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,680
F-A.

445
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,120
D-E-L!

446
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,880
F-A.

447
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,120
D-E-L!

448
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,720
Fadel, Fadel, Fadel.

449
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,520
Fadel!

450
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,120
Thank you.

451
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:24,880
Here.

452
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,760
Thank you.

453
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,880
Your produce is fresh as always.

454
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,160
Thank you.

455
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,960
Hello.

456
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,120
What would you like today?

457
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,000
Some ground pork and tenderloin, please.

458
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,320
Hello, there.

459
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,320
How much do you want for that?

460
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,120
Don’t tell me you’re a butcher, too.

461
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,560
Hell yeah.

462
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,120
I’m taking odd jobs.

463
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
I fix cars.

464
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,040
I push carts.

465
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,600
I sell pork.

466
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,800
I can’t be a chooser when I don’t want to be a beggar.

467
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,120
How much do you want for that?

468
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,120
Go on.

469
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,640
Two kilograms of ground pork.

470
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,840
And two of tenderloin.

471
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,640
Would you like your pork farm-raised,

472
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,080
or grass-fed?

473
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,880
Hey.

474
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,480
I’m in a hurry to open my restaurant.

475
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,560
Can you stop messing around?

476
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,760
I’m not messing with you.

477
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,560
It’s all about the quality, you know?

478
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,960
Ask her if you don’t believe me.

479
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,240
Never mind.

480
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,440
I’ll buy it somewhere else.

481
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,680
Hey, hold it.

482
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,280
It runs out everywhere else.

483
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,000
You’re late to the market today.

484
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,000
You were wasting my time.

485
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,880
Fine.

486
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,240
I’ll sell it to you.

487
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,760
Under one condition.

488
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,520
You have to let me eat at your place for a week,

489
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,520
on the house.

490
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,480
And no chasing me out.

491
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,920
I threw you out

492
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,280
because you were drunk

493
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,440
and disorderly.

494
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,360
Yeah.

495
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,400
That was my bad.

496
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,360
I’ll behave next time I go to your place.

497
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,800
I’ll be the perfect customer for you to serve.

498
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,120
Auntie.

499
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,480
Let’s get him what he asked for.

500
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,480
Do we deliver?

501
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,200
We do.

502
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,200
For our regulars.

503
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,880
It’s alright.

504
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,800
Hey.

505
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,480
Don’t you know

506
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,600
it’s bad manners to turn her down?

507
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,360
Here.

508
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,480
How much?

509
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,880
Well, let’s go.

510
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,680
We’re here.

511
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,120
Now go.

512
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,600
Hey.

513
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
I told you not to chase me out.

514
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,280
I have to get ready to open.

515
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
I don’t have time to cook for you.

516
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,320
I’ll wait right here

517
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,560
until you’re done.

518
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
I’d like to be the first to eat…

519
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,480
you.

520
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,320
Wow. Wow. Wow.

521
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,840
I was wondering why you took so long at the market.

522
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,480
So someone was walking you home.

523
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,040
You don’t get to scold me for this anymore, you know?

524
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,240
Walk me home, my ass.

525
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,680
He was in the way.

526
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,000
He’s trouble.

527
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,360
One more thing,

528
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,120
this guy is friends with that tattooist.

529
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,880
Careful.

530
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,760
They might be working together.

531
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,000
“That tattooist” is called Kant.

532
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,240
I don’t give two rat’s ass what he’s called.

533
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
Just be careful.

534
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,440
What’s with you?

535
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,880
You overanalyze everything.

536
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,200
What are you, a conspiracy theorist?

537
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,200
If this wasn’t just pure coincidence,

538
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,240
then it was…

539
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,320
Destiny.

540
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,880
Destiny, my foot.

541
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,960
I bet you’re at least curious about him.

542
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,800
♪ My brother is in love ♪

543
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:04,960
♪ Someone walks him to his burger joint ♪

544
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,720
Beef… Burger.

545
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,120
Cheese…

546
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,800
Hey.

547
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,360
Hi?

548
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,080
Style, right?

549
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,080
I’m Bison.

550
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,080
I’m Fadel’s brother.

551
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,600
Right.

552
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,600
Kant told me about you.

553
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,720
Sorry I was taking orders from some customers for you.

554
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,720
Oh, hey, it’s no biggie.

555
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,800
Thanks.

556
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,080
Well,

557
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,920
now that I see you up close, I get him.

558
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,400
How he’s so head over heels for you.

559
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,480
Oh, I doubt it’s like that.

560
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,000
Kant has never fallen for anyone like this.

561
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,720
This is the most down bad I’ve ever seen him.

562
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,560
I don’t think so.

563
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,120
I think it’s too soon for him to be down bad.

564
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,360
We just met, you know?

565
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:05,960
Hey.

566
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,800
I know Kant asked you to hit on my brother.

567
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,280
I just want to tell you that,

568
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,440
I know you’re doing this for Kant,

569
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,440
but if you actually like him at some point,

570
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,920
just go for it.

571
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,440
I just want to see him with someone.

572
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,760
It’s unlikely at the moment.

573
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,000
He can’t even talk to me nicely.

574
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,120
Do your best.

575
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,560
That’s Fadel for you.

576
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,800
He’s rough on the outside,

577
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,880
and on the inside.

578
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,000
You gotta give him a good beating.

579
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,720
Bye.

580
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,960
Chef, one juicy beef burger.

581
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,680
One crispy fries with lots of ketchup.

582
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,760
No veggies, please.

583
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,920
And now,

584
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,160
you have 15 minutes to impress the judges.

585
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,800
If you’re ready,

586
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,920
grab your tools.

587
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,480
Begin.

588
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,000
Go for it.

589
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,200
Chop faster.

590
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,360
Slice faster.

591
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,560
Do it faster.

592
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,480
Faster.

593
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,360
Faster!

594
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,520
Can you do it even faster?

595
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,840
Is this the best you can do?

596
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,840
We’ve got hungry customers outside.

597
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,760
Hurry up.

598
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,360
Hey there.

599
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,000
Are you talking to me?

600
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,679
Yeah.

601
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,920
Mind if I join you?

602
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,600
Oh.

603
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,159
I’m waiting for a friend.

604
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,520
He’s probably working.

605
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,040
But he’ll be here any minute.

606
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,639
How about we bowl together while you wait?

607
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,000
It’d be more fun that way.

608
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,600
Sure.

609
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,080
I’m Tawan.

610
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,120
Bison.

611
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,520
That’s a cool name.

612
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,840
Strong,

613
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,679
but adorable.

614
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,760
Thanks.

615
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,760
That was alright.

616
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,040
Look up there.

617
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,280
Well done.

618
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,240
That was a good stance.

619
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:33,720
You think?

620
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,880
You mean this one?

621
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,000
Yeah.

622
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,800
I throw so much better.

623
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,520
Should we go another round?

624
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,040
Bison.

625
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,960
Oh.

626
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Sorry I’m late.

627
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,040
Something urgent came up.

628
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,120
No need to apologize.

629
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,560
I wasn’t going anywhere anyway.

630
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,960
Oh.

631
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,040
Tawan, this is Kant.

632
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,360
Kant, this is Tawan.

633
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,960
He was just joining me.

634
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,800
Hey.

635
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,720
I saw he was waiting all alone

636
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,320
so I kept him company.

637
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,680
Didn’t want him getting stood up.

638
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,400
He was just teaching me how to bowl like this.

639
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:21,840
Did he?

640
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,440
I didn’t ask, though.

641
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And I taught him that trick.

642
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,760
Oh.

643
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,240
I see.

644
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,320
And I was just trying to keep him off the radar.

645
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,120
Someone as cute as him would attract so many guys, you know?

646
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,600
But now that I think about it,

647
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,760
I’m one of those guys myself.

648
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,480
Well, I’m here now.

649
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,960
Bison doesn’t need your protection.

650
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,760
Unless…

651
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,440
you’re the one I need to protect him from.

652
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
I get it.

653
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,040
I’ll go back to my alley, alright.

654
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,160
It was nice to meet you.

655
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,480
We’re not dating, you know?

656
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,640
And you’re getting jealous already?

657
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,360
Just a bit.

658
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,680
I’ll do anything for you.

659
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,320
If the next set is too much,

660
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,800
let me help.

661
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,360
Don’t worry about me.

662
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,760
I know my limits.

663
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,520
Whoa.

664
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,600
Your veins look so cool.

665
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,600
How’d you find out about my gym?

666
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,400
Hey.

667
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,040
This is a public gym.

668
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,240
It opens 24/7.

669
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,760
799 baht a month.

670
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,880
As if I would miss out on such a good deal.

671
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,080
I’ve been trying to build my muscles, you see.

672
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,600
Maybe one day I’ll look as good as you.

673
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,840
If you plan to frequent this place,

674
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,920
come during the day.

675
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,600
Because I’m here at night.

676
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,520
What?

677
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,520
We can’t show up at the same time?

678
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,280
No.

679
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,520
It’s less crowded at night.

680
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,240
I don’t like when it’s crowded.

681
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,600
But I get frustrated at night.

682
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,960
I need to let off some steam.

683
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,520
I need to sweat it out.

684
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,760
If you need a spotter,

685
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,080
just holler.

686
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,760
I’ll be around here.

687
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,840
Yes!

688
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,640
See?

689
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,440
Told you I never lose.

690
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,800
You know what?

691
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,160
I let you win.

692
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,360
I just love seeing that smile on your face.

693
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,000
Oh, hey.

694
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,680
Your friend Style is quite something.

695
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,240
He’s not afraid of Fadel at all.

696
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,360
I’m a bit shaken to think he’d find out
I have something to do with this.

697
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,760
He’d kill me if he knew.

698
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,760
I doubt it.

699
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,640
You guys are brothers.

700
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,160
I’m sure you can talk it out.

701
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,120
You did this because you’re worried about him.

702
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,120
You just want him to enjoy life, don’t you?

703
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,840
Yeah.

704
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,680
Mother did say

705
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,320
Fadel is too high strung,

706
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,120
while I’m too laid-back.

707
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,320
No middle ground between us.

708
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,720
You call your mom “Mother”?

709
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,400
What are you, a young master?

710
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,160
Not at all.

711
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,160
It’s just our family’s inside joke.

712
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,720
I see.

713
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,960
Hello!

714
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,600
And here’s the moment you’ve all been waiting for:

715
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,880
“Murder on the Dancefloor.”

716
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,040
You’re all welcome on the dancefloor to set it ablaze.

717
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,400
We don’t mind friend duos, couples, or whatever.

718
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,880
Just waltz right on!

719
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,480
The winner takes home this week’s trophy

720
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,480
and a 3000-baht voucher at our diner.

721
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,480
Let’s go!

722
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,160
Count me in!

723
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,200
Hey, you serious?

724
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,520
Of course.

725
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,000
I want that trophy.

726
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,120
Will you dance with me?

727
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,720
I don’t know how to dance.

728
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,640
It’s embarrassing.

729
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,120
Embarrassing?

730
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,120
You were just telling me you’d do anything for me.

731
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,120
But not this little thing?

732
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,120
Let’s do it, then.

733
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:46,880

00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,680
♪ I know what your heart feels inside ♪

752
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,560
Hot, isn’t it?

753
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,440
What are you doing?

754
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,120
What?

755
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,280
Does my naked body make you feel uncomfortable?

756
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,080
There’s no rule against being naked in a sauna.

757
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,520
I just need the heat to seep through every pore on my body.

758
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,440
I’m not uncomfortable.

759
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,720
Do whatever you want.

760
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,640
Just leave me alone.

761
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,040
Alright.

762
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,640
But you’re allowed to look, you know?

763
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,560
I don’t mind.

764
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,280
I know it’s kinda irresistible.

765
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,920
But hey.

766
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,560
Why does it have to be a burger joint?

767
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,560
Why not local food or barbeque?

768
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,680
Why not hot pot or dumplings?

769
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,200
Those are the trends, you know.

770
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,200
No talking in the sauna.

771
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,080
Be quiet.

772
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,440
I really like your name, by the way.

773
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,280
“Fadel.”

774
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,120
It has such a nice ring.

775
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,480
And a good meaning.

776
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,840
“Someone who is virtuous,

777
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,720
generous,

778
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,640
and pure.”

779
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,720
How’d you know that?

780
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,720
Well, it’s such a unique name.

781
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,520
I got curious.

782
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,720
Well, the meaning doesn’t reflect you, to be fair.

783
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,240
You’re not generous,

784
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,200
and you’re not…

785
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,560
I don’t think you’re “pure.”

786
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,320
Cool tattoo.

787
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,240
Damn it, uncle.

788
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,000
Where’d he gone?

789
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,920
Who sent you?

790
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,400
No one did.

791
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,600
Who’d you think you are?

792
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,240
A celebrity?

793
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,480
You’re lying.

794
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,480
You suddenly live at my pace.

795
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,920
Morning jogging, grocery shopping,

796
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,240
showing up at my burger joint,

797
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,640
and now frequenting the same gym?

798
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,480
You want me to believe it’s all coincidental?

799
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:04,800
Of course not.

800
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,440
It’s not a coincidence.

801
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,080
I follow you.

802
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,720
So you’re finally admitting it.

803
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,720
Who sent you?

804
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,160
I like you.

805
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,320
I liked you the moment I crashed into you that night.

806
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,960
It was love at first sight.

807
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,400
So damn romantic.

808
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,680
Straight out of a movie.

809
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,200
Or a freaking soap opera.

810
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,280
I don’t believe you.

811
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,720
You don’t believe me

812
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,560
because you’ve never felt like that with anybody.

813
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,560
This is the kind of thing that takes a heart to understand.

814
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,680
When you know you meet the right one,

815
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,160
you do whatever it takes to get them.

816
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,440
What the hell are you doing?

817
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,680
Stop following me.

818
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,160
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

819
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,920
Is this even worth dying for?

820
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,240
You said you didn’t know how to dance.

821
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,480
You did it so well that I had the courage to do it, too.

822
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,280
I think we match each other’s pace so well.

823
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,960
Both in dancing,

824
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,480
and in…

825
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,640
In what?

826
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,880
In whatever we were doing that first night we met.

827
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,360
I don’t remember, really.

828
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,080
Well, wanna come over tonight?

829
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,520
We can retrace our steps.

830
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,080
Oh, you pervert, you.

831
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,160
I can’t.

832
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,160
Fadel won’t let me.

833
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,400
Okay.

834
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,280
Understandable.

835
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,720
But I’ll wait until we…

836
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,440
get to retrace our steps.

837
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,000
Enough of that.

838
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,120
I’m leaving.

839
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,480
I park over there.

840
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,040
Don’t I deserve something, too?

841
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,400
You get the trophy.

842
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,600
I get nothing.

843
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,960
What do you want?

844
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,160
That’s hardly enough.

845
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,560
One more here, please.

846
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,000
Actually…

847
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,920
Something’s still missing.

848
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,000
I think around here.

849
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,120
You really don’t know when to stop, huh?

850
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,600
I’m going.

851
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,760
Get home safe.

852
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,720
Bye.

853
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:21,760
Kant.

854
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,560
Crap!

855
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,720
Tawan.

856
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,680
It’s me, dude.

857
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,720
Well, how was that?

858
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,880
Did I do a good job hitting on your boyfriend?

859
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,200
You did amazing.

860
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,120
But he’s not my boyfriend yet.

861
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,080
I’ll hire you for something else next time.

862
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,840
Sure, sure.

863
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:46,840
Here.

864
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,920
With tips.

865
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,040
Of course.

866
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:49,880
Thanks, man.

867
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,680
Keep me in the loops.

868
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,440
See ya.

869
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,880
Make sure he knows he really matters to you.

Ugh, Fadel.

880
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,120
What the hell are you playing?

881
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,000
I thought you were a burglar.

882
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,080
Idiot.

883
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,280
Why were you being so careless?

884
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,520
If it wasn’t me, you’d have been in a hearse already.

885
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,240
Where have you been to come home in the morning?

886
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,640
It’s Friday night.

887
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,040
Get used to it.

888
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,800
What’s with the trophy?

889
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,400
Oh.

890
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,720
It’s…

891
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,480
It’s…

892
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,280
I won a sushi-eating competition.

893
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,560
I was so good at it.

894
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,280
I ate almost 50 sushis within 30 minutes.

895
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,040
I was, like, so stuffed, Fadel.

896
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,680
And–And…

897
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,040
They make really good sushi.

898
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,040
I’ll probably take you there and try it some time.

899
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,800
That’s the best story you can come up with?

900
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,800
Fadel, come on.

901
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,520
This is why I didn’t want to tell you.

902
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,520
What if someone made you out?

903
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,000
Fadel.

904
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,560
We’re in the internet era.

905
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,880
Don’t you think having no social media

906
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,040
would be weirder?

907
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,920
People will just clock us immediately.

908
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,600
I’m doing this for us, you know?

909
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,040
I’m trying to blend in.

910
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,320
Stop bullshiting me.

911
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,520
Fine.

912
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,640
Who posted that?

913
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,800
Was it the bowling place?

914
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,160
I’ll tell them to delete it.

915
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,280
If they refuse, I’ll blow their heads off.

916
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:32,920
Alright?

917
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,240
Save your sarcasm.

918
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,160
What about that tattooist?

919
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,120
What is he to you?

920
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,080
We’re not dating yet, if that’s what you mean.

921
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,000
We’re just taking it slow.

922
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,120
What about you?

923
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,600
What of that guy who won’t leave you alone?

924
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,360
Does he pique your interest?

925
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,000
He’s kinda cute.

926
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,320
And he doesn’t seem to be scared of you.

927
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,120
I like him.

928
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,120
He annoys the hell out of me.

929
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,520
Don’t change the subject.

930
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,600
We’re talking about you.

931
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,840
He clearly wants something from you.

932
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,200
What else do you think he wants from me, Fadel?

933
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,680
He wants my body.

934
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,120
He wants my heart.

935
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,520
Look at how adorable I am.

936
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,000
Fadel!

937
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,360
How should I even help you now?

938
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,800
If you want a break, behave.

939
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,480
Or else everything’s just coming back to bite you in the ass.

940
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,360
Understood?

941
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,240
Fine.

942
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,640
I just need the heat to seep through every pore on my body.

943
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,480
You’re allowed to look.

944
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,880
I know it’s kinda irresistible.

945
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,040
I really like your name, by the way.

946
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:02,960
“Fadel.”

947
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,720
Cool tattoo.

948
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,720
I think you should get inside their house.

949
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,000
You want me to enter the tigers’ lair,

950
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,320
you sure I won’t get clawed to death?

951
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,760
If I win,

952
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,440
we’re going to your house tonight.

953
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,800
And if I win,

954
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,800
can I continue what we were doing at your tattoo parlour?

955
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,120
I’ll give you a good time.

956
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,000
I don’t like being pursued.

957
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,760
You don’t fall for me just a little?

958
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,120
I think there’s something fishy about Fadel.

959
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,600
He’s suspicious.

960
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,000
I don’t like being left in the dark.
