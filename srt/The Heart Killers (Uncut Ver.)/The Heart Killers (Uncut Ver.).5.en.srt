1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,860
(Previously) I'm looking for
the kids who hurt my brother.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,810
You have my heart now,

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,500
so take good care of it.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,200
I don't like you being in
my life and changing it.

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,500
I don't like that I miss you.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,800
Be my boyfriend.

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,760
Give me a chance.

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,200
Fine, I'll be your boyfriend.

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,250
You made me hit on a gunman?

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,330
Not a gunman.

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,470
A hitman.

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,671
They don't just use guns.

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,520
Ruerat was behind the death of our parents.

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,220
If the two of us work together,

15
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,960
they'll never catch us.

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,960
I'm sorry I didn't have
time to meet you two before.

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,460
It's okay, Mother.

18
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,930
We know you're busy.

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,210
It's obvious what this is.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,020
What more answers do you need?

21
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,820
So Ruerat really was
behind our parents' death?

22
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,070
Yes.

23
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,370
Your parents refused
to sell him their land.

24
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,100
He had them killed.

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,700
That was how you became orphans,

26
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,500
and I took you in.

27
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,420
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

28
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,550
We could have dealt with him long ago.

29
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,100
Taking out someone
of his status isn't easy.

30
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,400
We must wait for the right moment.

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,500
I see that you two are ready now.

32
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,160
It's a big job.

33
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,640
So I'll give you what you ask for.

34
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,010
Get this done,

35
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,460
and if you want to take a long break,

36
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,270
or even quit,

37
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,300
I'll let you.

38
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,600
There's going to be a party.

39
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,020
It's a good opportunity
to carry out the operation.

40
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,800
I will have Keen take
care of everything for you.

41
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,360
What do you think, Keen?

42
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,500
Yes, Mother.

43
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,990
It's time to take revenge
for your loved ones.

44
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,650
Get it done.

45
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,220
What's wrong?

46
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,860
You look pretty bummed.

47
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,050
I'm just sick of work.

48
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,810
It's just all admin tasks.

49
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,800
No challenge at all.

50
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,400
What do you want to do instead?

51
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,800
You're pretty good at helping people.

52
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,970
You're cheeky now, you know that?

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,310
I thought you liked that.

54
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:25,620
I do.

55
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,550
I'll get you back for
this comment after work.

56
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,620
How would you do that?

57
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,560
Keen.

58
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,100
Are you and Tanont going out?

59
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:58,830
No.

60
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,200
We were just chatting.

61
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,790
Just chatting.

62
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,560
Yes.

63
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:07,960
Good.

64
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,020
I thought you'd start dating

65
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,000
and leave me, too.

66
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,200
"The Heart Killers"
(Episode 5)

67
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,118
What's with you?

68
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,700
Oh, it's just hot

69
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,820
and uncomfortable in here.

70
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,100
Sorry.

71
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,420
That's kinda the point of a sauna.

72
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,500
You seem strange today.

73
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,620
I'm fine.

74
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,300
I'm just not used to this.

75
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,300
It's usually me running after you,

76
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,980
but now you're with me.

77
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,100
You wanted us to be boyfriends.

78
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,140
Well, I'm your boyfriend now.

79
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,300
Or did you change your mind?

80
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,500
I don't mind, you know?

81
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,740
I don't like you that much.

82
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,020
I'll get over it.

83
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,020
Bye, then.

84
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,940
Hey, hey.

85
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,660
Wait.

86
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,420
Are you sure?

87
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,220
Are you intimidated by me?

88
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,020
I'm not intimidated.

89
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,260
I just can't believe
my persistence actually worked.

90
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,860
It didn't.

91
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,060
I told you.

92
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,340
We're on trial.

93
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,900
Should we go back to your garage?

94
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,220
You've been to my restaurant
too many times already.

95
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,500
Nah, let's not.

96
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,020
The garage is messy and full of cars.

97
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,420
We can do it here and get it over with.

98
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,540
Well?

99
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,620
No.

100
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,900
Let's go back to your garage.

101
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,100
You've been in my turf.

102
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,380
Let me be in yours.

103
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,140
If I don't have to move again,

104
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,820
I'll take you in, alright?

105
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,380
Let's take a snapshot.

106
00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:38,051
(Is he cute?)

107
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,660
(The cat is obviously cute.)

108
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,900
(But I'd rather see your face.)

109
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,940
Alright, baby.

110
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,380
Let's take another one.

111
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,380
One, two, three.

112
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,700
(Who's more adorable?)

113
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
(I can't choose.)

114
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,900
(I want to kiss both cat and human.)

115
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,460
See?

116
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,180
I'm just as adorable as you are.

117
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,100
What do we say?

118
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,340
Should we let him give us a kiss?

119
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,580
Hmm?

120
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,140
(I'll let you give me a few
kisses next time, then.)

121
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,180
(Any updates on them yet?)

122
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,700
(Did you get in their house?)

123
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,340
He trusts me enough to go out with me now.

124
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,700
Well, be careful.

125
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,620
Tell your friend, too.

126
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,860
These hitmen hate
just as hard as they love.

127
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,580
Geez, thanks for the fair warning.

128
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,580
I'll put them behind bars
before they catch on to you.

129
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,180
Don't worry.

130
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,380
You could have had that!

131
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,220
Look!

132
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:17,820
Okay!

133
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,700
You want to play this?

134
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,980
I'm just gonna try this.

135
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,180
You know,

136
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,380
I was on the basketball
team in high school.

137
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,780
Very popular with the ladies.

138
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,380
If I didn't have my head
wrapped up in other things,

139
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,940
I could probably have made it to the NBA.

140
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,300
You could have, huh?

141
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,820
You're pretty amazing.

142
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,380
Is there anything you can't do?

143
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,900
I don't think so.

144
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,420
If I got someone as hard to get as you,

145
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,260
I think I'm pretty good.

146
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,580
Right?

147
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,340
Hey.

148
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,660
We're outside.

149
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,620
What were you good at as a child?

150
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,660
I loved drawing.

151
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,660
I loved art.

152
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
I always got an A in my art classes.

153
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,860
PE was never my thing, though.

154
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,500
The only sport I do is swimming.

155
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,620
That's the opposite of me.

156
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,180
I play basketball and football quite well.

157
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,300
Bison doesn't like basketball or football.

158
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,100
What are you doing?

159
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,300
Taking notes.

160
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,900
I'm jotting down what you don't like

161
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,420
so I know not to take you
out on basketball dates.

162
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,380
What kind of date is that?

163
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,500
I'm sure some people do it.

164
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,100
You might not play,

165
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,500
but you can always cheer
me up on the sideline.

166
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,940
I look pretty cool on the court.

167
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,580
It'll definitely make you scream.

168
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,980
Didn't know you stopped betting on football
and are hanging out at arcades now.

169
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,860
I stopped football betting ages ago.

170
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,300
But you used to do that all the time.

171
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,220
Don't you remember?

172
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,100
That Manchester derby match

173
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,700
where you bet all your
money on Manchester City.

174
00:13:02,203 --> 00:13:03,603
You paid off your car
with that money, right?

175
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,860
That was long ago.

176
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,340
I don't do anything shady anymore.

177
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,020
To think you're an upstanding citizen now.

178
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,260
How boring.

179
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,620
What about you, Bison?

180
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,460
You into sports betting?

181
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:16,900
No.

182
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,100
I don't care for it.

183
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,580
Does working at a burger joint

184
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,700
pay you well enough?

185
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,620
How do you know where I work?

186
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:31,900
Well…

187
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,700
You brought Kant a burger the other day.

188
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,540
I assumed from that.

189
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:41,980
Alright, alright.

190
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,580
You're all exemplary people here.

191
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,460
I'll leave you alone now.

192
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,700
But if you're ever interested
in placing your bets,

193
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,180
you know where to find me.

194
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,900
It's a nightly thing.

195
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,260
So I'll always be ready for you.

196
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,660
He sure clings to you.

197
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,460
Was it very serious with him?

198
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,940
Is that why he dared say all that?

199
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,300
Come on.

200
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,100
It's nothing to worry about.

201
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,820
That's just how James is.

202
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,260
I'm not saying anything, am I?

203
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,060
He probably just doesn't
know me well enough.

204
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,420
I might need time to
go and introduce myself.

205
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,060
What do you mean?

206
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,620
I was just saying that.

207
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,340
As if a waiter like me could hurt anyone.

208
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,540
Am I right?

209
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,300
Catch me if you can.

210
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:17,980
Well?

211
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,380
Am I the best or what?

212
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,100
It's just a fluke.

213
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,980
Don't let it get to your head.

214
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,020
Can I ask you something?

215
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,380
Did you become a mechanic

216
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,780
because you wanted to
or because of your family business?

217
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,500
At first, I just wanted to help my dad out.

218
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,460
But when my mother died,

219
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,300
and he lost his bearings for a bit,

220
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,260
I was glad to have something
I could talk to him about.

221
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,260
But after a while,

222
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
it just kinda grew on me.

223
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,540
Would you believe

224
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,700
I even won a car tuning competition?

225
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,020
I know.

226
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,980
How'd you know that?

227
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,980
It was on the internet, you know.

228
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,260
I'm gonna be honest with you…

229
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,460
You said you liked me from
the moment you saw me.

230
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,460
What did you like about me?

231
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,740
I liked the feeling of chasing after you.

232
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,300
I'm a competitive guy.

233
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,220
Being in a race gives me adrenaline.

234
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,540
So you only hit on me for the thrill of it?

235
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,780
This ain't car racing.

236
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,220
Of course not.

237
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,380
I like how you look, too.

238
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,260
I like that you're so different from me.

239
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,820
It's an opportunity to learn,

240
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,740
and it's an experience, you know?

241
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,940
You haven't won, you know?

242
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,300
The game isn't over.

243
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,100
A guy like me

244
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,820
doesn't know how to accept defeat.

245
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,020
Follow me.

246
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,340
Oh, Boss.

247
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,620
You're back.

248
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,820
I'm just about closing up shop for you.

249
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,660
It's alright.

250
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,900
Go home. I'll take it over from here.

251
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,740
Yes, sir.

252
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,780
Where's your father?

253
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,700
On a fishing trip with his buddies.

254
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,180
He deserves a break.

255
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,700
You're quite the son, aren't you?

256
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,100
You take such good care of your dad.

257
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,380
We're all each other has.

258
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,340
When Mom died,

259
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,380
Dad became the most
important person in my life.

260
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,780
You know what?

261
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,020
When I came out to him about liking dudes,

262
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,820
I was so afraid of disappointing him.

263
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,900
But you know what he did?

264
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,020
He tried to set me up with
another mechanic at the garage.

265
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,540
And what did you do?

266
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,180
Look at me.

267
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,620
With my god-sculpted face,

268
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,060
of course I'd prefer to choose my own man.

269
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,420
And you chose me?

270
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,780
You wanna do it here?

271
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,260
Don't tell me you never
fantasized about garage sex.

272
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,180
That's straight out of porn.

273
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,500
Well, wanna give it a shot?

274
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,020
Excuse me.

275
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,940
My car broke down.

276
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,100
Need it fixed?

277
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,408
I don't have any money.

278
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,700
You can pay with something else.

279
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:37,570
He probably just doesn't
know me well enough.

280
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,976
I might need time to
go and introduce myself.

281
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,380
Hey, Otto.

282
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,020
Can I ask you something?

283
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,300
Yeah, bro?

284
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,820
I haven't heard from you in ages.

285
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,011
Which teams do you wanna bet on tonight?

286
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,540
I didn't call to place bets.

287
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,940
I wanna know if James is there.

288
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,620
He's not here yet.

289
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,020
Why didn't you just call him?

290
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,300
I did, but he didn't pick up the phone.

291
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,420
It's alright.

292
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,300
I'll call him again.

293
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,420
(I see.)

294
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,540
(Strange.)

295
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,700
(Someone just came
here and asked after him.)

296
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,580
Who?

297
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,700
(I don't know the guy.)

298
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,580
(But he's good-looking.)

299
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,740
Probably someone James' hooking up with.

300
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,460
(Small and pretty.)

301
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,780
Okay, thanks.

302
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,540
What was that?

303
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,740
Hurry up, guys.

304
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,340
What happened there?

305
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,100
That scar.

306
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,540
This?

307
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,660
Just a little accident.

308
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,420
Will you tell me about it?

309
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,220
Why'd you want to know?

310
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,500
It's just an occupational hazard.

311
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,260
I want to know more about you.

312
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,620
You don't tell me anything.

313
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,340
Like the Rise Up support group…

314
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,060
Why do you go?

315
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,100
I lost my parents.

316
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,620
You can talk to me, you know?

317
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,460
I lost my mother to cancer.

318
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,580
You don't have to tell anyone else.

319
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,940
My parents were murdered.

320
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,540
I'm sorry.

321
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,820
Let's… change the subject.

322
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,940
You had any lovers before?

323
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:23,700
No.

324
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,500
My life isn't exactly easy.

325
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,820
I don't want to drag anyone along with me.

326
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,620
Does owning a burger joint

327
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,780
so difficult that you can't date?

328
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,540
I don't think anyone wants
to risk their life with me.

329
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,580
What risk?

330
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,020
I mean…

331
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,820
The risk of the business going under.

332
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,340
You know running a restaurant
isn't exactly a secure job.

333
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,620
Maybe you just need to
find something else to do.

334
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,420
Do something that allows you to love

335
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,500
without risking your loved ones.

336
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,020
Style.

337
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,260
Kant?

338
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,580
Fadel.

339
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,900
Sorry for interrupting.

340
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,820
Kant, what's up?

341
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,300
Why didn't you call me up?

342
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,940
I did. You didn't pick up.

343
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,700
What were you guys doing?

344
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,820
Yeah, well…

345
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,140
What do you want?

346
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,740
I need to talk to you in private.

347
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,020
Can I?

348
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,980
I'm gonna talk to Kant for a bit.

349
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,540
Sure.

350
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,380
I'll wait outside.

351
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,460
What?

352
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,220
Bison is on his way to take out
your old hookup, James?

353
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,020
Yeah.

354
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,180
What would we do if
Bison actually hurt him?

355
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,740
You know Bison's pretty hot-headed.

356
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,380
Crap, dude, worry about yourself first.

357
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,380
You could die any minute.

358
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,740
I can't help you.

359
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,780
Someone is in danger, you know?

360
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,780
I had nothing to do with this.

361
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,700
You dragged me along.

362
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,100
By the way, I have a
bad feeling about Fadel.

363
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,260
He scares me.

364
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,620
But I like his rough romantic side.

365
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:41,980
The hell?

366
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,300
This ain't no time to
confess your weird feelings.

367
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,180
I think we need Fadel's help with this.

368
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,380
You want me to talk to Bison about your ex?

369
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
Not my ex.

370
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,620
But I did sleep with him.

371
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,740
How many times?

372
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:11,980
Once.

373
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,420
I was single so I slept around a bit.

374
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,220
But now your brother is
the only one I'm serious about.

375
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,740
He gets furiously jealous.

376
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,620
James is a bookie.

377
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,500
It could be dangerous for Bison.

378
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,340
How can I even help?

379
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,340
I can't exactly stop him.

380
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,020
But this isn't bad, either,

381
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,180
he needs to see your true colors.

382
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,620
Won't you help him out?

383
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,900
You're my boyfriend, you know?

384
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,340
If you like me at all,

385
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,500
you have to help my friend.

386
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,500
Fine.

387
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,300
I'll help.

388
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,500
But I can't promise you anything, alright?

389
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,060
Of course, brother.

390
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,020
Good job, buddy.

391
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,300
But…

392
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,220
Once my brother makes up
his mind about something,

393
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,260
even I can't stop him.

394
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,100
He's a mad dog.

395
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,620
Yo, anyone wanna try this?

396
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,540
Yeah, ain't no way.

397
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,700
Don't you even think about it.

398
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,660
(Yeah?)

399
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:37,860
Where are you?

400
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,180
At some larb place.

401
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,300
(Liar.)

402
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,740
(You can't handle spicy food.)

403
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,980
Why'd you be at some larb place?

404
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,940
Tell me where you are.

405
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,700
I'm just running some errands.

406
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,740
Don't worry.

407
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,020
I'm your brother.

408
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,260
Of course I have to worry.

409
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,700
I'm with some friends.

410
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,540
Bye.

411
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,380
Bison.

412
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,660
Bison!

413
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,500
What did he say?

414
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:05,980
Where is he?

415
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,660
He didn't tell me where.

416
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,300
But I heard some people watching football.

417
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,220
Football…

418
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:13,820
Shit.

419
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,740
I have to go.

420
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,980
Thanks, big brother.

421
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,300
Wow.

422
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,900
I hope you're not the jealous type
like your brother is.

423
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,620
If you mean well, then you have
nothing to worry about.

424
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,820
But if you're just leading me on,

425
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,380
or trying to get something out of me,

426
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,860
you're in for some serious bruises.

427
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,780
ZEUS

428
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,980
10K on Liverpool.

429
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:07,860
Oh?

430
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,380
It's you.

431
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,380
Kant's boy.

432
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:12,980
What's your name again?

433
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,660
Bison?

434
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,140
What a freaking name.

435
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,540
Might as well be named “buffalo.”

436
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,420
What?

437
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,140
You're going behind his back to gamble?

438
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,780
Are you putting up a good act for his sake?

439
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,020
I'll let you in on a secret…

440
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,740
Kant is a freaking douchebag.

441
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,300
The good guy mask ain't
gonna stay on forever.

442
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,540
I'm not trying to be a good guy.

443
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,660
I'm here to talk to you.

444
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,100
You're pretty crazy, huh,

445
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,020
to show up here on my turf?

446
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,820
Didn't pick you for a jealous boyfriend.

447
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,540
Kant is one thing.

448
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,260
But I'm here to tell you
to stop following me.

449
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,300
Think I didn't notice?

450
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,420
What are you, an amateur stalker?

451
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,020
If you knew, why didn't
you tell Kant anything?

452
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,420
Because that's not my business.

453
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,180
I was waiting for you to reveal yourself.

454
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,220
I looked you up.

455
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,900
You're just a bookie at
a shady betting house.

456
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,460
I have nothing to be scared of.

457
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,100
I'll let Kant deal with you in his part.

458
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,020
But on my part,

459
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,020
you have to stop following me.

460
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,620
Bison!

461
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,180
You wanna try me, huh?

462
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:21,700
Well?

463
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:26,780
Here.

464
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,540
We're in for some big win tonight.

465
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,460
Choose well, brother.
We don't do refunds, you know?

466
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,460
Otto.

467
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,060
Oh, Kant.

468
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,260
You said you quit
betting. Why are you here?

469
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,540
Where's James?

470
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,540
I need to talk to him.

471
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:40,940
James?

472
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,780
He went outside

473
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,140
with someone I don't know.

474
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,500
Small, petite guy.

475
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,620
Same one I told you about.

476
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:51,940
Who scored that?

477
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,740
Oh, Kant?

478
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:57,780
Kant!

479
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,140
No need to wipe so hard.

480
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,980
If you're impatient about Ruerat,

481
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,780
don't be.

482
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,700
We can handle it.

483
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,020
You and I are in this boat together.

484
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,260
Ruerat is the last jerk we have to kill.

485
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,420
After that, we can live however we want.

486
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,980
But besides this Ruerat thing,

487
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,420
what the hell did you do?

488
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,780
What?

489
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,460
What are you talking about?

490
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,700
I'm talking about Kant's ex hookup.

491
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,860
What did you do to him?

492
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:29,940
How did you know that?

493
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,060
Did Kant tell you?

494
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,220
He was afraid you would
do something stupid.

495
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,740
Well?

496
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,940
What did you do to him?

497
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,100
You wanna try me, huh?

498
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,620
Well?

499
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,020
Do you?

500
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,460
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.

501
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,740
Don't kill me.

502
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,020
If you don't stop,

503
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,420
your resting place is
down there on the floor.

504
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,540
Alright.

505
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,140
I promise to stop following you and Kant.

506
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,780
What got you so hung up on him?

507
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,260
Did he promise you something?

508
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,900
No, he didn't

509
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,900
He was just good to me when I had no one.

510
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,980
When I was down and out,

511
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,660
he was the only one who kept me alive.

512
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,100
He gave me money to get by.

513
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,060
I just couldn't help but fall for him.

514
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,780
You stupid jerk.

515
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,100
Just 'cause he felt sorry for you
doesn't mean he loved you.

516
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,380
I will disappear from him now.

517
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,020
I swear.

518
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,980
Please don't kill me.

519
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:30,660
Fine.

520
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,020
I won't.

521
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,940
But you have to get lost.

522
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,540
And don't tell Kant about this.

523
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,220
If I see your face again,

524
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,260
I'm putting one of these bullets
through your skull.

525
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,660
Understood?

526
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,140
Okay.

527
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,620
Okay.

528
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,780
See?

529
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,420
I dealt with him with calm and clarity.

530
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,580
I talked things out with him.

531
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,420
What's the gunshot for, then?

532
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,580
Showing off?

533
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,860
I had to show him it ain't no prop, right?

534
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,540
I don't want to interfere.

535
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,100
But we're asking for a break from work,

536
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,100
so be careful what you do.

537
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,340
Don't cause trouble.

538
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,140
Yes, Dad.

539
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,700
You little shithead…

540
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,540
Hey.

541
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,180
I went looking for James
at his workplace and his house.

542
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,660
But he wasn't there.

543
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,500
You think that's weird?

544
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,060
Maybe he just went out of town.

545
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,900
Don't forget he's neck deep in debts.

546
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,140
I don't think it has
anything to do with Bison.

547
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,980
You're way too optimistic.

548
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,540
Did you forget what they are?

549
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,420
He's a hitman.

550
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,620
I know that.

551
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,140
I was sleeping with his brother last night

552
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,420
all because you asked me to, didn't I?

553
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,020
Yeah.

554
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,220
But I don't want anyone
else risking their lives.

555
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,020
I have to get this job done.

556
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,140
Come to think of it.

557
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,300
How would I even get through this?

558
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,300
I compromised my whole body,

559
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,340
and if we're being honest,

560
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,980
I've already compromised
half of my heart, too.

561
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,660
I'm beginning to worry about him now.

562
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,660
Don't fall in love with him at all costs.

563
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,420
You're one to talk

564
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,400
when Bison has you
wrapped around his finger.

565
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,900
I know.

566
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,420
That's why I'm trying
to end things quickly.

567
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,780
Once those two get arrested,

568
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,420
we walk free.

569
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,540
Holy crap.

570
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,020
Hope it ends before either one
of us kicks the bucket.

571
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,140
I shouldn't have put
my heart on the line for this.

572
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,900
Can you ask Fadel out
on a double date tonight?

573
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,060
You don't have to do anything.

574
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,700
Just make sure he
stays with you at all times.

575
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,100
What are you gonna do?

576
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,300
Making use of my
Fast and Furious skills once more.

577
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,820
What's with your t-shirts?

578
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,940
It's our team jerseys.

579
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,060
We invited you out for a bowling match.

580
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,020
Of course we have teams, right?

581
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,060
What's KB?

582
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,260
Kant and Bison.

583
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,700
Here I've got F and S.

584
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,780
Fadel and Style.

585
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,420
I put your name first, you know?

586
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,460
You like that?

587
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,460
Do you like it?

588
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:38,980
Of course.

589
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,860
Blue is my favorite color.

590
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,820
Okay.

591
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,512
Noted. Blue is your favorite color.

592
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,420
I'm going to get changed.

593
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,100
Let's go, Fadel.

594
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,500
No can do.

595
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,780
What now?

596
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,260
I agreed to a date.

597
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,380
I didn't say I'd do everything
you guys want to do.

598
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,820
Ugh.

599
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,420
What a killjoy.

600
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,380
I customized this shirt for you, you know?

601
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,660
How'd you know what size I wear?

602
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,220
I've touched you enough
to know what your size is.

603
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,940
Come on.

604
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,340
Please.

605
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,220
We can't have an S without his F.

606
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,660
Please.

607
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,340
F stands for ‘Fadel, '
not ‘fail, ' you know?

608
00:39:29,707 --> 00:39:30,747
Come on, Fadel.

609
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,300
You're here.

610
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,660
Might as well just go for it.

611
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,420
Fine.

612
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,100
But I'm taking it off
as soon as we're done.

613
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,140
Alright.

614
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,900
Take it off at my place.

615
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,540
Style, you.

616
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,220
Be right back.

617
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,540
Fadel!

618
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,940
Whoa!

619
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,180
I threw a strike, too!

620
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,780
I kinda feel bad, you know?

621
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,620
For asking your friend to hit on
my brother just so we could go out.

622
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,020
But on the other hand, I'm glad I did.

623
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,900
I haven't seen him so happy in a long time.

624
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,380
Your friend won't dump him, will he?

625
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,460
I can't say, to be honest.

626
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,660
But he did tell me he
really likes your brother.

627
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,500
He said your brother
is weird and off-putting.

628
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,460
Cool.

629
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,660
Hey.

630
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,220
Did you think I'd hurt James?

631
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,340
What do you take me for?

632
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,900
You even went to Fadel to stop me?

633
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,620
I remember how crazy
you went at that PE teacher.

634
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,180
I was worried about you.

635
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:04,860
And…

636
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,580
I want you to trust me.

637
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,500
No matter how bad my past was,

638
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,980
I just want to be a better man for you now.

639
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,540
Stop that.

640
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,140
I wasn't going to hurt him, you know?

641
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,620
I just wanted to talk to him.

642
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,900
He had been following us for a while.

643
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,540
Just be open with me about everything.

644
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,260
Finding out by myself later kinda hurts.

645
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,020
Okay.

646
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,900
I promise to tell you everything.

647
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:52,660
Okay.

648
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,580
I'm okay now.

649
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:57,820
Come on.

650
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,540
What are you doing?

651
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,060
No way.

652
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:01,820
It's embarrassing.

653
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,460
Embarrassing?

654
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,940
You weren't embarrassed
dancing at that host club.

655
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,300
What are you doing?

656
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,860
What dance is this?

657
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,100
Stay over at my place tonight.

658
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,300
Your brother and my
buddy look good together.

659
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,860
I'd say they're the perfect match.

660
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,140
I don't need your accolade.

661
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,060
Even if I let him in now,

662
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,100
I still don't trust him.

663
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,820
A guy like me doesn't go
trusting someone 100%.

664
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:25,980
Oh?

665
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,700
Not even me?

666
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,820
You're at 80% at best.

667
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,300
I feel like you're hiding something
from me in the rest 20%.

668
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,260
What are you talking about?

669
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,140
What do I have to do to
gain your complete trust?

670
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:46,900
It'll never happen.

671
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,620
No matter how much you love someone,

672
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,780
I just don't believe

673
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,780
that you can completely lay
yourself bare in front of them.

674
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,940
You're a difficult man, indeed.

675
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:05,980
Let's sing.

676
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,660
For funsies.

677
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,340
No.

678
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:10,740
I don't want to.

679
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,500
Go for it if you want.

680
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,940
What's with you?

681
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,700
No one actually pays attention, you know?

682
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,860
This place is full of drunk people.

683
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,660
Let's do it.

684
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,500
Let's go.

685
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:25,980
No.

686
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,420
Quickly. Come on.

687
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,540
This song is a must.

688
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,300
Come on.

689
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:15,820
Hey, Babe, what's up?

690
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:17,700
What?

691
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,220
Assaulted?

692
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,020
Are you alright?

693
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:23,860
Who did this?

694
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,380
Those jerks again?

695
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,580
I'll be there.

696
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,620
Go hide.

697
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,580
What happened?

698
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,620
Babe got ganged up on
by his bullies at school.

699
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,660
He's hiding right now.

700
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,340
Is he okay?

701
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,020
I don't know.

702
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:41,980
But I have to go.

703
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:42,740
I'm coming with you.

704
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,220
No.

705
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,060
I'll be back in a bit.

706
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,020
I want to go with you.

707
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,420
I gotta deal with those kids.

708
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,740
I don't want you risking
yourself for me again.

709
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,580
Kant.

710
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,020
Do you want me to go with you?

711
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,260
No.

712
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,500
You guys stay here.

713
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,660
This is about my
brother so I'll deal with it.

714
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:02,940
We're here to have fun.

715
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,820
Don't let me be a killjoy.

716
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:06,980
I'll deal with it quickly
and be right back.

717
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:09,460
Be careful.

718
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,220
I'll be right back.

719
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,340
Now that's more like it.

720
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,420
He finally looks like
someone trustworthy for once.

721
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,580
I'm going to Kant's place.

722
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,020
He's been gone too long.

723
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,660
He'll be here soon.

724
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,260
I'll call him.

725
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,740
I already did and he didn't pick up.

726
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:35,820
I'm worried.

727
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,380
I'll just wait for him at home.

728
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,540
I want to check out
if Babe is alright, too.

729
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,540
He must be shaken.

730
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:41,820
Sure.

731
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,340
See you tomorrow.

732
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,020
Be careful.

733
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,780
Wait, you're not coming home tonight?

734
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:52,620
Okay.

735
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,420
(The mad buffalo is heading to your place.)

736
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:02,740
Hey.

737
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,340
Hey.

738
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,020
Kant.

739
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,500
Hey!

740
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,300
You scared me.

741
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,420
Sorry.

742
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,140
You carry a gun?

743
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,660
Fadel told me to.

744
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,260
We recently had a burglar.

745
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,820
What are you doing here?

746
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,620
I told you I'd meet you
back at the bowling alley.

747
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:40,780
I came to see you.

748
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,060
You didn't pick up any of my calls.

749
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,100
I got worried.

750
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:45,740
Sorry. My phone died.

751
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,620
Carry around a portable charger.

752
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,740
I don't like it when you
don't answer my calls.

753
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,860
Okay.

754
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,100
It's well noted.

755
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:58,860
How are you, Babe?

756
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,220
I'm alright.

757
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,340
They were ganging up on me.

758
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,902
If it was one on one, I
might have taken them.

759
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:04,940
Kant made it in time.

760
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:06,900
Good.

761
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,420
Tell us when something happens, alright?

762
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,580
Of course.

763
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,860
Excuse me.

764
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,420
Did I scare you?

765
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,820
You think Babe knows you and I are dating?

766
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,060
I think he guessed as much.

767
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:33,980
Well…

768
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,260
Can I stay over?

769
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,140
Please?

770
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,260
Of course.

771
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,460
But let's not be loud tonight.

772
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,180
I'll cover your mouth if you're loud.

773
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,300
I like that.

774
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:13,740
Hey.

775
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,700
Wait, you have a tattoo there?

776
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,220
I never saw it before.

777
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,180
This one?

778
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,660
My first tattoo, actually.

779
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,478
I did it myself.

780
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,340
But it turned out super ugly.

781
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,780
I've been thinking about
getting another one over it.

782
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,100
Don't.

783
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,540
It's not ugly at all.

784
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:51,700
I think it's pretty,

785
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,780
with its own story.

786
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,220
I love every story on your body.

787
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:34,700
Careful.

788
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,380
You know,

789
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,860
I'm really lucky to have met you.

790
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:52,140
I can feel that my life is about to change.

791
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:31,740
You know,

792
00:55:33,201 --> 00:55:34,380
it feels so weird

793
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,620
every time I'm with you.

794
00:55:37,912 --> 00:55:38,717
How so?

795
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,318
Sometimes you make me feel so scared,

796
00:55:44,377 --> 00:55:46,318
and sometimes you make me feel so safe.

797
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,820
It wouldn't hurt to be wary of me.

798
00:55:50,082 --> 00:55:50,989
Like I said,

799
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:54,602
no one can truly lay
themselves bare for someone.

800
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,020
The real me

801
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,180
might be scarier than you think.

802
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,140
Will you lay yourself bare for me?

803
00:56:05,367 --> 00:56:07,900
I promise that no matter who you are,

804
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:10,734
I'll still like you.

805
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,088
Words are cheap.

806
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,820
I'll do that when you're ready.

807
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,620
You can judge, then.

808
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:29,260
One day,

809
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,660
I'll be your 100%.

810
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,300
I just hope you don't get any new scars.

811
00:57:57,592 --> 00:57:59,168
(Next Week)
If you got everything you wanted,

812
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,248
I guess we're done here.

813
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:03,274
Who said we are?

814
00:58:03,448 --> 00:58:04,765
Let's get this revenge for our parents.

815
00:58:05,742 --> 00:58:07,533
And we can finally start
dating without worries.

816
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,660
If they really did strike tomorrow,

817
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,420
and Captain arrested them,

818
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,192
what would we do?

819
00:58:13,213 --> 00:58:15,340
Are you saying tonight is
the last time I'd see him?

820
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,020
There are only two options.

821
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:18,509
If we can't stop them,

822
00:58:19,002 --> 00:58:20,420
we might as well have the time
of our lives tonight.

823
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,460
Babe!
