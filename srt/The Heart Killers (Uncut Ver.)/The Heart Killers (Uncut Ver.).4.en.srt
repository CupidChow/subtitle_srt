1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,520
(Previously)
Your new job.

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,300
I promise we'll take care of this thing.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,400
This ain't no hit-and-run.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,910
I gave you what you wanted.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,120
I want to date.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,860
Better yet, get inside their house.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,860
You're asking me to
enter the tigers' lair here.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,160
You know I could get
clawed to death, right?

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,610
If I win,

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,370
we go back to your place.

11
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,350
If we go back to my place,

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,930
can we continue what we left
off at your studio the other day?

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,340
I'll give you a big show.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,670
Hey.

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,690
Hey.

16
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,200
Hey.

17
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:18,990
Hey.

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,380
Hey.

19
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,220
What are you doing?

20
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,800
How did you get inside my house?

21
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,520
Your brother was dead drunk.

22
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,520
I gave him a ride home.

23
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,610
I'm looking for a bathroom.

24
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,320
I need to pee.

25
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,550
The bathroom isn't here.

26
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,510
It's too dark to see so I can't find it.

27
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,320
What's in your pockets?

28
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,270
Empty them.

29
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,160
There's nothing here.

30
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,500
I don't have anything on me.

31
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,400
Can you first, please, calm down

32
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,890
and lower your gun?

33
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,130
Don't want it going off now, do we?

34
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,190
What's wrong with it?

35
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,380
It'd be like shooting a thief.

36
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,900
I told you I'm not stealing anything.

37
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,940
I just gave your drunk brother a ride home.

38
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,410
Empty your pockets.

39
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,610
Do it.

40
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,630
Can you let me go pee first?

41
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,550
I really have to go.

42
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,000
I said empty the damn pockets.

43
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,990
It's just my car key.

44
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,180
I don't believe you.

45
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,280
I'll do it myself.

46
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,160
Hey, you don't want me
to pee right here, do you?

47
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,820
If that gun goes off, it
ain't gonna look pretty.

48
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,320
That'd be nice.

49
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,270
Bison needs to get his
head straight about you.

50
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,010
My cigarettes.

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,550
Fadel.

52
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,120
Bison.

53
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,620
Are you okay?

54
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,220
I was looking for a towel to wipe you down.

55
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,570
Didn't you say you were
looking for the bathroom?

56
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,650
I was doing both things.

57
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,290
Your brother is throwing up
and you're still nitpicking me?

58
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,580
What kind of brother are you?

59
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,810
Save your lecture.

60
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,990
I can take care of my own brother.

61
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,930
Go home.

62
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,000
Are you alright?

63
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,600
I'll take care of him.

64
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,820
I said go away!

65
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,040
And don't come back.

66
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,240
If you show up here again,

67
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,210
even Bison won't save you from me.

68
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,280
Go!

69
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,130
Hey.

70
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,910
I have to go.

71
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,250
Crap…

72
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,000
Crap. That was close.

73
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,300
"The Heart Killers"
(Episode 4)

74
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,220
The one rule here is we do
not bring anyone home.

75
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,540
And what did you do?

76
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,420
What if he was a narc?

77
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,950
What's the big deal?

78
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,850
If he's so troublesome,
just kill him.

79
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,200
Don't say things you won't do.

80
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,200
It's annoying.

81
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,290
Look.

82
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,810
Will you believe now
that Kant was never here?

83
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,760
It was suspicious enough
that he was outside the room.

84
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,980
If I didn't come home right
then and he got in, what'd we do?

85
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,530
Besides being a tattoo artist and having a
brother, what else do you even know about him?

86
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,680
What else is there to know?

87
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,820
You know,

88
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,110
I ran a background check on him.

89
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,610
He was a thief.

90
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,540
He stole cars for parts.

91
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,450
Cops were after him for years.

92
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,000
Did you know that?

93
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,180
That's pretty cool.

94
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,310
Everyone has a past.

95
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,980
That's normal.

96
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,140
You know what's not normal?

97
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,640
The fact that he's never been arrested.

98
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,440
You think that's not strange?

99
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
He must have made
some deal with the police.

100
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,410
What's more,

101
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,350
the way you were last night

102
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,330
seemed more like you were poisoned.

103
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,580
You threw up exactly like
that secretary at the host club.

104
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,840
Did you realize that?

105
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,740
You're overthinking, Fadel.

106
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,940
I know that drug well enough.

107
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,870
You think I wouldn't
notice it if I ingested it?

108
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,100
You know,

109
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,490
the reason I don't want to fall for anyone

110
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,630
is because I know once
your heart is involved,

111
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,090
you'd become blind

112
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,260
and careless like you are now.

113
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,320
If you want it,

114
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,980
I'll give it to you.

115
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,590
Crap…

116
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,420
Morning, Dad.

117
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,750
Hey.

118
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,450
Have breakfast.

119
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,360
Made it for you.

120
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You're not going jogging this morning.

121
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,540
You've been going for a
while now, haven't you?

122
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,610
I'm still doing it.

123
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,480
But absence makes the
heart grow fonder, you know?

124
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,640
What are you talking about?

125
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,760
Don't tell me you're only
jogging because of a girl?

126
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,980
A girl?

127
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,400
A boy, actually.

128
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,320
Oh, yeah, my bad.

129
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,280
I forgot you liked men.

130
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,470
But hey, if this is how
you want to play it,

131
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,960
make sure he's actually into you.

132
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,690
Or else he's just relieved
to see a jerk like you gone.

133
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,220
With a face like mine,

134
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,480
I doubt he'll forget me so easily.

135
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,150
Oh, you're really something.

136
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,190
Oww, it's hot!

137
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,480
Oh, Dad.

138
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Serves you right for talking too much.

139
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,830
Well, who'd you think I took after?

140
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,310
Watch it!

141
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,940
Should have told me it was hot.

142
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,510
Sorry.

143
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,030
Thanks.

144
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,110
Oh, hey there.

145
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:13,760
Hi.

146
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,990
What would you like today?

147
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,510
Tenderloin, please.

148
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,050
Of course.

149
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,860
Excuse me.

150
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,480
Yeah?

151
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,480
Where'd the guy who was always here go?

152
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,700
Who?

153
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,970
The guy who's about my height.

154
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,800
Oh, you mean the boy who
always messes with you?

155
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,430
Yes.

156
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,550
He's not coming here anymore.

157
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,750
Too bad.

158
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,100
He was good for business.

159
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,340
I actually wanted to hire him for real.

160
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,350
He's such a sweet talker.

161
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,420
Got me blushing from ears to ears.

162
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,860
Gave this old woman something
to look forward to, alright.

163
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,470
Hello.

164
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,030
I'll be late to work.

165
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,350
Take care of things on your end.

166
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,780
Yeah.

167
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,560
You don't have to come to work today.

168
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,360
Just make sure you take care of him.

169
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,380
Oh, hey.

170
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
You're alright now?

171
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,070
Yeah.

172
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,480
I feel so much better.

173
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,460
I learned my lesson not
to drink with you anymore.

174
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,270
You really know how to hold your liquor.

175
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,880
As if.

176
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,500
I was throwing up all night.

177
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,200
What's this?

178
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,220
Faux leather.

179
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,290
I use it to teach.

180
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,480
Cool.

181
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,100
I didn't know you teach.

182
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,980
Just the basics, really.

183
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,500
You gotta learn this
kind of thing on the job.

184
00:15:17,941 --> 00:15:19,600
Can you teach me?

185
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,570
I want to learn how to tattoo.

186
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,630
You serious?

187
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,750
Yeah.

188
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,750
Maybe one day I can do it on you.

189
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,350
You think?

190
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:33,980
Sure.

191
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,980
I'll teach you very exclusively.

192
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,300
Let me get the tools.

193
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,070
You're back.

194
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,960
How was it?

195
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,960
Everything went well?

196
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,120
I am back.

197
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,660
Did you miss me?

198
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,700
We're not open yet.

199
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,700
Why are you here?

200
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,530
I wasn't going to come.

201
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,340
But some auntie told me
someone asked about me.

202
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,100
Missed me, didn't you?

203
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,760
Missed you, my ass.

204
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,410
You annoy the hell out of me.

205
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,420
You mess up my routine.

206
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,960
I won't hold what happened
last night against you.

207
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,450
I was asking for it.

208
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm just here to tell you that

209
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,830
it doesn't matter how scary you are,

210
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,170
I'm hooked.

211
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,410
Hey.

212
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,030
Can I ask you something?

213
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,290
What do I have to do to win you over?

214
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,550
Easy.

215
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,240
Get out of my face.

216
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,610
I know

217
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,660
a guy like you just needs a little nudge.

218
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,980
You don't know me.

219
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,340
You're turned on

220
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,250
when I mess with you.

221
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,440
Don't try to control everything.

222
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,190
If you bottle it up,

223
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,240
it could explode one day.

224
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,430
Oh, we're doing it in the kitchen?

225
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,820
Wild.

226
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,650
I like it.

227
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,780
You won't ever get what you want.

228
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,570
Get out of here.

229
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,910
I said get out.

230
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,930
You're ditching me?

231
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,370
I ain't letting you.

232
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,940
Like that, yeah.

233
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,980
How's your brother?

234
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,960
He's fussy, per usual.

235
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,040
I'm used to it.

236
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,170
What about you?

237
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,300
Were you scared?

238
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,600
He was pointing a gun at you, you know?

239
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,970
Of course I was.

240
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,240
But I understand.

241
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,280
With a stranger in his house
in the middle of the night,

242
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,560
I'd have done the same thing.

243
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,520
Thank you for taking care of me last night.

244
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,310
I wasn't usually such
a weakling with alcohol.

245
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,050
Did you give me something?

246
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,360
The only thing I gave you
was my friend's homebrew.

247
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,430
She brewed it herself so it's quite strong.

248
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,130
Thank you, though,

249
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,940
for coming all the way
here to explain this to me.

250
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,200
But your brother being overly protective

251
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,670
won't make me stop liking you.

252
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,550
Do you really like me

253
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,800
or are you just curious about me?

254
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,680
Is it strange to be curious
about the person I fell for?

255
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
You never told me about yourself.

256
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,120
Because I'm not an interesting person.

257
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,250
I'm just a tattoo artist

258
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,480
who lives with his teen brother.

259
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,270
You don't think the part
where you used to steal cars

260
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,580
was worth mentioning?

261
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,600
How'd you know that?

262
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,150
You should be telling me

263
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,200
why you didn't tell me that.

264
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,840
It was just something I did…

265
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,230
to give my brother a better life.

266
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,700
Like before my parents died.

267
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,440
That sounds like something to be proud of.

268
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,350
Why didn't you tell me?

269
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,790
Hello, Bison.

270
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,800
Sorry. I didn't know you're busy.

271
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,040
I'm here to give you the printer ink.

272
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,710
Thanks.

273
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,320
Did school end already?

274
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,180
Why are you home so early?

275
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,570
I have a headache so I asked to come home.

276
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,810
You have a headache?

277
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,910
Do you want to go to a doctor?

278
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,000
Nah.

279
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:18,910
It's too expensive.

280
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,880
I paid for your health insurance, dude.

281
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,990
Don't worry about it.

282
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,000
No.

283
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,500
I'll feel better after a nap.

284
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,562
I'll buy you some spicy
soup for dinner, then.

285
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,800
You want some omelette with that?

286
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,430
Let's go talk somewhere else.

287
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,100
Sure.

288
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,120
But let's do it later.

289
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,150
Didn't you see Babe just now?

290
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,800
Babe?

291
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,120
The bruises under his clothes.

292
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,620
Did he get into a fight at school?

293
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,980
I don't know.

294
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,360
He's been acting weird lately.

295
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,680
He's not his bright usual self.

296
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,790
And he goes straight to his
room when he gets home.

297
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,220
I think I should talk to him about this.

298
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,320
Wait.

299
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,770
I don't think he's going to tell you.

300
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,980
Let's find the answer ourselves.

301
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,180
Your food is here.

302
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,850
Have a good meal.

303
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,600
Why are you still here?

304
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,420
I'm not going.

305
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,380
What you gonna do?

306
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,000
Punch me in the face?

307
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,210
In front of all these good people?

308
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,180
Go on.

309
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,590
They're going to post the video
online and your place is going down.

310
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,260
Or do you want to do what
we did in the storage room?

311
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,420
I'm not against it.

312
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,200
I've been thinking of getting
an OnlyFans account anyway.

313
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,840
And you can be my first bang.

314
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,620
Put a shirt on and get out of here.

315
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,700
I don't have one.

316
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,700
You tore it up.

317
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,590
Put this on and get out of here.

318
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:51,790
Go back to your garage.

319
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,640
Okay.

320
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,390
I'm not ruining your career, then.

321
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,320
But just keep in mind:

322
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,950
Nobody gets to nail and bail me.

323
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,860
I'll be the first.

324
00:26:11,183 --> 00:26:12,800
A guy like Style won't back down.

325
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,520
Feel free to take some photos.

326
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,230
And post the videos if you have some.

327
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,600
Go for it.

328
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,050
Run this place out of business.

329
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,300
Let's do it, guys.

330
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,750
I'm really sorry about this.

331
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,960
Hey.

332
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,500
Where you going?

333
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,080
I'm looking for the kids
who hurt my brother.

334
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,460
Calm down.

335
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,320
This school has like a thousand kids.

336
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,710
How'd you know who did it?

337
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,230
Where should I start, then?

338
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,260
What about your brother's social media?

339
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,300
Did he post anything?

340
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,050
CUTE. I SHIP IT.

341
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:23,970
WHOOPS, SENSING SOMETHING. YOU
LOOK LIKE A GAY COUPLE. SISSY BOYS. OMG.

342
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,130
These little shits…

343
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,130
Hey, hey.

344
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,170
Slow down.

345
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,550
We're outsiders.

346
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,910
They'll throw us out if we barge in.

347
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,980
Well, what's your plan?

348
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,330
We gotta be discreet.

349
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,753
Just curious.

350
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,861
Did you and Babe do it yet?

351
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,366
Did you do him?

352
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,083
Or did you let him do you?

353
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,415
Tell me.

354
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,415
Come on.

355
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,609
Did you?

356
00:28:06,627 --> 00:28:07,175
What?

357
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,286
Say that again.

358
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:14,960
Who did who?

359
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,329
You're a janitor.

360
00:28:18,356 --> 00:28:19,624
How dare you hit a student?

361
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,153
Run to your teachers, then.

362
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,430
I'll tell them how you bully my brother
and his friend.

363
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:31,175
Oh?

364
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,203
Weed in school?

365
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,603
Who the hell are you?

366
00:28:37,476 --> 00:28:39,470
You're definitely not a
janitor and a PE teacher.

367
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:45,181
I'm Babe's big brother.

368
00:28:46,135 --> 00:28:48,129
You beat him up.

369
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,135
I didn't do anything.

370
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,498
He tripped and fell or something.

371
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,067
That's the best excuse
you can come up with?

372
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,510
Who started this bullying?

373
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,273
Answer!

374
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,203
Hey, come on.

375
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,255
You guys take this too seriously.

376
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,658
It's just a joke.

377
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,969
A joke, huh?

378
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:18,953
Is that funny?

379
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,329
Do you see me laughing?

380
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,276
But the teacher's also saying it

381
00:29:26,295 --> 00:29:27,624
so I didn't think it meant anything…

382
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,993
Which one?

383
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,033
I need a name.

384
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,864
That's him.

385
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:42,836
Mr. Sombat.

386
00:29:53,495 --> 00:29:54,203
What?

387
00:30:02,523 --> 00:30:03,403
Nothing.

388
00:30:03,741 --> 00:30:04,947
I thought he was looking at us.

389
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,120
Tell me what he said.

390
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,120
He always calls me and Babe sissy boys

391
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,424
just because we go everywhere together.

392
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,067
And because Babe and I love reading novels.

393
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,541
Babe stands up for me when I get bullied,

394
00:30:28,566 --> 00:30:30,221
and sometimes he gets beat up, too.

395
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,393
But it's this teacher who turns
a blind eye to the bullies.

396
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,003
And to think a jerk like that is a teacher.

397
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,498
No one does anything around here?

398
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,993
He's the disciplinary
teacher so no one dares.

399
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,704
I'll deal with this.

400
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:51,975
Thank you.

401
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:09,420
As expected of a former car thief.

402
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,821
Is that what you heard?

403
00:31:12,941 --> 00:31:14,940
I'm not proud of this, you know?

404
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,310
I just didn't have a choice.

405
00:31:20,998 --> 00:31:23,300
Ever since my parents
died in a plane crash,

406
00:31:24,436 --> 00:31:26,424
I had to take over all the home expenses.

407
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,076
My livelihood.

408
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,806
My brother's school fee.

409
00:31:31,243 --> 00:31:32,412
His education.

410
00:31:33,587 --> 00:31:35,580
This was just the quickest
way to make money.

411
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,320
But why didn't you tell me?

412
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,110
Did you think it'd push me away?

413
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,338
Nobody wants to look
bad to their boyfriend.

414
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,187
Sorry.

415
00:31:53,218 --> 00:31:54,338
Not boyfriend.

416
00:31:54,775 --> 00:31:56,330
I always jump the gun, don't I?

417
00:32:02,418 --> 00:32:03,206
Got it.

418
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,738
You stealing this car?

419
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,981
I told you I don't do that anymore.

420
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,627
But from my car theft days,

421
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:22,683
I learned people hide their
ugliest secrets in their cars.

422
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:24,726
I bet there's something here.

423
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,169
Look in the glove compartment.

424
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,778
Bingo.

425
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,606
What's that?

426
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,590
You wanna play Robin for me?

427
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,532
Sure.

428
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,292
This is your thing.

429
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,347
I'll let you be Batman this once.

430
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,646
Are you a new janitor?

431
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,086
I've never seen you before.

432
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:52,510
Yes, I'm the new janitor.

433
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,356
And I'm here to throw
out the trash of a teacher.

434
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,461
What are you talking about?

435
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,495
Who are you?

436
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,747
I'm a PE teacher.

437
00:34:05,883 --> 00:34:07,020
I'm the PE teacher here.

438
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,993
Not you.

439
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,560
Then freaking act like a teacher.

440
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,775
What the hell are you saying?

441
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,316
I'm calling security.

442
00:34:15,341 --> 00:34:16,510
Hold it.

443
00:34:17,175 --> 00:34:18,326
What's the rush?

444
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,566
How–How did you get this?

445
00:34:32,584 --> 00:34:33,304
Give it back.

446
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,430
Give it back.

447
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,747
Doesn't matter how I got it.

448
00:34:38,307 --> 00:34:40,300
What matters is that
your life is freaking over.

449
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,821
Give it back to me.

450
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,323
Give my photo back.

451
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:50,806
And get the hell out of my school!

452
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:51,513
Or else...

453
00:34:51,538 --> 00:34:52,861
Or else what?

454
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,498
Call the cops?

455
00:34:54,516 --> 00:34:55,280
Do it.

456
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,633
Let's see who they're gonna arrest
between a pedophile and some intruders.

457
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,083
Give it back!

458
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,956
You okay?

459
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,975
No, no!

460
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:08,615
Please.

461
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,353
Please.

462
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,350
Don't call my brother a sissy.

463
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,129
He can be whatever the hell he wants.

464
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:19,987
You only take it out on him

465
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,624
because you can't accept who you are.

466
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,643
Oh?

467
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,603
You're Piyapong's brother?

468
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,113
I won't call him that anymore.

469
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,852
But please give me back that photo.

470
00:36:31,883 --> 00:36:33,850
Don't ruin my career.

471
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,975
Oh, now you're afraid
of ruining your career?

472
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,400
What about that kid you groomed?

473
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,944
What about his future?

474
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:44,700
I only cared about my brother at first,

475
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,323
but my boyfriend's right.

476
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,676
If I let you go,

477
00:36:53,107 --> 00:36:54,547
you're only going to
do it to other children.

478
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,646
You're boyfriends?

479
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,750
You look good together.

480
00:37:03,784 --> 00:37:05,113
I'm just like you, you know?

481
00:37:05,144 --> 00:37:06,480
Give me a chance.

482
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,363
“Just like you”?

483
00:37:10,393 --> 00:37:11,913
You're nothing like me.

484
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,812
Someone like you doesn't
deserve to be a teacher.

485
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,649
What are you doing?

486
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:24,301
Hey.

487
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,483
Hey.

488
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,590
Hey!

489
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,083
Give that back to me!

490
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,566
Please!

491
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,840
Hey!

492
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,507
Please!

493
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,135
Hey!

494
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,130
I just lost my father.

495
00:37:49,618 --> 00:37:51,610
My mother lost her mind.

496
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,403
Now I got dumped.

497
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,489
I've dated him for years.

498
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,790
But suddenly he told me

499
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,975
that he didn't love me anymore.

500
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,713
Take it easy.

501
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,295
What did I do?

502
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,489
Take your time.

503
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,292
Everything will get better soon.

504
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:23,489
Oh, you're the one who lost his dog.

505
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:24,953
How have you been?

506
00:38:24,984 --> 00:38:26,950
Did you get a new dog?

507
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,080
No.

508
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,123
But I'm not here to
talk about my dog today.

509
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,710
It's something else.

510
00:38:35,636 --> 00:38:36,400
Oh…

511
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,658
Of course.

512
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,387
But you'll have to wait your turn to speak.

513
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:42,400
I have to say it now.

514
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,929
This is worse than losing my dog.

515
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,963
This has ruined me and my self-esteem.

516
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,898
I need everyone to know
what I've been through.

517
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,981
Of course.

518
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,980
You seem to be in some serious distress.

519
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,076
Go on.

520
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,636
I got nailed-and-bailed.

521
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,313
Sorry?

522
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,806
You heard me.

523
00:39:09,409 --> 00:39:11,378
Even a handsome guy like me

524
00:39:11,396 --> 00:39:12,621
could experience something like that.

525
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,396
Can you–Can you please elaborate?

526
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:23,800
How has it ruined you?

527
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,701
When you like someone,

528
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,200
and they only think of you as a toy,

529
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,486
something they can break,

530
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,916
they don't even know how
deep they have cut you.

531
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,612
I understand you.

532
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:45,610
I've been through something similar.

533
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,203
These people are heartless.

534
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,147
They don't know how to love.

535
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,609
They deserve to be alone.

536
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:54,000
They deserve to die alone!

537
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:54,646
You're right.

538
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:56,713
Hey!

539
00:40:04,793 --> 00:40:05,446
What?

540
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,646
You can't accept the truth?

541
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,243
I don't take defeats.

542
00:40:13,273 --> 00:40:14,270
You slept with me,

543
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:15,532
so take responsibility for it.

544
00:40:15,563 --> 00:40:16,775
Why?

545
00:40:16,806 --> 00:40:17,827
Are you pregnant?

546
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,981
I might as well be.

547
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:22,861
Don't you know I'm in so
much pain I can't even eat?

548
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:25,618
I throw up everything I eat
like I have morning sickness!

549
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:26,744
Nonsense.

550
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,806
If you ignore me,

551
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,763
I'm only going to keep messing with you.

552
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,673
Where are we going?

553
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:39,175
I'm shutting you up.

554
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:40,529
What?

555
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,326
You're not killing me or
anything like that, right?

556
00:40:42,726 --> 00:40:43,329
Huh?

557
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,966
Your brother is lucky to have a
big brother protecting him like you.

558
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,935
It's only normal, right?

559
00:40:58,953 --> 00:41:00,233
Dad died early.

560
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,504
I had to be a father to Babe.

561
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,978
If this had happened to you,

562
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:06,970
I bet Fadel would be making
steak out of that man's meat.

563
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,981
Oh, Fadel wouldn't
even have to get involved.

564
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,301
If anyone even tries anything with me,

565
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,796
I wouldn't let them walk away free.

566
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,640
I'm only kidding.

567
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,652
I might not trust you 100%,

568
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,156
but I have to admit…

569
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,975
What you did today totally rocks.

570
00:41:31,704 --> 00:41:33,700
I broke my own promises, though.

571
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,981
I promised myself I would
stay away from car theft.

572
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,129
But you did it to save your brother.

573
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:40,812
Mind you, I think you might
have saved other boys, too.

574
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,886
The way I see it,

575
00:41:43,636 --> 00:41:44,861
you're a hero.

576
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,975
If you didn't tell me Babe was beat up,

577
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:54,123
I wouldn't even have done any of this.

578
00:41:56,326 --> 00:41:57,501
You're a hero, too.

579
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,500
At least you got to
do it at the right time.

580
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,760
You might have missed some details,

581
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,264
but with a boyfriend by your side,

582
00:42:10,658 --> 00:42:11,581
you won't have to miss anything again.

583
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,246
Come again?

584
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:16,510
Boyfriend.

585
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,664
You called me that so many times today.

586
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:22,880
Why not just make it real?

587
00:42:26,701 --> 00:42:27,427
What do you think?

588
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,003
Alright, boyfriend.

589
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:36,738
Oh.

590
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,276
I brought you this.

591
00:42:44,904 --> 00:42:46,498
You said you wanted one the other day.

592
00:42:51,427 --> 00:42:53,427
But answer me this one question.

593
00:42:54,356 --> 00:42:55,409
What is it?

594
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,301
You're not hiding anything
else from me, are you?

595
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,532
Besides my being Dominic “Dom” Toretto,

596
00:43:17,569 --> 00:43:18,615
there's nothing else I hide from you.

597
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,301
Be serious.

598
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,793
I can trust you, can't I?

599
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,470
Of course.

600
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:29,975
Let me put it on you.

601
00:43:39,643 --> 00:43:41,101
You have my heart now,

602
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:42,756
so take good care of it.

603
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:14,775
Hey.

604
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:15,809
Hey.

605
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:17,581
Hey.

606
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:19,981
Where are you taking me?

607
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,304
Are we doing it outdoors?

608
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,987
Your taste sure surprises me.

609
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,676
Fadel, where are you going?

610
00:44:32,695 --> 00:44:34,012
Don't leave me here!

611
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,735
Are you going to take a leak?

612
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,600
I'll wait here.

613
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,495
What the…

614
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,713
Fadel, where have you gone?

615
00:44:59,101 --> 00:45:00,504
I want to go home.

616
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,492
Hurry up!

617
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,046
Hey.

618
00:45:19,064 --> 00:45:19,987
Fadel.

619
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,840
Where are you?

620
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,046
I know you're gonna kill me
and hide my body in the woods.

621
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,403
But I ain't scared of you!

622
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:29,987
I'm more scared of
ghosts, I'll have you know.

623
00:45:30,012 --> 00:45:31,618
If you don't come out,

624
00:45:32,295 --> 00:45:34,290
I'm driving your car home.

625
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:37,993
Don't think I can't do that
just 'cause I don't have a key.

626
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:40,276
Come out!

627
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:42,289
Fadel!

628
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:45,883
Where are you?

629
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,467
Fadel!

630
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,009
I don't like you messing up my life.

631
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,200
My life has been planned out.

632
00:45:57,833 --> 00:45:59,830
You're disrupting it.

633
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:03,858
I don't like myself when I look for
you on the morning jog or at the market.

634
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:07,698
I don't like waiting to see if you'd show
up at my restaurant or my go-to club.

635
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:08,486
You...

636
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,793
I don't like you being in
my life and changing it.

637
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:17,778
I don't like feeling like this.

638
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,009
I don't like it!

639
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,489
I don't like that I miss you.

640
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:02,621
It's okay to love.

641
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,276
Here.

642
00:48:05,095 --> 00:48:06,763
All your favorite food.

643
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,196
Eat up.

644
00:48:08,215 --> 00:48:09,298
And take your medicines.

645
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:10,978
Hey.

646
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:14,332
Knot told me you went to school today.

647
00:48:16,584 --> 00:48:17,581
Yeah, so what?

648
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,772
I wouldn't let anyone who hurt my brother

649
00:48:19,803 --> 00:48:21,010
get away with it.

650
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:25,347
Listen.

651
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,981
Tell me when something's bothering you.

652
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,987
I'm your big brother, you know?

653
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:37,495
I'm sorry

654
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:39,821
for not taking good care of you.

655
00:48:40,455 --> 00:48:41,366
Nah.

656
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,360
I have to know how to hold my own.

657
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,686
But that's not all you do, right?

658
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,381
You stand up for other people, too.

659
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,596
I have the coolest brother ever.

660
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,492
I got it from you.

661
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,246
Eat up.

662
00:49:08,683 --> 00:49:09,347
Yeah.

663
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:11,323
The omelette looks pretty good.

664
00:49:11,353 --> 00:49:12,110
Can I steal a bite?

665
00:49:12,135 --> 00:49:12,953
No way.

666
00:49:12,978 --> 00:49:13,981
It's for me.

667
00:49:14,012 --> 00:49:14,892
Just share, dude.

668
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:40,596
Think about it.

669
00:49:40,627 --> 00:49:41,987
If you go to jail,

670
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,683
who'd take care of your brother?

671
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,806
You have my heart now,

672
00:49:46,824 --> 00:49:47,987
so take good care of it.

673
00:49:58,055 --> 00:50:01,993
Oh, hey, Mr. Kant, my good sir.

674
00:50:02,018 --> 00:50:05,372
When should I come and get your car?

675
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:07,316
What are you talking about?

676
00:50:07,335 --> 00:50:09,107
Make sure you seal the deal first.

677
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,332
Hey, if I hadn't done that already,

678
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,793
I wouldn't be here to
pick up the car, would I?

679
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,923
Are you saying that

680
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:21,993
Fadel has agreed to go out with you?

681
00:50:22,572 --> 00:50:23,286
Yes.

682
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,206
We've slept together twice now.

683
00:50:33,538 --> 00:50:34,683
What are we?

684
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:37,483
What are you talking about?

685
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,473
Some people did it countless
times and never called it anything.

686
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,160
I'm not some people.

687
00:50:43,015 --> 00:50:45,010
I need clarity.

688
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,560
What do you want?

689
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:50,843
I told you.

690
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,652
I want to be your boyfriend.

691
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,406
Why would you want that?

692
00:50:57,126 --> 00:50:59,612
You're mysterious and alluring.

693
00:51:00,313 --> 00:51:02,310
You're quiet, but sexy as hell.

694
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,504
I'm not a puzzle you have to crack.

695
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,200
One more thing, I don't want a boyfriend.

696
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,415
Why not?

697
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:15,193
It's great.

698
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,230
You have someone to embrace,

699
00:51:17,636 --> 00:51:19,230
to love,

700
00:51:19,747 --> 00:51:21,740
and to…

701
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:24,886
I'll stick with jerking off.

702
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:27,716
I'm sure.

703
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:31,083
But isn't it better to have
someone like me with you?

704
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,009
What you said to me just now…

705
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,267
I feel the same way, you know?

706
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:46,726
Be my boyfriend.

707
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,110
Give me a chance.

708
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:55,581
You don't even know me.

709
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:58,313
And what about it?

710
00:51:59,058 --> 00:52:01,050
I'll learn more about you
when you're my boyfriend.

711
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,523
I'm 100% in.

712
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,418
It's your turn

713
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,984
to let me in a little bit.

714
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:16,713
Yeah.

715
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,449
Fine.

716
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:21,698
What?

717
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,356
Well, what did you ask me?

718
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:26,966
Fine, I'll be your boyfriend.

719
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,326
Really?

720
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,144
We're dating now?

721
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:36,203
Yeah.

722
00:52:53,692 --> 00:52:55,390
Well, what do you think?

723
00:52:55,415 --> 00:52:56,529
Your best friend is a genius, isn't he?

724
00:52:56,541 --> 00:53:00,732
I told you I can get anyone.

725
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:02,806
Yeah, you're great.

726
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:09,950
What?

727
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:11,926
What's wrong?

728
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:13,950
Bummed?

729
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:18,633
Are you bummed, my dude?

730
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,233
I know you love this car.

731
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:25,070
But a deal is a deal.

732
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:27,670
And you got Bison like you wanted.

733
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,286
I'll give you the car like I promised.

734
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:32,984
But I have something to tell you.

735
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:35,993
It's about those brothers.

736
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:37,760
What are you talking about?

737
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:09,612
Fadel.

738
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,144
What?

739
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,941
Kant and I are dating.

740
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:25,255
I did tell you to take care of him,

741
00:54:25,286 --> 00:54:26,904
but not like that!

742
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,224
We talked.

743
00:54:29,618 --> 00:54:31,610
And I saw it with my own eyes.

744
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:33,981
Kant was just trying to
get away from his bad past.

745
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,523
You wanted him

746
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,572
so you'd believe anything.

747
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,649
Whatever he says, you'll buy it.

748
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:44,289
I'm not doing that.

749
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,547
I have all my wits about me when I love.

750
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:53,655
Think before you say you love someone.

751
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,849
What about you and Style, then?

752
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,027
Would you call it love?

753
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:01,064
I don't love him.

754
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,544
I just gave him a chance.

755
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,233
Alright.

756
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,436
Really?

757
00:55:12,369 --> 00:55:13,323
Did you sleep with him?

758
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,415
None of your business.

759
00:55:15,753 --> 00:55:17,969
Come on, Fadel.

760
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:19,698
Was it good?

761
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:21,569
Get lost.

762
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,467
Tell me!

763
00:55:24,492 --> 00:55:25,107
Please!

764
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,935
Leave me alone.

765
00:55:28,966 --> 00:55:30,375
I need to concentrate.

766
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:33,987
You totally slept with him.

767
00:55:34,203 --> 00:55:36,147
My brother has a boyfriend!

768
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,446
My brother has a boyfriend!

769
00:55:37,476 --> 00:55:38,283
My brother has a boyfriend!

770
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:39,193
Bison!

771
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,372
Get to work.

772
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:44,763
What the hell are you playing?

773
00:55:47,113 --> 00:55:48,615
You're really something, huh?

774
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:24,947
Fadel, Fadel.

775
00:56:25,495 --> 00:56:26,061
Fadel.

776
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,178
Fadel.

777
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,261
Look at this.

778
00:56:39,163 --> 00:56:40,566
Now this is probably
something worth stealing.

779
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:01,735
What?

780
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:03,975
I thought there'd be some
gold and diamonds inside.

781
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:22,227
Dad?

782
00:57:24,246 --> 00:57:24,916
Mom?

783
00:57:42,935 --> 00:57:44,160
What the hell?

784
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,270
These are my parents.

785
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:13,655
I think…

786
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,350
Ruerat was behind the death of our parents.

787
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,424
Crap, Kant!

788
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,015
You made me hit on a gunman?

789
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,843
Not a gunman.

790
00:58:46,867 --> 00:58:47,938
A hitman.

791
00:58:47,956 --> 00:58:49,009
They don't just use guns.

792
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,550
Jerk, that isn't better!

793
00:58:51,575 --> 00:58:53,981
No wonder he always
seems dead set on killing me.

794
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:58,356
I could have made a headline:

795
00:58:58,375 --> 00:59:00,898
“Handsome man killed in the woods.”

796
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:03,550
Hey, I'm sorry.

797
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,390
I didn't think it through.

798
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,658
I just wanted to get the old
car theft cases off my butt.

799
00:59:08,873 --> 00:59:10,870
You're literally sending me to my death.

800
00:59:10,892 --> 00:59:12,590
You ain't dead yet.

801
00:59:12,609 --> 00:59:13,975
And Captain is on our side.

802
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,221
No.

803
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:16,978
I quit.

804
00:59:17,003 --> 00:59:17,716
I don't want your car anymore.

805
00:59:17,735 --> 00:59:18,529
Hey.

806
00:59:18,547 --> 00:59:20,061
If you back off now,

807
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,510
it's more dangerous for you.

808
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,307
It's gonna make you look suspicious.

809
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,670
And from what you told me,

810
00:59:26,695 --> 00:59:28,338
Fadel let you in now.

811
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,123
If you dump him,

812
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,578
you're definitely making
some gruesome headlines.

813
00:59:32,621 --> 00:59:34,184
What do you want me to do?

814
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,326
No matter what I choose, it's a death wish.

815
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,541
Work with me.

816
00:59:38,898 --> 00:59:40,258
Help me get more information on them.

817
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,144
Once we get that, it's done.

818
00:59:43,378 --> 00:59:45,046
Captain puts them in jail

819
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:45,975
and we walk free.

820
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,360
Help me out, bud.

821
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,089
I even agreed to let you have my car.

822
00:59:54,393 --> 00:59:56,172
Besides Babe,

823
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,233
you're all I have.

824
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:00,461
If you don't help me,

825
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:02,560
who else would I turn to?

826
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:04,363
Please.

827
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:19,113
Alright.

828
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,652
I already slept with him, didn't I?

829
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:24,621
Might as well just go all the way.

830
01:00:25,606 --> 01:00:27,600
Now that's what I'm talking about!

831
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:29,993
If the two of us work together,

832
01:00:30,012 --> 01:00:31,520
they'll never catch us.

833
01:00:49,692 --> 01:00:52,184
It's okay to love.

834
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:54,381
Be my boyfriend.

835
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,270
Give me a chance.

836
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:57,600
Fine.

837
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:02,910
Crap!

838
01:01:02,929 --> 01:01:04,627
You made me hit on a gunman?

839
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,993
Not a gunman.

840
01:01:06,012 --> 01:01:06,947
A hitman.

841
01:01:11,175 --> 01:01:12,055
Let's do it.

842
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:34,301
Need a spotter?

843
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:40,307
Nah.

844
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,987
I can't do it anyway.

845
01:01:42,006 --> 01:01:42,978
I was pushing my limits.

846
01:01:45,236 --> 01:01:46,596
But if you let me help,

847
01:01:48,461 --> 01:01:50,460
maybe you can go beyond your limits.

848
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:01,163
Alright.

849
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:02,547
Let's try again.

850
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:08,676
Two.

851
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:11,150
A little more.

852
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,621
That's it.

853
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,150
Your stamina isn't bad.

854
01:02:29,876 --> 01:02:31,360
Wanna use it for something else?

855
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,809
What–What do you mean?

856
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:38,627
You liked it, didn't you?

857
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:42,055
Both in the storage room and in the woods.

858
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:47,975
I'm… done with my workout.

859
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:49,532
I have to go.

860
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:56,775
Wait.

861
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,310
What is it?

862
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:20,781
You're sweaty.

863
01:03:27,649 --> 01:03:28,578
Thanks.

864
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:44,818
All done.

865
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,095
We can redo the paint next week.

866
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:48,553
Okay. Thanks.

867
01:03:48,578 --> 01:03:49,009
Sure.

868
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:58,393
Will you blacken a tattoo for me?

869
01:04:02,689 --> 01:04:03,987
Why the hell are you here, James?

870
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:06,726
Your name.

871
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,341
I need it blacked out.

872
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:11,950
So I can finally start over.

873
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:16,646
Stop talking nonsense.

874
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:18,363
I'm busy today.

875
01:04:18,381 --> 01:04:19,206
Come back later.

876
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,461
Why, you got a date?

877
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:23,175
With that Bison guy?

878
01:04:23,446 --> 01:04:24,338
Stay out of my business.

879
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,969
I bet you don't want him to see me.

880
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,963
To think you'd finally
“date” someone properly.

881
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,541
If I blacken the tattoo for you,

882
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,655
you'll leave me alone, won't you?

883
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:51,015
You want all this blackened?

884
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,307
Even the lightning?

885
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:54,393
Why'd I keep it?

886
01:04:54,929 --> 01:04:56,920
It means nothing to you anyway.

887
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:00,818
It was a long time ago.

888
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:02,566
Will you stop this nonsense?

889
01:05:02,873 --> 01:05:03,975
Nonsense?

890
01:05:04,504 --> 01:05:06,500
You were leading me on with every word,

891
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,400
and with every touch.

892
01:05:12,252 --> 01:05:12,849
Kant.

893
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,027
You're still working?

894
01:05:23,366 --> 01:05:25,020
We don't have to do it today.

895
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,600
Just thought I'd drop by

896
01:05:27,624 --> 01:05:28,664
because I missed you.

897
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,449
Who was that?

898
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,723
James is an old friend of mine.

899
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,483
James has a K at the back of his ear.

900
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,206
Does it stand for your name?

901
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,492
K could stand for…

902
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:00,707
“Kinda a jerk.”

903
01:06:00,732 --> 01:06:01,643
It has nothing to do with me.

904
01:06:11,858 --> 01:06:13,304
We had fun once.

905
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:16,264
But there's nothing between us now.

906
01:06:17,981 --> 01:06:19,980
He was just here to
get the tattoo blackened.

907
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,501
You're the only one I'm serious about.

908
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:45,040
If you say so.

909
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:46,436
I'm not saying anything.

910
01:06:47,452 --> 01:06:49,450
Just make sure I don't see
any more “K's” on anyone.

911
01:06:50,535 --> 01:06:51,563
Or else it's “kill.”

912
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:07,612
Hey.

913
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:09,747
Where are you going?

914
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:11,267
Won't you stay with me tonight?

915
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:12,529
No.

916
01:07:12,553 --> 01:07:13,643
You turned me off.

917
01:07:13,661 --> 01:07:15,021
I have to get back to work.

918
01:07:15,403 --> 01:07:17,020
I just dropped by to give you the burger.

919
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,978
That's nice of you.

920
01:07:24,615 --> 01:07:26,610
You always make sure
I get to eat good food.

921
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:30,990
And if you want to keep eating it,
don't flirt with anyone anymore.

922
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,375
Because not only will you
not get to eat any burgers,

923
01:07:34,393 --> 01:07:35,980
you could very well
become burgers yourself.

924
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:53,040
(Next Week)
You're amazing.

925
01:07:53,076 --> 01:07:54,190
Is there anything you can't do?

926
01:07:54,227 --> 01:07:55,249
I don't think so.

927
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,732
If I got Mr. Hard-To-Get like you,

928
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:58,150
then I'm really pretty amazing.

929
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,618
Didn't know you hang around arcades now.

930
01:08:01,636 --> 01:08:02,713
You wanna try me, huh?

931
01:08:02,732 --> 01:08:04,929
Can you ask Fadel out
for a double date tonight?

932
01:08:04,953 --> 01:08:07,630
You said you liked me from
the first time you saw me.

933
01:08:07,661 --> 01:08:08,880
What did you like about me?

934
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:11,753
No matter how in love you are,

935
01:08:11,784 --> 01:08:15,470
I don't believe you can truly
be yourself with someone.

936
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,673
I'm so lucky to have met you.

937
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:20,966
I can feel my life changing.
