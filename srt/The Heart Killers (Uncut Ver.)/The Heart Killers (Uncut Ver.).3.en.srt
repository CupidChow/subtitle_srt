1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,360
(Previously)
Good morning, there.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,200
Fadel, Fadel, Fadel!

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,990
You suddenly live in my place.

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,430
Morning jogging, grocery shopping,

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,330
showing up at my burger joint,

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,680
and now frequenting the same gym?

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,010
Stop following me.

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,870
Don't say I didn't warn you.

9
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,070
Don't you think we should
just keep it casual between you and me?

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,690
I don't want no casual.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,190
You've still got a lot to prove.

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,200
Make sure he knows
he really matters to you.

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,360
You have a meeting with
Senator Vichai at 4.30.

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,420
Right.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,550
Then dinner with Mr. Boonterm at 7.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,500
I've got all the documents prepared.

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,850
What about our important meeting?

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,090
They're waiting in your office.

19
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,100
Good.

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,670
Don't let anyone in there

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,850
until I'm done talking to them.

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,610
Yes.

23
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,260
Of course.

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,860
Ms. Lilly.

25
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,320
We need you to sign this
month's financial report.

26
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,540
You want me to sign it here?

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,020
Shouldn't you have put that on my desk?

28
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,160
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,660
Your new job.

30
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,420
Who is he, Mother?

31
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,680
Someone important.

32
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,050
He's a big shot.

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,700
Why does he deserve this?

34
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,540
I see him on the news
for helping poor children

35
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,970
and doing charity work.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
He's never done anything bad.

37
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,080
Bison, dear.

38
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,180
You've always been easily
deceived by appearance.

39
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,600
It's all for show.

40
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,650
He acts like a saint.

41
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,310
But it's just a facade
to mask all his crimes.

42
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,950
He's the man behind corruptions, drugs,

43
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,000
human trafficking, and so much more.

44
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,450
It would take me
forever to list everything.

45
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,280
But for this kill,

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,250
you need to make it a spectacle.

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,480
They need to send a
message to the other big shots.

48
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,150
One more thing,

49
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,420
this could be dangerous.

50
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,490
But I believe in you two.

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,190
Of course, Mother.

52
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,930
But it'd be better

53
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,510
if you let me take a little break.

54
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,580
Fadel!

55
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,300
What's the matter, Bison?

56
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,950
Do you want to stop?

57
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,040
Do I not pay you enough for this?

58
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,970
Well?

59
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,960
Or…

60
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,920
Are you seeing someone?

61
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,080
Well, Fadel?

62
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,440
Is your brother seeing someone right now?

63
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,080
You can tell me, love.

64
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,050
Well?

65
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,970
There's no one, Mother.

66
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,930
I promise we'll take care of this.

67
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,920
Don't worry.

68
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,120
Don't quit so soon, my dear.

69
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,180
Work with me.

70
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,820
We're all we've got.

71
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,740
Right?

72
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,420
Excuse us.

73
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,970
I guess we'll do it.

74
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,360
If you think Fadel and
Bison might not make it,

75
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,050
do you want me to help them out?

76
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,050
You're already doing well at the office,

77
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,870
and you're not as adept
on the field as they are.

78
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,770
You still have so much to learn.

79
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,000
"The Heart Killers"
(Episode 3)

80
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,670
One beer, please.

81
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,010
You're always here alone.

82
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,450
Why not go have fun with everyone?

83
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,280
I'm good.

84
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,840
I'm having the time of my life here.

85
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,250
Hello. Hi.

86
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,870
Cheers.

87
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,320
Long live rock and roll.

88
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,690
Oh, hey.

89
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,080
To think I'd run into you here.

90
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,820
You like heavy metal?

91
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
You don't look the type.

92
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,180
You're supposed to have fun
with your friends at a place like this.

93
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,340
You can't just sit drinking
looking mysterious.

94
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,460
Come on.

95
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,640
Let's go dance with me.

96
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,360
Come on.

97
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,620
I've made so many new
friends already, you know?

98
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,680
No.

99
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,970
I can have a good time all by myself.

100
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,810
How'd that even work?

101
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:19,520
You need someone to “scream” with.

102
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,700
Well, whatever.

103
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,480
I'm here all the time anyway.

104
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,070
This place is so my thing.

105
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll make you scream
with me one of these days.

106
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,470
Bro, I need a double.'

107
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,360
Coming right up.

108
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,280
Double, it is!

109
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,220
Follow me, alright?

110
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,290
Double, huh?

111
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Hey, I'll be right back.

112
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,620
Did you know

113
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,060
they use heavy metal to torture prisoners

114
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,600
so they confess?

115
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,360
If I was the warden,

116
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,510
I wouldn't do that.

117
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,930
What if it was me?

118
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,920
What'd you do
to torture the truth out of me?

119
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,650
Would you kiss…

120
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,670
or choke me?

121
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,810
You'll know.

122
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,530
You look kinda sexy tonight.

123
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,000
Mind if I join you?

124
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,130
You've been following me.

125
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,540
Me?

126
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,570
This is the nearest onsen around here.

127
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,090
I'm a regular.

128
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,050
Maybe it's you
who's been following me.

129
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,950
You've got a tattoo on your back?

130
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,820
I didn't notice it that night.

131
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,810
I was busy with…

132
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,280
With what?

133
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,200
Can I see?

134
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,950
“If I be…”

135
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,040
What does it mean?

136
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,140
“If you piss me off,”

137
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,230
“be careful of my fist.”

138
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,100
Really?

139
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,480
Where is that from?

140
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,660
It's from one of Shakespeare's books.

141
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,290
Babe is a fan.

142
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,290
I asked him to pick
some cool quotes for me.

143
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,470
This is my favorite.

144
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:47,940
It's about bees.

145
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,440
“If I be waspish,”

146
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,020
“best beware my sting.”'

147
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,620
Scary.

148
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,170
I'm just saying that.

149
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,170
You know I'm actually just a baby.

150
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,690
You're much scarier than I am.

151
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,740
I'm scary?

152
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,000
Look at me.

153
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,250
Do I look like I can hurt anyone?

154
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,980
But I get what you mean.

155
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,760
If they did me wrong,

156
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,850
I'd get them back.

157
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,350
What'd you do to them?

158
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,300
You want to know?

159
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,440
Oww, hey!

160
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,060
That's what they'd get.

161
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,530
That's just a sample.

162
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,770
But if you don't mean me harm,

163
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,010
then you have nothing to be afraid of.

164
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,190
Stop it.

165
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,510
Bye.

166
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,920
Anything worth reporting?

167
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,260
Did you follow me, Cap?

168
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,250
Well, it's kinda my job to follow through.

169
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,610
All I know right now is that

170
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,810
they have the same mother,

171
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,940
but different dads.

172
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,180
Continue investigating.

173
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,360
Better yet, get inside their house.

174
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,070
I'm sure there's some leads there.

175
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,260
You're asking me to
enter the tigers' lair here.

176
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,640
You know I could get
clawed to death, right?

177
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,280
You can do it.

178
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,530
Up your game and gain his trust.

179
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,030
He'll lead you right into his house.

180
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,130
Trust me.

181
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,170
What about the big brother?

182
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,270
How are you dealing with him?

183
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,040
You sure he won't get in your way again?

184
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,070
My friend is handling him.

185
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,530
Does your friend know they're hitmen?

186
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,790
No.

187
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,260
I'll give you a fair warning.

188
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,360
Don't tell anyone about this.

189
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,440
The more people know,

190
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,620
the more dangerous it is.

191
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,080
Good morning.

192
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,650
If you're here, it's clearly a bad morning.

193
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,720
Hey.

194
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,860
Starting the day off on the wrong foot

195
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,500
makes the whole day bad, you know?

196
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,700
Do you like doing cardio?

197
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,120
I hate doing cardio after weight training.

198
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,690
It's boring.

199
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,770
I'm looking for some
other form of cardio, though.

200
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,820
Is that all you think about all day?

201
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,020
Go jerk off if it bothers you so much.

202
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,610
I know I can do it alone.

203
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,990
But it burns more
calories doing it together.

204
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,810
Is that why you won't leave me alone?

205
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,240
You want to sleep with me?

206
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,520
May I?

207
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:19,000
I want your body and your…

208
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,300
Heart.

209
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,470
You're not my type.

210
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,710
What's your type, then?

211
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,480
Tell me!

212
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,690
I can be that for you.

213
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,840
Hey!

214
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,700
Excuse me.

215
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,660
What can we get you today?

216
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,530
Ground pork?

217
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,880
We grind… the pork ourselves here.

218
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,570
It will sure make some good burgers.

219
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,220
Do you work here full-time now?

220
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,530
If you're here every day,

221
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,660
then I'm here every day.

222
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:11,310
I'll give you some fresh meat daily.

223
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,680
Oh, you don't want it?

224
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,020
My meat is sweet, I tell you!

225
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,250
Auntie, I'll be back.

226
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,470
I have to win that guy over.

227
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,080
Alright.

228
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,090
I'm rooting for you.

229
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,000
Do your best.

230
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,820
Thanks.

231
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,440
Welcome to Heart Burger.

232
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,120
Please have a seat.

233
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,480
Here's the menu.

234
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,480
What would you like?

235
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,280
One cheeseburger and some water, please.

236
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,760
Please have a seat.

237
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,950
Hello.

238
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,230
Here's the menu.

239
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,100
Come on in.

240
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,460
This place is a must.

241
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,500
- It's cheesy and juicy.
- I'll be back to take your order shortly.

242
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,160
Come on in.

243
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,090
It goes down easy and
agrees with your stomach.

244
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,820
Come on over.

245
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:07,810
Can I have a photo?

246
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,300
Of course.

247
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,320
Let's do it.

248
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
One, two, three.

249
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,540
Alright. Thank you.

250
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,790
Come on this way.

251
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,030
Come here for some
juicy and cheesy burgers.

252
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,140
It's a must.

253
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,120
Don't miss it.

254
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,040
Come right in.

255
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,660
- You won't regret it—
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

256
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,090
I'm spreading the word about your place.

257
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,670
I'm doing it for free, mind you.

258
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,130
Stop it.

259
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,740
I didn't ask you to do this.

260
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,590
You didn't have to.

261
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,280
It's a great strategy to attract customers.

262
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,660
Don't you know how many
burger joints there are?

263
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,730
We gotta stand out to survive.

264
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,710
One more thing,

265
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,580
who would be able to resist

266
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,160
a handsome guy in a costume?

267
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,310
They're here for my burgers,

268
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,850
not your theatrics.

269
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,260
Who knows?

270
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,320
Maybe they're here because

271
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,480
the chef is so damn good-looking.

272
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,530
Don't try to cozy up to me.

273
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,410
Why not?

274
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,960
Did that make you blush?

275
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,660
It did, didn't it?

276
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,610
You're blushing.

277
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,230
Take that thing off and
go back to your garage.

278
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,280
Why?

279
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,600
I said take it off.

280
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,320
I won't!

281
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,080
I said I won't!

282
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,810
No!

283
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,310
You hungry?

284
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,400
That's so cute.

285
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,170
Please come on in.

286
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,050
Welcome.

287
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,640
Leave my restaurant alone.

288
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,620
Shouldn't you be
cooking at a time like this

289
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,320
instead of telling me off?

290
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,190
Your brother isn't even here to help.

291
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,710
But I am.

292
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,410
All I ask from you is a little decency.

293
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,810
No.

294
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,170
This is my job.

295
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,460
I can handle it myself.

296
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,460
Help me up.

297
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,270
I can't get up.

298
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:12,880
Help me!

299
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,490
Keep it dry for the time being.

300
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,490
Make sure you avoid water.

301
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,230
Here as well…

302
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,560
No soap on your tattoo
for the next seven days.

303
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,650
Of course.

304
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,730
Thank you.

305
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,850
Thank you.

306
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,220
What is this?

307
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,180
Are you getting lonely?

308
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,210
Is that why you called
me over to your studio?

309
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,410
Well, you said I can't go to your place.

310
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,220
And since Babe is home at
night, I can't have you over.

311
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,790
This is the only place we
can meet during the day.

312
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,400
I don't see an issue here.

313
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,540
We can just book a hotel.

314
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,210
Hotels are for hookups.

315
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,920
I want to see you every day.

316
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,620
Who meets their boyfriend at a hotel?

317
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,460
I'd prefer your place.

318
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,570
Jumping the gun, are we?

319
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,440
I'm not your boyfriend.

320
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,680
What are you talking about?

321
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,520
One more thing,

322
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,520
I don't think Fadel will let
you step foot inside my house.

323
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,300
So?

324
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,990
You called me over just to chat?

325
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,020
mn.

326
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,970
Look at this.

327
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,620
I called you over for the cat tattoo.

328
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,350
You left it here last time, remember?

329
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,310
You like it?

330
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,900
It's nice.

331
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,460
But I don't want a cat tattoo anymore.

332
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,290
I think it makes me look too cute.

333
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,290
I want something cool.

334
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,560
Can you get any cuter than this?

335
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,010
I can barely resist you as you are.

336
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,450
Ow!

337
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,620
Do you like it rough or something?

338
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,890
Can you handle it?

339
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,780
If you like it, I can handle it.

340
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,650
What if I told you I'm
into… bondage and whips?

341
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,580
Are you the S or the M?

342
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,180
I prefer to be in control.

343
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,350
You didn't mention that
the first night we met.

344
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,690
Who'd tell a total stranger
their sexual preference?

345
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,320
Do you trust me now, then?

346
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,680
Not 100%.

347
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,070
What do I have to do

348
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,450
for you to trust me 100%?

349
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,060
Hey.

350
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,600
Which table ordered this?

351
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,010
I'll do it.

352
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:45,690
Go away.

353
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,620
You're going to both wait tables and cook?

354
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,330
Just stay in here.

355
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,060
I'll handle the serving.

356
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,900
I called Bison and he'll be here soon.

357
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:53,650
Just go.

358
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,140
Your customers would leave
by the time Bison is here.

359
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,820
Learn to accept help from people, will you?

360
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,240
I'll help you.

361
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,680
Fine.

362
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,560
But go get changed into
our uniform before that.

363
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,720
Where is it?

364
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,100
Over there.

365
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,400
Mine will probably fit you.

366
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,480
Quickly.

367
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,480
Hey, hey, hey.

368
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,730
Do it in the bathroom.

369
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,930
Why?

370
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,900
This is nothing you haven't seen before.

371
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,920
Getting embarrassed, are we?

372
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,100
Embarrassed, my ass.

373
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,960
This is a…

374
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:27,940
kitchen.

375
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,010
Oh, hey.

376
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,760
Your stuff sure… fits me perfectly.

377
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,480
Can you shut up and be quick?

378
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,350
Or else I'm going to change my mind.

379
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,300
Yeah.

380
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,100
Take this.

381
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,320
Yes, Chef.

382
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,110
Hurry up.

383
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,400
Ugh, damn it.

384
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:28,680
Here.

385
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,290
Sorry for the wait.

386
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,970
Hey.

387
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,180
How come they get their food before I do?

388
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,410
I was here first.

389
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:36,740
Yeah.

390
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,740
I've been waiting forever.

391
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,760
We thought the place was nice,

392
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,410
but the service sure is awful.

393
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,130
I apologize.

394
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,330
I'll hurry up your order immediately.

395
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,290
Sorry.

396
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,900
Hey.

397
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,980
Is the food for Tables 5 and 6 ready?

398
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,450
They're pissed.

399
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,770
I'm making it.

400
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,250
I'm doing it as fast as I can.

401
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,700
Told you I don't need help.

402
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,170
I don't need this many customers.

403
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,770
I don't need money. I'm
only doing this for fun.

404
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,050
That can only come out of
the mouth of a real millionaire.

405
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,180
I'm not a millionaire.

406
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,480
If you're not, and you're
only doing this for fun,

407
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,990
then you're hiding something.

408
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,920
Are you…

409
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,440
What?

410
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,680
You're a…

411
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,100
A police informant?

412
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,350
Definitely.

413
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:42,400
Or are you an undercover cop?

414
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,660
What are you investigating?

415
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,540
Murders?

416
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,710
Drugs?

417
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,890
Adulteries?

418
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,220
You can tell me.

419
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,330
I know everyone around here.

420
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,470
I'd say you watch too
many of those Fast films.

421
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,690
Now get out there.

422
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,490
If you want to help,
deal with the customers.

423
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,120
Keep the talking to the minimum.

424
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,760
What?

425
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,920
I'm watching you like a hawk.

426
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,480
Will you tell me what you like?

427
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,370
Well, it varies.

428
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,710
Something from face slapping, bondage,

429
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,150
to something involving some tools.

430
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,250
Face slapping?

431
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,570
How hard?

432
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,940
Depends on how intense
the mood is at the time.

433
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,810
Won't you try slapping me?

434
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,180
What?

435
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,570
Why'd I do that?

436
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,880
I'm not in the mood for that.

437
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,100
Try it.

438
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,540
I'll know if I can handle it

439
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,360
if the occasion ever arises again.

440
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,250
Please slap me.

441
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,470
Do it.

442
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,040
That's it?

443
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,270
It doesn't even hurt.

444
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,530
That turns you on?

445
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,330
I don't want to hurt you.

446
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,230
Hey.

447
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,820
Don't hold back.

448
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,060
Just slap me.

449
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,840
Who knows?

450
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,500
Maybe I'll even be into it.

451
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,500
We could be the perfect match.

452
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,400
You like inflicting pain.

453
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,870
I like feeling pain.

454
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,750
Slap me.

455
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,680
Harder.

456
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,680
Hey, let's–let's not.

457
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,660
Harder.

458
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,700
Come on. Just stop.

459
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,530
I said harder!

460
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
Hey, are you alright?

461
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,350
I'm sorry.

462
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,400
I told you I didn't want to do it.

463
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,200
You really didn't have to do this for me.

464
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,540
I think I liked it.

465
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,460
Anything else you want to try?

466
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,240
Answer, damn it.

467
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,370
What the hell is he busy doing?

468
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,250
Calling for backup?

469
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,850
Hell yeah.

470
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,460
Oh?

471
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,490
Your first burger for me.

472
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,650
Are you finally folding?

473
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,320
Was it because of how hard working I am?

474
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,260
You like me now, don't you?

475
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,440
Don't get your hopes up.

476
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,460
This is your wage.

477
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,920
My wage?

478
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,940
This is next to nothing.

479
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,630
You weren't listening.

480
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,870
I told you I didn't
ask for your help.

481
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,170
Fine.

482
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,660
I'll take it.

483
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,330
Go home when you're done eating.

484
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,340
And take your burger suit.

485
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,650
Oh, the nature of man.

486
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,510
He will exploit you and
then throw you away.

487
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,660
Don't be dramatic.

488
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,060
Just go home.

489
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,980
Don't you just love to chase me off?

490
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:41,640
Let me finish this first.

491
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,630
It's great.

492
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,350
Customers.

493
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,980
Eat and go home.

494
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,160
I know.

495
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,720
It's really good.

496
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,410
Thank you.

497
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,840
What the hell are you doing here?

498
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:15,890
Oh?

499
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,180
Is that how you talk to a customer?

500
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,930
Your place is pretty popular.

501
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,110
You might do better flipping
burgers than killing people.

502
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,470
Just tell me what you want.

503
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,840
Does Mother want something from us?

504
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,090
No.

505
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,660
I just want to help out.

506
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,320
Who is she?

507
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,650
Ruerat's secretary, Penpak.

508
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,530
She knows all his schedules,
keys, and passwords.

509
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,530
If you get to his secretary,

510
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,150
you get to him.

511
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,770
That's it?

512
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,640
What do you mean by “help,” then?

513
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:06,480
Bison and I can do this much on our own.

514
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,800
It's not you I'm helping.

515
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,890
It's Mother.

516
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,150
I see.

517
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,430
You just want to lick her boot.

518
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,290
Fine.

519
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,080
Once we get this job done,

520
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,160
I'll put in a good word for you.

521
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,020
So?

522
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,490
Are you both quitting after this one?

523
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,750
You said you'd quit last time, too.

524
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,160
But as we saw,

525
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,570
you ended up having nowhere to go.

526
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,980
Didn't the dude you wanted
to rely on just disappear?

527
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,950
Why bring it up?

528
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,640
I just want you to tell your brother

529
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,100
how pipe dreams always end.

530
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,930
In this line of work,

531
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,620
no one waits for you.

532
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,320
Are you serious about this?

533
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,240
Of course I am.

534
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,940
I doubt it will even hurt.

535
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,440
Are you sure?

536
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,350
It's not too late to change
your mind, you know?

537
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,200
Look at all the tattoos I have.

538
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,450
This doesn't compare to that.

539
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,590
How about this?

540
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,350
Let me know as soon as it's too much.

541
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,860
Just… say your safe word.

542
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:22,590
What do you mean?

543
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:27,120
Just a word that will let
me know when to stop.

544
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,180
It can be anything.

545
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,950
Can't I just call your name?

546
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,090
Bison, stop it.

547
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,440
Bison, please stop.

548
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,810
Bison.

549
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,440
Nope, that won't do.

550
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,730
Pretty sure I'll think you
enjoy it if you do that.

551
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,230
I'll just hurt you even more.

552
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,340
You're right.

553
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,290
How about…

554
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,230
Penguin?

555
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:53,980
Penguin?

556
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,100
Why penguins?

557
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:56,960
It's just cute.

558
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,010
I saw a documentary on them.

559
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,570
They're adorable but can be pretty vicious.

560
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,230
Sounds like you.

561
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,660
Okay, then.

562
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,240
Penguin it is.

563
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,330
Ready?

564
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,940
Are you okay?

565
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,920
It doesn't hurt as bad
as I thought it would.

566
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,680
The other one, alright?

567
00:34:00,852 --> 00:34:02,472
It's not too late to back out, you know?

568
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,440
Bison!

569
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,440
Fadel.

570
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,510
What are you doing here?

571
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,550
You didn't show up at the restaurant.

572
00:34:50,717 --> 00:34:52,007
You weren't answering my calls.

573
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,840
That's how I know you're here.

574
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,460
I was just getting a tattoo.

575
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,640
With you straddling him like that?

576
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,320
Go home.

577
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,430
We have a job to do.

578
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,020
I gotta go.

579
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,200
Let's go.

580
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,540
I need to talk to him.

581
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,230
Fadel.

582
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,470
Go.

583
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,770
Fadel!

584
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,840
Go!

585
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,390
Hello.

586
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,050
I think I was pretty clear last time.

587
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,720
It seems you don't remember.

588
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,580
I'll give you one more fair warning…

589
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,120
You and your mechanic friend

590
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,710
should leave us alone.

591
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,130
Or you're in for something serious.

592
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,520
Why'd you embarrass me like that?

593
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,260
You neglected your work.

594
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,360
Well?

595
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,420
Were you sleeping with him again?

596
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,570
I didn't even get to that, Fadel!

597
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,230
You were kind of interrupting!

598
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:10,860
Fadel.

599
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,150
I don't want to work at the restaurant.

600
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,920
I want to live my own life.

601
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,840
I don't want to kill people
anymore, don't you get it?

602
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,600
I don't want to wait tables
at a damn burger joint.

603
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,030
I want a boyfriend!

604
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:27,200
I want to tell him about
myself without lying.

605
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,640
Think about this.

606
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,720
If Mother didn't take us in, where'd we be?

607
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,840
We would've had no parents,
no house to live in, nothing!

608
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,150
How'd we survive like that?

609
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,530
And we're supposed to do
this for the rest of our lives?

610
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,270
Is that what I said?

611
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,890
Look.

612
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,370
I'll talk to Mother.

613
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,990
I'll tell her this will be your last job.

614
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,740
But during this time,

615
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,290
will you just cooperate and listen to me?

616
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,160
Just that.

617
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,540
Okay?

618
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,410
Of course, my best big brother.

619
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,330
Save your goddamn sarcasm.

620
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,130
And if you really want
to talk to that tattooist,

621
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,770
just bring him to the restaurant.

622
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,330
I'd rather you guys stay
where I can see you.

623
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,790
Thanks, Fadel!

624
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,840
Don't hug me.

625
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,140
I said he could come to the restaurant.

626
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,440
I didn't say you two can date.

627
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,310
Well, we're not dating anyway.

628
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,890
We're just hanging out for now.

629
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,280
Tonight's task.

630
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:41,030
Get some information out of
Ruerat's secretary at a host club.

631
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,900
Host club?

632
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,780
I ain't playing that role again.

633
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,120
You're good at it.

634
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,190
So it's just up your alley.

635
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,720
No.

636
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,400
You do it.

637
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,280
I think this one suits you.

638
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,100
She's a mature woman.

639
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,010
I'm pretty sure she prefers
your god-sculpted face,

640
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,530
with a jawline so
sharp it cuts, like yours.

641
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,170
I don't think she likes an
adorable petite guy like me.

642
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,820
So, Fadel, tonight,

643
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,040
you're the star.

644
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,460
Good evening, Ms. Pen.

645
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,700
How are you tonight?

646
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,700
See anyone you like?

647
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,590
Not even close.

648
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,450
I've seen them all
before and they're boring.

649
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,120
Don't you ever recruit new faces here?

650
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,150
Oh, Ms. Pen.

651
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,430
Of course, we do.

652
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,990
We just recruited some today,

653
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,800
just this afternoon, actually.

654
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:46,060
With the way they look and everything,

655
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:49,220
I'm sure they're your type.

656
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,100
Well, where are they?

657
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,870
All you do is talk.

658
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,330
I've been disappointed by
you too many times before.

659
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,700
One more time, and I'll go somewhere else.

660
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:02,090
Oh, Ms. Pen, please calm down.

661
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:02,930
He's here.

662
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,400
Why don't you have a little drink first?

663
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,300
Is this one of them?

664
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:12,450
Yes, he's just recruited today.

665
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,450
But he's only pouring your drinks for now.

666
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,040
He's not ready to entertain anyone.

667
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,090
But if you like him,

668
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,180
he'll be alright keeping you company.

669
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,260
Come closer.

670
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,080
No.

671
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,290
Too cute.

672
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:44,130
I prefer someone rougher…

673
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,890
dark and brooding, you know?

674
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,010
Is there anyone like that here?

675
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,770
Someone like that?

676
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,500
Dark and brooding.

677
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,160
Oh, sure there is!

678
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,010
He's exactly your type.

679
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:00,180
I'm sure you'll like him, Ms. Pen.

680
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,760
Less talking, and just bring him out.

681
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,760
Wait a minute.

682
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,660
Oh, he's hot.

683
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,750
Hey, Dad.

684
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,230
I'm just supposed to
give her the key, right?

685
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,350
She hasn't paid?

686
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,580
Fine.

687
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,770
Okay.

688
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,390
Hey, you there.

689
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:48,980
Yes?

690
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,800
Where's Ms. Ped?

691
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,840
I'm here with her car key.

692
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:52,740
She's inside.

693
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,020
You can go in.

694
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,880
Thanks.

695
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:17,160
Is that enough for you?

696
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:19,620
It's perfect.

697
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,210
I love it.

698
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:25,060
I'll see you in your room.

699
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,730
That was humiliating as hell.

700
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,460
I think it kinda suits you.

701
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,340
Didn't know you could dance like that.

702
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,160
I learned it from Magic Mike.

703
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,820
Stop it.

704
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:37,170
Don't you think it's weird, though,

705
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,170
that Keen just suddenly
helped us out like this?

706
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,200
I did at first.

707
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,270
But not anymore.

708
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,900
You know how he is.

709
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,000
Dude just loves getting all the credit.

710
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,080
He probably just wants Mother to approve

711
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,100
so she'd let him on the field, too.

712
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:54,680
I guess it makes sense.

713
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:56,690
Is it done?

714
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:58,570
Yeah. All done.

715
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:04,210
What about your girlfriend?

716
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,180
Do we just leave her here?

717
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:06,480
Girlfriend, my ass.

718
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,190
She ain't my type.

719
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:11,650
Well, what is your type?

720
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,120
Style?

721
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:14,930
Piss off.

722
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:20,420
Just leave her like that.

723
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:22,250
They'll just think she's passed out drunk.

724
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,630
Let's go home.

725
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,850
Careful not to be seen when you leave.

726
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:26,850
You go first.

727
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,790
I'll leave in a bit.

728
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,410
See you at home.

729
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:33,840
See you, big bro.

730
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,300
Hey.

731
00:46:56,196 --> 00:46:57,700
That was pretty hot.

732
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,060
You again?

733
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,760
Hey, don't get the wrong idea.

734
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,950
I didn't follow you.

735
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,310
I'm here to return the car
to the owner of this place.

736
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:11,160
I just happened to see
your sensual performance.

737
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,200
You're working at a host club, too?

738
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,200
It's a second job.

739
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,700
I get it. It pays well, right?

740
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,480
You need the money
for your restaurant, right?

741
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,650
No need to be embarrassed.

742
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,650
An honest job is an honest job.

743
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,050
With your looks and your body,

744
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:30,480
of course you gotta
make some money with it.

745
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:34,460
Wait.

746
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,970
Don't go. Let's chat.

747
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:39,440
Yeah.

748
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,840
You're right.

749
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,610
I need the money for my restaurant.

750
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:44,340
Happy now?

751
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:46,850
Yeah.

752
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,980
I guess owning a business isn't easy.

753
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:55,120
I know because my dad
worked hard for his garage, too.

754
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:01,310
Do you need to get a loan or something?

755
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:03,690
I know someone.

756
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:05,650
Thanks.

757
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,080
But I don't wanna be in debt.

758
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,610
Hey, newbie.

759
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,040
Where are you rushing off to?

760
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:15,940
Me?

761
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,840
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

762
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:22,760
Think you can steal my
regular on your first night?

763
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:25,560
Ms. Pen usually goes for me.

764
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,880
I'm sorry.

765
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,750
I didn't know.

766
00:48:28,355 --> 00:48:29,675
I'll stay out of your way.

767
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,730
You can do what you always do.

768
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,440
Oh, you think you're better than us?

769
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,710
She paid you well so now you'll
give us your scraps or what?

770
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:36,770
Guys, guys.

771
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:38,630
Let's be rational here.

772
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,030
I'm sure there are enough
clients with hefty pockets

773
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,360
for all of you.

774
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,220
Who the hell are you?

775
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:44,260
What do you have to do with this?

776
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:47,850
I'm just a good-looking pacifist.

777
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,850
You guys are fellow hosts,
so you gotta stick together.

778
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:54,130
I know people think
lowly of your profession,

779
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,670
but I totally support you.

780
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,150
I'm rooting for you all.

781
00:48:58,170 --> 00:48:59,310
The hell are you babbling about?

782
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,610
I don't need your support.

783
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,060
I need to let off some steam.

784
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:03,650
Get away!

785
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:12,570
Come here!

786
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:19,820
Hey, that's not fair!

787
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:20,450
Piss off!

788
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,020
Get out of the way!

789
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:26,050
Get up.

790
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,290
No, don't!

791
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,720
I surrender!

792
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,500
Let's run.

793
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:56,390
Let's get out of here!

794
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:18,640
You okay?

795
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,720
I am.

796
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,130
Go home.

797
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:44,470
Hey.

798
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:47,040
I think there's something
shady about Fadel.

799
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:48,240
He's suspicious.

800
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,120
How so?

801
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:53,220
As if I'd believe he needs
to work at a host club

802
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,750
to get some money for the restaurant.

803
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:59,130
Then what's with all the
pep talks you gave him?

804
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,920
I was just trying to gain his trust.

805
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:03,550
I was acting stupid

806
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:05,240
so he doesn't get suspicious of me.

807
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,720
But I swear something's off.

808
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:13,510
You should have seen when
he put those guys in their places.

809
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,230
Damn it, man.

810
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:18,150
Those three guys sure had
their asses handed to them.

811
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:23,850
He's gotta be some kind
of hitman, assassin, killer.

812
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,070
I'm sure of it.

813
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,050
I think you read too much into this.

814
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,910
Maybe he's just multifaceted like that.

815
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,220
I used to steal cars, you know?

816
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,600
And now I'm a tattoo artist.

817
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,050
I dance, too.

818
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:39,050
You think too much.

819
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,790
You're doing a good job.

820
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,980
Just wait a little longer.

821
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:44,480
Once I get inside their house,

822
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:45,680
you won't have to hit on this guy anymore.

823
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,460
And you'll get my car, as you wish.

824
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:50,550
The car isn't a priority anymore.

825
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,650
I just want to find out more about him.

826
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,660
I hate being left in the dark.

827
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,860
So you're taking my brother out tonight.

828
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:14,680
Yes.

829
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,850
A friend of mine just opened her own bar.

830
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,610
I thought I'd ask Bison to go with me.

831
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,950
I let you in here,

832
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,280
but that doesn't mean
you're free to take him out.

833
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,510
Ever since you're in the picture,

834
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,510
this guy's been slacking off at work.

835
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,670
I'm not that bad.

836
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:33,230
You're not going anywhere today.

837
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:34,850
Your schedule is full.

838
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,250
You have dishes to wash
and trash to throw out.

839
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,490
You have to clean this kitchen, too.

840
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:40,270
And you think you're free to go anywhere?

841
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,890
Come on, Fadel!

842
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,420
Can't we switch schedules for once?

843
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:45,240
I just want to go to this bar.

844
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:46,960
That's none of my business.

845
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,840
I have errands to run today.

846
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,280
How about…

847
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,480
I help you out?

848
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,720
You? Doing chores?

849
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,130
Don't underestimate me, big brother.

850
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,400
I have a little brother, too, you know?

851
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:09,250
I do all the chores at home.

852
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,660
And I'm hygienic as
hell, I'll have you know.

853
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:12,850
I don't need your bragging.

854
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:14,850
It's not a brag.

855
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:19,140
Fine.

856
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:23,170
If you finish all the tasks,

857
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,450
I'll allow it.

858
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,170
But it'd better be spotless.

859
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:27,060
Really?

860
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:28,640
You promised?

861
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:31,280
Go.

862
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,680
You really don't have to help, you know?

863
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:41,230
Fadel was clearly messing with us.

864
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,510
It's alright.

865
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,170
I just want to show your brother

866
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,520
that I'm serious.

867
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:50,730
Serious, huh?

868
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:53,600
There!

869
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,740
Hey!

870
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,490
That's dirty.

871
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,640
It's dishwater, not soap, you know?

872
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,610
Well, you were asking for it.

873
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,330
The pin looks really great.

874
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:12,320
Who designed this?

875
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,020
I did.

876
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,300
You're the best.

877
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:22,990
I want one.

878
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,100
Will you give me one?

879
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:26,930
No can do.

880
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,440
I only give this to my
special someone only.

881
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:30,640
You're not that yet.

882
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,380
I'll be your special someone one day.

883
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,190
Hey.

884
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,300
If you don't get everything done,

885
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,360
and if I see even one
spot on one of the dishes,

886
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,500
you don't get to go anywhere.

887
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,130
Yes, sir.

888
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,140
This place is great.

889
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,070
The vibe's kinda beachy, isn't it?

890
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,010
I love it.

891
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,370
I guessed as much from your taste.

892
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,760
I knew you'd like it.

893
00:56:02,535 --> 00:56:04,435
We haven't met all that long,

894
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,690
and you already know me that well?

895
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,210
I love learning about you.

896
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:09,830
Not so fast.

897
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,210
There's still so many
things to learn about.

898
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,340
Thanks.

899
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:21,260
Try this.

900
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,670
It's the house special.

901
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,060
My friend made this.

902
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,880
I don't know if you can handle it, though.

903
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:29,040
It's pretty damn strong.

904
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:30,630
Handle it?

905
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,500
You don't know me well enough, then.

906
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,050
You're saying you can hold
your liquor looking like a baby?

907
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:36,790
It's not too late if you want a
milkshake instead, you know?

908
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,490
Are you challenging me?

909
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,140
If you dare.

910
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,420
I never turn down a challenge.

911
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:40,360
Winner gets something.

912
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:41,370
Name it.

913
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:42,850
If I win,

914
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:46,420
we go back to your place.

915
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,250
Why do you want to go to my house?

916
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:56,320
Because my house is occupied.

917
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,210
Babe brought his friends over tonight.

918
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:00,820
And you said Fadel won't be home.

919
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,220
I'll leave as soon as we're done.

920
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:06,700
Okay.

921
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:07,700
Fine.

922
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,080
I don't want to be a bad
example for you brother anyway.

923
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:13,490
What if I win?

924
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,750
What do you want?

925
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:16,910
I'll give you anything.

926
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:20,980
If we go back to my place,

927
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,680
can we continue what we left
off at your studio the other day?

928
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,330
I'll give you a big show.

929
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,830
Big… how so?

930
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:30,440
It's a surprise.

931
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:32,480
Well?

932
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,140
Are you scared?

933
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,880
Okay.

934
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,120
Deal.

935
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:40,600
Deal.

936
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:49,900
One more.

937
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,320
How about a love shot?

938
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,570
Hey.

939
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:45,600
SUPPORT GROUP FOR LOSS

940
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,600
Losses are typical.

941
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,820
Time heals all.

942
00:58:56,307 --> 00:58:59,507
So feel free to cry it all out.

943
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,220
Take your time.

944
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,340
Is this your first time here?

945
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,750
We welcome you.

946
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,490
We are a support group for
people who have lost someone,

947
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:19,940
and people who have
not overcome their past.

948
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:22,440
This is a safe space.

949
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,520
You can trust us.

950
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:27,170
Would you mind taking off your sunglasses?

951
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,420
Everyone's more comfortable
knowing each other's faces.

952
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:39,440
Please introduce yourself
and tell us your story.

953
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:40,710
My story?

954
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:44,410
Something you've lost,

955
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:47,120
or the changing point in your life.

956
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,770
There is one thing.

957
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,940
It's still stuck with me.

958
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:00,940
When I was a kid,

959
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,780
there was this one vicious
stray dog always chasing me.

960
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:07,800
But one day,

961
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:10,150
I fell down a sewer hole.

962
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:13,300
There was no one there to help me.

963
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:15,550
But believe it or not,

964
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,550
this dog went and got help for me.

965
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:19,540
I survived because of him.

966
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,270
I adopted him immediately

967
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,520
and I named him Boonterm.

968
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,410
But recently…

969
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,340
He fell down a sewer hole and died.

970
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,690
I was deeply depressed.

971
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:36,980
I don't know what to do.

972
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,560
Every time I walk by a sewer hole,

973
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:40,310
I can't help but see him.

974
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,720
Boonterm.

975
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,830
Boonterm, my boy.

976
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,860
Boonterm.

977
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,310
It's okay.

978
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,230
Boonterm.

979
01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:59,820
You can take your time.

980
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,820
I lost a dog, too.

981
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,570
Wipe your tears.

982
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,790
Here's some napkins.

983
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,660
My poor boy.

984
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:21,830
You alright?

985
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:24,920
This is nothing.

986
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,590
I don't even feel it.

987
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,620
Wait for me on the dance floor.

988
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:34,050
I'll bring you your drink.

989
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:36,480
Let's dance.

990
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:38,270
Sure.

991
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,160
Don't pass out.

992
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,160
The night is still young.

993
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:54,610
Hey.

994
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:57,290
I want the same thing,

995
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:58,640
but make one shot really strong.

996
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,610
The other shot…

997
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,960
No alcohol.

998
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:04,560
But can you make it look the same?

999
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:06,930
What are you talking about?

1000
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:08,670
Just do it.

1001
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,080
Fine.

1002
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:21,280
Thanks.

1003
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:39,050
Hey.

1004
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,450
I think I'm losing this time around.

1005
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,800
Then you'd better tell me your address

1006
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,130
before you pass out.

1007
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:15,580
Of course.

1008
01:03:16,682 --> 01:03:18,962
But I don't know if I'm
up for anything tonight.

1009
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,650
I'm just feeling so tired.

1010
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,420
I'd say you're still pretty good.

1011
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:53,370
Hey!

1012
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,020
Where are you taking me?

1013
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:00,000
Hey, what are you doing?

1014
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I've been too nice to you.

1015
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:09,340
Do you take other
people's losses for a joke?

1016
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,340
I don't.

1017
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:13,200
I have my own problems.

1018
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,240
You're not the only one.

1019
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,490
A stray dog?

1020
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:18,210
His name was Boonterm.

1021
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,690
Respect him, dude.

1022
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,970
And I found this support
group on the internet.

1023
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,240
It was a coincidence you're also here.

1024
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,260
That's it.

1025
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,740
I don't buy that.

1026
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:32,450
I'm hitting on you

1027
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,210
because I like you.

1028
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,570
I want you.

1029
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,570
Nothing more than that.

1030
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,670
I don't like being pursued.

1031
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:43,260
If I like you, I'll do the pursuing.

1032
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:48,280
Well, then don't you like me just a little?

1033
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:49,560
No.

1034
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:51,480
I don't.

1035
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,480
Not even a little bit?

1036
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:58,710
You really want me?

1037
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:04,070
Fine.

1038
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:06,510
If you want it,

1039
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:08,460
I'll give it to you.

1040
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,760
Hey, where are you going?

1041
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:26,870
This ain't no hit-and-run.

1042
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:28,690
I gave you what you wanted.

1043
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:32,500
What kind of man do you take me for?

1044
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,170
I might look like I play around,

1045
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,170
but I'm damn devoted to love.

1046
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:38,770
I want to date.

1047
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,200
Then go find someone.

1048
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,370
Hold on.

1049
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,940
You can't do this to me.

1050
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,350
Why can't I?

1051
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:48,660
We agreed on it.

1052
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,550
You're way too mean.

1053
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:53,940
Move.

1054
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:57,480
If you don't move,

1055
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,770
I'll beat you.

1056
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,020
No, you won't.

1057
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,030
You like me.

1058
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,370
Hey, Fadel!

1059
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:23,370
As if I'd let you nail
and bail on me like that!

1060
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:34,610
Hey, we're here.

1061
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:51,960
You know…

1062
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:55,090
You're the first guy I ever brought home.

1063
01:07:57,970 --> 01:07:59,080
Thank you.

1064
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,770
Where's your key?

1065
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:21,240
Let's go.

1066
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:38,720
You alright?

1067
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:41,740
Yeah.

1068
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:47,540
Which room?

1069
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:53,550
Careful.

1070
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:27,680
Hey.

1071
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,552
Where are you going?

1072
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:36,320
I'm going to get you some water.

1073
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,069
Don't go.

1074
01:09:39,796 --> 01:09:41,790
I'm not that drunk.

1075
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:45,869
That means…

1076
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,000
I won.

1077
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:57,578
Hey.

1078
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:06,290
I won.

1079
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:09,614
Give me what I asked for.

1080
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:15,978
What are you gonna do?

1081
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,167
You know…

1082
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:51,694
I've been waiting to have fun
with someone like this for so long.

1083
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:15,920
You ready?

1084
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:21,658
Are you?

1085
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,043
Ye–yeah.

1086
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:40,654
Now…

1087
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:44,138
We'll finally get to do it
as more than strangers.

1088
01:11:49,185 --> 01:11:50,523
Hello.

1089
01:11:50,858 --> 01:11:52,130
I'm Bison.

1090
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,174
The most adorable waiter at a burger joint.

1091
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:01,316
I'm Kant.

1092
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:06,210
I'm a tattoo artist who
loves adorable guys.

1093
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,269
Don't forget your safe word.

1094
01:12:22,865 --> 01:12:24,065
Penguin.

1095
01:12:50,276 --> 01:12:51,396
Keep your eyes closed.

1096
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:01,040
Hope you don't say penguin soon.

1098
01:14:03,069 --> 01:14:04,334
(Next Week)
What are you doing?

1099
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:05,789
How did you get inside my house?

1100
01:14:05,978 --> 01:14:07,447
Your brother was dead drunk.

1101
01:14:07,483 --> 01:14:09,105
I gave him a ride home.

1102
01:14:09,134 --> 01:14:11,100
Besides being a tattooist,

1103
01:14:11,134 --> 01:14:11,832
what else do you even know about him?

1104
01:14:11,869 --> 01:14:13,120
You have my heart now.

1105
01:14:13,156 --> 01:14:14,400
Take good care of it.

1106
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:18,901
What do I have to do to win you over?

1107
01:14:18,945 --> 01:14:22,021
I know someone like you
just needs a little nudge.

1108
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:23,585
So what are we?

1109
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,770
Be my boyfriend.
