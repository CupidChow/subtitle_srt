1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,380
The hell did you do that for?

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,720
You brought all this on us!

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,360
If you’re going to kill him,
kill me, too.

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,700
What the hell are you doing?

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,520
I’m going to keep walking until you give me a chance.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,660
Who is he?

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,980
He’s my ex.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,540
But one day, he’s just gone.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,630
Won’t you just let Ruerat go?

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,210
I told you
this would be the last mission.

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,630
Do you think we’d get to come back here again?

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,760
Once we wrap up the last mission,

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,420
we can go anywhere and do anything.

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,530
Don’t forget to change your bandage regularly.

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,660
So we’re not…

16
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,860
sleeping together tonight?

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,070
I can’t.

18
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,650
I have to get this job done.

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,740
We’ll be away for a while,

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,500
but I’ll see you soon.

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,209
There’s nothing I can do to change your mind, is there?

22
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,000
Hey.

23
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,880
Call me.

24
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,330
Keep me updated.

25
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,630
Of course.

26
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,400
But let’s not stay in contact for a little while,

27
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,230
just to keep everyone safe.

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,180
Okay?

29
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,580
We have to go.

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,240
Why do I have a feeling

31
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,540
that we won’t see them again?

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,280
Don’t jinx it, dude.

33
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,530
I looked up and found that

34
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,530
Ruerat has bought all the land around here to build a condo.

35
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:53,980
Look here.

36
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,600
This is our new identity.

37
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,720
When should we do it?

38
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,050
Ruerat’s secretary wants to meet us tomorrow.

39
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,080
Good.

40
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,290
Let’s tell Mother.

41
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,790
We’ll deal with this and get it over with.

42
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,460
We’ll finally get to be with the ones we love.

43
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,250
Here is the sale and purchase agreement.

44
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,800
The price is 80 million baht,

45
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,970
as specified by the landowner.

46
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:52,000
All you need to do is sign here,

47
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,000
and the land is yours, Mr. Ruerat.

48
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,420
Allow me.

49
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,250
I’ve been trying to contact the owner for nearly a year,

50
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,970
but I never got through.

51
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,130
How did you two get to them?

52
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,000
It’s our trade secret.

53
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,320
But since you’re a very special client,

54
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,900
I’ll tell you.

55
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,780
Do you happen to know

56
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,170
Empire Estate and Property

57
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,840
and Punlert Development?

58
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,400
Dad.

59
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,490
Mom.

60
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,810
What do you mean?

61
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,980
We mean to ask…

62
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,700
Why did you kill them?

63
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,650
What do you want?

64
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,860
Who sent you?

65
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,180
It doesn’t matter who sent us!

66
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,820
Just answer my question.

67
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,280
Why did you kill my parents?

68
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,450
I didn’t!

69
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,820
Answer me!

70
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,520
You’re Lilly’s boys, aren’t you?

71
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,180
Aren’t you?

72
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,620
Answer my question!

73
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,620
Did you kill them just because they refused to sell their lands?

74
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,020
I didn’t kill them.

75
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,020
This is no excuse.

76
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,620
Listen to me.

77
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,960
There’s been a misunderstanding.

78
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,850
Don’t lie.

79
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,990
I’m not lying!

80
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,360
The person who killed your parents
was your mother!

81
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,810
What the hell are you saying?

82
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,750
Lilly killed your parents
with her own hands!

83
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,420
You know I’m not above putting a hole through a liar’s skull.

84
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,880
Listen to me.

85
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,300
Hear me out.

86
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,820
Lilly was once a hired gun,

87
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,330
just like you two.

88
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,220
She used to work for me.

89
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:44,150
I hired her to poison people,

90
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,440
to kill people.

91
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,780
One day, she said she’d quit and start a family.

92
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,970
So I thought she was getting married and having children.

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,970
But in the end, she just adopted the children of the people she killed

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,740
and raised them as hitmen.

95
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,490
All just to get rid of me!

96
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,980
You’re lying!

97
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,210
Mother would never do that.

98
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,120
Say what you want,

99
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,510
- but I call that bullshit!
- 	Bison, stop!

100
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,970
Hold on.

101
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,320
You believe him?

102
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,740
Think about it,

103
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,000
if she wasn’t a hitman before,

104
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,800
how’d she know how to train you into one?

105
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,340
You bastards are more dumb than I thought.

106
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,210
Damn it!

107
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,540
So Mother has been using us all along?

108
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,300
What even was real?

109
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,300
You’re still calling her “Mother”?

110
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,300
What about the lives we’ve wasted?

111
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,770
What about the freedom I long for,

112
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,600
the love I refrain from?

113
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,410
We killed people we didn’t even want to kill.

114
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,950
I told you not to indulge her so much!

115
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,720
Crap…

116
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,350
Maybe Ruerat was just trying to mess with our heads.

117
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,300
What the hell would he do that for?

118
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,960
He was on death’s door.

119
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,480
Nobody would lie at a time like that.

120
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,330
I’m telling you

121
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,740
I’m not letting my parents’ murderer
get away with it.

122
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,470
What do you say?

123
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,010
What do you want to do?

124
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,050
Should we kill her?

125
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,680
She taught us to kill bad people.

126
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,840
What she did to us was beyond evil.

127
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,990
Kill her!

128
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,340
Let’s kill her, Fadel!

129
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,590
Kill her!

130
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,380
Kill her!

131
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,580
- Kill her!
- Bison!

132
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,840
I know you’re angry.

133
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,450
I am, too.

134
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,970
Listen to me.

135
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,970
We need to pull ourselves together
if we want to deal with someone like her.

136
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,250
We need plans.

137
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,560
She raised us.

138
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,530
She knows how we think,

139
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,360
what we would do.

140
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,040
That’s why…

141
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,450
You need to calm down.

142
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,660
It’s not in my nature
to let someone who’s been using me

143
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,440
continue to live a happy life.

144
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,810
I think he’s turned off his phone.

145
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,390
Can you reach your guy?

146
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,970
Same here.

147
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
He texted me before he went silent, though.

148
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,210
What did he say?

149
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,300
“Let’s stay away from each other for a bit just to be safe.”

150
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,730
What’s with that?

151
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,980
Do they think we’ll just sit here carefree?

152
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,700
We couldn’t stop them,

153
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,160
and they refused to let us help.

154
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,860
Do they think they’re superheroes or something?

155
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,580
Agreed.

156
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,340
Why don’t you
find out what they’re up to?

157
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:09,980
It’s worth trying.

158
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,090
I know what they’re up to.

159
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,970
The point is he wouldn’t listen to me.

160
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,370
Why don’t you try and stop Fadel?

161
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,200
See if you can.

162
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,140
You’re right.

163
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,400
In the end, all we can do is
wait for them to come back.

164
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,560
I thought you two abandoned me.

165
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,780
We’re sorry we’ve been out of contact.

166
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,460
We felt really bad for messing up last time,

167
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,970
so we just needed some time to recoup.

168
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,640
It was my idea to keeping our distance from you
until we killed Ruerat.

169
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,530
What do you think?

170
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,420
Is it a surprise?

171
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,410
Not at all.

172
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,220
You two never disappoint me.

173
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,080
Well, now that it’s mission accomplished,

174
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,190
can we finally quit?

175
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,560
As you wish.

176
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,440
You can do whatever you want.

177
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,260
Thank you, Mother.

178
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,510
If you need us for anything,

179
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,480
just let us know.

180
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,640
You’ve raised us.

181
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,120
We can never repay you.

182
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,900
You don’t need to think about that.

183
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,210
Just seeing you two happy
makes me happy.

184
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,530
If you ever need anything,

185
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,370
just let Keen know.

186
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,970
He’ll take care of it for you.

187
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,880
Of course.

188
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,440
Thank you.

189
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,980
If you’ll please excuse us for now…

190
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,810
Goodbye.

191
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,530
They don’t know about your mess-up, do they?

192
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,500
I don’t think so.

193
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,620
Good.

194
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,200
At least Ruerat is now taken care of.

195
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,240
As for those two,

196
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,960
we’ll let someone professional deal with them.

197
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,960
In this industry,

198
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,220
once you’re in,

199
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,050
you don’t get to walk away easily.

200
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,280
And if you want to quit,

201
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,540
this is the only way out.

202
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,890
If you miss him so much,

203
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,470
why don’t you just go and see him?

204
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,500
I can’t.

205
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,980
He won’t see me.

206
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,980
What’s in your way now?

207
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,310
You already got his brother’s approval.

208
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,110
So what now?

209
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,230
Do his parents disapprove?

210
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,750
Do you think you’ll be shunned by society?

211
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,020
What is it?

212
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,170
Don’t make it sound like the plot of a novel.

213
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,540
But what’s in my way is even worse than any of those.

214
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,170
If you love him,

215
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,560
you have to fight for him.

216
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,070
Don’t let him do it alone.

217
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,070
You gotta push back when he refuses your help.

218
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,460
You gotta show him
that you’re on his side.

219
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,090
Romantic, aren’t I?

220
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,410
You’re quite a casanova, huh?

221
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,040
I only know the theories,
never put any to practice.

222
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,880
Bison.

223
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:25,980
Bison!

224
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,740
Hey!

225
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:33,960
Bison.

226
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,720
Bison.

227
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,960
I know you’re here.

228
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,640
Bison!

229
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,460
Kant!

230
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,600
Look where you’re going!

231
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,370
Don’t you know how to use the damn brake, jackass!

232
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,560
That jerk…

233
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,040
Hey.

234
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,610
You hurt?

235
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,380
Hey—

236
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,520
Does it hurt?

237
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,940
No, it doesn’t.

238
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,650
Nothing hurts more than not seeing you.

239
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,780
I don’t want you getting involved with my mess.

240
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,260
Once I tidy up everything on my end,

241
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,240
we can be together.

242
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,570
So?

243
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,210
You’re just going to keep living like this?

244
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,000
If you worry about me so much,
why not just keep me on camera?

245
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,540
I’ll be under your surveillance all the time.

246
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,500
I don’t like uncertainty.

247
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,310
I just want to be sure

248
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,420
that I’ll get to be with you.

249
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,970
I can’t promise anyone anything with the way I live.

250
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,780
But I’ll try.

251
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,480
No, I don’t want that.

252
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,260
You think I’ll go on living

253
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,850
if you die?

254
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,380
I won’t die.

255
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,700
I’m good at what I do.

256
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,940
How about this?

257
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,320
Let me help you.

258
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,050
Let me help you deal with the person who hurt your parents.

259
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,960
No. It’s too dangerous.

260
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,770
You weren’t trained to do it like I was.

261
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,720
Train me, then.

262
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,350
Train me to be like you.

263
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,760
It’s not easy, you know?

264
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,390
Did you forget

265
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,190
I was a thief and even a narc?

266
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,420
The audacity.

267
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,400
You want another scratch or something?

268
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,500
I’ll help you start over with me.

269
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,420
We will take care of each other.

270
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,770
This isn’t just an empty promise.

271
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,890
I’ll make it happen.

272
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,800
Hey—

273
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,630
Fadel.

274
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,580
You scared me.

275
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,050
I’m sorry.

276
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,970
Didn’t you say we needed to stay away for a while?

277
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,220
I can’t help thinking about you.

278
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,860
How’s your wound?

279
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,340
Does it still hurt?

280
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,600
No.

281
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,170
My heart hurts more.

282
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,330
What are you talking about?

283
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,700
You hurt my feelings.

284
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,760
I thought you trusted me.

285
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,100
You know I know everything,

286
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,920
but still you push me away.

287
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,870
I’m doing this for you.

288
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,500
I don’t want you getting caught in the crossfire.

289
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,140
So you’d rather I wonder whether you’re dead or alive?

290
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,840
You think that’ll make me happy?

291
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,580
It hurts more than getting shot.

292
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,980
You’re so dramatic.

293
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,550
You love calling me that.

294
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,980
If you really believe that,

295
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,030
just go.

296
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,160
Go, and don’t come back.

297
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,360
Style.

298
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,420
I don’t want to lose you.

299
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,780
Neither do I.

300
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,960
That’s why you need to let me help you.

301
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,880
Are you sure you want to do this?

302
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,220
Hell yeah.

303
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,120
When I’m in, I’m all in, body and soul.

304
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,820
Don’t say that just to be cool.

305
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,070
I’m not saying it to be cool,

306
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,370
I’m saying it to be yours.

307
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,810
I’m in, too.

308
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,670
I mean it.

309
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,640
I was a narc once,

310
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,320
not to mention a car thief.

311
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:53,340
I think I’m more than qualified for the job.

312
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,370
Now it just sounds like you’re bragging.

313
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,900
I’m not bragging.

314
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,210
With two extra pairs of hands,

315
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,680
we’ll make your job easier.

316
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:05,160
You don’t have to worry about me.

317
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,210
I’m good enough to make this dude fall for me, aren’t I?

318
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,320
Stop joking.

319
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,970
This is important to the two of us.

320
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,370
I’m not joking.

321
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,520
Your life is as important to me as my own.

322
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,110
How about this?

323
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,220
We split into two teams.

324
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,720
Kant and I will dig up anything we can find on Lilly.

325
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,570
You and Style go after Keen.

326
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,200
We’ll share what we find later.

327
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,980
I’ll ask again.

328
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,710
It’s not too late to back off.

329
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,240
Ain’t no way I’m backing off.

330
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,090
Let’s get this over with.

331
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,500
You and I will have nothing to fear from now on.

332
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
And I just can’t stand not being around you anymore.

333
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,670
You ready?

334
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,380
You can count me in as well.

335
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,230
I’m not backing off.

336
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,730
The four of us are in the same boat now.

337
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,460
If you make it, I make it.

338
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,970
If you die, I die.

339
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,980
Let it end here.

340
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,660
Am I right, bud?

341
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,250
Since you’re so determined…

342
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:31,970
Let’s do it.

343
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,020
Fadel.

344
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,760
Don’t be a sore thumb.

345
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,490
Come on.

346
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:47,910
Hurry up.

347
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,270
Good.

348
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,850
Now I can finally date without fearing for my life.

349
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,180
Let’s go!

350
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,450
Why did no one say it with me?

351
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,930
That was on brand of you, really.

352
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,490
It feels kinda weird to have a new work partner.

353
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,120
I never worked with anyone besides Fadel.

354
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,450
When I worked for the cops,

355
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,910
I always worked alone.

356
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,270
I get scared sometimes.

357
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,010
What do you mean?

358
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,520
I get scared no one will help me if I mess up, I guess.

359
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,050
There’s no need to worry.

360
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,800
We’re not here to kill anyone today.

361
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,400
We’re just investigating.

362
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,910
And one more thing,

363
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,080
I have your back now.

364
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,260
Hey.

365
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,090
Stop it.

366
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,410
We can’t risk someone seeing us.

367
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,710
What cabbie makes out with his boyfriend so openly, right?

368
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,200
Fine.

369
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,890
I won’t distract you while we’re on the job.

370
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,040
But you look cool in that cabbie uniform.

371
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,700
You know, like a blue collar jobber…

372
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,290
It’s kinda sexy.

373
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,560
You just said you wouldn’t distract me.

374
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,330
Alright.

375
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:25,550
Hey.

376
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:26,570
She’s here.

377
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,770
Follow her.

378
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,690
Style, what the hell are you doing?

379
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,930
Why don’t you just go and sit with him?

380
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,100
You nearly revealed us.

381
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,110
It’s not like I’ve been trained to stalk people, you know?

382
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,730
You were stalking me for weeks, weren’t you?

383
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,850
Well, that was me being my persistent self.

384
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,100
What do you know about this guy?

385
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,140
I don’t actually know anything.

386
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:48,460
I only know that we were adopted at the same time.

387
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,500
We worked in field operations.

388
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,450
But Lilly thinks he’s more suited for a desk job.

389
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,840
We never really care about him.

390
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,600
I kinda feel sorry for him.

391
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,930
He’s eating all alone.

392
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,930
Why do you feel sorry for him?

393
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,530
He was trying to kill us.

394
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,900
This guy—

395
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,810
I need to get back at him.

396
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,340
He hurt me.

397
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,860
What are you gonna do?

398
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,990
Shoot him?

399
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,330
Can you even kill people?

400
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,400
You’re right.

401
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,570
I ain’t as ruthless as you are.

402
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,510
Move away from there.

403
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:16,910
Hey.

404
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,670
Who are those women?

405
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,240
I think they’re the wives of some senators.

406
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,110
Lilly is probably trying to get close to them

407
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,700
as a way of getting herself into politics.

408
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,580
Using their wives to do her bidding…

409
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,400
That’s smart.

410
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,990
We need to be smarter.

411
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,740
We need to get close to one of her minions.

412
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,280
My boyfriend’s the best.

413
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,180
Hey!

414
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,550
This is no time for that.

415
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,780
We need to work.

416
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,460
Can you help me with something?

417
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,040
What?

418
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,860
Hurry up.

419
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,330
I have work to do.

420
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,660
Here’s the thing…

421
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,170
What do you say?

422
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,010
Alright.

423
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,330
What are you going to do?

424
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,100
Keep me in the loop.

425
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,720
Don’t worry.

426
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:31,050
I got this covered.

427
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,650
Gonna need to put myself out there a bit, though.

428
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,120
Who is he here to see?

429
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Meeting at a hotel like this…

430
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,270
I bet it’s his lover.

431
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,960
If they’re dating,

432
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,980
why would they meet at a hotel?

433
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,199
If you ask to meet me at a hotel,

434
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,260
I’d definitely assume you’re hiding something from me.

435
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,290
Maybe he’s hiding from Lilly?

436
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,730
And you said you’re not much of a detective.

437
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,650
I learned it from you.

438
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,270
What should we do?

439
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,409
Wait until he comes out?

440
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,210
Can you do that?

441
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:45,659
If you can’t wait, just go home.

442
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,580
Like hell I will.

443
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,810
I said I’d help.

444
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,510
I won’t back down.

445
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,120
I have a plan.

446
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,460
We won’t have to wait,

447
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,230
and we’ll find out who he’s with.

448
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,320
What are you going to do?

449
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,980
Thank you for inviting me out for a swing.

450
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,880
All I do is attend charity events and functions,

451
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,080
it gets so boring at times.

452
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,180
It’s all my pleasure.

453
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:40,190
Women our age
must do something invigorating every once in a while.

454
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,290
It must be so boring helping your husband with his work.

455
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,230
You’re right to do something fun for a change.

456
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,200
You are so right.

457
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:53,020
The gentlemen have pretty young caddies on their side.

458
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,500
Don’t you think us ladies
deserve handsome caddies, too?

459
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,130
You are so right again.

460
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,120
Hold on a moment.

461
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,750
I’ll go talk to them.

462
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:06,550
Okay.

463
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,610
Where’s the other boy?

464
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,990
I picked him especially to take care of the lady.

465
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,100
I don’t know, ma’am.

466
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,200
Go and take care of them.

467
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,400
Hello.

468
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,830
I’m here to replace Ton.

469
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,990
Where is Ton?

470
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,980
He’s her favorite.

471
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,640
He has a stomach ache.

472
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,940
He asked me to fill in.

473
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,530
I am displeased.

474
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,230
Do you think you can just waltz in without asking me?

475
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,350
I apologize for Ton’s sake.

476
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,590
But I am good at my job, ma’am.

477
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,180
No.

478
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,530
I’ll find someone else to fill in.

479
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,610
You can go.

480
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,410
Do you need my help, ma’am?

481
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:09,970
Of course.

482
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,250
Excuse me, please put your weight on this leg.

483
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,860
Put your right leg forward.

484
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,170
Now, keep your eye on your target.

485
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,110
I see.

486
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,750
When you swing, use the strength in your shoulder.

487
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,010
Like that.

488
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,180
Would you like to give it a try, ma’am?

489
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,440
Help me out.

490
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,380
Of course.

491
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,860
Let’s try it.

492
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,600
Wow, you’re a natural.

493
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,980
Thanks.

494
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,860
What’s your name?

495
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,290
My name is Tonkhao.

496
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,100
Tonkhao.

497
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,490
That’s a cute name.

498
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:27,800
Will you be staying with me all day, Tonkhao?

499
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,610
I’d love to, ma’am,

500
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,420
but I don’t know if Ms. Lilly—

501
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,730
I asked him to help you.

502
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,380
I see.

503
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,540
I know sweet guys are just your type,

504
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,700
so I hand-picked him just for you.

505
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,440
Oh, you.

506
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,370
You shouldn’t say such things right in front of him.

507
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,450
Now you’re making me blush.

508
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,990
There’s no need to be embarrassed.

509
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:04,780
Why don’t you let him take care of you for the day?

510
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,410
Of course.

511
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,970
Let me hold that for you.

512
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,870
Let’s go to the next hole?

513
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,710
I can help you with that.

514
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,700
Of, how kind of you.

515
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,330
Let me help.

516
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,040
Room service.

517
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,830
We didn’t order anything.

518
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,800
I was told to deliver it to your room, sir.

519
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,690
Keen.

520
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,060
Did you order room service?

521
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,340
No, I didn’t.

522
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:11,100
I think you’ve got the wrong room.

523
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,090
I’m sorry.

524
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,510
Hey!

525
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,990
I don’t think you’ve got the wrong room.

526
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,060
What’s going on?

527
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,470
I was waiting when you’re going to show up.

528
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,940
How was it?

529
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,050
It was really fun.

530
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,320
What do you think of this boy?

531
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,640
He’s perfect.

532
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,350
I’ll book him for your next round.

533
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,220
Please have some orange juice and fresh fruits, ma’am.

534
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:28,710
Here.

535
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:31,990
Thanks.

536
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,910
It’s good.

537
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:48,720
Thank you for such a lovely day, Tonkhao.

538
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,310
Of course.

539
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,570
It’s my pleasure to take care of you, ma’am.

540
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,450
Oh, quit it with the “ma’am” now.

541
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,770
Just call me by my name.

542
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:04,570
Try calling me Nuch.

543
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,750
Of course, Nuch.

544
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:13,960
Attaboy.

545
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:18,380
I need to use the bathroom.

546
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,800
Of course.

547
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,420
Don’t think I approve of you for sneaking behind my back.

548
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,980
I’m sorry.

549
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,770
I just want to prove to you that I’m good at my job.

550
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,080
You’re lucky she likes you.

551
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,300
I’ll give you another chance.

552
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,390
What do you want me to do?

553
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:50,050
Do what you’re good at.

554
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,760
Use your pretty face to your advantage,

555
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,250
serving these old ladies.

556
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:58,270
Her birthday is coming up.

557
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:02,330
I want some young things like you
to take care of her and her friends.

558
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,110
Can you do that?

559
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:05,780
Oh.

560
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,220
Do you prefer women or men?

561
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,530
Men.

562
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,470
But I don’t mind.

563
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,220
I work in service.

564
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,710
I know it’s my job to serve people of all genders and ages.

565
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:19,000
Good.

566
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:22,160
If you’re not picky,
you’ll make money.

567
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:27,600
Find me a few more boys like you.

568
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,270
Make sure your friends are handsome.

569
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,520
All my friends are, ma’am.

570
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,430
Excuse me for now.

571
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,300
Put your gun down

572
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:52,340
and kneel next to your boyfriend.

573
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,130
Let Style go.

574
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,700
This is between you and me.

575
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:11,650
He has nothing to do with this.

576
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,260
Everyone who is in your life

577
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,910
has something to do with this.

578
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,450
One wrong move,

579
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,430
and I put a hole through his skull.

580
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:32,980
No need to be scared.

581
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,610
He doesn’t have the gut to do that.

582
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,200
You think you’re so amazing, huh?

583
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,300
I knew you were following me.

584
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:46,810
I even had a GPS on your car.

585
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:49,470
Why did you think I found you back there?

586
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,660
You still suck at this, don’t you?

587
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,790
You did all that,

588
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,980
and I’m still alive.

589
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,410
Not this time.

590
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,980
You’re in my turf.

591
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,980
Mother will trust me once she sees what I can do.

592
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,310
What is going on?

593
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,290
Who are these people?

594
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:32,820
I’ll tell you

595
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:34,900
after I deal with them.

596
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,360
You think you’ll get to live a normal life?

597
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,730
Even if you pull the trigger now,

598
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,450
you’ll still have to sneak about to see your lover.

599
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,870
She doesn’t want us to be happy.

600
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,870
She just wants us by her side.

601
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,820
Listen to me.

602
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,380
It was her

603
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,660
who killed our parents.

604
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:17,100
That’s not true.

605
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,940
Mother would never do that.

606
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:20,900
Keen!

607
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:23,740
You’re not her child.

608
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,980
The only reason she keeps us

609
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:28,660
is because she wants us as her dogs.

610
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:43,430
Stop!

611
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:51,780
Fadel…

612
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:54,810
Don’t hurt Nont.

613
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:57,380
You dare ask me to spare your boyfriend

614
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,260
when you were going to shoot mine?

615
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:07,970
You said she killed our parents.

616
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:12,150
I have something to tell you.

617
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,850
What’s your ploy now?

618
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,180
Do you remember when you asked to quit

619
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:22,940
so you could be with your ex-boyfriend?

620
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,190
What are you saying?

621
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,990
He didn’t leave you.

622
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,000
Mother put a hit on him

623
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,610
because she wanted you to keep working for her.

624
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:49,600
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

625
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:52,960
She asked me not to!

626
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:55,880
If I refused,

627
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:57,790
she’d have had me killed, too.

628
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,710
Let’s make a deal.

629
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,700
You get me dirt on Lilly,

630
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,700
and I’ll spare your boyfriend’s life.

631
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,280
Style.

632
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:03,070
Don’t hurt Nont.

633
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,120
That’s for you to decide.

634
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,740
Do you love him

635
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,740
more than your Mother?

636
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,750
That’s for shooting me!

637
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,380
Nont!

638
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,700
You really know how to charm everyone, huh?

639
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,700
That lady sure fell for you.

640
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,390
Jealous?

641
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,410
Don’t worry.

642
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:11,910
I prefer younger guys.

643
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,960
I think our next job will be easy breezy.

644
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:22,350
She kinda trusts me now.

645
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:25,890
Thank you.

646
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:31,410
But I think Fadel and I got it from here.

647
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:34,940
No way.

648
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,690
I said I’d help.

649
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,950
I’ll stick with you till the end.

650
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:42,360
We’ll get to start over together.

651
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,460
Will you help me with one more thing?

652
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:00,960
What?

653
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:06,620
Put this on me?

654
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,620
I thought you threw it in the ocean.

655
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,760
I did.

656
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:19,990
I picked it up when I was saving your life.

657
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,260
You really can’t cut me loose, can you?

658
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,730
You were furious at me,

659
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,720
but still saved my life.

660
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,820
I guess I really know how to charm everyone, like you said,

661
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:51,130
but especially you.

662
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,400
You let one compliment get to your head, you know that?

663
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:59,130
Now I wish I left you at the bottom of the ocean with the necklace.

664
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,290
Like in Titanic?

665
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:03,300
Have you seen it?

666
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:04,420
Of course.

667
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,970
I watched it with my Dad.

668
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,500
The hero dies at the end, right?

669
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,110
Yeah, you’re right.

670
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,430
But you know, I read somewhere that

671
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:18,310
Jack could have made it on that wooden door.

672
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:20,300
There’s a whole experiment and everything, you know.

673
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,170
But dude just can’t lose face, right?

674
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:25,170
He sacrifices himself to keep Rose alive.

675
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,530
But I’m no Jack.

676
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,970
I can’t lose face, either,

677
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,210
but I will make sure we both come out of this alive.

678
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,690
What?

679
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,970
“I’m the king of the world!”

680
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:43,080
Come on.

681
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,570
“I’m the king of the world!”

682
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,110
Stop it.

683
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,820
That’s the classic scene, right?

684
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:53,820
I prefer reenacting another scene, though.

685
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:55,020
Which one?

686
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:56,270
The one in the car.

687
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,950
Beep-beep!

688
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:06,600
“Where to, mister?”

689
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,350
“To the stars.”

690
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:16,910
I’m just reenacting the scene, you know?

691
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,990
Did you forget this part?

692
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,970
Hey!

693
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,480
You’ll have to wait until we’re in an actual car.

694
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:34,610
Promise?

695
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:11,570
I’ve asked Mother about quitting my job

696
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,980
and moving to the South with you.

697
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,420
He didn’t leave you.

698
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,020
Mother put a hit on him.

699
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:39,300
Are you alright?

700
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,750
You can talk to me, you know?

701
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:54,670
You know what?

702
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,660
I’ve always blamed myself.

703
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,060
I thought…

704
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:09,420
He left

705
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,860
because of me,

706
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:17,950
because he was scared of me.

707
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,960
He didn’t want a future with me.

708
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,590
That’s why I don’t want to get close to anyone.

709
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:37,430
Now that I found out about this,

710
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,780
I finally understood you

711
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,060
and why you were so closed-minded before.

712
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,360
I don’t want to have any expectations

713
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:03,390
just to be disappointed.

714
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,170
I never thought…

715
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,170
that he’d be dead because of me.

716
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,470
If only I didn’t want to quit my job,

717
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:37,420
if only I didn’t get close to him…

718
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,590
He’d still be alive.

719
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,220
It wasn’t your fault.

720
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,210
Lilly was the one who had him killed.

721
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:00,190
It was her fault.

722
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,980
Don’t blame yourself.

723
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:07,570
You had the full right to love and to want a future with him.

724
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:13,810
You see now, Style?

725
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,880
The only thing my love will lead you to is death.

726
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:29,330
Please just leave me.

727
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,220
I won’t even get mad at you.

728
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,830
Live the life you deserve.

729
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,610
Don’t leave it with me.

730
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,810
Why would you say this?

731
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:51,720
It hurts my feelings, you know?

732
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,500
I’m not the type to leave the one I love to save my life.

733
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,390
I’m not selfish like that.

734
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:09,150
Love is something you fight for together.

735
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,980
Stay by each other’s side through every obstacle.

736
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:17,900
If I was scared,

737
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:20,970
I’d have run away the day I found out you’re a hitman.

738
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:25,020
But I stay with you

739
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:28,800
because I love who you are.

740
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:35,390
I know for sure that you’re the one I want.

741
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,180
There’s no need to be afraid.

742
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:05,220
You and I will be fine.

743
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:08,400
Everything will turn out alright.

744
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,660
Knowing how much you care about me

745
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:17,530
makes me certain

746
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:20,210
that I didn’t choose the wrong man.

747
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,780
You deserve love just like anyone.

748
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,310
We’re not your children.

749
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,090
You’re not my mother!

750
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,760
You two take this car and drive to the border.

751
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:40,690
Halt!

752
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,750
Can I ask you something, Cap?

753
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:49,820
Why not just get married?

754
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:51,130
I’m asking you to marry me.

755
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:52,300
So will you?

756
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:54,760
Let’s be happy today.

757
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,780
Too bad I didn’t see this side of yours from the get-go.

758
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,230
Ever since I met you,

759
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,990
all I want to do is keep living just so I get to be with you longer.
