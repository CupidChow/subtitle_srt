Can I call you "My Babe"? Because my whole heart I dedicate to you

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,248
Whenever I turn, I see you

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,024
Because you are the answer

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,296
And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else…

Whenever I turn, I see you

13

Because you are the answer

14
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:53,632
And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else, except for you

15
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:57,576
Can I call you "My Babe"? Love, love, love

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,992
Can I call you "My Babe"? Love, love, love

"Doctor's Mine"
(Episode 4)

20
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,328
Be careful, it's sharp!

21
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,960
Ready? Action!

22
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,000
Look at that! It's Romeo,

23
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,664
the coward of the Montagues.

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,480
And there's Tybalt, the scum of the Capulets!

25
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,808
You're so mouthy, Romeo! Then die here!

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,448
Ahhhh!

27
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:25,936
Hey!

28
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,752
Hey Per.

29
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:27,952
Hey Per, I'm sorry!

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,592
Ah!

31
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,712
Are you badly hurt?

32
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,416
Looks like you'll need stitches.

33
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,288
Do I need to stitch?

34
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,632
I'm scared of needles.

35
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,216
What the fuck did you scared of needles?

36
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,016
Hey guys! Help me take him to the hospital.

37
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:46,784
Let's go,

38
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,456
we can check it out later.

39
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,744
Mild, what's up?

40
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,776
Wait a moment.

41
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,448
Give me your hand.

42
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,784
Why didn't you say anything when you're hurt?

43
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,944
I wasn't aware., I saw Per was hurt more so I was shocked.

44
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,056
You should worry about yourself too.

45
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:15,540
Are you mad at me?

46
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:20,944
No.

47
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,072
Are you mad at me? Hmm?

48
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,656
I'm not mad.

49
00:04:54,384 --> 00:04:55,600
I just don't like it.

50
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,768
If you can't even take care of yourself,
how can you take care of anyone else?

51
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,184
It has happened once before, when P'Mud punched you.

52
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,560
Mild, I'm sorry.

53
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,312
You don't need to apologize to me.

54
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,664
If you really like me.

55
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,640
You need to take good care of yourself.

56
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,864
Can you promise me?

57
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,040
I promise.

58
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,008
Thank you for caring.

59
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,080
Good that you realize it.

60
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,752
Ahhh!!

61
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:36,750
Hey! Does it hurt?

62
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,256
Bear with it.

63
00:06:38,304 --> 00:06:39,776
Because you're heavy-handed.

64
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,312
I'm the person with the lightest hand in my class.

65
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,544
How's lighted? Look, it hurts so much.

66
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,944
Does it hurt anywhere else? Patient Per.

67
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,568
It hurts here too. Can you blow on it for me?

68
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,128
Too much, turn away.

69
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,736
Don't let the wound get wet for 2 days.

70
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:18,224
Two days? It's going to stink, then!!

71
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,168
Patient Per, you can just sponge yourself down!

72
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,040
I don't know how. Can you take care of me?

73
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,768
Oh, no one would believe it!

74
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,360
Just pretend to believe me, okay?

75
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:37,112
I beg you now.

76
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,968
Please, please.

77
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,448
Sponge me down please.

78
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,384
Alright! Just for two days, okay?

79
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,072
You're too cute.

80
00:07:57,328 --> 00:07:58,304
Hey Klah!

81
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,672
Hey Klah!

82
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:05,784
Do you wanna play like this? Okay!!

83
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,216
Are you gonna turn around and talk nicely,
or do you want to die with a broken neck?

84
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,928
You ass! Let me go!

85
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,584
What do you want?!

86
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,312
You should apologize to me.

87
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,600
I don't want to be mad at you for long.

88
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,200
What did I do wrong?

89
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:25,980
You said that P'Pat can't be trusted.

90
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:28,860
I didn't say she can't be trusted.

91
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,432
I just told you not to tell our story to other people.

92
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,984
That "Other people" is my girlfriend!

93
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,712
You're biased.

94
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,960
I'm not biased. I'm the one who sees clearly.

95
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,712
It's just you who's blind.

96
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,240
She's my girlfriend, Klah. Be careful what you say.

97
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,312
Yeah, I'm sorry.

98
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,144
That's all.

99
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,712
I'm sorry too.

100
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,456
Being mad at you is exhausting, seriously.

101
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,608
Then don't fight, dude.

102
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,504
Yeah.

103
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:09,600
For P'Pat You shouldn't be so biased against.

104
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,488
That's just how she is.

105
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:13,968
Okay.

106
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:23,340
Oh, where's Mild?

107
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He went to see his boyfriend.

108
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,168
Boyfriend?

109
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,056
Ahh.

110
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,968
Oh, Mild! Are you here to see Knight?

111
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,176
Uh nothing, actually...

112
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:12,336
Come on, The Engineering faculty is like a second home
for engineering students' boyfriends.

113
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:13,824
No need to be shy.

114
00:10:13,856 --> 00:10:15,000
He's not my boyfriend.

115
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:16,840
I don't believe.

116
00:10:16,856 --> 00:10:18,840
Mild, do you come to see me?

117
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,016
What kind of tone is that?

118
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:24,832
With us, he chases us away like pigs and dogs!

119
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,424
Doctor, He only talks to you in that tone.

120
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,968
You guys talk too much. Go away!

121
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,600
Damn it, I'm annoyed.

122
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,784
You come to see me, is everything okay?

123
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,064
How's your wound?

124
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,744
What are you smiling about?

125
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:56,888
I'm glad to see you worried about me too.

126
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,520
I just came to see my patient, that's all.

127
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,816
Wow! You're almost recovered!

128
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,992
Just a few more days of applying the medicine and you'll be fine.

129
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,336
I guess I got good medicine then.

130
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Okay then, I'm leaving now.

131
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:18,136
Come on, I'll walk you out.

132
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:20,936
Hey, no need.

133
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,288
I have to read for my exam tomorrow.

134
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,080
So what about tomorrow?

135
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,512
I have to read tomorrow too.

136
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,408
Oh... so we won't get to see each other much then?

137
00:11:35,288 --> 00:11:37,290
Hmm... probably yes.

138
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,856
Oh... don't make it seem like the end of the world!

139
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,752
I'm just taking my final exams, it's okay.

140
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,552
I can wait.

141
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,808
Hey Kan!

142
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,776
What's up, guys?

143
00:12:28,184 --> 00:12:30,568
Uh, wanna go for lunch?

144
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,176
I... I'd rather not.

145
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,032
I'll stay and keep studying.

146
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,000
Ah.

147
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:44,030
I'm planning to stay and study too.

148
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,112
Can you buy some for us?

149
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,624
Alright then.

150
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:55,936
Then we'll have Pad Krapow as usual.

151
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,216
Okay, I'm leaving then.

152
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,064
What's up, Great?

153
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,072
Can I talk to you?

154
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,224
I think you probably know how Nat feels about you.

155
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,160
Great, just say what you need to say.

156
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,880
What do you think about Natcha?

157
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,360
Natcha is my friend.

158
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,168
Then would you be willing to give her a chance
to be more than a friend?

159
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,968
I don't want to lose a friend.

160
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,392
I don't have many friends.

161
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,952
Did a star of faculty like you have few friends?

162
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,936
Great, but I only have you guys as true friends.

163
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,808
But I think you have to keep your distance for now.

164
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,232
It's my fault for not stopping her at all.

165
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,784
She wants to try just one more time.

166
00:14:21,952 --> 00:14:26,848
But every reaction you give her seems to give her hope.

167
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,992
But I didn't intend for it to be like that, you know.

168
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:36,952
I know, but she can't control her feelings.

169
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,280
Just give her time.

170
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:42,272
Okay.

171
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,416
So, what's going on between you and N'Per?

172
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,984
Nothing.

173
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,176
Don't hold back, I can see you like him.

174
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:03,736
Yeah, good that you know.

175
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,464
By the way, are you going out with him tonight?

176
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,272
How did you know?

177
00:15:12,424 --> 00:15:14,420
I have many sources.

178
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,528
Hey You..

179
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,256
Go, Let's go to eat.

180
00:15:19,688 --> 00:15:20,456
Let's go.

181
00:15:43,848 --> 00:15:47,128
You treat me like I'm disabled. It's just my arm that hurts.

182
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,328
Hey, don't look down on disabled people!

183
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,584
They can take care of themselves better than you.

184
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:55,784
Sorry.

185
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,288
And didn't you say that you couldn't do it?

186
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,976
I was actually seduced with you.

187
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,592
Since you're all better now,
I probably don't need to wipe you down anymore, huh?

188
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,264
It's only temporary, It'll flare up again tonight.

189
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,536
What are you talking about?

190
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,256
Enjoy your meal.

191
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,416
Thanks.

192
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,792
Then can I have a reward...

193
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,840
as a special service from Dr. Kan tonight?

194
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:57,232
That depends on whether patient Per behaves himself.

195
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,848
I can't take this anymore.

196
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,240
I'm going to get some coffee.

197
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Hey. Uh... I'll go too.

198
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,416
Do you want anything?

199
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,080
I'll be right back.

200
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,648
So tired.

201
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,240
Hey, P'Knight!!

202
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,328
How'd you get here?

203
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,128
I came to see you.

204
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,240
But it's late at night already.

205
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,096
I bought this for you.

206
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,704
Thank you.

207
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,432
What's wrong?

208
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,192
When do you finish your exams?

209
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,720
Uh... on Friday.

210
00:18:46,304 --> 00:18:47,456
Friday.

211
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,176
So, can I come see you every day until then?

212
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,944
I'm lonely.

213
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,656
I didn't say anything yet.

214
00:19:07,536 --> 00:19:09,224
So, that's you allowed, right?

215
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,496
What is it? Why do you keep staring?

216
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:28,650
May I hold your hand?

217
00:19:42,408 --> 00:19:43,728
Is that P'Knight?

218
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:47,056
Oh, Holy shit! My stuff is on the table.

219
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,176
Wait!

220
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,168
Don't interrupt them!

221
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,096
Yeah, Go go!

222
00:19:56,136 --> 00:19:57,088
Klah, nooo!

223
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:57,800
Just go.

224
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:16,824
Doctor.

225
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,328
What?

226
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,224
I want to eat some popcorn.

227
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,112
Um.

228
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,720
Let me go.

229
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,640
Just use your other hand.

230
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,392
You're holding my right hand, I'm not familiar with it.

231
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,104
Then give me your left hand.

232
00:22:15,696 --> 00:22:16,744
Wait!

233
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,120
Why?

234
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,784
Let me treat your wound first!

235
00:22:21,584 --> 00:22:24,304
Never mind, this is more important.

236
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,480
If you don't do it, then don't.

237
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,856
Fine, treat the wound then.

238
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,664
You know exactly where I keep it.

239
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,320
My memory's good.

240
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,960
I didn't think you'd actually do this for me.

241
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,320
I don't like breaking my word.

242
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:06,808
That's exactly why I like you.

243
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,416
And do you like me?

244
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:20,280
What do you think?

245
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,504
I think...

246
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,960
you like me.

247
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,640
But I like you even more than you thought.

248
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,960
Why are you messing with my hair?

249
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,424
Is the little cat awake?

250
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,960
What the hell cat?!

251
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,528
You're just so cute.

252
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,952
Are you still groggy from sleep?

253
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,128
I'm drunk on my love for you.

254
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,096
Can I have a morning kiss to wake you up?

255
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,048
I let you do it and you're too much now.

256
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,944
And do you like it?

257
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,824
Who's the one that actually likes it?

258
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,088
Don't play around, or you'll get hurt like yesterday.

259
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,288
Who's afraid?

260
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,824
Doctor,

261
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,976
The gear for an engineer is their heart.

262
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,960
Can I leave it with you?

263
00:34:23,368 --> 00:34:24,680
You should take it back.

264
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,408
Why?

265
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,840
It's not that I don't want to accept it.

266
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,368
But give me some time.

267
00:34:41,544 --> 00:34:45,440
When the day comes that you and I truly love each other,

268
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,984
I'll let you be the one to put it on me yourself.

269
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,552
So, it's done then?

270
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,096
Well, obviously!

271
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,568
You're too good!

272
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,952
You gotta tutor me then.

273
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,824
Is that my job?!

274
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,952
Oh, don't just pass by yourself!

275
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,560
Hey guys, remember to collect my corpse!

276
00:35:36,144 --> 00:35:38,952
Yeah, I'll embalm you with formalin.

277
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,344
You ass!

278
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,976
Take it easy, it'll be over soon, just a little more.

279
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,824
Easy for you to say! You've got good morale.

280
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,720
He comes every evening.

281
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:52,736
What are you talking about?

282
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,600
That's it.

283
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:55,160
I barely finished saying it.

284
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,768
Are you done with your exams?

285
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,176
One more day left tomorrow.

286
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,864
You probably won't…

287
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,080
Don't worry about me. I'll finish my exams before you.

288
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:11,128
Didn't Mild tell me to take good care of myself?

289
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,080
Yeah.

290
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,152
Good job.

291
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,392
Why are you patting my head?

292
00:36:23,608 --> 00:36:24,528
There are so many people around.

293
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,960
If you don't like it, just push my hand away then. Huh? See?

294
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,888
Don't be so cute, huh!

295
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,864
Who's cute?

296
00:36:46,088 --> 00:36:48,090
Are you free after your exam tomorrow?

297
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,528
Yeah, I'm free.

298
00:36:54,776 --> 00:36:56,530
Okay, then I'm booking you.

299
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,328
Why?

300
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,984
I'm not telling. I'll pick you up tomorrow.

301
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,720
Study hard for your exam,

302
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,272
and eat some snacks too.

303
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,136
Hey, someone can't stop smiling.

304
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,264
You like him, don't you?

305
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,264
Like him? No way in hell!

306
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,656
Hey Mild, just accept it.

307
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,928
I feel bad for P'Knight, He has to come flirt with you every evening.

308
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,000
Seriously, I'm asking you for real now.

309
00:37:30,352 --> 00:37:32,230
Don't you like him?

310
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:33,640
Why are you so hard to get?

311
00:37:51,424 --> 00:37:52,424
What's up,

312
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,616
Yeah, I've finished the exam, I'm on my way back home now.

313
00:38:00,456 --> 00:38:02,460
See you at home, you don't have to pick me up.

314
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,992
His voice changed just like that!

315
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,056
Dr. Kan, could you please sign these documents?

316
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,960
Sure.

317
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,120
Kan.

318
00:38:24,856 --> 00:38:27,696
Natcha, aren't you off duty today?

319
00:38:29,528 --> 00:38:31,530
I come to see you.

320
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,150
How's it going between you and N'Per lately?

321
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,792
Why do you ask?

322
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,728
I see you going with him often.

323
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:53,720
People keep posting about it on the page, do you even know?

324
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,184
Really?

325
00:38:57,216 --> 00:38:57,976
Umm.

326
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,392
People are gossiping a lot,
they are saying you've already date with N'Per.

327
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,136
I think people here just talk nonsense.

328
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,000
Everyone knows N'Per is a playboy.

329
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,760
They're probably just using you to create some buzz, you just...

330
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:14,510
Natcha,

331
00:39:16,872 --> 00:39:18,510
Per isn't like that!

332
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:24,512
If you don't know Per well enough, don't talk like that.

333
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,088
Why are you getting so angry on his behalf?

334
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,752
I'm just telling the truth.

335
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,152
What did I do wrong?

336
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,208
You're just infatuated with that kid.

337
00:39:42,248 --> 00:39:43,216
Do you want to get cheated on?

338
00:39:43,264 --> 00:39:43,792
Natcha!

339
00:39:43,816 --> 00:39:44,288
Huh!

340
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,776
I'm leaving then.

341
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,368
I like you.

342
00:39:54,888 --> 00:39:56,890
I liked you before that kid,

343
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,152
before Namfah.

344
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,808
I know what you like,

345
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,328
what your flaws are, what your good points are.

346
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:25,456
Can't it be me?

347
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,848
I'm sorry.

348
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:44,336
I think we should take a break for a while.

349
00:40:53,872 --> 00:40:55,870
I still want to be friends with you.

350
00:42:13,744 --> 00:42:16,608
Doctor, your love is here to pick you up.

351
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,080
Who hurt you?

352
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,680
I'm the one who hurt her.

353
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:51,790
I made my friend sad.

354
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,488
I really don't know what to do anymore.

355
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,064
The exams are finished!

356
00:43:43,096 --> 00:43:44,296
Yay!!!

357
00:43:44,328 --> 00:43:45,376
We have to celebrate!

358
00:43:45,408 --> 00:43:45,928
Let's do it.

359
00:43:45,952 --> 00:43:47,808
I'm ready, my outfit's ready.

360
00:43:47,832 --> 00:43:49,888
So, where should we go, Mild?

361
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,120
Yeah, where?

362
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,200
P' Knight.

363
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,584
Oh! Someone's waiting!

364
00:43:59,648 --> 00:44:00,736
Hey, let's go.

365
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:02,072
How's that, then?

366
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,992
Let's go, I guess we'll have to postpone it.

367
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:10,768
Yeah, I think so.

368
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,856
There's only two of us left.

369
00:44:12,888 --> 00:44:14,144
You're done with your exam, right?

370
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:15,744
Yes.

371
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,504
Have you been waiting for a long time?

372
00:44:18,536 --> 00:44:19,928
No, just a moment.

373
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,408
Shall we go now?

374
00:44:22,632 --> 00:44:23,608
Where to go?

375
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,608
Hey P' Knight, please take care of my friend.

376
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,344
Please take care of him.

377
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,424
Good luck, Mild.

378
00:44:31,456 --> 00:44:32,872
Bye-bye!

379
00:44:32,896 --> 00:44:34,256
See you my friend.

380
00:44:58,664 --> 00:45:00,640
So where are we even going?

381
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:01,952
Samoeng.

382
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,480
Hey! Isn't this kidnapping?!

383
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,800
Hey! Consider it a vacation after your exams.

384
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,432
Are you planning to fatten me up and then eat me?

385
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,320
Can I?

386
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,032
Not like that!

387
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:29,712
Can I call you "My Babe"? Because my whole heart I give to you

388
00:46:29,752 --> 00:46:34,784
Can I call you "My Babe"? Because my whole heart I dedicate to you

389
00:46:34,816 --> 00:46:37,256
Whenever I turn, I see you

390
00:46:37,288 --> 00:46:40,024
Because you are the answer

391
00:46:40,056 --> 00:46:43,936
And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else..

392
00:46:43,976 --> 00:46:49,184
Can I call you "My Babe"? Because my whole heart I give to you

393
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:54,040
Can I call you "My Babe"? Because my whole heart I dedicate to you

394
00:46:54,088 --> 00:46:56,696
Whenever I turn, I see you

395
00:46:56,744 --> 00:46:59,488
Because you are the answer

396
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:04,080
And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else, except for you

397
00:47:04,128 --> 00:47:08,656
Can I call you "My Babe"? Love, love, love

398
00:47:08,688 --> 00:47:13,464
Can I call you "My Babe"? Love, love, love

399
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,936
Can I call you "My Babe"? Love, love, love

400
00:47:17,976 --> 00:47:20,448
Can I call you "My Babe"?

401
00:47:23,192 --> 00:47:27,880
Can I call you "My Babe"? Love, love, love

402
00:47:46,528 --> 00:47:48,530
Are you secretly preparing something like this?

403
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:55,984
The stars are beautiful.

404
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:00,600
Yeah, and...

405
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:03,552
Have you ever used a star map?

406
00:48:06,192 --> 00:48:08,190
My dad bought one for me along with a telescope.

407
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:11,512
Wow, that's cool!

408
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:14,504
I've never seen the stars up close.

409
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:19,952
But the person who bought them for me
never came to watch the stars with me, not even once.

410
00:48:20,616 --> 00:48:22,620
I don't even know why I have them.

411
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,416
P'Knight.

412
00:48:29,672 --> 00:48:32,312
Well, here it is. Mild's here to watch with me now.

413
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,936
Okay, if next time you come, just tell me.

414
00:48:42,184 --> 00:48:43,464
I can always come.

415
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,528
But actually, there's another reason I brought you here.

416
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,088
Huh?

417
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:11,648
I've always thought that if I had expressed myself enough in the past.

418
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,360
Mild would have truly believed my words.

419
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:21,184
But this time, I'm going to make it clear.

420
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:03,208
I like you.

421
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,112
I've always liked you.

422
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,112
I've never changed my mind.

423
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,240
Start over with me, okay?

424
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,832
Would you like to try? In my world

425
00:50:53,864 --> 00:50:55,696
Where it's just us, having fun all day

426
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,200
If you dare to step in and compete

427
00:50:57,232 --> 00:50:59,416
I'll shower you with so much love
you won't be able to take it all

428
00:50:59,448 --> 00:51:01,488
If you dare, I'll take care of you

429
00:51:01,528 --> 00:51:03,216
Even if it's hard, I don't care

430
00:51:03,256 --> 00:51:05,136
Just open your heart to a new world

431
00:51:05,168 --> 00:51:06,808
I promise you won't regret it

432
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:09,200
Do you dare? Uh uh oh oh

433
00:51:09,256 --> 00:51:11,544
To walk together

434
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,024
Are you scared? Uh uh oh oh

435
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,640
Will you agree? Uh uh oh oh

436
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,184
To love me every day

437
00:51:19,216 --> 00:51:23,536
Just hold my hand and we'll go together

438
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,800
Uh uh oh oh

439
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,352
Do you dare? Uh uh oh oh, Uh uh oh oh

440
00:51:29,384 --> 00:51:33,456
Do you dare? Uh uh oh oh, Uh uh oh oh

441
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,872
Do you dare? Uh uh oh oh, Uh uh oh oh

442
00:51:40,904 --> 00:51:44,624
Do you dare? Uh uh oh oh, Uh uh oh oh

443
00:51:44,648 --> 00:51:48,528
Do you dare? Uh uh oh oh, Uh uh oh oh
