Can I call you "My Babe"? Because my whole heart I give to you

00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,820
Can I call you "My Babe"? Because my whole heart I dedicate to you

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,250
Whenever I turn, I see you

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,020
Because you are the answer

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,300
And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else…

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,110
Can I call you "My Babe"? Because my whole heart I give to you

Can I call you "My Babe"? Because my whole heart I dedicate to you

Whenever I turn, I see you

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,350
Because you are the answer

14
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:53,630
And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else, except for you

15
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,580
Can I call you "My Babe"? Love, love, love

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,990
Can I call you "My Babe"? Love, love, love

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,980

"Doctor's Mine"
(Episode 5)

20
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,944
I like you.

21
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,712
I've always liked you.

22
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,496
My feelings have never changed.

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,930
Let's start over with me.

24
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,800
Thank you.

25
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,776
What kind of mood are you in?

26
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,656
Just thanking you for giving me a chance.

27
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,776
We've only just started counting to one,
we might not even make it to two.

28
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,952
Oh... Mild, that's too much.

29
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,192
Am I really that bad?

30
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,856
If you do well, then it'll be ok.

31
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,368
But if you don't do well, then I have to say goodbye.

32
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:25,640
It's not that difficult.

33
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,272
Of course... You're above me now.

34
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,384
But just give in to me.

35
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:32,848
Oh!
Oh!

36
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,740
- Are you ticklish?
- P'Knight!

37
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,128
Are you ticklish?

38
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:37,600
P'Knight, Stop it!

39
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,664
P'Knight P'Knight! You're not going to stop,

40
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:41,528
Oh!!

41
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,784
P'Knight! No!

42
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,944
P'Knight!

43
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,016
Come on, that's enough!

44
00:03:49,048 --> 00:03:50,912
Are you giving up yet? Are you giving up yet?

45
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,104
That's enough, no more.

46
00:03:55,144 --> 00:03:58,184
Come on, come on!

47
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:01,864
That's enough.

48
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,536
You're awake? Want some?

49
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,656
Isn't this too early?

50
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,800
Have you been awake long?

51
00:05:14,832 --> 00:05:16,168
Why didn't I know?

52
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,384
For a while.

53
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,792
Or should I say, I haven't slept yet.

54
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,312
Hey! You still haven't slept?

55
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:28,660
Ahh! I guess I must have been tired.

56
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,432
Oh... I guess I must have been tired.

57
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,192
My bad.

58
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,856
No...

59
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,712
The reason I couldn't sleep was just
that I wanted to look at your face for a long time.

60
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,336
You're a pervert!

61
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:50,910
Did you stare at my face all night?

62
00:05:51,664 --> 00:05:53,660
Are you crazy! Who would do that?

63
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,560
I slept some, woke up some.

64
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,816
That's creepy.

65
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,944
Hey, but I didn't do anything to you.

66
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:04,808
When morning came, I rushed to prepare breakfast for you.

67
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,048
Can I really believe that?

68
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,832
Believe me, if I looked at your face any longer,

69
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,720
I might...
Hey!

70
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,464
Stop it!

71
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,880
Hello?

72
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,104
Hello, P'Mud?

73
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,352
Hello?

74
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,088
Oh...

75
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,336
no signal at all.

76
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,560
It's a dead zone around here.

77
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,456
Can't make calls, no signal.

78
00:06:46,504 --> 00:06:48,864
Does a place like this still exist on Earth?

79
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:57,352
Oh, but why did you choose this place?

80
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,088
Huh?

81
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:05,464
I figured no one would be able to contact you.

82
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,088
You're so scary.

83
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,792
Want some? I'll make it for you.

84
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:23,680
Hmm.

85
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,560
Are you going to eat it yourself
or do you want me to feed you?

86
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,288
I can eat it myself.

87
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,336
Okay.

88
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,808
Here.

89
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,584
Thank you.
Yes.

90
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:17,032
How is it? Good?

91
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,488
Yeah, I feel really good.

92
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,096
I've never been anywhere like this before.

93
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,640
Normally, I'm just in a classroom. Thank you so much, P'Knight!

94
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,536
So, it means I picked the right place, right?

95
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,464
Huh, but it's also a bit scary.

96
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,056
I can't contact anyone.

97
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,152
I thought you were bringing me here to kill me.

98
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:45,620
I just wanted you to relax.

99
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:48,620
Seeing you smile makes me happy.

100
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,232
Because your happiness is my happiness.

101
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:59,016
I'm really happy!

102
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,128
Thank you so much, P'Knight!

103
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,032
Hey, what are you eating? That looks delicious as hell!

104
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,008
Oh...

105
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,680
so you're not even going to let me try some?

106
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,976
Hey... are you going to move that much and you fall off your chair?

107
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,848
Yeah, I'm just kidding around.

108
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,056
Just in case you get a girlfriend and forget about me.

109
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,224
Nonsense.

110
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,224
I'll always be the same with you.

111
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:24,824
Are you serious?

112
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:43,980
Hey, get out! I'm hot.

113
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,160
Hey, what's wrong with you, Tum!

114
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,304
I'm going to eat.

115
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,944
- Tum! You ass!
- Hmmm.

116
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,800
My egg!

117
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,952
Do you know how hard it was for me to queue up and buy this?

118
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,096
Oh, I'll buy you a new one.

119
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,960
But seriously... This is really delicious!

120
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,024
You're still not realized yet,

121
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,952
but I can remember what you said about buying me a new one.

122
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,888
Yeah, I'll really buy you a new one.

123
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,312
If you don't buy me a new one, I hope you turn into a dog.

124
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,792
I'll tease you until your kids become monks!

125
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:35,030
Uh, Yesss, okay.

126
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,608
Damn, I didn't even get to eat any.

127
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,680
Hurry up and eat so we can go to class.

128
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:53,024
Tum, It's mine.

129
00:11:53,064 --> 00:11:55,020
Hey, you have your own!

130
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,552
I don't mind.

131
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,168
Hm, yours is good too.

132
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,888
You don't eat vegetables anyway.

133
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,312
How did you know?

134
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,672
That's why I didn't bring any vegetables.

135
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,680
Hmm, eat some or you'll get hungry.

136
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,960
Um, keep it to eat, haven't you eaten yet?

137
00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:30,770
No, just keep it to eat.

138
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:31,976
Um.

139
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,512
Okay.

140
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,968
See you this evening, then.

141
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,856
I'm leaving now!

142
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,520
Bye!

143
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,536
Come here!

144
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,984
Where did you take my brother to?

145
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,360
Mild and I are dating, Mud.

146
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:19,984
Huh!?

147
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,344
Mild and I are dating.

148
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,232
Mud, let me take care of your brother.

149
00:13:28,536 --> 00:13:30,296
What the hell are you talking about?!

150
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,840
What?! My brother's gone and I can't reach him!

151
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:35,232
You're so damn bad!

152
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,624
You're going to take care of my brother?

153
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,864
Then why did you do that, huh?!

154
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,160
I told you that I really like your brother.

155
00:13:43,216 --> 00:13:46,152
You don't even have the right to say that, you ass!

156
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,960
If you won't listen, then don't listen, damn!

157
00:13:57,616 --> 00:13:59,000
You act like you're confident,

158
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,728
I'm telling you that soft-boiled egg,
the queue line to buy was so long.

159
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,192
I'll be waiting to see someone here howl.

160
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:12,088
If I howl, you'll howl with me!

161
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:14,144
Hey... I'm not involved?

162
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,688
Oh, so you don't really love me?

163
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:19,464
Bark bark bark bark!

164
00:14:19,504 --> 00:14:20,736
Damn it!

165
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,816
Hey! Go check it out!

166
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:27,968
P' Mud!
Hey, calm down first.

167
00:14:28,928 --> 00:14:29,968
P' Mud, calm down. Calm down.

168
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:30,704
Let me go!

169
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,264
Hey Klah,

170
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,008
are you okay?!

171
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,224
My nose...

172
00:14:42,232 --> 00:14:43,144
Dammmm!

173
00:14:57,424 --> 00:14:59,420
You wouldn't let him go when he told you to,

174
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,304
now you got it.

175
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,952
Look, it's all blood.

176
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,048
Hey,

177
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,704
what's wrong, Klah?

178
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:17,928
Your brother, just hit him.

179
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,328
Huh? What happened?

180
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:23,136
I don't know neither.

181
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,456
But I feel like there's something
they both know just between them.

182
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,616
Why do you think that?

183
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:32,620
Because they have some unresolved issues.

184
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,848
Something that's really... not okay between them.

185
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,152
Oh,

186
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,280
Mild!

187
00:15:42,344 --> 00:15:45,272
Only you can find out what it is!

188
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,976
Hey, no way.

189
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,360
I'd rather him feel okay and telling me himself.

190
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:56,672
Hey, otherwise, either your brother or your boyfriend
is going to end up dead, seriously.

191
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,368
Yeah, it might not be anything serious.

192
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,528
But if you know, it might help to fix it.

193
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,312
Think about it.

194
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,488
But I'm hurt.

195
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,544
Take it all.

196
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,528
Uh, Doctor, I...

197
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,530
It's okay, just a little bit.

198
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,488
Don't be afraid.

199
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,448
It's done.

200
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,752
Are you worried?

201
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,544
I got a stick jabbed in my butt..,

202
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:07,224
I wasn't careful and accidentally sat on it.

203
00:17:07,256 --> 00:17:09,680
So... I'm a bit worried.

204
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,624
Are you here for an HIV test, right?

205
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,792
How did you know, Doctor?

206
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,328
Is there anything you'd like to tell me?

207
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,176
I...

208
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,328
I accidentally had sex for the first time with an male senior.

209
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,056
And he was very violence.

210
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,352
So... I'm scared.

211
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,680
It's okay. I'll examine you,

212
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,456
and we'll do a blood test today,
then you can come back for the results.

213
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,552
For today, I'll give you a one-month course of
PEP (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis) antiretroviral medication.

214
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,912
Am I not overthinking, right?

215
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,488
I'm just really worried, so I wanted to get checked.

216
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,312
That's good you came to get checked out.
There's no need to be ashamed.

217
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,936
At first, I was really stressed and scared,
I didn't dare talk to anyone about it.

218
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,664
But... after talking to you, Doctor, I feel much better.

219
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,736
You can tell me anything, I'm happy to listen.

220
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,088
Talking to you made me feel a lot better.

221
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,760
This morning, after you dropped me off,
did you make it to class on time?

222
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:42,376
Oh! I'm Chill.

223
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,664
Really?

224
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,280
So are you fight with P'Mud again?

225
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:01,968
P'Knight, is there anything you want to tell me about you and P'Mud?

226
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,200
What exactly is going on with you two?

227
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,024
Why does it never end?

228
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,712
It's hard to end it, Mild.

229
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,944
It's something I need to sort out myself.

230
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,424
I just need you to keep supporting me like this, that's all.

231
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,872
So what?

232
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,080
Are you going to apologize for disappearing and being unreachable?

233
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,496
Do you even know how worried our family was?

234
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,216
Yeah I'm sorry, but I'm an adult now, not a kid anymore.

235
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,664
Exactly because you're an adult!

236
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:24,780
You should have left a message to me.

237
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,512
Oh, what about when you disappeared with a girl?

238
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:30,800
I haven't said anything yet.

239
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,304
Hey you!!

240
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,656
But anyway, you and P'Knight don't have to fight?

241
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,944
I already told you, Don't get involved with him!

242
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,376
You just keep saying "don't get involved, don't get involved."

243
00:20:46,424 --> 00:20:48,592
So what's the problem between you two?

244
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:50,590
Why won't you tell me so I know?

245
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,576
You don't need to know.

246
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,416
I'm your brother, just trust me.

247
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,336
So you want me to just believe you like this?

248
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,936
Hey! You're my older brother, you should be more reasonable!

249
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:14,670
What's so hard about just telling me?

250
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,880
Oh, did you fail again?

251
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,856
I think it must be about you, Mild.

252
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,536
I'm gonna need you guys' help.

253
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,576
Can I call you My Babe? Because my whole heart I give to you

254
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,720
Can I call you My Babe? Because my whole heart I dedicate to you

255
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,136
Whenever I turn, I see you

256
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,880
Because you are the answer

257
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:13,096
And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else, except for you

258
00:22:13,128 --> 00:22:17,968
Can I call you My Babe? Because my whole heart I give to you

259
00:22:18,008 --> 00:22:22,944
Can I call you My Babe? Because my whole heart I dedicate to you

260
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,496
Whenever I turn, I see you

261
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,288
Because you are the answer

262
00:22:28,312 --> 00:22:32,920
And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else, except for you

263
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,128
Can I call you My Babe? Love Love Love

264
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:42,344
Can I call you My Babe? Love Love Love

265
00:22:42,368 --> 00:22:46,872
Can I call you My Babe? Love Love Love

266
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:49,456
Can I call you My Babe?

267
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,256
Can I call you My Babe? Love Love Love

268
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:57,160
Is it delicious?

269
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,592
- Can I call you My Babe? Love Love Love
- Yes, delicious.

270
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,408
It looks good on you, actually.

271
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,648
Per, Even if we buy it, I won't wear it anyway.

272
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,880
You would wear for sure,

273
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,184
Here, a couple hats!

274
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,776
Let's take a photo first.

275
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,712
No, Per! No! No way!

276
00:23:33,752 --> 00:23:35,112
Per! No!

277
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,392
You might not like it, but I do.

278
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:40,616
Per, stop!

279
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,888
How did we end up at a market anyway?

280
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,728
We met at a pub and now we're at a market?

281
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:55,416
But it often ends up elsewhere too.

282
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,408
Damn it, Per!

283
00:24:05,968 --> 00:24:10,280
Hey, Per, today I met a patient.

284
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,504
He was so pitiful, he got bullied by his seniors.

285
00:24:14,528 --> 00:24:15,624
Wait!

286
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,968
You saying that doesn't mean you like him, right?

287
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:22,632
No way, I'm possessive!

288
00:24:22,688 --> 00:24:25,056
Oh, Per! Are you crazy?

289
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,664
I genuinely feel pity for him!

290
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,680
You can't even feel pity for anyone else.

291
00:24:29,728 --> 00:24:32,832
You can only feel sorry for me..

292
00:24:32,864 --> 00:24:37,384
And I definitely won't make you sad.

293
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:40,696
Per, I'm embarrassed!

294
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,808
You won't regret it, but you will lose...

295
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:51,152
Per! Per, stop it! Just take mine to wear.

296
00:24:52,936 --> 00:24:54,520
It looks cute.

297
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,976
Did you see? Look!

298
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,544
Per! I'm embarrassed!

299
00:24:58,576 --> 00:25:01,384
Why would you be embarrassed?
No one's looking at us anyway.

300
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,496
Here...

301
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,472
Ahh, the traffic is terrible, I can't take it anymore!

302
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,936
What did you buy so much, Per?

303
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,976
You can pick whatever you like.

304
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,696
Then why did you buy so much?

305
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,856
My mom gave them to me.

306
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,416
Your mom really takes good care of you.

307
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,600
Too much, She likes to bring me this
and that until the house is full.

308
00:25:42,632 --> 00:25:44,992
Sometimes it just piles up in the fridge until it expires.

309
00:25:45,024 --> 00:25:46,592
Then I have to throw away what's expired.

310
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,120
Hey Per, I want to play this!

311
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,392
Wanna play?

312
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,176
Sure! I'm super pro at this.

313
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,184
Damn!

314
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,320
Hey, which dog said super pro?

315
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,152
It was Per the dog,

316
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,150
The dog really wanted it too.

317
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,464
Hey!

318
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,824
Are you in heat lately?

319
00:27:05,504 --> 00:27:07,500
I'm just so damn addicted to you.

320
00:27:08,776 --> 00:27:09,960
My ass!

321
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,584
And what if I say I'm so damn addicted to you,
will you accept me?

322
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,952
Why should I accept you?

323
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,456
For you, what am I?

324
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:31,984
Brother, a friend, a boyfriend,

325
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,648
or just a one-night stand?

326
00:27:56,792 --> 00:27:58,136
I don't know.

327
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,950
If I find out, I'll tell you.

328
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,720
Then I'll prove it to you,

329
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,688
that you have to be my boyfriend.

330
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:20,208
I'll be waiting to see if you get that "boyfriend" status.

331
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,400
You're really challenging me.

332
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,400
The person next to Khun Per is Khun Kan.

333
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,328
He's a 6th-year extern doctor
who recently broke up with his girlfriend.

334
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,376
A woman or a man?

335
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,584
She's a woman.

336
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,944
She was caught secretly dating another man, which led to their breakup.

337
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:51,704
There are many posts and comments online saying that they are a couple.

338
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:57,960
And it seems that Khun Per is the one trying to pursue Khun Kan.

339
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,200
Will it work, Klah?

340
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,168
It has to work, even if it doesn't.

341
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,672
Is there any other way?

342
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,880
But I have to pretend to call P'Mud and P'Knight's high school friends.

343
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,200
Also, to hold a party in my house.

344
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,992
Does my house might get wrecked before anything even happens?

345
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,952
It's not that hard.

346
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,440
Oh! Do I really have to do this?

347
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,104
Come on.

348
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,256
Where is it?

349
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,336
Here.

350
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,016
Hello.

351
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:35,136
Hi, is this P'Yiwa, P'Mud's friend?

352
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,624
Oh yes, Who is this?

353
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,080
Oh, I'm Mild. Mud's younger brother.

354
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:45,272
Oh, Mild! Has Mud died?

355
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:47,328
Which temple is the funeral at? Send me the location.

356
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,848
No, not at all...

357
00:31:49,872 --> 00:31:54,624
P'Mud is actually having a party on Friday. He wanted to invite you.

358
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:00,360
Hey Mud! Been gone for so long,
and then he sends his brother to invite me to drink.

359
00:32:00,392 --> 00:32:02,260
When I see him, I'm going to punch him.

360
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,128
So... Can you come to the party?

361
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,760
I can go. Same house, right?

362
00:32:08,808 --> 00:32:11,128
And I need to go, uh... I...

363
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,296
Hey Mild, Let's eat.

364
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,696
Just a moment.

365
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,360
Okay, Friday at 4 PM at P' Mud's house.

366
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,700
Oh, Nong Mild, Nong...

367
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,256
Hey Mild, Let's eat! I'm hungry! Hurry!

368
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:32,888
Come down now!

369
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,600
Yeah, I know. Just a moment.

370
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,520
Damn P' Mud!

371
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,272
What's wrong with you, huh?

372
00:33:02,312 --> 00:33:04,528
Why can't you stay still? Got hemorrhoids?

373
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:09,432
No, my legs just hurt. I was standing for too long today.

374
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,136
You're acting suspicious.

375
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,264
Nothing.

376
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:18,680
It's clear. Just tell me what's going on.

377
00:33:18,712 --> 00:33:20,416
I noticed it since you rushed down here.

378
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:24,808
Oh, I've been studying so hard lately,

379
00:33:24,848 --> 00:33:26,810
and then there's the stage plays rehearsing too.

380
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:29,340
I'm exhausted every day.

381
00:33:29,664 --> 00:33:31,660
Well, you brought it on yourself.

382
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:36,344
Oh Look, my muscles are so weak.

383
00:33:36,368 --> 00:33:38,340
I just dropped my phone when I picked it up.

384
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,984
What are you so weak?

385
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,320
Alright, Let me hear what my little brother has to say.

386
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,288
How about this, should we have a party at home?

387
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,760
I really want to relax.

388
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,704
Oh, I thought it was something serious. Yeah, sure!

389
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,328
Then I'll invite Tum and Klah.

390
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,080
Sure.

391
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,128
Your high school friends.

392
00:34:03,152 --> 00:34:04,312
Even better.

393
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:05,128
And also P'Knight.

394
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,584
Sure, No way, that's crazy!

395
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,960
Why would you get involved with that jerk?

396
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,048
I told you to stay away from him.

397
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,440
But you and P'Knight are friends.

398
00:34:16,464 --> 00:34:20,416
I just want that fun and lots of people kind of vibe,

399
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,540
Come on,

400
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,096
just one night, please?

401
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:31,832
Or do you want me to go party outside
with P'Knight just the two of us?

402
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,912
Stop! We'll have a party here. Is that okay?

403
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,640
Deal.
Deal.

404
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,680
Hey, Mild! I'm here.

405
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:07,730
Hi, friends!

406
00:35:07,768 --> 00:35:08,416
Hey, what did you buy?
We bought a lot of snacks!

407
00:35:09,432 --> 00:35:11,392
Here Oh, Hi P'Mud!

408
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,672
Hi, bro! Hi!

409
00:35:13,688 --> 00:35:14,696
This is in case we watch a movie.

410
00:35:14,736 --> 00:35:17,552
Okay! Wow, popcorn! Oh, perfect!

411
00:35:17,568 --> 00:35:18,472
Peanuts, peanuts!

412
00:35:18,504 --> 00:35:20,392
I have peanuts too.

413
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,688
This is for watching movies.

414
00:35:23,728 --> 00:35:25,968
Wow! That's a lot!

415
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,376
Well, you picked it up. What'd you get?

416
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:30,192
Why is there so much?

417
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:31,264
I guess it's a plate.

418
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,448
Really?

419
00:35:32,784 --> 00:35:33,632
Mild.

420
00:35:34,464 --> 00:35:35,768
Hi, P'Knight.

421
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,848
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

422
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,944
Hey, What's up!

423
00:36:24,544 --> 00:36:25,128
Hi.

424
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,448
Wow! Everyone's here!

425
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,160
Get out, I wanna sit here.

426
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:32,120
I thought you're dead! You don't reply to my LINE messages.

427
00:36:32,152 --> 00:36:34,320
You even let your brother call to invite me?
What's wrong with you?

428
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,408
Hey, calm down. Don't ask all at once.

429
00:36:36,456 --> 00:36:37,744
I can't answer that fast.

430
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,296
Hey, is that P'Yihwa and P'Por?

431
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,620
Yeah, it is.

432
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,616
Oh, the legendary couple!

433
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,496
So you can't avoid it for sure.

434
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:52,744
What do I have to avoid?

435
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:57,800
Well, P'Yihwa's an engineering student, and P'Por's a doctor.

436
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,712
Um.

437
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,576
You definitely can't avoid it.

438
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,064
Nonsense, you ass!

439
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:04,728
Engineering students are meant to be with doctors!

440
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,000
But I totally forgot about that.

441
00:37:13,456 --> 00:37:16,616
By the way, my house used to have parties often.

442
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,424
This is their house, not yours.

443
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,488
Oh, my friend's house is like my own!

444
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,264
Yeah.
A friend's stuff is like our own.

445
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,680
This was smooth.

446
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,536
Your brother's gang seems really close.

447
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,088
Yeah, they used to be like this.

448
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,944
But I don't know why my brother and P'Knight are like this now.

449
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,808
I don't know too.

450
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,368
You'll definitely find out soon. Tonight.

451
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,728
Hello everyone!

452
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:53,536
Keep an eye on him.

453
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,848
Have you all eaten anything yet?

454
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,968
What will we eat? Do we have food?

455
00:37:56,992 --> 00:37:57,960
Would you like anything to drink?

456
00:37:58,008 --> 00:37:59,672
I'll just take this bottle.

457
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,528
- Are you sure?
- I'm so thirsty.

458
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,672
Okay, then, go get 3 bottles.

459
00:38:04,688 --> 00:38:05,256
3 bottles?
Just like this one.

460
00:38:05,864 --> 00:38:06,720
- The same kind.
- 4 for sure.
Give me 4 too!

461
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:07,952
Yeah.
Want some?

462
00:38:08,368 --> 00:38:09,064
Sure.

463
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,240
He served.

464
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,832
Let's drink!!

465
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,216
Hey, spin again.

466
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,520
I got you!

467
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,992
In Som Sri class, you didn't wear underwear to school, right?

468
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,896
Shit! How did you know that?

469
00:39:01,936 --> 00:39:04,512
Hey, I saw it, I saw it! He forgot to zip up!

470
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:06,152
The girls saw it and got shy and ran away.

471
00:39:06,408 --> 00:39:08,088
They aren't shy, they're disgusting!

472
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:12,880
At that time, I went to the restroom
and the tissue was out, so I had to use it to wipe.

473
00:39:12,944 --> 00:39:14,416
Besides, it also helps with ventilation.

474
00:39:15,568 --> 00:39:17,240
That's disgusting.

475
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:19,696
Dr. Por, but the tissue was gone.

476
00:39:19,752 --> 00:39:20,968
If I just put it on top,

477
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,768
It wouldn't be hygienic, right?

478
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,904
Normally, Yihwa doesn't like to wash underwear.

479
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,944
Hey, you!

480
00:39:27,024 --> 00:39:29,020
It's because Yihwa likes to wear it inside out...

481
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:29,976
Por!

482
00:39:30,016 --> 00:39:32,576
Enough! Just hearing it makes me sick.

483
00:39:32,616 --> 00:39:33,960
Let's clink glasses,

484
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,416
come on, Cheers!

485
00:39:36,456 --> 00:39:37,984
Cheers!

486
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,304
Ah, it's my turn.

487
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,528
I want to ask P'Yihwa...

488
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,936
why aren't P'Mud and P'Knight friends anymore?

489
00:39:58,392 --> 00:40:00,390
Can you tell me? I really want to know.

490
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,448
So…

491
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,544
Don't tell him.

492
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,808
Just tell him!

493
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,248
He definitely can't handle it.

494
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,320
So, this is what happened.

495
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,296
That day, we were out drinking just like today.

496
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,912
Yeah.

497
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:46,790
And Knight excused himself to go to the restroom.

498
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,360
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

499
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,624
Just like that, my friend.

500
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,480
Oh, I can't take it anymore, I'm going to the restroom now.

501
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,248
What's wrong with you?

502
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:05,488
Can't even handle this?

503
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,784
Don't make a mess here.

504
00:41:08,056 --> 00:41:09,992
Go on, up to my room.

505
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,808
Good job my friend.

506
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,784
Let's keep drinking!

507
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:15,656
He's gone. It's your turn now!

508
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,584
Mild, listen to me first.

509
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:11,816
See? Didn't I tell you not to get involved with him?

510
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,168
He's so damn bad!

511
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,944
It's been a long time.

512
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,968
We've never heard the truth from his mouth.

513
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:23,664
Besides, you guys used to be good friends before.

514
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:25,952
Can't you start over?

515
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:36,296
Fine, let's just start here then.

516
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:36,896
Hey!

517
00:43:37,312 --> 00:43:39,370
Calm down! Let's talk first.

518
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:44,488
Mild, trust me.

519
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,816
Mild, trust me.

520
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:09,816
How can you dare to say that?

521
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:12,992
It's obvious you raped my brother.

522
00:44:13,024 --> 00:44:14,248
Hey Mud.

523
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,250
Calm down, calm down first.

524
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:34,952
Can you just listen to him first?
Mild!!

525
00:45:35,424 --> 00:45:35,980
Mud.

526
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,128
Mild, Mild.

527
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,000
Mild, Hold on!

528
00:45:42,016 --> 00:45:42,840
Hey Mild!

529
00:45:44,016 --> 00:45:46,020
Hey Mild! Wait for us!

530
00:46:34,736 --> 00:46:36,592
Would you like to try? In my world

531
00:46:36,616 --> 00:46:38,520
Where it's just us, having fun all day

532
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,296
If you dare to step in and compete

533
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,352
I'll shower you with so much love
you won't be able to take it all

534
00:46:42,392 --> 00:46:44,312
If you dare, I'll take care of you

Even if it's hard, I don't care

Just open your heart to a new world

537

I promise you won't regret it

538
00:46:49,632 --> 00:46:51,944
Do you dare? Uh uh oh oh

539
00:46:51,968 --> 00:46:54,416
To walk together

00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,864
Are you scared? Uh uh oh oh

541
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,448
Will you agree? Uh uh oh oh

542
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,008
To love me every day

543
00:47:02,048 --> 00:47:06,296
Just hold my hand and we'll go together

544
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,336
Do you dare? Uh uh oh oh, Uh uh oh oh

545
