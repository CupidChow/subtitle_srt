Because you are the answer

And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else…

And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else, except for you

15
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,580
Can I call you "My Babe"? Love, love, love

"Doctor's Mine"
(Episode 7)

20
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:17,968
Doc!!

21
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,656
Where will you run away from me?

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,660
I'm busy. I'll going to work.

23
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,800
What's wrong?

24
00:01:32,096 --> 00:01:34,100
I said I'm going to work, Per!!

25
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,744
Doc, wait. Let's talk first.

26
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,976
I want to introduce you to my friends as my boyfriend.

27
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,936
There's no need to do that anymore.

28
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,976
What's wrong with you?

29
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,712
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,312
You don't need to apologize.

31
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,048
This isn't your fault, Per.

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,808
Then why are you like this?

33
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,672
Don't you like me?

34
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,304
Do you know?

35
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,968
Not long ago, someone confessed their feelings to me.

36
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,064
Who?

37
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,776
Do you like them?

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,480
No, I don't.

39
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,208
And I don't ever plan to.

40
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,096
When I rejected her,

41
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,192
it just reinforced that my heart already belongs to someone.

42
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,504
Doc!

43
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,312
I don't want to start over with anyone, Per.

44
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,640
I've always lied to myself like that.

45
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:11,968
But in the end, I can't stop my feelings.

46
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,632
Have you ever had a really good dream and then been woken up?

47
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,720
It's time for you to wake up, Per.

48
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,624
Wait, Doctor!

49
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,368
Doctor Kan!!

50
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,544
Kan, let's talk first.

51
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,952
Doc, I'm hurting.

52
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,152
Come and heal my wounds.

53
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,664
I'm here.

54
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,912
Hey... look at this, it's damn delicious.

55
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:09,860
I'm a real genius.

56
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,928
Alright, I'll let the host open it first.

57
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,616
You eat first.

58
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,176
F*ck! That hurts.

59
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,592
Hey... I'm asking you seriously.

60
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,592
Are you really happy in this kind of relationship?

61
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:41,224
Huh? What are you talking about?

62
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,624
Dude, don't you even realize that
before you started dating her.

63
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,936
You used to smile more often,
You looked so much happier.

64
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,120
I mean... you don't have to believe me,

65
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,912
but even when you were still trying to win her over,
you seemed happier than you are now.

66
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,600
I... I was like that?

67
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,128
Yeah, you were.

68
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,072
Now you look like you're under magic.

69
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:21,288
Are you even dating her
or just some idealized version of her?

70
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,040
Is this relationship making you happy at all?

71
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:27,688
I don't get it.

72
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,096
You ass! You're still dumb.

73
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,464
Does she even match a single thing
you thought she would?

74
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Does she make you genuinely happy?

75
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,680
I'm happy with my life.

76
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:42,480
Happy? My ass! You're happy?

77
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,976
Look at you, you've called her a hundred times
and he still won't pick up.

78
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,464
Ask yourself honestly,

79
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:53,776
are you really happy with what you're doing?

80
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:08,288
Ugh, never mind. Let's eat first.

81
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Maybe eating something will nourish your brain a bit.

82
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,480
But sorry, it's all just sodium.

83
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,624
Sure, I'll eat.

84
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,912
I put a lot of effort into this, you know.

85
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:36,712
Mmm, this is so good!

86
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:47,992
Is it good?

87
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,968
Thanks.

88
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,240
You've had enough. It's my turn.

89
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,192
Have you seen Dr. Kan?

90
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,320
Doc!

91
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:54,700
Can you open the door?

92
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,104
Doc!

93
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,312
Oh! How did you get here?

94
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,424
I think we need to talk this through.

95
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,780
But I'll bringing coffee up for Tum and Klah.

96
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,800
Hello Tonklah, come down and get the coffee.

97
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,560
Mild's not free to bring it up anymore.

98
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:02,968
Hey hey, you're forced my hand!

99
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,392
I'll only listen to the truth,

100
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,960
and then I'm leaving.

101
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,168
Just hearing that makes me happy.

102
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,944
Are you going to talk or not?

103
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,232
If you don't, I'm leaving now.

104
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,448
I'll talk, Mild.

105
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,240
Can you stay with me a little longer?

106
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,040
The first day I met you...

107
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,960
I didn't meet you at your house that day.

108
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,720
What do you mean?

109
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,912
I wasn't drunk because I saw you lying there.

110
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,210
But because it had to be you.

111
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,320
The one who saved my life.

112
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:20,330
The one I've never forgotten.

113
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,032
When I was a kid, I liked to go read at the park.

114
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,616
And there was a child who liked to secretly watch me.

115
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,792
He seemed really shy, but I didn't mind.

116
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:48,480
I didn't want to startle him.

117
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,552
That child was cute.
It felt like I had a friend who was with me.

118
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,024
Until...

119
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,120
Help me!!

120
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,200
Help me!

121
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,880
After that day, I've been looking for you all this time,

122
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,536
but I couldn't find you.

123
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,640
You were looking for me
even though you didn't know who I was?

124
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,416
Yeah.

125
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:06,496
I want you to know that I've never forgotten you.

126
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,512
I never intended to hurt you either.

127
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,624
Please, just listen to me for a bit.

128
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,088
About what happened that day...

129
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,080
Hey, cheers!!!

130
00:17:53,968 --> 00:17:57,272
Let's go all out today, my parents aren't coming back.

131
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,744
Let's do this!

132
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,392
Then I won't hold back anymore.

133
00:18:01,432 --> 00:18:02,984
Just drink it all.

134
00:18:03,008 --> 00:18:05,200
I have plenty more. I have a whole truckload.

135
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,480
Finish it all, finish it all!

136
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,432
Someone didn't cheers just now.

137
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:13,160
And he's quiet too.
What should we do?

138
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:14,344
Don't talk.
How?

139
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:16,488
Shove it in his mouth.

140
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,312
Be careful. I still have to go back home.

141
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,976
What are you talking about, go home?
You can just sleep here.

142
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:25,496
I have plenty of rooms.

143
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,728
Don't be a wimp. Drink it up!

144
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,656
Yeah, just drink it.

145
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,552
You know what happens when I get drunk.

146
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,272
- Bottoms up! Bottoms up!
- Drink it!

147
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:36,048
Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

148
00:18:41,992 --> 00:18:44,936
Hey, I'm gonna go to the rest room quickly.

149
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:45,536
I'll be right back.

150
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,680
Just a little bit more.

151
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,520
Are we friends or not?
I just finished mine.

152
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:53,936
Are we friends or not?

153
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,984
Grab your glass.

154
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:56,552
Let's go!

155
00:18:56,576 --> 00:19:07,384
Bottoms up, bottoms up!

156
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,848
That's my friend!

157
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:12,688
Oh, I can't take it anymore. I'm going to the rest room.

158
00:19:12,728 --> 00:19:15,720
What's wrong with you? You can't even handle this?

159
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,344
Yeah, Don't make a mess down here.

160
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:22,872
Go upstairs to my room. Keng's using the one downstairs.

161
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,000
Go on up. My room is...

162
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:31,280
you walk and turn left, then turn right, then left,

163
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,488
then right again, then left one more time.

164
00:19:34,512 --> 00:19:36,888
Ugh, stop it. I'll find it myself.

165
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,160
Alright, my friend.

166
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,952
Go on, go on. Let's keep drinking!

167
00:19:42,384 --> 00:19:43,528
Your turn.

168
00:19:43,552 --> 00:19:45,336
Oh, it's my turn?

169
00:19:45,376 --> 00:19:45,976
Your turn.
Oh really?

170
00:19:46,688 --> 00:19:48,864
Finish it all, finish it all!

171
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,312
Really finish?

172
00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:52,216
Hey, you have it as a truckload, right?

173
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,776
Left, right,

174
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,352
left,

175
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,672
left.

176
00:21:56,544 --> 00:21:57,440
Take it easy.

177
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,960
What the hell did you do to my brother?

178
00:21:59,992 --> 00:22:01,088
Calm down.

179
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,048
What the hell did you do to my brother, huh?

180
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,912
I didn't do anything. I didn't...

181
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:07,992
- What the hell did you do to my brother?
- I didn't do it.

182
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:09,088
Hey, calm down.

183
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,880
I saw it. You raped my brother.

184
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:18,312
Knight, that's your friend's brother. Why would you do that?

185
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,656
How could you do this to my brother?

186
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,856
I didn't do it.

187
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,208
If you don't believe me. It's up to you.

188
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,296
I'm begging you!

189
00:22:37,432 --> 00:22:39,430
I've told everything.

190
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,272
It was my fault for almost stealing a kiss from Mild that day.

191
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,640
But I swear, I never meant to hurt you.

192
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,448
Since that day, I've never let myself get drunk again.

193
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,336
If you've heard everything and you want to hate me,

194
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,352
then I...

195
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,336
I'm angry.

196
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,656
More than that...

197
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,936
I'm angry that you acted cool for so long and didn't tell me.

198
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,360
I was scared because the image made it look that way.

199
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,952
Stop feeling guilty.

200
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,120
I'm not angry anymore.

201
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,728
How about this, let's change the subject.

202
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:38,912
What about... you and P' Per?

203
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,384
Per?

204
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,744
He's my brother, but we have different mothers.

205
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,640
My mom married into the family later.

206
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:53,696
As you see Per like that, but he's a great older brother.

207
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,456
When I was looking for you, he was always by my side.

208
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,400
He always encouraged me.

209
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:08,656
And now, finally, I'm brave enough to confess to Mild today.

210
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,968
Aw! I'm hurting.

211
00:24:15,008 --> 00:24:16,616
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

212
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:19,712
That's all.

213
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,056
Do you know how long you let me be confused?

214
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,872
I couldn't enjoy my food, and I couldn't sleep.

215
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,560
So, I'll get the other 50% left back now, right?

216
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,208
I'll only give you 30.

217
00:24:43,376 --> 00:24:45,380
The other 20 is for my wasted time.

218
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,920
So what do I have to do to get the other 20% back?

219
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:06,632
I'm keeping this kiss and I'm not giving it back to you.

220
00:26:10,952 --> 00:26:12,950
Then I'll just let go of the full 100%.

221
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,336
I should have used this method more often.

222
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,392
What are you doing, Mom? It smells so good.

223
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,320
What brings you to see me today?

224
00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:03,816
Because I miss you, Mom Lek.

225
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,496
You're not going to pester doctors anymore?

226
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,040
Did Knight tell you, Mom?

227
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,224
You've never been like this before.

228
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
I really can't hide anything from you.

229
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:25,180
He broke me up, Mom.

230
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,752
I don't understand. Why did this happen all of a sudden?

231
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,504
Per, have you talked to Mom Yai recently?

232
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,576
Mom?

233
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,552
Mom,

234
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:01,952
Mom.

235
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:13,830
What did you say to Kan?

236
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,968
I did it for your future.

237
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,528
Did you ask me if I wanted it?

238
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,912
I already know what's best for you.

239
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,968
And what is it? What's best for me?

240
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,320
Dating a man makes you look bad.

241
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,912
And you'll lose business opportunities.

242
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,528
Even though it's more open now,

243
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,984
people will still look at you strangely.

244
00:28:42,024 --> 00:28:45,112
I don't care, I just want to be with Kan.

245
00:28:45,144 --> 00:28:46,368
Nonsense, Per.

246
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:51,792
If he really loved you, would he leave you
so easily just because I asked him to?

247
00:28:51,816 --> 00:28:55,488
It's because he loves me, Mom. That's why he had to go.

248
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,712
Because he knows I love you.

249
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:05,440
Per! Per, come back and talk to me right now!

250
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,704
Come back and talk this through! Per!

251
00:29:08,728 --> 00:29:10,376
I told you to come back!

252
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,960
Thank you so much, Mild.

253
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,472
You're so lovely, just as Knight raves about you
every morning and night.

254
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,472
Mom.

255
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,528
Well, it's true!

256
00:29:33,864 --> 00:29:36,000
He's been raving about you since he was a kid.

257
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,992
Actually, I've been encouraging him
to date you for a long time.

258
00:29:40,024 --> 00:29:40,610
Yes.

259
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:44,740
Normally, he doesn't talk much about his day.

260
00:29:44,768 --> 00:29:49,968
Whenever he does, it's always about how cute Mild is.

261
00:29:50,008 --> 00:29:52,192
Mom, that's enough.

262
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:53,840
How was it? I want to hear more!

263
00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:00,200
Well, before, he never used to come home early.

264
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,752
But ever since he reconnected with you.

265
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:06,768
Now he comes home so fast.

266
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:12,280
And when he does, he's so happy... his face just lights up!

267
00:30:12,328 --> 00:30:16,432
Huh? When you're with me, you don't act like this.

268
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:19,232
What do you mean? I compliment you all the time.

269
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,600
You're the one who never lets me.

270
00:30:21,824 --> 00:30:23,168
I'm shy. Just eat.

271
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,464
Oh my, I forgot the dipping sauce.

272
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,424
I'll be right back.

273
00:30:29,448 --> 00:30:31,890
It's okay, Mom. I'll bring it for you.

274
00:30:31,928 --> 00:30:33,152
Just stay here and talk to him.

275
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:41,976
Mild.

276
00:30:42,128 --> 00:30:43,224
Yes, mom.

277
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,808
Please take care of Knight.

278
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,672
Even though he seems quiet.

279
00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:54,448
He's actually very lonely.

280
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:56,824
I feel good knowing he's with you.

281
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,928
Don't worry, mom.

282
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,168
I'll take the best possible care of Knight.

283
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,648
And if Knight bullies you too much...

284
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:09,992
Yes?

285
00:31:10,008 --> 00:31:11,040
You can tell me.

286
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,512
I will! You'll be the first person I tell.

287
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,584
What were you guys talking about? Huh?

288
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,344
It's a secret.

289
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,880
You guys have secrets from me now?

290
00:31:27,032 --> 00:31:27,984
We can't?

291
00:31:28,464 --> 00:31:30,048
Eat, eat, it's here now.

292
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,576
Here you go, son.

293
00:31:31,608 --> 00:31:33,384
These shrimp are delicious.

294
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:35,752
You're changing the subject, mom.

295
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,600
- We're not.
- You are changing the subject.

296
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,704
Here, you want some? I'll serve you some.

297
00:31:38,728 --> 00:31:40,472
His favorite.

298
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,960
Here, I'll serve you some. Here...

299
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,160
Thanks.

300
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,984
And you eat some too, mom, so you can grow up.

301
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,184
I'll serve you some chicken then.

302
00:31:51,216 --> 00:31:52,008
Thank you.

303
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,264
Hello, what's up, Mild?

304
00:32:14,288 --> 00:32:17,328
Hello, P'Kan. How are you?

305
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,160
I'm okay, doing well.

306
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,704
Are you sure? You sound a bit down.

307
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,912
Um, someone wants to talk to you.

308
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,968
Who?

309
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,808
Hello, Dr. Kan. I'm Knight's mother.

310
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,360
Hello. I'm Kan.

311
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,760
You might be wondering why I want to talk to you.

312
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:50,200
I'm really worried about Per.

313
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,984
Per miss you a lot.

314
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,456
And how about you? How have you been?

315
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,720
I'm fine.

316
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,376
You can tell me anything.

317
00:33:03,576 --> 00:33:06,616
Think of me as an elder who cares for you.

318
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,536
I think having me in Per's life...

319
00:33:15,472 --> 00:33:17,470
made him worse.

320
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,000
And there's no way her mother will ever accept me.

321
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:38,864
Hello, mom. Are you here to see Per?

322
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,216
I'm here to see you, Dr. Kan.

323
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,680
Me?

324
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,088
Yes.

325
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,040
Can I talk with you?

326
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:51,040
Yes.

327
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,416
Haven't you seen Per at all lately?

328
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,976
Yes.

329
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:05,304
Honestly, he's my only son,

330
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:09,488
And I don't want to see him go down the wrong path.

331
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:16,128
So, please, doctor, get out of my son's life.

332
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,560
He should be with a perfect and suitable woman.

333
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:35,320
If that's all you have to say to me, don't worry.

334
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:43,224
I promise that Per and I are not and will not be dating.

335
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,976
You can rest easy.

336
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,024
And...

337
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:02,264
next time, I have to ask you not to wait for me like this.

338
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,672
It wastes my study time.

339
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,424
Goodbye.

340
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,736
Doc!!

341
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,600
Let's talk for a bit.

342
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,952
Doc, I want to introduce you to my friends as my boyfriend.

343
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,584
It's no longer needed.

344
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,688
What's wrong with you?

345
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,952
You didn't do anything wrong.

346
00:35:42,984 --> 00:35:44,624
Then why are you like this?

347
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,336
Don't you like me?

348
00:35:54,456 --> 00:35:55,640
I understand.

349
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,064
How about this? Dr.Kan would you mind meeting with me?

350
00:35:59,096 --> 00:36:01,400
We can fix any problems together.

351
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,936
Uh, it's okay.

352
00:36:06,608 --> 00:36:08,610
Thank you for your concern,

353
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,056
but I can handle it.

354
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,024
But I think...

355
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,904
Really, thank you.

356
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,456
I'm sorry, but I have to take this call.

357
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,600
I'm so sorry on behalf of P'Kan.

358
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:55,184
That's okay. Sometimes these things can be difficult.

359
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:00,888
Wow... if P'Kan could talk to you,
he'd fall in love just like I did.

360
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:05,128
Oh my... fall in love, really?

361
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,136
If that's the case, Knight will be upset with me.

362
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,728
Just let him be mad then.

363
00:37:12,736 --> 00:37:14,730
I've been annoyed with him for a long time.

364
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,912
If you see Doctor Kan, tell me, okay?

365
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,960
I know what I need to do.

366
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,096
Sure thing.

367
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:34,376
Doctor, which is more huggable, this doll or me?

368
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:37,090
I win by a landslide, right?

369
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,056
What's your mood?

370
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,936
You don't even realize it.

371
00:37:42,984 --> 00:37:45,944
That right now, you're in a terrible state.

372
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,120
That's why you need someone
to take care of you and put you to bed.

373
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,704
Are you Dr. Kan?

374
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,104
You're Knight's mom, right?

375
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:10,688
What a coincidence, I was just looking
for someone to have dinner with.

376
00:38:10,736 --> 00:38:12,120
You're available, right?

377
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,976
Yes.

378
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:18,488
Hello.

379
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,928
Thank you.

380
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,120
What would you like to eat, Dr. Kan?

381
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,312
I'll have the salmon steak and garlic bread.

382
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,472
We'll have that, then.

383
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,368
Alright. May I take the menus.

384
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,520
How are you?

385
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,240
I... I think I'm okay.

386
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,640
I can handle everything in my life.

387
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,072
But why is it that with this one, I just can't...

388
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,400
Listen to me, Dr. Kan.

389
00:38:52,448 --> 00:38:57,824
Sometimes, you don't have to handle everything all by yourself.

390
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:04,624
Per that I know is willing to fight the whole world
just to be with the one he loves.

391
00:39:04,648 --> 00:39:09,976
To be honest, I'm not feeling well about this.

392
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:15,720
Per doesn't smile, laugh, or feel cheerful like he used to.

393
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,944
He also comes home drunk every day.

394
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,920
He says he's been looking for you everywhere,

395
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,240
but he can't find you.

396
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:29,952
Per that I know is a very steady
and committed person when he loves.

397
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:37,288
If I'm with Per and he has to choose
between me and her mother,

398
00:39:38,832 --> 00:39:40,830
How can he be happy?

399
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,728
Listen to me.

400
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,616
Sometimes, it might not be necessary to choose.

401
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:56,984
Yesterday, I saw Per arguing loudly with her mother at home.

402
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,664
He insisted that he would be with Dr. Kan no matter what.

403
00:40:01,688 --> 00:40:04,592
I'm still worried about him.

404
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,760
How about Per?

405
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,728
I think it's better if you go see it by yourself.

406
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,968
Why are you coming here?

407
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:41,216
You weren't home for dinner,
so Mom told me to bring you some food.

408
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,160
Thanks.

409
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,456
You can go now.

410
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:51,976
What's wrong with you?

411
00:40:58,768 --> 00:41:00,770
I think he wants to break up with me.

412
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,936
Wait. You and him don't have any problems.

413
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,256
It's your mom who has the problem.

414
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,512
Then why doesn't he argue with my mom
and tell her we love each other?

415
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,824
Are you crazy? That's your mom.

416
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,632
If he argues with her, you, the one in the middle,
will be the one who ends up hurt the most.

417
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:23,792
You're right.

418
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,760
You're so smart when it comes to my problems.

419
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,968
But when it's about your own, you're so dumb.

420
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,408
Knight, just go back.

421
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,360
Last time, you stayed to comfort me.

422
00:41:35,688 --> 00:41:37,360
Are you going to let me just leave you alone like this?

423
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:40,830
I really can't find him.

424
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,416
Do you remember what you told me?

425
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,504
Just keep trying.

426
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,648
Even if I have to apologize to Mild
for the rest of my life, I have to do it.

427
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,160
If I want to get Mild back.

428
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,192
Yeah.

429
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,904
It's the same this time.
If you think Dr. Kan is the right person.

430
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,840
You have to do it,
even if it takes you your whole life to find him.

431
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,104
You have me. I'll help you.

432
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,640
When did you get so grown up?

433
00:42:19,672 --> 00:42:20,752
Hey... you jerk.

434
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:24,320
I'm not cussing you out because I see you're sad.

435
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,568
Knight.

436
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:26,928
What?

437
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,344
I won't give up.

438
00:42:31,728 --> 00:42:33,672
No matter how long it takes.

439
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,824
I'm going to find him.

440
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,936
That's the spirit!

441
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:44,704
But for now, eat your food first.

442
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,560
You won't have the energy to look for him if you don't eat.

443
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,112
Yeah, thanks.

444
00:42:52,928 --> 00:42:55,632
Sure thing, bro.

445
00:43:10,704 --> 00:43:11,976
Is Mild going out anywhere today?

446
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,728
He's going to watch a movie with his boyfriend.

447
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,160
He still hasn't brought him to meet us.

448
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,952
Hello, Mom and Dad.

449
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:23,824
Hello, Night.

450
00:43:23,848 --> 00:43:24,520
Hey.

451
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,632
We finally meet.

452
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:27,800
Yes.

453
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,480
Have a seat.

454
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:38,336
I know what happened back then.

455
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:40,664
It's good that it was all a misunderstanding.

456
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,392
Yes, Mom.

457
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:47,232
Mild's an adult now. If he chooses someone he loves,

458
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:50,024
we wouldn't think of getting in the way.

459
00:43:50,048 --> 00:43:51,832
But let's take it slow and see how things go first.

460
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:58,112
Yes, I'm happy to prove to you both

461
00:43:58,144 --> 00:44:00,768
How serious I am about Mild.

462
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,864
No matter how long it takes.

463
00:44:04,056 --> 00:44:05,752
Thank you for understanding.

464
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,288
Yes, Mom.

465
00:44:07,336 --> 00:44:10,288
And now is also the time
I'm giving Mild to make his decision.

466
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,072
I'm just waiting for Mild to be ready.

467
00:44:13,104 --> 00:44:16,480
If Mild feels bad or no longer wants to love me,

468
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,696
I'll respect his decision.

469
00:44:18,728 --> 00:44:19,616
I promise.

470
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,912
Good. Make sure you do what you say.

471
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,144
Yes.

472
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,008
What were you two talking about?

473
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,720
It's nothing, dear. Just a casual greeting.

474
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,584
Oh, Dad!! I won't be handsome anymore.

475
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,080
Go on, you'll be late.

476
00:44:41,104 --> 00:44:42,040
Okay.

477
00:44:42,072 --> 00:44:44,160
Take him and go now, Knight.

478
00:44:44,192 --> 00:44:45,888
And don't bring him back too late.

479
00:44:45,928 --> 00:44:46,912
Yes.

480
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:48,304
I'm not a kid anymore, mom.

481
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:51,480
Oh really? I still see you as a 5 year old.

482
00:44:51,528 --> 00:44:55,392
Oh dad, what 5 year old? Mom, look at dad.

483
00:44:55,424 --> 00:44:58,576
That's just how he is. Go ahead, hurry up.

484
00:44:58,616 --> 00:45:00,824
I'm leaving. Goodbye.

485
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:01,848
-Okay
-Bye mom, bye dad.

486
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:13,960
Hey, P' Night.
Yes?

487
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,112
Is there something you're hiding from me?

488
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,784
Nothing.

489
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,440
I was just talking to your parents about you.

490
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,456
Is there anything I need to know?

491
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:31,712
All you need to know is that if you still love me,

492
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,568
There's nothing to worry about.

493
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,360
Okay.

494
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,568
Then I guess there won't be any problems.

495
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:44,776
Let's go.

496
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,088
Please, Kan..

497
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:53,536
Are you just waiting for your NL Step 3 exam results?

498
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,952
You don't have any classes anyway,

499
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:59,040
so please, please come help out at the camp.

500
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:03,560
Oh teacher, but… I...

501
00:46:03,584 --> 00:46:06,864
It's a volunteer camp to help
develop a community up in the mountains, Kan.

502
00:46:06,888 --> 00:46:11,592
We need a 6th-year medical student
to help with health checkups for the villagers.

503
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,544
Oh, okay.

504
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,936
A bus will be waiting to pick you up
at the university on Friday.

505
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:21,952
Okay?

506
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:34,816
What's up? What's she got for you to do now?

507
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:40,120
She wants us to go to a volunteer camp this Friday.

508
00:46:40,128 --> 00:46:41,728
Is it that university camp?

509
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,040
What camp?

510
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,944
The community development volunteer camp.

511
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,720
The one where a bunch of faculties go together.

512
00:46:48,928 --> 00:46:52,272
But... engineering is going too.

513
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:54,912
Really?

514
00:46:58,470 --> 00:46:59,944
Are you sure you'll be okay?

515
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:02,440
Yeah, I'll be fine.

516
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:05,936
We might not even see each other.

517
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,032
Hey, come on.

518
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,976
I think it would be good for you to get a change of environment.

519
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,984
You look stressed out lately.

520
00:47:14,656 --> 00:47:15,400
Yeah.

521
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,400
Whaooooo!

522
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,120
Ahhhhh.

523
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,720
Please stay with me. I'm afraid.

524
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,576
Did you secretly drug me?

525
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:33,344
I didn't drug you, but I put my heart into it.

526
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,328
I'm going to let the ghost in your room deal with you...

527
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,944
I really want to date you.

528
00:48:43,216 --> 00:48:45,220
I'm serious about you, Doctor.

529
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,552
Please give me a chance.

530
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:15,592
The gear is the heart for an engineer.

531
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,712
Can I leave mine with you?

532
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,784
I miss you so much.

533
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,352
Guide, you need to load these onto the bus right away.

534
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,648
And be careful.

535
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,968
Doc!!

536
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:23,040
I've missed you, Doc.

537
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:30,216
Please Doc, don't run away again.

538
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,736
I'm begging you.

539
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,624
I don't have time for this, Per.

540
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,320
Per, let me go! Per! Per!

541
00:50:53,072 --> 00:50:53,712
Mild.

542
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,184
Huh?

543
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,384
Per is probably taking Dr. Kan to the car.

544
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:59,176
Yeah.

545
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,496
The car is probably full.

546
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,512
You and I can go together, right?

547
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,080
No, we can't.

548
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,368
You want me to walk alone?

549
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:09,968
No way.

550
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:11,952
Let's go together.

551
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,072
Per, Per, let me go!

552
00:51:15,112 --> 00:51:17,368
Per, I'm going to get in the car! Per!

553
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,656
Why are you avoiding me?

554
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,384
I'm not.

555
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:50,256
Doctor, let's talk nicely.

556
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,840
What happened?

557
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:05,960
Your mom... she doesn't like me.

558
00:52:09,576 --> 00:52:11,580
She wants me to get out of your life.

559
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,952
And you have to believe her?

560
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,584
But that's your mom, Per!

561
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:23,416
Are you dating me or my mom?

562
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,352
Do you have to care what she thinks?

563
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:39,440
Answer me, are you dating me or my mom?

564
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,280
I'm dating you.

565
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,776
Now I'm shy.

566
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:04,360
You said it first, and you're even wearing the necklace.

567
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,376
Hey, I wasn't planning on wearing this, you know!

568
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:26,984
Doc, can we not do this again?

569
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,392
Let's just talk things out,

570
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:35,960
and please don't run away again.

571
00:53:40,152 --> 00:53:42,150
I'm going crazy.

572
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:51,784
Yeah,

573
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,416
me too.

574
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:06,376
Let this just be about us, no matter how it ends.

575
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:11,360
Let the outcome be based on our own decisions.

576
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,016
Let's give it a try.

577
00:54:39,848 --> 00:54:43,960
But you might not know that I liked you,

578
00:54:44,944 --> 00:54:46,940
even before you knew who I was.

579
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,160
When?

580
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,624
But whether you knew or not doesn't matter anymore.

581
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:06,160
Because now I love you, and I won't lose you
so easily again, that's all that matters.

582
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,952
If you leave me, you're surely dead.
