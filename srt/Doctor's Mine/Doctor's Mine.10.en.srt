"Doctor's Mine"
(Episode 10)

20
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,960
Doc, do you love me?

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,370
Of course,

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,110
I love you like crazy.

23
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,320
Kan, I bought some fruit..

24
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,510
Mom.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,970
Are you busy?

26
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,020
The patient stopped breathing!
The patient stopped breathing! CPR! CPR!

27
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,540
CPR! The patient stopped breathing!

28
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,510
Do you hear me, patient?

29
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,420
Can you hear me?

30
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,880
CPR CPR

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,350
I can hear you loud and clear, Doctor.

32
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,960
The patient is awake now, Mom.

33
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,260
Okay.

34
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,970
Mom, you came over here?

35
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,330
Yes. You're taking such good care of your boyfriend.

36
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,790
Boyfriend?

37
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,440
It's okay, it's okay. Just talk.

38
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,670
I'll wait outside.

39
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,360
Right?

40
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,230
I'll wait outside.

41
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,750
I'll be back. I'll be back.

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,140
I'll go talk to my mom first.

43
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,260
Doc, will you be here?

44
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,710
Till the end.

45
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,980
Hey Kawin!

46
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,980
How long has it been since we've seen each other?

47
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,980
Hey, how'd you get here?

48
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,840
Aren't you staying in the upcountry, huh!

49
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,470
Hey, this is my wife.

50
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,360
Really?

51
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,180
Of course. You're always kidding me.

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,510
So what are you up to these days?

53
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,600
These days? Just doing some farming and gardening.

54
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,130
So you're friends with Per's dad?

55
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,350
Don't you know? We're really close friends.

56
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,980
When your dad heard that his friend's child
was in the same hospital where Kan works,

57
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,410
He decided to come and visit both you
and Nong Per at the same time.

58
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,470
Oh, what a coincidence!

59
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,500
I and him used to joke around,

60
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,940
Saying that if we had kids,
we'd have them get married.

61
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,520
We never thought it would actually happen!

62
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,820
Dad!!

63
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,280
Oh! You're shy!

64
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,630
Do you and Mom know about me and Per...?

65
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,630
I found out from your mom.

66
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,010
Are you guys okay with it?

67
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,240
Kan, you're an adult now.

68
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,610
You have the right to choose your own life.

69
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,800
Choose what you want to choose.

70
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,760
Besides, I'm not very good at talking to young women.

71
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,670
It would be nice to have another son.

72
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,910
Here you go again dad!

73
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,980
Oh, you can try talking with them so you will see.

74
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,500
Oh! See, your mom approved it!

75
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,080
What kind of snacks does Per like?

76
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,980
How about this? Next time we come to visit Per,
we can bring him some snacks, okay?

77
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,740
It might help him recover faster.

78
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,870
And we can also buy some for his parents, too.

79
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,690
Does that sound good?

80
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,940
Sounds good.

81
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,280
What should we buy?

82
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,060
How about pizza?

83
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,820
Are you full?

84
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,780
Oh, I've eaten so much, I'm already stuffed.

85
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,350
I have a sandwich in my bag. You can take it with you.

86
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,350
Just in case you have to work late, okay?

87
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,940
Okay, but how cute is my boyfriend.

88
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,860
Can't you see he's uncomfortable?

89
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,420
Why are you smiling to yourself?

90
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,000
Hello, my name is Mild, a first-year medical student!

91
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,320
What are you doing, Mild?

92
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,620
Play with me, please,

93
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,020
Please, please, please.

94
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,620
Fine, let's play!

95
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,280
Hello, I'm Knight, a fourth-year engineering student.

96
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,140
I'd rather not play, you're too intense.

97
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,350
Let's finish what we started.

98
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,930
You're the one who started it, Mild.

99
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,050
No thanks.

100
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,300
If we keep playing,

101
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,940
I'm going to die laughing for sure.

102
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,940
Stop making fun of me. Why?

103
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,710
My Juliet.

104
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:44,370
P'Knight, You go so big
since people started complimenting your role.

105
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,570
Well, I like it, My Juliet.

106
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,460
You're still emphasizing it.

107
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,810
Juliet.

108
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,410
P'Knight.

109
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,220
Where are you going?

110
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,200
I won't let you go anywhere.

111
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,660
P'Knight, let me go. There are a lot of people, they'll see.

112
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,550
My Juliet...

113
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,180
Knight/ I won't let you go anywhere.

114
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,910
No, Juliet... Juliet...

115
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,170
Where are you going, Juliet? Juliet...

116
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,740
Hey! What are you doing?

117
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,710
Hey Tum!

118
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,730
Hey, it's not all gone yet, Tum.

119
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,730
Let me help you wipe it off./ Hey!

120
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,510
That's enough!

121
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,970
I'm losing my coolness!

122
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,150
Oh!/ I want to stay cool.

123
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,830
I'm starting to think about
when we were first-year students.

124
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,380
We had so much fun back then.

125
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,180
Yeah, that's true. Now I feel so old.

126
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,910
Hey! You're that old already?

127
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,220
I don't know...

128
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,630
happiness always passes by so quickly.

129
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,800
The same goes for our youth.

130
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,620
Soon we'll graduate, and then we'll be working.

131
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,430
There probably won't be anything as fun as life right now.

132
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,750
It won't wash off now.

133
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,900
Tum!

134
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,460
Yeah?

135
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,930
Your face looks so messed up.

136
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,600
Then why are you taking a photo?

137
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,140
I just want to record this time while you're still young.

138
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,540
To show you when you're 60.

139
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,350
You're being so extra.

140
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,950
I'm going to wash my hands first.

141
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,460
Hey, don't use that as an excuse to go check out some girls.

142
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,740
I've got you, that's enough.

143
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,330
Why would I flirt with anyone else?

144
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,950
You can't take that back, Tum!

145
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,080
Okay, I'm going.

146
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,960
Oh! The hospital rice soup today was delicious.

147
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:01,950
Really?

148
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,460
Sure, you feed me.

149
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,700
So sweet.

150
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,300
I think I must be getting sick.

151
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,360
Why, doc? What's wrong?

152
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,270
I think I have diabetes.

153
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,670
You're so sweet to me every day.

154
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,480
I like it, give me more! Oh.

155
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,270
I love you so much I think I'm going crazy.

156
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,970
Oh, so loud!

157
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,690
Do you want the whole hospital to know
you like Dr. Kan? Huh?

158
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,990
Good! I've already reserved.

159
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,670
What are you interrupting for?

160
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,260
I want to be with the doctor.

161
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,910
I came all over here to see you.

162
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,100
I wish I hadn't.

163
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,380
I should've just spent time with Nong Mild instead, right?

164
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,780
P'Knight, that's enough.

165
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,040
Aww! You're so annoying!

166
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,980
Per, how are you?

167
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,420
Does it hurt a lot today?

168
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,840
I'm much better now, mom. Just a little sore.

169
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,120
Hello. I brought some snacks for you.

170
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,970
I heard Kan say that you like to eat them.

171
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,550
Thanks, my friend.

172
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,890
Oh, it's nothing.

173
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,380
We finally meet.

174
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,520
I'm Kan's dad.

175
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,010
Oh really? Well, I don't want to know you.

176
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,100
Kallaya!

177
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,300
I know you don't like me,

178
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,280
but you didn't have to talk to my dad like that.

179
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,770
It's okay, Kan.

180
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,460
I can't take it anymore.

181
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,480
And the only reason I put up with it was because of Per.

182
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,490
Come on, son. Go on, get out of here for a while.

183
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,620
Mom, why did you talk to his dad that way?

184
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,420
And why can't I?

185
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,500
Please calm down,

186
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,930
How about we let Per rest for a while?

187
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,450
Come on, let's go outside first. Come on, let's go.

188
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,940
It's alright, Give them some time.

189
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,490
P' Kan, are you okay?

190
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,960
I'm fine.

191
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,260
I won't change my mind.

192
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,210
Let me know if there's anything I can help you with.

193
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,780
Thanks, Mild.

194
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,700
But I think this is something I have to deal with myself.

195
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,630
Just calm down. Give your mom some time.

196
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,280
You won't get any better. If you keep stressing out.

197
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,310
Knight, get out.

198
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,210
Let me stay with...

199
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,120
Get out.

200
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,420
I want to talk to Per alone.

201
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,940
What's wrong, Mom?

202
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,540
Is this how you treat me?

203
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,220
You don't act like this with that other person.

204
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,520
Just be straight, Mom. I'm tired.

205
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,830
Stop seeing that person.

206
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,080
No.

207
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,960
Per! Why don't you believe me?

208
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,730
I'm not going to stop seeing Kan, Mom.

209
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,820
You're not?

210
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,220
Are you just going to let your life be difficult in the future?

211
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,560
If it's difficult, it's my life.

212
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,080
What are you involved with?

213
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,720
Per... Per, you're going crazy.

214
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,430
That person has changed you.

215
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,180
Get a grip, son./ I've never changed.

216
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,380
It's just that you've never really known me.

217
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,760
I'm doing this because I want what's best for you.

218
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,330
What's best? What's best! What's best!!

219
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:18,500
Do you know, Mom? That phrase,
"I want what's best for you," is choking me.

220
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,540
I can't breathe. I'm going to die.

221
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,950
It's okay, dear.

222
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,460
Did I do something wrong?

223
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,980
I just want my child to have a good future.

224
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,500
This story sounds familiar.

225
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:42,420
20 years ago, our parents made us both get married.

226
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,940
For the same reason.

227
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,160
And look at the result.

228
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:59,970
The happiest day of our lives was the day we got divorced.

229
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:08,060
When we had Per, we were both free.

230
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,950
And you want our child to live a life like that?

231
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:29,380
But can a love between two men really last?

232
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,940
And did we last back then?

233
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:48,700
I hope you'll go back and reconsider it one more time.

234
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,380
How's it going, Dad?

235
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,110
The rest is just a matter of time.

236
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,460
I'm sorry you had to go through something like this.

237
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,450
It's okay, I understand.

238
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,540
Oh, we haven't had a proper chat yet, have we?

239
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,950
Let's have dinner this Saturday.

240
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,940
Yes.

241
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,530
Oh, and where did Mom Lek go?

242
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,860
I think she took Uncle Kriang out for coffee.

243
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,940
Your mom is so good at taking care of people.

244
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,600
The happiest day of our lives was the day we got divorced.

245
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,250
When we had Per, we were both free.

246
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,170
And you want our child to live a life like that?

247
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,870
Mom,

248
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,110
can I talk to you?

249
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,730
Yes, of course.

250
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,110
I...

251
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,460
Thank you, Doc.

252
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,300
Have you tried talking to her yet?

253
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,950
About what?

254
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,780
About your mom.

255
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,260
Don't worry, Doc. I'll handle it myself.

256
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,330
Per, even if it's a family matter,

257
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,620
no one will understand if you don't speak up.

258
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,820
What should I say so that she'll understand?

259
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:48,340
I believe you know what you need to say.

260
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,340
What do you want to talk about?

261
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,460
Mom.

262
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,190
Hey!

263
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,950
Please let me date Kan.

264
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,320
Hey, what are you doing, Per? Get up.

265
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,120
No. / Get up. Get up.

266
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:30,710
No. I won't get up until you let me date Kan.

267
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,140
Which movie did you copy this from? Oh, my son.

268
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,830
Get up.

269
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:36,760
No.

270
00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:38,760
Hey.

271
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,048
I love Kan, Mom.

272
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,624
I know, that's enough, son.

273
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,384
You're finally listening to me, Mom?

274
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,488
Huh?

275
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,776
You never listen to me.

276
00:21:53,984 --> 00:21:55,264
I had to do this.

277
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,968
Mom!

278
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,232
I'm listening.

279
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,248
Speak.

280
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,928
Mom, I love Kan.

281
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,760
Please let me be with Kan.

282
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,952
I want you to accept us.

283
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:27,776
So you're going to love each other
even though you know I'll be angry, huh?

284
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,464
I know you're not mad at me because you hate Kan.

285
00:22:31,496 --> 00:22:33,600
But you're mad because you're worried about me.

286
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,672
You probably think that your son's life is so unpredictable,

287
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,128
always changing,

288
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,936
just like how I keep switching majors
and never finishing my degree.

289
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,352
But I'm just trying to find my happiness, Mom.

290
00:22:55,944 --> 00:23:00,936
Mom, I'm sorry that I've made it hard for you to trust me.

291
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,056
And that I've made you worry all the time.

292
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,040
But I wish you would trust me just this one time.

293
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,352
My son has grown up so much.

294
00:23:27,176 --> 00:23:33,776
I'm sorry I didn't try hard enough
to truly listen to what you wanted.

295
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,488
Live your life the way you want to.

296
00:23:43,344 --> 00:23:44,920
You're giving me permission then?

297
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,152
Yes.

298
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,768
Thank you, Mom.

299
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,624
What are you doing, Per?

300
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,032
Mom, can you pat my head?

301
00:24:02,056 --> 00:24:04,584
Here I do.

302
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,336
I'm doing it. So, are you really going
to finish your engineering degree?

303
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,672
Or are you going to switch to another faculty again, huh?

304
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,670
I love you, mom.

305
00:24:18,136 --> 00:24:20,536
Don't change the topic!

306
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,712
You're such a rascal.

307
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,384
I'm here.

308
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,992
Hello.

309
00:24:49,016 --> 00:24:49,968
Hello.

310
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,752
Hello.

311
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:53,088
Welcome, Mild.

312
00:24:53,136 --> 00:24:54,432
Have a seat, Mild.

313
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,648
Thank you.

314
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,344
I've prepared all of your favorite dishes.

315
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,768
How did you know?

316
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Knight told me everything.

317
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,224
So, when will you graduate, Mild?

318
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,992
Oh, it won't be for a few more years.

319
00:25:20,448 --> 00:25:22,450
But I still have to complete my scholarship obligation.

320
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,288
That's wonderful.

321
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,464
So, what made you want to become a doctor?

322
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,952
Oh.. That.

323
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,344
When I was a kid, I saved a child from drowning.

324
00:25:38,368 --> 00:25:40,696
I had just learned CPR.

325
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,304
So I was able to save a child's life.

326
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:47,688
Huh, this story... It sounds familiar.

327
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:54,232
Or was Mild the child who saved Knight's life?

328
00:25:55,952 --> 00:25:56,896
Yes, that's right.

329
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:03,056
Back then, in my heart, I just felt like I wanted to save him.

330
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:05,304
I didn't want anything to happen to him, no matter what.

331
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,544
And that's when I discovered that,

332
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,000
if you lose someone and can't save them,

333
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,880
It's probably the most heartbreaking thing in the world.

334
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,912
That's why I wanted to become a doctor.

335
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,248
So I could save the lives of many other important people.

336
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,984
But I also have to thank that child.

337
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:35,432
He was the inspiration for me wanting to be a doctor every day.

338
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,832
Mild.

339
00:26:40,856 --> 00:26:41,440
Yes?

340
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,976
I have to thank you so much.

341
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:48,256
Because if you're not there that day,

342
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,296
our Knight wouldn't be sitting here today.

343
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,580
Now we don't have to be separated anymore, right?

344
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,860
That's so nice.

345
00:27:13,888 --> 00:27:17,264
In that case, do you think this is what we call destiny?

346
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:24,240
So that..When are you going to marry our Knight?

347
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,944
Huh?! Marry!

348
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,888
Hmm, I think that's a good idea.

349
00:27:30,936 --> 00:27:34,376
Once you graduate, you can register your marriage first.

350
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,728
Ah! We could just have a small ceremony at our house.

351
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:40,136
Wait, mom. This is...

352
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,952
Sorry, my parents were just a little excited.

353
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,904
I've never brought anyone home before.

354
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,616
That's okay. They're cute.

355
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
You're cute too.

356
00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:21,250
Can you please stop complimenting me?

357
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,992
I'm already about to float to the ceiling.

358
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,232
That's because my boyfriend is so cute!

359
00:28:30,272 --> 00:28:33,608
Yeah, I know I'm cute,

360
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,152
but can't you just keep it to yourself?

361
00:28:36,168 --> 00:28:38,400
Like... you don't need to say it all the time.

362
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,624
Oh, by the way, do you know that after I saved your life..

363
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:46,270
Yes?

364
00:28:46,296 --> 00:28:48,390
I immediately went to the hospital to find you,

365
00:28:48,704 --> 00:28:50,872
but you were already gone.

366
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,456
I also never thought that we would find each other again.

367
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,400
But I was the one who remembered you first.

368
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,432
Then why do you think you remembered first?

369
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:03,928
Oh, because of Freshmen Orientation day.

370
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,976
Did you remember?

371
00:29:06,616 --> 00:29:07,952
Of course I do.

372
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:10,416
Even if I'm not that sure,

373
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,904
how could I forget my first patient?

374
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,616
You know I was always secretly looking at you.

375
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:21,304
But it was you who didn't remember me.

376
00:29:21,328 --> 00:29:22,344
That's really mean.

377
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,168
I do remember. I remembered it first.

378
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:28,272
Oh, then why did you pretend not to remember me back then?

379
00:29:32,096 --> 00:29:33,104
See?

380
00:29:33,144 --> 00:29:35,100
I was shy back then.

381
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,632
You're really taking advantage of this.

382
00:29:38,464 --> 00:29:40,460
Well, my boyfriend is just so cute.

383
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,760
And what if I don't want to just be your boyfriend?

384
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,464
What do you mean?

385
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:01,528
Let's get married after you graduate.

386
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,312
P'Knight!

387
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,040
I love you, Mild.

388
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,464
Um.

389
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,936
Are you teases me?

390
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,376
No more teasing.

391
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,944
Stop, others will see.

392
00:30:49,768 --> 00:30:51,208
No one's see. I've got it covered.

393
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,392
What's up?

394
00:34:58,216 --> 00:35:00,592
Hey,

395
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,832
want to go for lunch with me today?

396
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:19,496
Yeah, sure. See you later.

397
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,272
You did great.

398
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,936
Great, I have something I want to tell you.

399
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,968
Thank you so much.

400
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:08,510
You've always been by my side.

401
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,240
Of course.

402
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,512
Because I... I like you.

403
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,560
Are you sure?

404
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,010
Can I get to know you more?

405
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:37,896
But I can't guarantee that I'll be able to like you.

406
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,656
It's okay. Just give me a chance.

407
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:47,280
But I'm immature.

408
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:51,296
I'm dramatic and my moods are up and down.

409
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,128
Are you really sure you can handle that?

410
00:36:55,728 --> 00:36:57,730
I like that part of you too.

411
00:36:59,288 --> 00:37:04,568
And I also like men.

412
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,304
I know.

413
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,960
You don't have to change yourself at all.

414
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,650
I like you just the way you are.

415
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,048
I want you in my life.

416
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,288
Let's learn about each other together.

417
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:37,304
Yes.

418
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,296
Peekaboo! Doc.

419
00:37:58,344 --> 00:38:00,064
How did you get here?

420
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,640
I came to see my love.

421
00:38:01,688 --> 00:38:03,880
Oh Per, I'm embarrassed.

422
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,560
That's enough. Don't you have classes?

423
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,328
Are you free this evening, Doc?

424
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,424
Stop it. If you're going to invite me to your room, take a break.

425
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:15,616
You're overthinking it. My mom invited you to dinner.

426
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,728
Are you sure your mom's really okay with this?

427
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,536
Okay, I'm all clear now.

428
00:38:21,576 --> 00:38:23,944
And can you stop calling me "your mother"?

429
00:38:23,976 --> 00:38:25,344
Just call her "our mother" instead.

430
00:38:27,176 --> 00:38:29,272
I finally had a good understanding with Mom.

431
00:38:29,312 --> 00:38:31,360
How was that? Am I great?

432
00:38:31,384 --> 00:38:32,960
Praise me please!

433
00:38:32,992 --> 00:38:36,120
Yeah, you're so great. Just like a dog.

434
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:43,160
Doctor, Professor Krit asked me to come get you.
He wants to see you in his office.

435
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,584
Oh, okay. I'll follow you there.

436
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,968
See you in the evening, my love.

437
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,784
See you.

438
00:38:53,816 --> 00:38:55,780
Before you go, let me just give you a big kiss.

439
00:38:55,808 --> 00:38:56,728
I'm leaving now.

440
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,432
You— you damn Per!

441
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,976
Excuse me, professor.

442
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,520
Um, come in.

443
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:09,040
Kan, please have a seat.

444
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,328
Thank you.

445
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,536
Have you made a decision yet?

446
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,120
A decision? About what?

447
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,496
About paying your debt to the government!

448
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,512
Time is running out.

449
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:34,608
I think you should hurry up
and pay your debt and then come back.

450
00:39:34,632 --> 00:39:36,264
It will be better for you in the long run.

451
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:42,248
Besides, the hospital near the border that
you want to go to has been urging me for an answer.

452
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,280
You haven't cleared this up with your family yet, right?

453
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,952
Not yet, professor.

454
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:59,568
I think you should go sort things out with your family
and let me know as soon as you can.

455
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,824
Yes.

456
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,528
Doc! Doc! Doc!!

457
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,224
What's wrong?

458
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,144
Nothing.

459
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,544
You must be very tired.

460
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,992
Umm, let's eat.

461
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,968
I'll get you a big serving.

462
00:40:30,224 --> 00:40:31,408
Thank you.

463
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,168
Eat a lot, okay?

464
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,952
Ahem...

465
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:43,288
Oh, my dear mom's favorite dish.

466
00:40:43,744 --> 00:40:45,740
Eat a lot, mom.

467
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:49,664
Hmm... now that you have a boyfriend,
you've forgotten all about your mom.

468
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,744
Who could ever forget my beloved mom?

469
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,024
I heard that you like Tod Mun.

470
00:41:01,056 --> 00:41:02,256
I...

471
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,272
Mom tells them to make it for you. Eat up.

472
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,256
Thank you, mom.

473
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,864
Both mom and daughter-in-law are so adorable.

474
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,280
Quiet!!

475
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,168
Okay, I give up.

476
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,016
Let's just eat.

477
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,544
I have to thank you for the other day.

478
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,736
You made it possible for Per and me to have a good talk.

479
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:51,680
I should thank you too, mom, for accepting the two of us.

480
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,952
I wish it could be like this forever.

481
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,200
Having the two people I love most together like this.

482
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,680
He's a really good talker.

483
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,424
Yeah, no need to talk anymore.

484
00:42:09,456 --> 00:42:10,096
Just eat.

485
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,296
Kan, I only have one mom.

486
00:42:14,352 --> 00:42:15,680
And do you love me?

487
00:42:15,712 --> 00:42:17,216
Of course.

488
00:42:17,272 --> 00:42:18,744
Who do you love more? Tell me.

489
00:42:18,776 --> 00:42:22,584
I love both of you. I love my mom, and I love doc.

490
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,088
Eat carefully, you'll choke.

491
00:42:25,136 --> 00:42:26,144
Okay.

492
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,880
Just eat your food.

493
00:42:30,552 --> 00:42:33,288
Look at all this grime.

494
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,688
Darling, don't nag.

495
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,232
Having my mom nag is enough.

496
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:45,580
What do you want? Let me go!

497
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,752
What's wrong with you, Darling?

498
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,200
Huh?

499
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,320
What's wrong with me?

500
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,656
You've been distracted all day.

501
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,272
Is something wrong?

502
00:43:04,968 --> 00:43:06,072
Per,

503
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,944
I have to go serve my government scholarship.

504
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,504
For how long?

505
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,152
Three years.

506
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,256
Three years?!

507
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:20,900
Where? Can I visit you?

508
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,472
At the border.

509
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,960
The border!

510
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,960
Yeah, why?

511
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,296
You're not going to let me go?

512
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:35,024
And if I said no, would you still not go?

513
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,992
I'd probably still have to go anyway.

514
00:43:37,024 --> 00:43:37,992
See?

515
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,792
It's just that, I'm Dr.Kan's boyfriend.

516
00:43:49,824 --> 00:43:54,240
If I couldn't handle just this, it would be a shame.

517
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:01,392
Um, wait for me. It'll just be a little while.

518
00:44:02,584 --> 00:44:05,432
Promise you'll call me every day.

519
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,816
Yeah, I promise.

520
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,912
I'm not leaving tomorrow.

521
00:44:12,352 --> 00:44:14,350
But I'm already lonely now.

522
00:44:15,584 --> 00:44:17,580
What? What are you talking about?

523
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,696
Then can I charge my backup battery now?

524
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,648
Is your battery dead?

525
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,160
Two months passed.

526
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:55,912
How are you, Per?

527
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,640
It's been two months since I moved here.

528
00:45:59,312 --> 00:46:01,310
I really made the right choice to come here.

529
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:05,584
After coming here, I realized there are so many people
who don't have access to basic medical care.

530
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,832
Just traveling to the hospital
each time costs them a month's worth of savings.

531
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:14,712
I miss you.

532
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:29,352
What are you doing standing there acting cool, huh?

533
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:30,712
Don't you have work to do?

534
00:46:30,744 --> 00:46:33,180
Hey! I'm your brother.

535
00:46:33,216 --> 00:46:33,968
What's brother?

536
00:46:34,008 --> 00:46:36,792
We're all equals here, new guy.

537
00:46:36,808 --> 00:46:39,328
Hey! Who's the new guy?

538
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,416
I was here before you.

539
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,912
What time did you get here?

540
00:46:42,952 --> 00:46:43,712
9 a.m.

541
00:46:43,736 --> 00:46:44,576
I'm at 5 a.m.

542
00:46:44,608 --> 00:46:45,496
I'm at 4 a.m.

543
00:46:45,544 --> 00:46:46,320
I was here at 3:30 a.m.

544
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,928
I woke up at 2 a.m. to wash the car.

545
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,952
I was already on the road at 1 a.m.

546
00:46:50,592 --> 00:46:52,776
Do you know that I woke you up so you could get out here?

547
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,616
And do you know that
after you woke me up, you went back to sleep?

548
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,088
Darling, I'm doing well.

549
00:46:59,128 --> 00:47:03,312
Oh! But I'm going to die
because of this crazy younger brother;

550
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,832
we ended up working at the same place.

551
00:47:06,216 --> 00:47:08,648
Well, it is Dad's company, though.

552
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:12,152
But it's good, I guess, because there are only two of us,

553
00:47:12,184 --> 00:47:15,296
so when we're unlucky and get yelled at by Dad,
we can share it.

554
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:21,136
Ugh! I don't know if I can stand missing you for three years,

555
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:26,088
because I already miss you so much.

556
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,464
I wish the day we could see each other would come sooner.

557
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:44,312
I can't take it anymore!

558
00:48:23,784 --> 00:48:26,208
Why do you keep visiting me so often, Per?

559
00:48:26,232 --> 00:48:28,072
I'm almost done with my scholarship repayment.

560
00:48:32,392 --> 00:48:35,104
2 years passed.

561
00:48:35,128 --> 00:48:36,936
3 years passed.

562
00:48:36,976 --> 00:48:38,120
Here it is.

563
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,800
Doctor...

564
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,432
Yes, aunt?

565
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,784
Thank you for taking care of me.

566
00:48:53,808 --> 00:48:54,200
Yes.

567
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,200
You're very handsome and kind, doctor.

568
00:48:57,224 --> 00:48:58,824
I'm your fan!

569
00:48:59,192 --> 00:49:01,190
Could I take a picture.

570
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:01,960
Okay.

571
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,952
Doctor.

572
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:06,776
Yes?

573
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,192
Could you take a picture of me and Dr. Mild?

574
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:10,272
Oh, sure.

575
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,224
Come here.

576
00:49:12,256 --> 00:49:15,136
Okay, first picture, smile. 1, 2, 3!

577
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,368
1, 2, 3! All done.

578
00:49:19,776 --> 00:49:21,048
Thank you.

579
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:21,896
You're welcome.

580
00:49:21,944 --> 00:49:22,824
Thank you, doctor./ You're welcome.

581
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,624
I'm leaving now.

582
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,640
Okay, goodbye.

583
00:49:24,664 --> 00:49:25,384
Have a safe trip home.

584
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:26,440
Thank you.

585
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:30,952
You're even hotter than Dr. Kan.

586
00:49:30,976 --> 00:49:31,672
Yeah.

587
00:49:31,696 --> 00:49:33,670
You've got a lot of fans.

588
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:34,496
Don't even joke, Tum.

589
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,728
A hot extern doctor, I have to tell everyone.

590
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:38,312
You're exaggerating, Tum.

591
00:49:38,344 --> 00:49:40,560
Hey, are you busy right now?

592
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,896
Let's eat together.

593
00:49:41,936 --> 00:49:42,976
Probably not.

594
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,000
Wow, you're even busier than we are.

595
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:46,648
Yeah

596
00:49:46,696 --> 00:49:51,376
I can see why P' Knight would feel lonely
that you don't have time to see him.

597
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:54,304
I can't help it.

598
00:49:54,328 --> 00:49:57,344
We're doctors, so our patients have to be more important.

599
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,216
Yeah, I get it.

600
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,352
Okay, we'll eat for you.

601
00:50:02,592 --> 00:50:04,350
Alright, I'm going back to work then.

602
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,344
See you,

603
00:50:05,376 --> 00:50:06,440
See you. Bye-bye.

604
00:50:06,464 --> 00:50:07,104
Bye.

605
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,160
Hey Tum, what should we eat?

606
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,544
Whatever you want to eat.

607
00:50:14,696 --> 00:50:16,808
Why do I have to be the one to choose.

608
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,192
It's a date.

609
00:50:22,216 --> 00:50:23,656
Damn Tum!

610
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:24,816
Let's go.

611
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:25,872
Go.

612
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,440
Mild!

613
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,960
Oh, P'Knight.

614
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,392
How did you get here? You said you had an urgent work.

615
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,832
I found something more urgent.

616
00:50:44,656 --> 00:50:46,660
Are you free to have an urgent project meeting with me?

617
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,464
Hey, Mild.

618
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,840
Oh, P'Kan.

619
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:07,952
Wow, you've grown up so much.

620
00:51:07,976 --> 00:51:09,072
You're a full-fledged doctor now.

621
00:51:09,096 --> 00:51:10,440
Not really, P'.

622
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,680
Thank you for coming to see me.

623
00:51:15,728 --> 00:51:17,976
I have so many things I want to ask you for advice on.

624
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,336
Hey! I left something in the building.

625
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,000
Can you go with me to get it?

626
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,280
And then we can go to dinner.

627
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,320
Yeah, of course. Let's go.

628
00:51:29,368 --> 00:51:30,128
Thank you.

629
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,496
You've grown so much.

630
00:51:33,528 --> 00:51:34,944
Yeah, right?

631
00:51:40,368 --> 00:51:44,184
Ooh! Where is it?

632
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:45,864
Mild.

633
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:46,776
Huh?

634
00:51:46,824 --> 00:51:48,224
What did you forget here?

635
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,688
Oh, it's Dr. Bow.

636
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,560
She scheduled a meeting for us externs yesterday.

637
00:51:58,288 --> 00:52:00,088
But I probably won't find it now.

638
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,664
Never mind.

639
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:12,432
Uhm... I can't believe it's been 3 years already.

640
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,976
Soon, I'll have to do my residency just like you.

641
00:52:17,776 --> 00:52:22,632
It's kinda funny. As soon as you finish your residency,
I'll fly over to do mine there.

642
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,544
That's good. Have you told Knight yet?

643
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:32,456
Oh... he was so upset he almost broke the house,
but there's nothing he can do about it.

644
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:37,680
By the way, have you seen P' Per yet?

645
00:52:38,328 --> 00:52:40,330
Oh, not yet.

646
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,688
He said he couldn't pick me up at the airport.

647
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,384
Um,

648
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,536
you know what,

649
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,928
I kind of miss when we were rehearsing for the play.

650
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:00,920
It was so chaotic back then,
but it's good that we got through it.

651
00:53:00,968 --> 00:53:02,920
I was the one who was super chaotic.

652
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,260
I almost didn't get to perform.

653
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,008
But yeah...

654
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,928
I miss those days, too.

655
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,240
I think so.

656
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:28,688
Hi Doc,

657
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:33,416
sorry I couldn't pick you up at the airport.

658
00:53:35,808 --> 00:53:37,810
I really wanted to,

659
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:44,608
but there was something I didn't tell you.

660
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,784
I have a disease that requires urgent treatment.

661
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,960
So I had to rush to get treated.

662
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,450
I want you to be by my side.

663
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:07,488
But if I don't get better,

664
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:16,880
I hope you'll love and remember me the same way.

665
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:22,320
Mild!

666
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,968
What's wrong with Per?

667
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,800
Uh...

668
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,432
I think Per did his best.

669
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:38,304
What's wrong with Per? Where is he?

670
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:41,110
I…

671
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,840
Where is Per, Mild?

672
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,216
Doc!

673
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,088
Doc!

674
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:07,168
Per, what's wrong? Why didn't you tell me?

675
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,688
I didn't mean to tell anyone, especially you, Doctor.

676
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,128
Because I don't have much time left.

677
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:24,248
I'm a doctor. I'll treat you myself.

678
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:27,056
Will you really treat me?

679
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:29,552
Of course!

680
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:36,592
No matter what you're sick with, I'll cure you myself.

681
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:39,760
There's only one way to treat it, Doctor.

682
00:55:42,152 --> 00:55:44,150
You have to be my wife.

683
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,568
Marry me.

684
00:56:04,224 --> 00:56:05,928
Are you kidding me?

685
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:09,656
I'm not playing with you.

686
00:56:09,696 --> 00:56:10,952
Wait, Doc.

687
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:16,480
I'm sorry I pranked you so hard.

688
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,256
But I'm serious.

689
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:21,128
Serious about what?

690
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,920
You were acting like you were gonna die tomorrow.

691
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,952
I'll really die if I don't have you, Doc.

692
00:56:32,016 --> 00:56:33,950
I have a disease called "addicted love."

693
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:38,136
I can't eat or sleep.

694
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,640
All I think about is you, Doc.

695
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:46,784
Will you please take this patient
under your care for the rest of your life?

696
00:57:21,952 --> 00:57:23,944
I'll take this case under my care.

697
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,432
Thank you, Doctor!

698
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:32,080
Thank you so much.

699
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,160
I won, Knight! Look at this.

700
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:54,480
What's your deal? Why are you showing off to me?

701
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,320
Mild.

702
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,104
Hmm?

703
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,976
Are we just going to let them win?

704
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:01,760
Huh?

705
00:58:05,312 --> 00:58:06,336
Wait!

706
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:09,020
We're here to help him with a surprise.

707
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:17,400
What are you doing?

708
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,768
When did I become your sweetheart?

709
00:58:38,368 --> 00:58:41,760
You just learned my name, Romeo.

710
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:47,696
You are indeed my sweetheart, Juliet.

711
00:58:55,624 --> 00:59:00,504
The moment I first saw you, I fell in love instantly.

712
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:09,504
And you smiled because you knew it too.

713
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:46,840
My sweet heart, Juliet.

714
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,256
Mild, do you remember?

715
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,296
You told me that if I ever wanted to do something to you,

716
01:00:00,248 --> 01:00:02,250
I had to ask for your permission first.

717
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,704
I'm asking for permission now.

718
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:40,472
Will you marry me, my Juliet?

719
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:39,664
This version of Romeo and Juliet is so good.

720
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,968
You all finally got what you wanted.

721
01:01:42,024 --> 01:01:43,432
Congratulations, everyone.

722
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,040
Finally, Happy ending.

723
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,304
We were so nervous!

724
01:01:52,336 --> 01:01:55,088
Hey! What's with all this Romeo and Juliet around here?

725
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,680
I'll stab you until your guts fall out.

726
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,816
Per, that's enough.

727
01:01:59,864 --> 01:02:01,820
He's stealing my spotlight.

728
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,776
Tonight's for you, wifey.

729
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:16,160
Who's your wife?

730
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,544
I'll not be a bottom, you know.

731
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:20,592
You like it too.

732
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:25,288
Can I hug you, I miss you so much.

733
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:31,280
Per, that's enough.

734
01:02:44,728 --> 01:02:46,176
Do you want something like this?

735
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,312
What are you talking about?

736
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,968
Well... a marriage proposal.

737
01:04:02,056 --> 01:04:03,120
Mild.

738
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:05,224
Huh?

739
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:08,864
Can we be like this forever?

740
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,352
Yes, of course.

741
01:04:13,264 --> 01:04:15,260
But let's wait until I finish my scholarship obligation first.

742
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:19,960
Don't do that, Don't play with my heart like this.

743
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,432
Mild!

744
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:25,064
P' Knight.
