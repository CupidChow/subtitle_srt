Can I call you "My Babe"? Because my whole heart I give to you

00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,820
Can I call you "My Babe"? Because my whole heart I dedicate to you

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,250
Whenever I turn, I see you

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,020
Because you are the answer

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,300
And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else…

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,110
Can I call you "My Babe"? Because my whole heart I give to you

Whenever I turn, I see you

13

Because you are the answer

And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else, except for you

15
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,580
Can I call you "My Babe"? Love, love, love

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,990
Can I call you "My Babe"? Love, love, love

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,980
Can I call you "My Babe"? Love, love, love

"Doctor's Mine"
(Episode 6)

20
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,472
Mild... Mild, trust me.

21
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:04,072
How dare you even say that?

22
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,352
It's obvious you assaulted my brother.

23
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:08,312
Hey Mud.

24
00:02:08,344 --> 00:02:09,696
Calm down, calm down first.

25
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,420
Mild... Mild, trust me.

26
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,416
What are you doing sitting here lonely by yourself?

27
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,432
And what's wrong? Tell me.

28
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,376
I'm fine.

29
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,776
Really!

30
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,056
Just looking at your face,
I can tell you look like you're about to die.

31
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:06,270
I just have something to think about.

32
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,928
So, wanna come with me?

33
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,368
Where to go?

34
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,432
Never mind, I will take you away.

35
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,416
Um.

36
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,016
You ass!

37
00:03:29,064 --> 00:03:30,304
P'Knight P'Mud, Calm down.

38
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:31,616
Calm down first./ Don't be nosy.

39
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:33,960
Get out. This is between me and Knight.

40
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,096
Go find Mild.

41
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,040
Let's go!

42
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:39,800
You still dare to call my brother's name, huh?!

43
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,616
Get up and fight me! Get up!

44
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,136
I really like your brother.

45
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:52,496
You like Mild, huh?!

46
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,184
I don't get it, why didn't you hit me back?

47
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:14,420
Haven't I hurt Mild enough yet?

48
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,920
If I hit you in front of him,
Mild would hate me even more.

49
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,960
Do you seriously think you'll see Mild again?

50
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:29,752
Damn... and why did you have to
hurt Mild's feelings like that?

51
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,840
What about hurting his feelings?

52
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,944
I was going to tell Mild, but you used the dumbest method,

53
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:40,040
Even though it wasn't the whole truth.

54
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,712
What do you mean?

55
00:05:07,368 --> 00:05:08,584
Damn it...

56
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:09,944
Does he still not answer?

57
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,664
Not at all. I've called him like a hundred times already.

58
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,416
And is it really okay for us to leave P'Knight and P'Mud alone?

59
00:05:17,456 --> 00:05:19,048
Their friends have all gone home already.

60
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,304
Well, they said it's something
the two of them need to sort out themselves.

61
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,080
I guess... we'll just have to let it be.

62
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,000
Damn, I shouldn't have done it.

63
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,976
I was the one who suggested this plan.

64
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,024
I messed everything up.

65
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
Damn, it's not your fault.

66
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,488
Mild isn't even mad at you.

67
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,672
How would you know?

68
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,080
We haven't even found him yet.

69
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,792
Anyone who goes through
something like that would be shocked.

70
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,160
Just give him a while.

71
00:05:49,744 --> 00:05:50,608
Damn it!
Hey.

72
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,760
If Mild sees you like this, he'd probably feel even worse.

73
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:39,110
Yeah, I'm fine now.

74
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,872
Thanks a lot.

75
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Mild probably went to find one of his friends, I guess.

76
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:58,430
Does he even have other friends besides us?

77
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,024
Yeah, I think so.

78
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,160
Come on.

79
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,656
What's up?

80
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,896
You look terrible.

81
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,952
Why are you here?

82
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,920
Your mom's worried, she sent me to check on you.

83
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,992
Here it is, you've seen me.

84
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,256
Now go back.

85
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:38,450
Hey! No way!

86
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,376
Your mom asked me to bring you food.

87
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,416
Eat it.

88
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:50,816
Hey.

89
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:55,784
This is bothering me.

90
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,152
Do I have to feed you?

91
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,736
You're not even my wife.

92
00:09:03,096 --> 00:09:05,100
C'mon, eat, eat, eat!

93
00:09:05,136 --> 00:09:06,424
I can eat it myself.

94
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,088
Knight,

95
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,624
what exactly happened?

96
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,824
Mild found out about what I did to him.

97
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:43,030
Tell me the whole story from the beginning.

98
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,440
I think there's only one way.

99
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:17,720
So tell me.

100
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:21,190
I think you have to apologize to him.

101
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,368
I want to apologize,

102
00:10:24,408 --> 00:10:27,568
but he doesn't even want to look at me.

103
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,720
Then keep trying! Be persistent.

104
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,256
Show him your sincerity. Make Mild see it.

105
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,256
Even if you have to apologize to him
for the rest of your life, you have to do it.

106
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:49,224
But I'm scared,

107
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,080
I'm scared Mild will hate me.

108
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,408
I really like him.

109
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:10,600
Don't worry, Knight, you've got me.

110
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,248
If you're heartbroken, I'll...

111
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,448
I'll buy you some drinks myself.

112
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,392
Damn it!

113
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,848
What did you guys say? Say that again.

114
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,944
There's a slight problem.

115
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:34,720
We haven't been able to contact Mild for several days.

116
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,352
So, if Mild still isn't here now,

117
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,928
I... I think we should rehearse without Juliet first?

118
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:41,648
Yes sir.

119
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,650
Oh, I'm going crazy.

120
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,112
Ugh... he's not answering.

121
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,208
Knight's another one,
he's been like a sad dog since morning.

122
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,904
Go on, practice is over for today.

123
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,440
Yes.

124
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,232
Damn, where's Mild?

125
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:15,504
I don't know either, I called but he's not answering.

126
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:16,112
Tum.

127
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,416
Oh, P'Pat! What are you doing here?

128
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,856
Why aren't you answering your phone?
You didn't call back either.

129
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:24,040
It's been several days now.

130
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,304
Sorry, I've just been so busy about Mild.

131
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,688
Mild? Oh, Mild Mild Mild!

132
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:32,280
Tum, you're always busy with your friend! What about me?

133
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:34,800
Hey... P'Pat, please calm down first.

134
00:12:34,816 --> 00:12:36,064
Can we go talk over there?

135
00:12:36,184 --> 00:12:38,552
No! Let's just finish talking here!

136
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:39,568
You'll just run away from me again.

137
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,880
No, I won't. I won't run away from you.

138
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:44,208
Oh, I told you to finish talking here!
Where will you take me?

139
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,360
No, it's just... I'm really not free.

140
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,232
Please sit and talk first.

141
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,464
About my friend...

142
00:12:50,464 --> 00:12:52,460
Tum, don't you ever want to be with me?

143
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,688
Anyway, Mild is my close friend.

144
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,312
It's always Mild!

145
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,840
What are you doing making an MV here, Mild?

146
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:23,616
Do you think you're an MV star or something?

147
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,080
Nothing. I'm just thinking.

148
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,808
I know everything now.

149
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:30,856
Huh?!

150
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,536
You know everything! What is that?

151
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,952
Can't be helped, I'm the eldest grandchild of the family.

152
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,584
I'm not going to comfort you,
because I know you're grown up.

153
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,920
You have a brain, you can think
for yourself about what's what.

154
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,960
I know, but I don't know what to do.

155
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:02,608
And I'm not going to judge
whether what happened to you deserves forgiveness.

156
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,776
But I think everything that happens has its reasons.

157
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,472
Reasons?

158
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,920
You can't judge him when you don't know anything.

159
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,400
At least, you have to go back and listen to his explanation first.

160
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,568
I don't know.

161
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,864
I'm just... totally confused.

162
00:14:24,144 --> 00:14:25,860
If I were to look at it from another angle,

163
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,008
What actually happened has a good side to it.

164
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,016
How? I don't understand.

165
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:38,680
I'm not saying what they did was right.

166
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,104
But from what I've heard from everyone.

167
00:14:41,384 --> 00:14:43,888
Everyone loves and worries about you.

168
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,224
Sometimes, when we love someone so much,

169
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,976
it makes us make foolish decisions and do stupid things.

170
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,680
I really want to remind that "everyone."

171
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,088
Just go back.

172
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,768
Go back and listen to their explanation.

173
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,776
Then you can slowly think about what you want to do next.

174
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,456
Running away like this won't make anything better.

175
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,176
Here, drink some coconut water first.

176
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,600
And this one's for you.

177
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,984
You know me so well!

178
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,656
Oh, I'm so jealous of you guys.

179
00:15:30,856 --> 00:15:35,400
You're married, but how do you make it
seem like you're still dating all the time.

180
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,760
Because I'm good at it!

181
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,992
Let's go back tomorrow, we'll drop Mild off.

182
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,456
Oh, so are you gonna kick me out?

183
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,368
No, I just don't want to support a coward.

184
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,104
What am I coward?

185
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,720
You're like... someone who's already fallen in love
and cares a lot about him,

186
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,976
but you want to be angry, so you're trying to be tough.

187
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:00,144
Do you even realize it?

188
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,248
No way.

189
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,632
Peem knows best. He's like this often.

190
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,984
Oh...

191
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,352
so you're like this often, huh?

192
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,200
You could rack your brain and still not figure it out.

193
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,096
It needs to be used right here.

194
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:17,328
Look, P' Seth! He's trying to grope me!

195
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,760
I mean your heart, your heart doesn't hate him.

196
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:23,808
You probably feel a lot for him already.

197
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,248
I don't know.

198
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,640
Your life is yours.

199
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,960
No one can judge you for what you do.

200
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
Do what you want to do.

201
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,800
I'll be the one to support you.

202
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,432
Thank you so much.

203
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,984
Knight, focus a bit!

204
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,696
Sorry, Can I try again?

205
00:16:58,728 --> 00:17:01,024
It's okay. Go take a break.

206
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,048
You can't get anything by doing it now.

207
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,568
Yes.

208
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,432
Doctor, don't stress out.

209
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,792
How can I not stress?

210
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,144
The play is about to be performed!

211
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,272
Come on, trust me.

212
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:24,392
Everything will turn out fine.

213
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,432
I'm tired.

214
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:31,110
If I could perform instead, I would have already.

215
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,816
You should pair with Tybalt!

216
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,864
I'm still missing a partner.

217
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,112
This is ridiculous!

218
00:17:38,512 --> 00:17:39,280
Hey,

219
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,616
if you get tired,
you can always come to me for encouragement.

220
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,080
I'm right here.

221
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,192
Oh, Per...

222
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:56,540
Even if you are the best in the world,

223
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,632
you'll still need encouragement. I know it.

224
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,456
Uh... excuse me.

225
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,512
I don't mean to interrupt your sweet moment

226
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,128
but we have something we'd like you to help us with.

227
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:21,650
Can we go outside and talk a bit?

228
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:23,650
Yeah, let's go.

229
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:07,864
We're arrived.

230
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,784
What should we do?

231
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,712
We can call him later.

232
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:19,992
There's still some time before practice.

233
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,856
Then don't forget to remind him to bring down the snacks.

234
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,832
Didn't he eat anything at that restaurant earlier?

235
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,128
He just poked at it, so I'm worried he'll be hungry.

236
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,224
Thank you for caring about my brother.

237
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,872
Your brother is like my brother.

238
00:19:41,872 --> 00:19:43,960
I'm so glad to have you.

239
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,808
Do you hate me that much?

240
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,360
I don't hate you.

241
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,968
I just like you.

242
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,688
Okay, I'm leaving then.

243
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,392
Oh wait, Mild.

244
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,128
Hey! What are you doing?

245
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,616
Can't you stay?

246
00:20:28,384 --> 00:20:29,584
P'Knight.

247
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,968
Are you really going to leave me alone?

248
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:56,460
Let's start over with me.

249
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,912
Mild, are you okay?

250
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,520
Yes bro.

251
00:21:07,552 --> 00:21:08,528
We're here,

252
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:12,160
but... if you're not feeling up to it, you can leave first.

253
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,552
It's fine.

254
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,160
You guys brought me all the way here,
so just go. I'm okay.

255
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,136
Don't push yourself, Take your time.

256
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,640
I'll go practice now, I don't want to be late.

257
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,840
Oh, don't forget to take the snacks with you.

258
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,088
I'm leaving now, bro. Enjoy your trip!

259
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:46,624
Yeah, if anything happens, just call us okay?

260
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:47,704
Okay.

261
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,008
Yeah I'm here.

262
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,792
Hurry up! P'Kan's waiting for you.

263
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:16,928
Huh?? You told P'Kan about me already?

264
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,584
P'Kan.
Hmm.

265
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,048
Where have you been for so many days?

266
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,928
Everyone was worried sick about you.

267
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,680
So, where did you go?

268
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,496
I had a bit of a personal issue,

269
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,480
so I went away to take some rest.

270
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,768
Did I cause everyone a lot of trouble?

271
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,272
I'm sorry,

272
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,736
P'Kan. Don't mad at me.

273
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,632
Um, just seeing your face, I can't stay mad.

274
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,400
But don't do that again next time.

275
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,704
You can run away,

276
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,160
but you have to tell us.

277
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,608
Got it bro.

278
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,420
So what happened?

279
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:29,984
I think we should go practice,

280
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,392
We've wasted enough time.

281
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,280
Alright, let's do.

282
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,192
Mild!

283
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,680
Mild, talk to me first.

284
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,000
This is practice time. Let's just practice.

285
00:23:59,984 --> 00:24:01,980
Mild, please let me explain.

286
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:06,256
But I have nothing to talk about with you, let me go!

287
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,928
I'll practice.

288
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,704
Do you think he'll be okay?

289
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:29,176
I'm just worried he'll pretend he's fine.

290
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,896
Should we buy him something to eat?

291
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,320
Maybe that'll make him feel better.

292
00:24:36,832 --> 00:24:38,830
Yeah, let's do it.

293
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,048
I'll pay for it myself.

294
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,912
Tum.

295
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,608
Oh, P'Pat, aren't you finishing late today?
How did you get here?

296
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,992
I missed you, so I came to see you.
And I brought Fern too.

297
00:24:56,024 --> 00:24:58,616
We wanted to watch you practice and cheer you up.

298
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,856
But I'm not playing anything.

299
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,624
Oh.

300
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,056
Even if you're not playing,
it doesn't mean you're not important.

301
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,400
Pat saw that you were busy with Mild,
so she wanted to come see you.

302
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,872
We promise to watch quietly and not disturb you at all.

303
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,992
Um.. I'm fine, Really okay.

304
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,792
But... I probably can't let you in
because P'Kan doesn't allow outsiders.

305
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:30,752
Oh, I just want to watch, that's all.
It shouldn't be difficult.

306
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
I'm sorry.

307
00:25:35,104 --> 00:25:37,100
It's okay, we should go.

308
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,752
It's really okay, Tum. I understand.

309
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,048
Thank you.

310
00:25:41,728 --> 00:25:43,730
Let's have dinner tonight, okay?

311
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,176
Alright, see you later.

312
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,712
To cheer you up.

313
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,448
You're totally smitten.

314
00:25:57,864 --> 00:25:59,616
Well, she's my girlfriend!

315
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,296
Didn't someone say friends are more important than a girlfriend?

316
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:09,536
I'm doing it right now, almost.
Then I remembered I have to see Mild this evening.

317
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,272
Whatever. I'm used to it.

318
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,256
Why are you mad at me?

319
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
No, I'm going to buy some snacks.

320
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,024
Hey! Wait for me!

321
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,512
Let's go home.

322
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,280
Mild!

323
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,568
You have to tell me where you've been, okay?

324
00:26:33,832 --> 00:26:37,432
Seriously, we were so worried, you know?

325
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,400
Yeah.

326
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:44,416
Yeah, I'm not ready to talk about it yet.

327
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:46,824
Okay.

328
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,832
You guys can go on ahead.

329
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,000
I need to talk with Mild for a bit.

330
00:26:55,496 --> 00:26:56,096
Okay.

331
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,640
I can walk by myself.

332
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,912
You go ahead.

333
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,768
If you have something to say, just say it.

334
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,200
Mild,

335
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,192
at least...

336
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,408
Can you please listen to me?

337
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,312
It wasn't like that that day.

338
00:27:44,344 --> 00:27:45,264
Enough.

339
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,288
Take your kiss back.

340
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:17,544
And from now on, don't bother me anymore.

341
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,840
That's good.

342
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,520
But you told me you weren't seeing anyone!

343
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,736
If you were going to have a lover, it should be me!

344
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,328
Well, I have one now, and that's Mild.

345
00:29:30,776 --> 00:29:33,888
Oh, that second-year medical student, right?

346
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,096
What about me then?

347
00:29:36,144 --> 00:29:37,808
We're just "friends with benefits," Fern.

348
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,936
Are you P'Fern, P'Pat's friend?

349
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,904
Do you know me?

350
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,280
Did Tum tell you, or did Knight tell you?

351
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,128
Both.

352
00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:00,496
Then you probably know, Mild.
That Knight isn't serious about anyone.

353
00:30:02,144 --> 00:30:05,048
Oh, I already know that.

354
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,592
Everyone talks about it.

355
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,880
You're afraid of being dumped,
so you dump them first.

356
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,688
But you're brave to give him back the kiss.

357
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,840
Does it hurt to leave when you still love him?

358
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,672
But it depends on the status.

359
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,168
Huhhh.

360
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,288
If it's a lover, it hurts.

361
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,944
But if it's just friends with benefits,
love was never involved.

362
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,616
Knight loves me.

363
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,896
Thank you for your empathy for me.

364
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,240
But I feel empathy for you more
that you still can't move on about P'Knight.

365
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,104
Hope you feel better soon.

366
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,600
Hey Tum, you're eating with us,

367
00:31:00,624 --> 00:31:02,280
aren't you supposed to have a date with your girlfriend?

368
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,416
I already messaged her that I'd be home late.

369
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,560
She kept calling,

370
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,024
but I didn't answer.

371
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,472
Do you think I could just leave Mild like this?

372
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:20,472
Mild, are you okay?

373
00:31:20,488 --> 00:31:21,256
Yeah.

374
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,408
Just a small thing. It's nothing.

375
00:31:25,448 --> 00:31:26,584
Whoa. / Wait.

376
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,712
Are you saying that
you're going back to being with P'Knight?

377
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,408
Yeah.

378
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,192
No way! I don't even like him.

379
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:36,112
You ass! If you lie I hope you choke on water!

380
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,432
See? I thought it.

381
00:31:38,584 --> 00:31:39,232
Damn it.

382
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,304
Whether I like him or not,
it's not like I have to get back with him.

383
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,584
Hey... but honestly, you won't escape P'Knight's grasp.

384
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:52,040
Because even P'Mud seems to be...
giving in to P'Knight already.

385
00:31:52,072 --> 00:31:52,888
Uh...
Huh?!

386
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,168
Well, back then, when you ran out,
P' Knight followed you too.

387
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,024
But P' Mud followed him and beat him up first.

388
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,384
I saw it,

389
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,656
but P'Knight didn't fight back at all!

390
00:32:05,696 --> 00:32:06,056
Yeah.

391
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:08,136
He just lay there letting P' Mud kick him.

392
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,376
And when I went to help, he told me not to interfere.

393
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,096
P' Mud only stopped when he ran out of energy himself.

394
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:15,600
Really, That much?
Sure.

395
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,912
Yeah.

396
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,888
He didn't do anything at all?

397
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,064
Yeah.

398
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,704
Excellent everyone!

399
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,648
You all did very well today.

400
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:46,824
Thank you so much for your hard work
over the past few months.

401
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,784
Tomorrow's the big day,
so I hope everyone gives it their all.

402
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,752
Go home and rest for today,
and let's do our best tomorrow.

403
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,616
That's all for today. Thank you very much.

404
00:32:56,656 --> 00:32:58,008
Thank you.

405
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:06,904
Come check the lights
and make sure they're in good condition.

406
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,584
If you keep following me, I'll call the police.

407
00:34:57,912 --> 00:35:00,232
What is it? Why do you keep staring?

408
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
May I hold your hand?

409
00:35:17,856 --> 00:35:19,860
Seeing you smile makes me happy.

410
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:24,440
Your happiness is my happiness.

411
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,504
I'm really happy, thank you so much, P'Knight.

412
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,960
If you touch me, I'll hate you for the rest of my life.

413
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,408
As if you don't hate me now?

414
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,632
Since you already hate me.

415
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,232
So I will make it worth it that you hate me.

416
00:37:15,376 --> 00:37:16,296
P'Knight!

417
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,504
I can't take it anymore, Mild.

418
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,336
Please don't hate me.

419
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,984
Can you be the one person who doesn't hate me?

420
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,904
I have no one left.

421
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:15,384
Do you think something like this is easily forgiven?

422
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,104
If you hears the whole story, and still wants to hate me.

423
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,560
I won't ever go to see you anymore.

424
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,496
Please just listen to me, Mild.

425
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,760
I'm going to standby.

426
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,272
But there's one thing I never lied to you about.

427
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,040
I like you.

428
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,048
I've always liked you.

429
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,032
When did you start like me?

430
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,800
Longer than you realize.

431
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,560
Make up with me,

432
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,040
please, Mild.

433
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,048
50%

434
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,368
Huhhh?

435
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,416
I'm only 50% okay with you right now.

436
00:39:44,624 --> 00:39:46,620
So what do I need to do to get to 100%?

437
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:51,952
Just wait until you tell me the whole story. Then I'll see.

438
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,660
Okay, should I tell you now?

439
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:59,336
P'Knight, is this the right time?

440
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,592
The show's about to start.

441
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,024
Go get ready.

442
00:40:08,904 --> 00:40:10,900
Please be okay with me.

443
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,824
Please, Mild.

444
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,712
I'm going crazy.

445
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,280
Well, then just go crazy and die.

446
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,008
Mild.

447
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,976
Who are you?

448
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,224
My name is Romeo, and you?

449
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,360
My name is Juliet.

450
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,232
Juliet.

451
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:22,976
Juliet, you are my dearest.

452
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,600
When did I become your sweetheart?

453
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,648
You just learned my name, Romeo.

454
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,712
You are indeed my sweetheart, Juliet.

455
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:50,504
The moment I first saw you, I fell in love instantly.

456
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:59,576
And you smiled because you knew it too.

457
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,120
I love you.

458
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:15,152
I fell in love with you at first sight.

459
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:24,424
Even though you don't know me.

460
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,128
I'm the one who has been looking at you all along,

461
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:40,832
longer than you realize, my Juliet.

462
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,496
My Juliet.

463
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,472
Juliet!

464
00:43:15,504 --> 00:43:18,856
Come on, the Count wants to dance with you now.

465
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,400
Why did you go off-script just now?

466
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,744
Because it came from my heart.

467
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,088
Then why did you do that?

468
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,216
Don't worry.

469
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:53,630
I'll take care of you until the end.

470
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,416
I'm worried.

471
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,232
Are you worried about me?

472
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,272
I'm worried about myself!

473
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,768
You brought me to the wrong side,
I need to go to that side.

474
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:21,944
Romeo, the coward of Montagues!

475
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,704
And that's Tybalt, that Capulet trash!

476
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:32,408
You're so mouthy, Romeo! Then die here Romeo!

477
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,688
Sh*t! Hey, Please take care of this.

478
00:45:17,296 --> 00:45:18,816
Are you okay, Per?

479
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,712
Did you come to see me?

480
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,792
Did I play well today?

481
00:45:25,832 --> 00:45:28,840
Oh, Per, you're sticky!

482
00:45:28,872 --> 00:45:30,912
Let me go, Per, let me go!

483
00:45:30,944 --> 00:45:34,152
I won't let you go, my queue is over now.

484
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:35,872
Yours is over but mine isn't!

485
00:45:35,912 --> 00:45:39,288
I have to go to the control room, Per! Let me go!

486
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:53,512
Don't you see that your revenge hasn't made anything better?

487
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,088
The tragedy of Romeo and Juliet

488
00:45:57,128 --> 00:46:00,712
is the consequence of the hatred
and animosity between two families.

489
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:05,392
Wouldn't it be better if this world had no hatred

490
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,680
or divisions of any kind?

491
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,856
Love is not wrong.

492
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:15,840
Don't open your eyes.

493
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,096
How would you know I'm looking,
if you aren't secretly looking at me too?

494
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,744
Please be quiet.

495
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,848
Mild.

496
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,064
The dead aren't allowed to speak.

497
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,472
Closer, please.

498
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,040
Very great.

499
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,536
Knight, you acted so well, dear.

500
00:47:14,568 --> 00:47:18,040
Just now, watching you, I teared up too.

501
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,536
Thank you, Mom.

502
00:47:20,568 --> 00:47:22,456
So good, dear.

503
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,176
I'm so proud of you.

504
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:26,960
Yeah.

505
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,576
Oh, is this Mild?

506
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:33,128
Yes.

507
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,824
I hear Knight talk about you often.

508
00:47:36,872 --> 00:47:40,088
In person, you're even more charming than I thought.

509
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,144
Thank you, Madam.

510
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,592
Oh, you can just call me Mom.

511
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:46,832
Huh?

512
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:52,784
Let's just say, if you don't mind, you can call me Mom.

513
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:00,104
Yes, Mom.

514
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:02,744
So cute. Good boy.

515
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:23,712
So, Mr. Kawin and Ms. Kallaya,
what did you think after watching the play?

516
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,472
Of course, I'm proud.

517
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:29,600
It's Per's first time acting in a charity play.

518
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,920
That's why I donated a little extra today.

519
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:37,056
Can you tell us the amount?

520
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,824
It was around a seven-digit number.

521
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,344
Isn't that too much?

522
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:48,040
This was his idea, actually.

523
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,816
And where has him gone?

524
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:56,376
I'm not sure where he's gone now.

525
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,840
Per, someone will come to see.

526
00:49:19,144 --> 00:49:21,140
Later.

527
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,264
Hey Per, you need to go out and take pictures with your friends.

528
00:49:26,784 --> 00:49:31,592
Okay, but tonight we have to...

529
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:50,744
Yeah, we'll talk about that later, okay?

530
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,960
Oh sht!

531
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,208
I forgot my parents are here.

532
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:01,952
Sht!

533
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:14,552
Sh*t!, Please stay here for a moment.

534
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,200
Hello, Mom Lek.

535
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,376
Hey Night, come with me.

536
00:50:21,424 --> 00:50:22,112
What the heck?

537
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:22,960
Let's go, quick!
No, no!

538
00:50:24,992 --> 00:50:25,624
Quickly!

539
00:50:25,664 --> 00:50:27,128
Per, no way!

540
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,744
Excuse me.

541
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,624
My son is here.

542
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,880
Hello.

543
00:50:36,904 --> 00:50:38,208
Hello.

544
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,240
N'Per, how was your played today?

545
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:45,008
It was good. I'm relieved that
what I practiced turned out well.

546
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,456
But it's not just me who did well,

547
00:50:47,496 --> 00:50:49,712
I have to thank everyone, both in front of and behind.

548
00:50:49,736 --> 00:50:50,768
Right, Knight?

549
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,536
Yes, I have to thank everyone.

550
00:50:55,576 --> 00:50:59,856
Especially N'Mild, who is my partner.

551
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:04,624
And our talented producer, Doctor Kan.

552
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,088
Excellent!

553
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,688
This is N'Knight, my youngest son.

554
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,960
He doesn't like being in the media,

555
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:25,024
but I'm just as proud of him
as I'm proud of Per, my eldest son.

556
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,424
Siblings!

557
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:36,712
We've finished asking about work,
now what about the relationship status of their heart?

558
00:51:36,736 --> 00:51:38,072
How's that going?

559
00:51:42,896 --> 00:51:44,900
Can I not answer that yet?

560
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:47,872
I've got to go.

561
00:52:10,488 --> 00:52:13,952
So, is your heart still available, N'Per?

562
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:18,744
How should I say this... it's not available anymore.

563
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:24,936
I'm currently interested in someone and I'm dating them.

564
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,712
I'm very serious,

565
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,920
and I hope...

566
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:35,890
Shall we talk about business instead?

567
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,720
We've talked about this quite a bit already.

568
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:44,472
So, does this mean you don't approve of this daughter-in-law?

569
00:52:44,504 --> 00:52:46,080
Why would you say that?

570
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,888
It's like this, we're currently launching a new production line.

571
00:52:53,912 --> 00:52:58,232
We'd like everyone to help promote our company.

572
00:52:58,264 --> 00:53:02,872
Please support us, as we've put a lot of effort into this project.

573
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:05,144
Yes, please support us.
