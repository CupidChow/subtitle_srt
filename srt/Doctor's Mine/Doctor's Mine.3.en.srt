Can I call you My Babe? Because my whole heart I give to you

Can I call you My Babe? Because my whole heart I dedicate to you

Whenever I turn, I see you

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,000
Because you are the answer

9
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:33,288
And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else, except for you

10
00:00:33,312 --> 00:00:38,096
Can I call you My Babe? Because my whole heart I give to you

11
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:43,248
Can I call you My Babe? Because my whole heart I dedicate to you

Whenever I turn, I see you

13

And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else, except for you

15

Can I call you My Babe? Love Love Love

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,384
Can I call you My Babe? Love Love Love

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,200
Can I call you My Babe? Love Love Love

00:01:07,224 --> 00:01:10,304
Can I call you My Babe?

"Doctor's Mine"
(Episode 3)

20
00:01:24,408 --> 00:01:28,872
So... Can I kiss you?

21
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,704
Thank you for allowing me.

22
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,160
Okay, if you tell me to ask first, I will.

23
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,264
Can I date you?

24
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,912
I trust you.

25
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,360
Let me know when you're ready to talk about it,
I'll always be here to listen.

26
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,384
How could I say that?

27
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,192
Eat up. So you'll have energy.

28
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,320
I'm not hungry.

29
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,392
What's wrong? Are you sick?

30
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,640
Nothing, I just...

31
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,056
I just don't usually eat breakfast.

32
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,936
Coffee is enough.

33
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,256
And why are you here so early?

34
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,432
Why? Are you afraid I'll run away
because of what happened yesterday?

35
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,430
So what's the deal with you and Mud?

36
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,480
Did you really cheat on P'Ploy?

37
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,408
Just tell me so I can understand.

38
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:02,510
At that moment, I really liked a guy.

39
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:05,990
But I didn't date him,

40
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,592
I didn't even tell him I liked him.

41
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:11,590
Oh!

42
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:14,990
So you didn't cheat on P'Ploy then?

43
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,240
She probably knew I didn't love her anymore,
so she broke up with me.

44
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,808
Then why didn't you date that guy?

45
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:27,456
The one you liked.

46
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,896
He probably wasn't ready.

47
00:05:35,664 --> 00:05:40,512
You think too much, If you don't tell him,
how would he know?

48
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,304
I'm going to class first. See you at the rehearsal.

49
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,544
Are you okay?

50
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,248
I'm fine.

51
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,880
Tum, Mild is not good today.

52
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,616
Hey Tum!! Share some with me!

53
00:06:28,928 --> 00:06:30,896
Um.

54
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,200
Come on, I'm hungry.

55
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,168
What about mine?

56
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,664
Take it.

57
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,592
Hey...

58
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,664
Hey, why aren't you sharing with friends?

59
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:41,648
It's mine.

60
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,224
Hey, don't play so rough.

61
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,512
Fine.

62
00:06:44,544 --> 00:06:47,600
Give me more! I can't, I'm so sleepy.

63
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:50,768
Put it here, so others can eat too.

64
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,936
Mine!

65
00:06:52,968 --> 00:06:53,952
I'm refreshed.

66
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:55,464
Mine!

67
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,792
You left home in such a hurry this morning.

68
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,224
Oh! I had an early class.

69
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,312
Are you in a hurry to meet someone?

70
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,744
Hey P'Mud!

71
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:17,280
If you wanted to know this morning
if I came to meet your friend P'Knight, then just say it directly.

72
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,952
What friend are you talking about? He's not my friend.

73
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,992
Yeah, yeah, okay.

74
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:26,570
So, can you tell me about you and P'Knight?

75
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,952
Well, it...

76
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:29,280
Tell me everything.

77
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:36,816
Yeah, you already know that
we've been friends since middle school.

78
00:07:37,976 --> 00:07:39,980
Then in 11th grade, he started dating Ploy.

79
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,656
Huh! So why did you steal his girlfriend?

80
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,840
At that time, Ploy came to me crying.

81
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:48,784
She said that Knight cheated on her and liked another guy.

82
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,520
But I didn't know who it was.

83
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,984
Ploy just told me that Knight really liked that person.

84
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,824
And then...

85
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,920
I saw she was really sad.

86
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,464
And... I secretly liked her too.

87
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,320
So when we were alone, it just…

88
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,472
You probably know how it goes.

89
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,440
But then Knight caught us.

90
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,760
Then why did you do it?

91
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,496
But they are about to break up anyway.

92
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,408
You're really bad,

93
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:20,990
no wonder he's mad at you.

94
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,648
Yeah, I feel bad too.

95
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,160
But you should stop getting involved with Knight.

96
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,928
So he and I can just be done with each other.

97
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,656
But I want to trust him.

98
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,610
Hey Mild!

99
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
And I want you to trust me too.

100
00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:47,150
Hey, anyone want coffee?

101
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,552
I'll take a cold Americano, less sweet.

102
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,008
You're not drinking latte anymore?

103
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,248
I don't want to drink milk.

104
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,688
That's why you're so short.

105
00:08:55,728 --> 00:08:56,472
Damn it!

106
00:08:56,504 --> 00:08:58,840
I'll have the same as usual. You remember, right?

107
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,800
Of course, Iced cappuccino, less sweet, changes milk to oat milk.

108
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Alright, I'm leaving! Come on.

109
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,408
Dr. Kan.

110
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,256
Yes?

111
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,904
Are you dating Nong Per from Engineering?

112
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,952
Oh no, nothing.

113
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:19,968
I just thought the mood in this photo was nice, so I posted it.

114
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,800
Don't be shy.

115
00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:26,144
N'Per reposted it with a heart emoji.

116
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,368
I'm leaving.

117
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,816
Damn Per.

118
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,488
Where are you going? You still have rounds!

119
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,632
Yeah, Engineering.

120
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,400
Hey.

121
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,376
Per!

122
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,008
Per!

123
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,552
What are you doing?

124
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,448
What am I doing?

125
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,208
The photo you reposted!

126
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,632
Oh. It's cute. Don't you like it?

127
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,496
Per, stop acting like you're trying to date me!

128
00:10:12,536 --> 00:10:13,720
Everyone's misunderstanding!

129
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,072
Per, what the hell are you doing?

130
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,752
I'm really serious about you.

131
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,536
They're serious.

132
00:10:30,576 --> 00:10:34,184
Please take care of my friend's heart.

133
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,056
Per! Per!

134
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,248
Hey,

135
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,992
what's wrong with you?

136
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,824
I like him.

137
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,112
Who you like?

138
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,504
I like Kan.

139
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,184
I've always liked him,

140
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:07,020
but now I can't take it anymore.

141
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,688
I'm hurt.

142
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,872
It's okay.

143
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,952
But I don't get it. Why can't it be me?

144
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,200
Why do I have to lose to that engineering kid?

145
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,240
Kan hasn't said anything yet.

146
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,600
Don't imagine things.

147
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,424
But you saw it, Great.

148
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,420
Don't give up yet!

149
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:43,160
You're still important to him, you know.

150
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,896
You think I still have a chance?

151
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,264
Yeah.

152
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,800
You have to help me, Great.

153
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
I always help you.

154
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,736
Thanks.

155
00:12:14,616 --> 00:12:15,704
Come here.

156
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,968
Thank you.

157
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,880
Hey Mild, do you have rehearsal this evening?

158
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,408
Hey Mild!

159
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,560
Mild!

160
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,920
Mild!

161
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,440
What's he thinking about?

162
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,704
Mild.

163
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
Oh dude!

164
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,896
You don't turn around for your friend,
but when P'Knight calls, you do!

165
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,600
I think something's weird now...

166
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,120
Hey! Where are you going?

167
00:13:00,152 --> 00:13:00,936
Mild.

168
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,376
That's how people act when they're newly in love.

169
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,624
You should take notes.

170
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:14,272
So I have to deal with him like I dealt with you
when you had a new girlfriend?

171
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:18,328
So sorry, that's what happens when you don't have a lover.

172
00:13:52,704 --> 00:13:55,064
Mild, hold on!

173
00:13:55,088 --> 00:13:55,864
Oh!

174
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,728
Ahhhh..hh.

175
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Does it hurt?

176
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,760
Let me go.

177
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,736
Go treat your wound first.

178
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,720
That's okay.

179
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,536
I can do it myself.

180
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,056
There are so many people,

181
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,960
I'm shy.

182
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,464
Let's go, don't be naughty.

183
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,696
When I'm not around, don't play around
until you hurt yourself, understand?

184
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,904
Hey...

185
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,840
I'm hungry.

186
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,224
Want to go eat together?

187
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,496
Sure, how about that restaurant over there?

188
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,688
Hey...

189
00:15:21,696 --> 00:15:25,608
Are you brave enough?
A-a-ow, a-a-ow, are you brave enough?

190
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,680
Are you brave enough?
A-a-ow, a-a-ow, are you brave enough?

191
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:37,864
Are you brave enough?
A-a-ow, a-a-ow, are you brave enough?

192
00:15:37,888 --> 00:15:39,256
Per, stop it!

193
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,248
I'm shy!

194
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,152
I won't stop.

195
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,920
If you want me to stop, then let me date you first!

196
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,616
No way!

197
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,224
Then I won't stop. I really like you.

198
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:55,180
I like Dr. Kan.

199
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:59,510
Per likes Dr. Kan.

200
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:02,744
Per from Engineering likes Dr. Kan from 6th year med.

201
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,056
We heard that!

202
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:10,520
Woohoo!

203
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,464
Will you stop or not?

204
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,192
I won't stop until you agree to be my boyfriend.

205
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,504
You already took the shop jacket
or Do I need to give you my gear too.

206
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:23,936
For you to accept my love?

207
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,160
Hey, is that shop jacket on Instagram Per's?

208
00:16:27,456 --> 00:16:29,680
Whoa, that's impressive!

209
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:32,968
Just accept his love. He's so sincere.

210
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,184
I'm still not taking Gear.

211
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:45,512
If you guys don't stop, I'll cut all the budget for faculty's play.

212
00:16:49,112 --> 00:16:51,110
Pretty people are often mean.

213
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,496
Yeah, good.

214
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,848
Is that a compliment?

215
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,952
Your heart's melting, right?

216
00:16:59,992 --> 00:17:01,936
Am I cuteeee?

217
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,952
Damn Per! What the hell are you doing?!

218
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:05,728
Per!

219
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,072
Looks like Tiger Kan is losing to the engineering lion!

220
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:14,568
I told you, handsome guys like Kan
might end up being someone else's wife someday.

221
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,560
Damn Per, let me go!

222
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:19,936
I won't let you go.

223
00:17:20,152 --> 00:17:21,680
Hugging you is so comfy.

224
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:22,960
Let me hug you a bit longer.

225
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:24,888
Per, let me go!

226
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:27,696
Kan!

227
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,736
Is this why you said you had someone else
and wanted to break up with me?

228
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:49,264
Excuse me, weren't you the one who cheated first sis?

229
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,744
Kan, What's he talking about?

230
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,680
Yes, I'm dating Per.

231
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,568
I don't believe it. Kan would never like someone like this.

232
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,664
Really?

233
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,488
Is this clear enough?

234
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,528
Let's go, Per.

235
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:34,136
Oh, okay, darling!

236
00:18:34,184 --> 00:18:39,024
I will take you all the way to bed.

237
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,320
You're surely in trouble, when you get home, Per!

238
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,912
Are you really going to tease him at his house?

239
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,480
Look at what he's doing, so funny!

240
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,368
That's so bad.

241
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,720
Why did you even record it?

242
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Look at how he acted.

243
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,944
It wouldn't be surprising if Dr. Kan broke up with his girlfriend.

244
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,208
Hey Knight,

245
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,232
why would you curse him like that?

246
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:20,704
If an engineering student decides to flirt with someone,
they'll always succeed.

247
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,888
Hey, I'm not hungry anymore.

248
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,504
I'm going to class now.

249
00:19:39,256 --> 00:19:41,260
Don't run, you'll fall.

250
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,296
What the heck? Invited me for lunch and just walk away.

251
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:52,504
But he's cute.

252
00:19:59,984 --> 00:20:01,980
Doctor!

253
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,416
It's hurts, Doc!

254
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,968
You're taking advantage,
What just happened was more than enough.

255
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,536
Well... we're seeing each other, darling.

256
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,432
Oh Per! That's enough!

257
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,936
How can you treat your benefactor like this?

258
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,344
I even agreed to be your fling just now.

259
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,392
Yeah, you did great.

260
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,760
Thanks.

261
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,168
I don't want “thanks”.

262
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,552
I want something else more.

263
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,736
Per!

264
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,600
Per, give me my car key!

265
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:13,760
No way.

266
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,752
Per!

267
00:21:14,768 --> 00:21:15,984
You can come get it then.

268
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,632
Per! Give it to me, Per!

269
00:21:21,008 --> 00:21:21,944
Per!

270
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,960
If I finish eating. I'll going home.

271
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,872
Be careful not to get hooked after you eat.

272
00:21:41,688 --> 00:21:42,552
No way!

273
00:22:02,448 --> 00:22:04,904
See? Am I Handsome, right?

274
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,824
You're falling for me.

275
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,104
My bed is wide and still empty.

276
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,272
Go sleep with the ghosts in your room.

277
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,432
Don't say that. I'm scared.

278
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,288
What are you scared of?

279
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,832
You never leave a bed empty.

280
00:22:22,864 --> 00:22:24,690
There's always someone using it.

281
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,976
How do you know?

282
00:22:29,232 --> 00:22:30,680
The ghost in your room told me.

283
00:22:30,704 --> 00:22:31,980
Doctor!

284
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:44,810
Did you secretly drug me?

285
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,704
I didn't drug you, but I put my heart into it.

286
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,304
I'm going to let the ghost in your room deal with you...

287
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,536
I really want to date you,

288
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:06,980
You're the one for me.

289
00:23:07,664 --> 00:23:09,880
Let the ghost in this room be my witness.

290
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,328
I've never felt this way to anyone before.

291
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,832
Can you give me a chance?

292
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,992
Did you feel it too?

293
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,536
The feelings I have for you.

294
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,952
I feel,

295
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,312
I feel my eyes sting.

296
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,912
Doctor! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. Doctor!

297
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,600
Doctor!

298
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,872
I'm gonna die, why are you being so dramatic?

299
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:05,040
I wasn't teasing just now,

300
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,072
I was serious.

301
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:12,400
Umm...

302
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,080
I know.

303
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,424
Just date then.

304
00:24:19,264 --> 00:24:21,260
Huh? What did you say?

305
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,432
I'll give you a try.

306
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,952
Per, you haven't washed your hands yet.

307
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,288
Uh... later.

308
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,272
Per, Per.

309
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,936
Yes?
Pot.

310
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,616
If you want me to stop messing around,
then you should be my boyfriend.

311
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:14,224
The pot you're using for the soup, it's burnt.

312
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,520
Damn!

313
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:23,408
Hurry, bring that here, quickly!

314
00:25:34,752 --> 00:25:36,750
Hey, have you done the calculus yet?

315
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,960
I finished it last night.

316
00:25:37,992 --> 00:25:40,496
Damn, can I copy yours?

317
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,360
You ass, do it yourself!

318
00:25:42,392 --> 00:25:44,304
You copy me every time, idiot!

319
00:25:44,328 --> 00:25:45,832
Oh, you're so stingy!

320
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,960
Knight, Fern wants to talk to you about something.

321
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,392
Why aren't you answering my calls?

322
00:25:55,408 --> 00:25:57,390
I've called you so many times.

323
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,512
What's up?

324
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
It's about us.

325
00:26:02,032 --> 00:26:04,030
Are you really going to let it end like this?

326
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,976
There never was an "us" since the beginning.

327
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,512
We agreed there wouldn't be any crossing the line?

328
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,960
I have someone I like now,

329
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:17,660
so you should respect my lover.

330
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,592
But you told me you weren't seeing anyone!

331
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:24,152
If you were going to have a lover, it should be me!

332
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,096
Well, I have one now, and that's Mild.

333
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,648
Oh, that second-year medical student, right?

334
00:26:33,576 --> 00:26:35,016
What about me then?

335
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,696
We were just friends with benefits, Fern.

336
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,960
You told me that you were okay with this.

337
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,632
But I'm not okay with it now.

338
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,992
I think you should try to deal with your feelings first.

339
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,168
Do you have any questions to ask me?

340
00:27:33,712 --> 00:27:36,800
Um, so...

341
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,584
you and P'Fern...

342
00:27:53,592 --> 00:27:55,590
Fern and I are just friends with benefits.

343
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
We're both lonely, so we meet up.

344
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,824
There's nothing more to it than that.

345
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,368
So you don't really like her, right?

346
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,888
No, I don't like her.

347
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,280
Never ever.

348
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,960
The only person I like is Mild.

349
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,648
But I'm still not sure how to act with your "liking" me.

350
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,064
I need time.

351
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,832
Okay. I'm not rushing you for an answer or anything.

352
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,632
I'm totally up to you.

353
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,288
Just you wanted to get to know me better. I'd be happy.

354
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,480
Thank you.

355
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,264
Hmm... So where's the "sincerity award"?

356
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,672
Here it is! I'm hungry, let's order some food.

357
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:23,432
P'Kan, was the scene I just played okay?

358
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,848
But I feel like my charisma isn't as good as Knight's.

359
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,960
I'm not fierce enough.

360
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:35,584
I think it was okay, but you need to add a bit more intensity.

361
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:40,128
Or maybe I should try to act more stern during the action part?

362
00:29:40,424 --> 00:29:45,184
Hey... I think that's good, but you should be careful, Be safe.

363
00:29:45,224 --> 00:29:46,432
Be careful not to get hurt.

364
00:29:46,456 --> 00:29:49,608
Hey, let me try a standby for you so you can see how it is.

365
00:29:49,648 --> 00:29:51,610
Hey, just give it a try!

366
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,544
Oh Ahhhh..hh.

367
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:54,688
Hey, Safe!

368
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,968
Hey, are you alright?

369
00:29:57,008 --> 00:29:58,970
Hey... Carefully help him up.

370
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,080
Hey, I think we should take him to the hospital.

371
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,544
I'll take him then.

372
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,608
Clam down.

373
00:30:14,376 --> 00:30:18,408
Damn it! And who's going to play Tybalt for me?

374
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,552
There's one person... that guy, he'll definitely do it.

375
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,328
Who?

376
00:31:17,992 --> 00:31:19,104
Per!

377
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,960
Oh, did you miss me so much so you come to see me?

378
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:29,936
Uh, well...

379
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:31,120
Yes?

380
00:31:33,216 --> 00:31:35,220
Do you have some free time lately?

381
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,784
Don't tell me, are you going to try to sell me something?

382
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,960
Are you going to pull out a file and presentations?

383
00:31:43,888 --> 00:31:47,256
Are you interested in acting?

384
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,488
What do you mean?

385
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:59,288
The reason I come to see you today is to ask
if you're interested in performing in the play Romeo and Juliet.

386
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,984
My brother, who plays Tybalt, got injured.

387
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,128
You must be really stressed about this?

388
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,840
Not at all, I'm okay.

389
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,816
Then I'm not playing.

390
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:24,728
Per, please help me, please, please!

391
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,880
Beg me, and I'll play.

392
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,650
Make it super cute.

393
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,384
Per, please help me with the play, please, please!

394
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,600
Eh... should I agree or not?

395
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,432
Just a little more, little more.

396
00:32:50,464 --> 00:32:53,952
Make it sweet and super cute.

397
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,928
Per, please help me with the stage play, please... please.

398
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:09,080
This role really suits you, Per. Please... please.

399
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,888
Don't worry, I'll do my best.

400
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,240
You can rest assured.

401
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,264
Thank you so much, Per.

402
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,936
Is this your regular place?

403
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,968
Yeah... The doctors here really like eating at this restaurant.

404
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,328
Why are you acting so strangely today?

405
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,112
You cooked for me and now you're even helping me out.

406
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,768
Let me treat you back.

407
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,040
Or don't you want me to?

408
00:34:04,088 --> 00:34:06,808
Wait, I'll take it!

409
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,992
I'm going to eat well.

410
00:34:10,024 --> 00:34:13,064
This is the first meal you have ever treated me.

411
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,752
Yeah, order whatever you want,

412
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:17,960
because I don't know if there'll be another time.

413
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:22,504
There will be! But you have to be my boyfriend first, Doctor.

414
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,400
Then I'll pay you every meal.

415
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,872
Per, I'm a guy too,

416
00:34:31,856 --> 00:34:35,064
You don't have to take care of me or treat me like this.

417
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:41,712
Doctor, I'm not treating you like this
because you're a woman or a man.

418
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,968
I like you, so I just want to take care of you, that's all.

419
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,232
Yeah, it is.

420
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:02,984
If you want us to get to know each other better,

421
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,248
Let me take care of you sometimes.

422
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:13,968
Okay, I know you're good at taking care of others.

423
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:21,464
So... please take care of this little heart of mine.

424
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,808
Yeah, I get it!

425
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,944
Just order. What do you want to eat? Just order.

426
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,904
Are you really not going to let me drop you off?

427
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:53,624
Yeah, I can go back by myself.

428
00:35:53,664 --> 00:35:55,440
You can go back now. Go back safely,

429
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,144
and don't bail on me tomorrow.

430
00:35:57,168 --> 00:35:59,336
5 PM at the rehearsal room, okay!

431
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,848
Yes, I won't miss a chance to see you.

432
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,968
Tell me when you've arrived.

433
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,952
Alright, you can go home now.

434
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:09,960
Give me a hug.

435
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,432
No way, there are too many people.

436
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,040
Per, let me go!

437
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:15,896
I'm leaving now.

438
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,168
Yeah, go ahead.

439
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,016
I'm leaving.

440
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:21,976
Yeah.

441
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,944
Just go ahead.

442
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:42,820
New kid? Yes.

443
00:36:42,824 --> 00:36:43,888
It's Tybalt.

444
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:44,976
P'Kan.

445
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,312
I bought some snacks

446
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,952
for you and your friends.

447
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:53,752
Here, he bought it for you guys.

448
00:36:53,784 --> 00:36:54,912
Thanks a lot.

449
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:56,216
Yeah.

450
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,240
Is that why you're late because you went to buy snacks?

451
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,208
Oh.. I knew you'd be tired.

452
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,760
I'm a doctor too, just like you.

453
00:37:06,984 --> 00:37:08,496
Let me get it for you.

454
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,856
Here.

455
00:37:18,896 --> 00:37:20,168
Have you eaten yet?

456
00:37:21,144 --> 00:37:23,140
I intended to buy it for you.

457
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,024
Whoa...

458
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:28,352
Hey bro.

459
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,520
What's up? You smile sweetly at Doctor,

460
00:37:31,544 --> 00:37:34,672
or do you only like it when Knight pat your head?

461
00:37:34,696 --> 00:37:35,976
Are you gonna rehearse, Per?

462
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,504
Stop bothering Mild.

463
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,104
Oh, I'm new here, you know.

464
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:43,240
I need to introduce myself first.

465
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,848
Come introduce yourself to me.

466
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,688
Damn it!

467
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,592
Why do I have to be Tybalt for you to kill?

468
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,704
Go light incense and ask Shakespeare.

469
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,104
Hey, clam down!

470
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,416
Clam down!

471
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,936
That's Romeo, the coward of the Montagues.

472
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,968
That's Tybalt, the scum of the Capulets!

473
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,336
You ass! Do you want to fight?!

474
00:38:30,376 --> 00:38:31,408
Yeah, I do. Do you want?

475
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,920
Come on!

476
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:34,704
Hey.
Wait.

477
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:36,344
What the hell are you guys playing at?

478
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,936
Look at Knight! He started first! Please deal with him.

479
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,944
Take a look, he hit me first.

480
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:46,376
Hey, calm down! Aren't you friends?

481
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,584
Don't fight, okay? Please.

482
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,968
Alright, I won't fight anymore.

483
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,208
Great.

484
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:06,104
Doctor, action scenes aren't fun.

485
00:39:06,312 --> 00:39:09,864
Can I rehearse a love scene with you, just the two of us?

486
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,000
Knight, stab him to death!

487
00:39:19,216 --> 00:39:21,400
Oh Doctor, why are you doing this?

488
00:39:21,432 --> 00:39:23,560
Doctor, wait for me!

489
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,184
Doctor!

490
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,504
Doctor!

491
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,112
Mild, how are you going back home?

492
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:53,576
Oh, I'll call P'Mud to pick me up.

493
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,128
I'll drop you off.

494
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,000
Hey, it's okay.

495
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,928
You rehearsed a lot of action scenes today.
You should go home and rest.

496
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,568
It's alright.

497
00:40:04,912 --> 00:40:06,570
We barely talked today.

498
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,328
Let me drop you off..

499
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:21,120
Okay, then I'll call P' Mud first and tell him I'm going back b.

500
00:40:29,152 --> 00:40:30,104
So cute.

501
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:47,584
Hey!

502
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:08,648
Hello, I'll go back home by myself today, um.

503
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,472
I'm so sleepy.

504
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,216
Does anyone want coffee?

505
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,232
Me! Kan, do you want some? I'll treat you.

506
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:53,216
That's weird. Why are you treating me?

507
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,968
Well, I've seen you rehearsing hard for the play lately,

508
00:41:57,370 --> 00:42:00,760
and I heard N' Safe fell down the stairs, right?

509
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,632
So, how's the new person?

510
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,960
Oh, you mean that Per?

511
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,168
It takes forever to get rehearsal each day.

512
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,328
But it's okay.

513
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,792
So, what's going on between you and him?

514
00:42:27,136 --> 00:42:29,140
Uh, well...

515
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,408
once I got to know him, he wasn't that bad,

516
00:42:34,216 --> 00:42:37,592
So I decided...

517
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,568
to let him date me.

518
00:42:49,136 --> 00:42:51,952
Hey, congrats!

519
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:55,240
You're too quick to congratulate me.

520
00:42:55,288 --> 00:42:56,728
I don't even know if it'll work out yet.

521
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,376
I'll go grab some coffee.

522
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,544
Hey... uh..., I'd rather have milk tea.

523
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,032
Natcha!

524
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,288
You're in such a hurry.

525
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,520
Is anyone sitting here?

526
00:43:27,728 --> 00:43:29,520
Oh, no one's sitting here.

527
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,864
Thank you.

528
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:35,016
What's your name? I'm Kan.

529
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm Natcha.

530
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,944
And why do you want to be a doctor?

531
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,552
Well... it's like... I like helping people.

532
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,528
And you?

533
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:51,530
I also want to help people.

534
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,536
Natcha, wake up!

535
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,216
Everyone else has left.

536
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,784
Huh... did I fall asleep?

537
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,040
Oh no, I slept through the first class?

538
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,752
I'm definitely going to fall class.

539
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:14,750
Hey, you can borrow my lecture.

540
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,048
Really?

541
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,312
It won't bother you?

542
00:44:19,584 --> 00:44:20,712
Doesn't bother me at all.

543
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:21,304
Here!

544
00:44:21,432 --> 00:44:22,768
Thank you.

545
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,992
Natcha, your cheek.

546
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:31,064
My cheek? What about my cheek?

547
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,344
Ink.

548
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,168
Hey, really?

549
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:38,104
Where is it?

550
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:39,328
Has it come out yet?

551
00:44:39,368 --> 00:44:41,330
Come here,

552
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,824
It's okay, I'll wipe it myself.

553
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:09,560
Yes.

554
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:32,304
What's wrong with you?

555
00:48:33,808 --> 00:48:40,456
I did something so stupid.

556
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:48,208
If he finds out, he's definitely going to hate me.

557
00:48:56,072 --> 00:48:59,544
He won't hate you. No matter what you do.

558
00:49:03,296 --> 00:49:05,752
I really don't want him to hate me.

559
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,976
I like him,

560
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:12,440
but I don't know what else I can do now.

561
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,120
I think you should just give up.

562
00:49:19,536 --> 00:49:21,540
If you can't handle it, just step back.

563
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,408
Believe me, he'll understand.

564
00:49:34,904 --> 00:49:36,544
Can I try it first?

565
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:40,672
Don't cry.

566
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,672
Aren't your friends joining this meal?

567
00:50:04,976 --> 00:50:07,168
Oh, Klah went to buy snacks.

568
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:10,416
And Mild probably went to eat with P'Knight already.

569
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,512
I saw them leave right after class finished.

570
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,608
Are Mild and Knight dating?

571
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,704
It seems like it, but it's not 100% yet.

572
00:50:19,024 --> 00:50:22,408
I saw P'Knight just offer to drop Mild off home.

573
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:26,400
What kind of person is Mild?

574
00:50:26,432 --> 00:50:28,128
I haven't met him yet?

575
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:32,432
He's a really good person, seriously. He's kind, loves his friends.

576
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:34,660
Everyone in the faculty loves him.

577
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:39,520
Wow... Mild is that good, Does he have any flaws?

578
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:43,968
That's hard. I'll let you know when I find out.

579
00:50:56,656 --> 00:50:58,584
Oh, I forgot.

580
00:50:58,608 --> 00:51:00,608
I have another class. I'm leaving now.

581
00:51:01,648 --> 00:51:02,610
Oh, okay.

582
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:17,752
Hey, you were gone a long time. Was the que line long?

583
00:51:17,792 --> 00:51:20,392
How could you tell her about us like that?

584
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:25,144
My girlfriend wants to get to know you guys. That's fine.

585
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:28,688
Don't you feel that she didn't ask about me at all?

586
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:30,856
She only asks about Mild.

587
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:34,288
Hey, are you upset my girlfriend didn't ask about you?

588
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,144
You ass! I'm serious.

589
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,984
Don't just tell anyone about us so easily!

590
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:41,880
I just told you my girlfriend can be trusted.

591
00:51:41,912 --> 00:51:42,872
What's your problem?

592
00:51:42,896 --> 00:51:44,680
So, you trust your girlfriend more than me?

593
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,696
Yeah.

594
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:47,904
Yeah, you ass! Then there's nothing more to talk about.

595
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,952
Hey Klah!

596
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,960
Klah!
