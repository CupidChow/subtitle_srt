00:00:50,782 --> 00:00:51,852
(Previously)

3
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,982
A year has passed, but the memories are so vivid.

4
00:00:56,692 --> 00:01:00,221
In a single day, everything changed.

5
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:02,291
Why would my dad die all of a sudden?

6
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,261
I'm reporter Lee Jin Woo from Times.

7
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:05,731
I never agreed to an interview.

8
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:06,801
Hello?

9
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:08,761
Let's do the interview already.

10
00:01:09,272 --> 00:01:10,801
It's 2020 here.

11
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:13,901
And you're in 2015.

12
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:16,041
Hello, I'm Seo Ki Tae.

13
00:01:16,212 --> 00:01:17,971
Mr. Seo will die?

14
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,041
Please save my father, Jin Woo.

15
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:22,551
As soon as this is over, you'll both live.

16
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,822
Both my father, and you, Jin Woo.

17
00:01:29,452 --> 00:01:30,791
How...

18
00:01:31,322 --> 00:01:32,962
It really has changed.

19
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:34,692
A hit-and-run?

20
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:37,692
So you're telling me people will keep trying to kill your dad?

21
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,901
Please follow my father.

22
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:42,201
To see how the incident was fabricated...

23
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:44,171
And who fabricated it, right?

24
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:46,871
Some guy was dressed just like Seo Ki Tae.

25
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:49,412
Did you lose him?

26
00:01:49,412 --> 00:01:51,072
Ms. Seo. Hello?

27
00:01:51,772 --> 00:01:54,141
What if they changed their plans again?

28
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:55,541
Han Do Kyung.

29
00:01:55,912 --> 00:01:57,281
- Ms. Kim, I... - Why are you trying...

30
00:01:57,281 --> 00:01:58,681
to change the past?

31
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,552
How meaningless.

32
00:02:00,552 --> 00:02:02,391
Don't rely on Jin Woo anymore.

33
00:02:02,391 --> 00:02:03,951
I made it that way.

34
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:08,492
Who ordered you to kill me?

35
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:10,862
I'll get you out of here.

36
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:15,231
It's Team Leader Han Do Kyung of Ma Un Police Station.

37
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:16,972
The culprit has changed.

38
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:18,671
Are you certain it's Do Kyung that I know?

39
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,341
The only one who can change the past...

40
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,742
is you, reporter Lee Jin Woo.

41
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:27,181
What's happening?

42
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,841
- What on earth is going on? - What is that?

43
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:50,731
(Visitor Pass)

44
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:53,002
You were right.

45
00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:55,072
Geun Woo didn't commit suicide.

46
00:02:56,141 --> 00:02:57,342
But he was murdered.

47
00:02:58,072 --> 00:03:00,081
And I've been keeping it from you all this time.

48
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:03,312
What... What do you mean?

49
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:05,782
You're making a fool of yourself right now.

50
00:03:05,782 --> 00:03:08,051
That jerk whose life you saved twice.

51
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:09,551
That jerk...

52
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:11,021
Dad.

53
00:03:11,852 --> 00:03:12,991
He killed Geun Woo.

54
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:15,831
The presidential candidate of the Democratic People's Party,

55
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:16,991
Seo Ki Tae.

56
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:20,562
Seo Jung In played you.

57
00:03:21,562 --> 00:03:23,032
This isn't right, Jin Woo.

58
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:26,342
If you help him, Geun Woo would be heartbroken.

59
00:03:26,342 --> 00:03:27,372
All because of what you did.

60
00:03:32,072 --> 00:03:33,812
What's going on? You came all the way here.

61
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,211
I wanted to see you, Dad.

62
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:39,782
What's wrong? Did something happen?

63
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:41,551
I just...

64
00:03:42,152 --> 00:03:44,551
wanted to see your face.

65
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:45,861
Why, this little...

66
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:47,861
Wait just a moment.

67
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,791
I'll wrap up my meeting and come to you right away.

68
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,162
All right. I'll wait.

69
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,671
(Authorized Personnel Only)

70
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,812
Why do you think I wasn't able...

71
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:13,451
to reinvestigate the case despite all your pleas?

72
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,122
It's because the higher-ups kept blocking it.

73
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,852
The reason they covered it up as a suicide,

74
00:04:17,852 --> 00:04:19,592
the reason they kept blocking attempts to reinvestigate,

75
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,122
they're all Seo Ki Tae.

76
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:29,301
You really must be in a rush.

77
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:31,331
Seeing as you you're even trying to pull Geun Woo into this.

78
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:32,741
What is it?

79
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:34,701
Did the guys you're taking orders from, tell you to say that?

80
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:36,812
Did they tell you to say that...

81
00:04:36,812 --> 00:04:39,141
- if you fail to kill Seo Ki Tae? - That's not it, you jerk.

82
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:41,541
Your younger brother was really murdered by...

83
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,652
Stop spouting nonsense! You jerk.

84
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:46,021
Why can't you come to your senses?

85
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:47,922
- Jin Woo. - Don't say my name.

86
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,292
Who's the one giving you orders?

87
00:04:56,232 --> 00:04:57,362
Just tell me that.

88
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:01,002
Who made you do that?

89
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:03,132
Who ordered you to kill Seo Ki Tae?

90
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:05,531
No one ordered me to do it.

91
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:07,542
Seo Ki Tae murdered Geun Woo.

92
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:09,442
That's a fact.

93
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:12,482
If no one made you do it,

94
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,312
why do you die in two days?

95
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,011
Jung In called me and told me,

96
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:19,822
that you commit suicide in exactly two days.

97
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,151
I don't know who's behind you,

98
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:24,451
but you're no different...

99
00:05:24,451 --> 00:05:26,562
from Kim Jin Chul or Jo Kang Shik to people like that.

100
00:05:30,732 --> 00:05:32,732
I'll catch the ones behind this,

101
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:35,901
so if you change your mind in the next two days, call me.

102
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,312
That way, you can live.

103
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:05,261
How do I make a phone call?

104
00:06:05,862 --> 00:06:08,161
If you put in a request, you can make one tomorrow.

105
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:10,201
Who are you trying to call?

106
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:24,382
(A country where people can dream! Candidate 1, Seo Ki Tae)

107
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,451
(Candidate Seo Ki Tae Pushes Forward with Campaign)

108
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:35,391
How much work do you have that you're always working late?

109
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:39,091
Is Seo Ki Tae the kind of boss who overworks and underpays?

110
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:40,261
He's not like that.

111
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:42,802
Although I don't know everything about him yet.

112
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,072
You're his aide, but you still don't know him after three years?

113
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:46,401
Jin Woo.

114
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:49,042
Look over there.

115
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:51,011
If you look over there,

116
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:53,542
you can only see the parts that are lit up.

117
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:57,351
No one knows what's in the unlit parts.

118
00:06:58,511 --> 00:06:59,922
I think people are like that too.

119
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:03,091
What are you trying to say?

120
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:07,622
I see, so you're saying there are a lot of shady parts to Seo Ki Tae?

121
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:11,292
I don't know.

122
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,812
(Times)

123
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:31,252
There really isn't anything wrong?

124
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,581
No.

125
00:07:33,982 --> 00:07:37,692
I just had a lot of work these past few days,

126
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,591
and I'd become exhausted,

127
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:43,492
but now that I've seen your face, I feel fine.

128
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:45,961
I'm sorry for crying for no reason.

129
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,002
All right. That surprised me.

130
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,531
You never cry.

131
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:54,042
You must've had a lot of work.

132
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:55,771
I thought so too,

133
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,872
but in hindsight,

134
00:07:57,872 --> 00:08:00,182
I think it was work that I needed to do.

135
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:03,211
Before that, I took things for granted,

136
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:06,182
though now I've realized how precious they are.

137
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:08,752
Within just a few days,

138
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:11,151
my daughter seems to have gone through a lot.

139
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:12,492
Tell me about it.

140
00:08:12,922 --> 00:08:16,461
If you open up about it, maybe you'll feel better.

141
00:08:17,432 --> 00:08:20,002
I can't tell you everything right now,

142
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:21,601
but I will later.

143
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:25,372
I also want to introduce you to some people.

144
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:28,872
I've met some really good people recently.

145
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:30,911
What kind of people?

146
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:36,182
They're a bit awkward or clumsy.

147
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:39,482
What courageous fool ate ox knee soup again?

148
00:08:39,482 --> 00:08:40,552

I hope you end up looking like Park Bo Gum.

You will look like Park Bo Gum.

152
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:46,792

154
00:08:47,992 --> 00:08:49,322
Don't look like an old fogey.

155
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:50,761
Why can't I get a loan?

156
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:52,391
We're a media company too.

157
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:54,632
Aren't you in the media industry?

158
00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:58,802
Maybe it's because I met them while going through hard times,

159
00:08:58,802 --> 00:09:00,841
but I've grown fond of them.

160
00:09:01,672 --> 00:09:04,672
I know you'll like them too, once you meet them.

161
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:08,211
By any chance...

162
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:10,782
By any chance what?

163
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:12,682
You're not trying to get your friends jobs, right?

164
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,621
Of course not.

165
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,091
Why would I do that so blatantly?

166
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:19,221
All right, then it's fine.

167
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:21,892
Once my term is over,

168
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:24,091
set a date and introduce me.

169
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:27,101
I'm sure I'll like people that my daughter likes.

170
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:29,432
I will.

At that time, let's have a drink of soju,

00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:19,152
(A country where people can dream! Seo Ki Tae)

183
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:26,422
It appears he fled the country.

184
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,461
I'm sorry, I should've noticed from the beginning.

185
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:33,001
It's all due to my inattention.

186
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,971
But I never suspected Secretary Choi would do that.

187
00:10:37,672 --> 00:10:40,341
It might be for the better,

188
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:43,042
since you found out before entering the Blue House.

189
00:10:43,412 --> 00:10:44,471
That's true.

190
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,981
Still, I believed we would be together for the long haul.

191
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,111
Make sure you're careful, and that word of Secretary Choi...

192
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:52,211
isn't leaked to the police.

193
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:54,251
Yes, don't worry.

194
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:58,392
Did you confirm who spoke to Han Do Kyung last?

195
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:01,192
According to the police, it's a number that doesn't exist.

196
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:03,192
It appears to have been erased as soon as the call was completed,

197
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:05,091
so we're trying to find out through the telecom companies.

198
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:09,731
The party suspects that Candidate Kim Seong Gu...

199
00:11:09,731 --> 00:11:12,371
is behind his attempt.

200
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:15,442
There's something strange about this.

201
00:11:16,172 --> 00:11:19,241
And I wonder about Secretary Choi too.

202
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:23,951
Can you find something out for me?

203
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:25,351
Could I meet Candidate Seo?

204
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:27,652
I only need a moment.

205
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,162
(A country where people can dream!)

206
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:43,532
I was worried about you anyway, and was planning to call.

207
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:45,532
Are you hurt anywhere?

208
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:48,371
I'm fine. I went to the hospital to get checked out.

209
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:51,241
Are you all right?

210
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:53,711
I'm fine, thanks to you.

211
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:56,251
They say you have a relationship with someone who passes you by,

212
00:11:56,251 --> 00:11:57,451
so we must have quite a deep relationship,

213
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:00,081
since I owe you such a great debt.

214
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:03,221
What do you mean by debt? You're not indebted to me.

215
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:06,762
Okay. Why did you come here today without telling me first?

216
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:16,231
There's something I'd like to ask you.

217
00:12:20,701 --> 00:12:23,741
My question might make you feel uncomfortable,

218
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:26,581
but in spite of it, I'll still ask.

219
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,581
Is there something I don't know...

220
00:12:30,012 --> 00:12:31,812
about Geun Woo's death?

221
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:34,922
- What do you mean? - Someone told me...

222
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:37,552
that you killed my brother.

223
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:40,192
Is that true?

224
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,961
What kind of answer do you want to hear to ask me that?

225
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:44,491
Of course, I want the truth.

226
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,432
Okay.

227
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:51,101
I'll tell you the truth you seek, Mr. Lee.

228
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:52,272
It's true.

229
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:56,512
I killed Geun Woo.

230
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:05,111
What are you thinking about?

231
00:13:05,782 --> 00:13:06,981
You know.

232
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:09,282
This bill...

233
00:13:09,282 --> 00:13:12,152
is something Geun Woo and I have been working on for three years.

234
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:15,292
I'm getting thoughtful as we failed.

235
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:18,861
Let's not think about work today...

236
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:20,961
and just get some rest.

237
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:22,762
I think we chose a bad spot.

238
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:24,001
Just wait.

239
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:26,601
It's nice and pretty.

240
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,512
It's Geun Woo.

241
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:39,552
- What did he say? - He wants to know if I could meet.

242
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:43,091
That's good. Tell him to come.

243
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:44,851
I told him we should talk tomorrow.

244
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,861
I want to get some rest today.

245
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:51,461
That night, I got a call on my way back.

246
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,131
I found out that your brother,

247
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:55,432
(Lee Geun Woo)

248
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,032
Geun Woo, passed away.

249
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:05,042
It wasn't the first time that I've experienced it,

250
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:09,211
but it was a first for Geun Woo.

251
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:13,981
I regretted it so much.

252
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:17,652
If I went to him right after I got that text and listened to him,

253
00:14:18,152 --> 00:14:20,961
he might have made a different decision.

254
00:14:23,932 --> 00:14:26,932
On the day that I decided to rest without thinking about anything,

255
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,062
Geun Woo...

256
00:14:29,772 --> 00:14:31,532
decided to die.

257
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:36,841
I'm sorry. Let me ask you one more question.

258
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:40,381
Have you ever put pressure on anything...

259
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:42,182
regarding Geun Woo's investigation?

260
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:45,111
I did speak with the chief of the police station in charge.

261
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:46,922
I asked him to catch the murderer...

262
00:14:46,922 --> 00:14:49,081
and bring him to me if it's a murder.

263
00:14:49,081 --> 00:14:53,221
That's probably why the investigation progressed so quickly.

264
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:56,562
I see.

265
00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:00,432
If there was a misunderstanding, please clear it.

266
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:01,902
I'm sorry.

267
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:05,932
It's okay. I should be sorry...

268
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:07,642
for coming here unannounced.

269
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:09,101
It's okay.

270
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,172
Mr. Lee.

271
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:16,412
I'll be sure to create the world...

272
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:19,951
that Geun Woo wanted.

273
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:23,922
A world where people don't need to give up and can have dreams.

274
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,322
I'll repay my debts to you that way.

275
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:34,032
Could you wait for it?

276
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:38,201
Yes. I'll keep an eye out for it.

277
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:44,471
(Candidate Number 1, Seo Ki Tae)

278
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:51,951
Where does he think this is for him to show up here?

279
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,552
I'm sure he came to be thanked.

280
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:57,351
He saved his life. Twice.

281
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,861
The more I look at him, the more different the two brothers are.

282
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:05,562
Geun Woo was really polite.

283
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:08,062
Why? I think they're the same.

284
00:16:08,062 --> 00:16:11,172
They both stick their noses into other people's business.

285

286
00:16:33,662 --> 00:16:36,631
(Seo Jung In)

287
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:42,461
- Jin Woo. - Hey.

288
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,631
I'm coming back from meeting my father.

289
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:47,942
Everything is really over now.

290
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:50,942
I want to thank you once again.

291
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:52,642
That's good.

292
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:55,211
Is something wrong? You don't sound good.

293
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,782
What do you mean?

294
00:16:57,012 --> 00:16:58,812
I just met Do Kyung.

295
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,152
- What did he say? - It's all a bunch of nonsense.

296
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:02,451
It's better if you didn't know.

297
00:17:02,782 --> 00:17:03,892
But...

298
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:06,392
I'm certain there's someone behind Do Kyung.

299
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,792
Since we saved my father, we need to find out who they are now.

300
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:12,231
I'll just help until we find out the mastermind behind Do Kyung.

301
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,701
Thank you, Jin Woo.

302
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,572
But will you be okay?

303
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:21,572
You said that Mr. Seo... I mean, Mr. President is alive.

304
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:25,711
What could possibly happen now?

305
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:38,591
Anyway, I'll look into the cases Do Kyung was in charge of.

306
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,022
Okay.

307
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:51,901
- Hello. - Hello.

308
00:17:54,702 --> 00:17:57,212
- Go on in. - Thank you.

309
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:04,881
- Welcome. - Hello.

310
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,232
"Current Events Desk", let's have a meeting.

311
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,502
- Shin Wook! - What?

312
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:22,931
Can we talk for a second?

313
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:28,772
There's something I need to look into,

314
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:30,641
and I looked through our database...

315
00:18:30,641 --> 00:18:32,611
and found out you were in charge of it.

316
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,341
- What is it? - The assassination attempt...

317
00:18:34,341 --> 00:18:36,081
on my father in 2015.

318
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:40,121
I think it's strange how they didn't find out who was behind it.

319
00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:44,992
That's because the criminal said nobody was behind it...

320
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:46,621
in the suicide note he left behind.

321
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:48,591
The investigation and the story coverage ended there.

322
00:18:48,591 --> 00:18:52,062
Have you seen Han Do Kyung's suicide letter?

323
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:55,202
I don't think it was revealed for various reasons.

324
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:57,072
The detention center just sent out a press release...

325
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:59,202
regarding the part about the mastermind.

326
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:09,899
Every journalist out there is making a fuss over Mr. Han.

327
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:12,729
They're all desperate to get their hands on this case report.

328
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:14,498
I barely managed to get this from reporter Choi.

329
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:16,068
He had been going to Ma Un Police Station for a while now.

330
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:17,568
Good job.

331
00:19:17,568 --> 00:19:19,508
I'll call reporter Choi myself. You can wrap things up and go home.

332
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:20,578
Okay.

333
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:22,679
This is why...

334
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,778
you can never know who someone is even if you've known them forever.

335
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:27,248
I didn't expect this from Han Do Kyung.

00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:06,669
Just ask her yourself later.

537
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,479
- I need you to do something. - What is it?

538
00:32:09,939 --> 00:32:11,109
- A wiretap. - What?

539
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:13,278
- A wiretap? - Whenever you have time,

540
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:14,479
study up on wiretapping.

541
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:16,548
If you learn it, it'll become a great boon for you,

542
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:18,518
in exactly five years.

543
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:19,818
Five years.

544
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:25,828
Are you ready?

545
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:27,088
Of course.

546
00:32:27,828 --> 00:32:30,359
It's been five years since we've been ready.

547
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:32,598
- Five years? - Yes, five years.

548
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:34,869
It really has been five years.

549
00:32:35,699 --> 00:32:37,498
Why are you taking a photo?

550
00:32:37,838 --> 00:32:40,169
You darn otaku. Why would you take a photo?

551
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:41,238
Erase it, now.

552
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:44,960
Get out. Get out, everyone, out.

553
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,491
Especially you, get out.

554
00:32:47,491 --> 00:32:49,531
Are you firing us?

555
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:51,200
I love it here.

556
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,271
That's not it. I'm just telling you to get out.

557
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:53,531
I don't want to get out.

558
00:32:53,531 --> 00:32:55,140
This is going to be the company I work at forever.

559
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,440
That's not what I mean.

560
00:32:56,801 --> 00:32:58,470
I'm telling you to leave work and go home for the day.

561
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,541
Everyone, go have dinner on the company card.

562
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:00,940
What's going on?

563
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:03,611
Here, go.

564
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:06,811
It's five dollars per person. Go.

565
00:33:06,811 --> 00:33:08,781
What? What can I do with this?

566
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:10,450
What a cockroach.

567
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,551
Okay, okay, what did she say?

568
00:33:11,551 --> 00:33:13,291
Only good things.

569
00:33:13,321 --> 00:33:14,720
All right.

570
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,890
Don't be too grateful. We all need this once in a while.

571
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,230
Could I get your autograph, please?

572
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,960
You little otaku.

573
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:25,301
- Gosh. - You're scaring her.

574
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,400
Now they're out.

575
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,571
Shall we begin?

576
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,281
Move over.

577
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,311
What a guy, just sitting there.

578
00:33:42,781 --> 00:33:44,451
That was so...

579
00:33:46,951 --> 00:33:48,020
Gosh.

580
00:33:56,531 --> 00:33:59,770
First, I'll go up to Detective Oh and provoke him.

581
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:04,310
So that he gets scared and goes to the mastermind himself.

582
00:34:04,571 --> 00:34:05,971
What are you talking about?

583
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:10,940
I did what with Han Do Kyung?

584
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,920
Excuse me, Detective Oh.

585
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,621
If a reporter came to you with this information,

586
00:34:19,321 --> 00:34:20,850
don't you know what it means?

587
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,661
Are you reporting this?

588
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,130
Correct!

589
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:29,330
I'll report it on tomorrow's evening news.

590
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,971
Detective Oh from Ma Un Police Serious Crime Team 2...

591
00:34:31,971 --> 00:34:35,201
collaborated with Han Do Kyung, who attempted to murder Seo Ki Tae.

592
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:37,141
They have a deeply intertwined relationship...

593
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:38,511
- Hey! - What?

594
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:43,580
I've gathered all the evidence, and I have confirmed testimonies.

595
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,480
So...

596
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:53,520
I hope you enjoy the four meals you have left in freedom.

597
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,391
You know jail food is terrible, right?

598
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:10,871
So he'll meet with the person in charge to ask to be saved,

599
00:35:10,871 --> 00:35:13,210
- I'm sure he'll be persistent. - That's right.

600
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,080
And we'll end up at their meeting spot...

601
00:35:17,341 --> 00:35:18,480
to tap it.

602
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,051
Gosh.

603
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,391
Don't worry about it. It's because this is used.

604
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:28,991
It works just fine.

605
00:35:33,761 --> 00:35:35,730
(Ma Un Police Station)

606
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,571
Why isn't he coming out?

607
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,900
Maybe he just called them from his desk?

608
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,871
They'll definitely call him out to meet in person,

609
00:35:44,871 --> 00:35:48,310
since they'll be worried about whether they were exposed.

610
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,500
He's the colleague who was closest to my husband.

611
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,270
Even at the funeral, none of his colleagues came,

612
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,911
except for him.

613
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:22,710
You really won't publish anything on this?

614
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,781
Of course not.

615
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:26,080
I'll make sure you don't suffer any consequences,

616
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,920
so please relax and tell me everything you can.

617
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,290
First of all, things are different from how they were reported.

618
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:34,790
After Cheol Ho died,

619
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:38,861
the company started saying he was meeting with an outsider.

620
00:36:39,761 --> 00:36:41,361
It wasn't an internal incident?

621
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,201
Not at all.

622
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,500
I saw him leaving his coworkers,

623
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,040
on my way home that night.

624
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,100
He said he had to meet someone, and that he was leaving first.

625
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,911
Then do you know anything about that meeting?

626
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:56,940
He didn't take his car,

627
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,380
so I assumed he was going to drink.

628
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:04,150
He did say he was going to Myeong-dong.

629
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,161
Myeong-dong. I'll be there in 10 minutes.

630
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:10,391
I just met with someone.

631
00:37:10,591 --> 00:37:14,560
This is just a rumor...

632
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,600
Thank you for your time.

633
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:21,371
I'll take my leave then.

634
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:26,940
Yes, I asked the card company and got it from them.

635
00:37:28,141 --> 00:37:29,380
Just a moment.

636
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,380
(Card Usage Report)

637
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,181
That day,

638
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,350
he took the subway in front of the office,

639
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,991
and got off at Myeong-dong Station at 18:58.

640
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:44,861
At 19:50, he got on the bus returning home from Myeong-dong.

641
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,861
7:50pm?

642
00:37:54,031 --> 00:37:56,071
Why did you write down my name for something I didn't eat?

643
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:58,371
- We can just total it. - I just had ox bone soup.

644
00:37:58,371 --> 00:37:59,571
Do the math.

645
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:01,170
- There's only three of us... - Hey, guys.

646
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,681
Last year, the office was broken into once, right?

647
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:06,710
When I went to the country because of Geun Woo?

648
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,991
It was broken into, but nothing was taken.

649
00:38:11,991 --> 00:38:14,290
It was searched though, so it was scary.

650
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,491
The same thing happened at your place not long after.

651
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:17,861
Gosh, how scary.

652
00:38:19,361 --> 00:38:20,431
Jin Woo.

653
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,531
Chairman Kwon Min Soo did that.

654
00:38:23,531 --> 00:38:25,770
When you were investigating labor at Yeseok Electric,

655
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,040
we got angry and wrote a bunch of special reports,

656
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,741
which got them all riled up.

657
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,170
What is it now?

658
00:38:33,341 --> 00:38:35,911
There was a rumor that Cheol Ho didn't take money,

659
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,210
but certain documents from the company.

660
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,951
After his death, I looked into...

661
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:44,480
all of the hard copies of his documents too.

662
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,491
I just met with someone.

663
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,690
I have something to give you too.

664
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:50,621
Mr. Han, we need to investigate further.

665
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:53,290
We need to search in other places, not just here.

666
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:55,801
The guy who was with Han Do Kyung when I was kidnapped,

667
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:57,330
Detective Oh Jung Shik.

668
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:03,040
The person who ransacked this place might not have been Chairman Kwon.

669
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,111
- Then who? - If Geun Woo got...

670
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:07,371
something from Choi Cheol Ho that night,

671
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,080
and was trying to get those materials to me...

672
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,150
Darn it.

673
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,580
- Hey, Jin Woo. - Jin Woo?

674
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:21,020
Chase after him, quickly. Go with him now.

675
00:39:21,121 --> 00:39:22,821
- I... - Hurry up and go!

676
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:24,190
Can I use the company card?

677
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:32,670
Jin Woo, Jin Woo.

678
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,531
Hey, Jin Woo.

679
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,141
Hey, you know you're out of your mind now, right?

680
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:40,611
Consult with me before you do anything rash.

681
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:41,781
I need to meet with Do Kyung.

682
00:39:41,781 --> 00:39:43,710
He's definitely hiding something from me.

683
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,080
- Like what? - The thing Geun Woo left behind.

684
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,850
What do you think that is?

685
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,920
Geun Woo might have died because of that.

686
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:53,091
I have to find it.

687
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:54,350
I need to find it to figure out who killed him.

688
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,420
Hey, hey. Stop already.

689
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,531
We didn't find anything when we put his things in order.

690
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:00,630
Let go.

691
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,230
You're going to cause more trouble again.

692
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,400
I said it's not possible.

693
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,830
A prisoner on trial can only receive one visit per day.

694
00:40:08,141 --> 00:40:10,871
Han Do Kyung has already had his visit for the day.

695
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:12,911
I'm asking who that visitor was?

696
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,371
He has no friends or family.

697
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,580
I cannot tell you that.

698
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:18,451
(Open campus, a hopeful future)

699
00:40:18,451 --> 00:40:20,281
Let me ask you for this favor.

700
00:40:20,281 --> 00:40:22,951
I have to tell him something, and so does he.

701
00:40:22,951 --> 00:40:25,250
How many times do I have to tell you?

702
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,951
It's not within my power.

703
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:28,491
He might die!

704
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:31,261
Jin Woo, calm down. We can come back tomorrow.

705
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,531
Jin Woo, let's go.

706
00:40:33,661 --> 00:40:35,761
Where are you going? The car's over here.

707
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:37,330
Wait.

708
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,031
What are you up to now?

709
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:42,600
Just a minute. I only need a minute.

710
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,400
Just a minute.

711
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,841
- I said I just need a minute. - I'm sorry.

712
00:40:46,841 --> 00:40:49,210
Let me go. I have to meet with Do Kyung.

713
00:41:04,761 --> 00:41:06,460
Hey. Wake up. He came out.

714
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,730
Who? What?

715
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,931
Hold on. Put your head down.

716
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:14,000
He might see us.

717
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,770
- Put your head down. Hurry. - This is as far as I can go.

718
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,511
He didn't see us. Let's go.

719
00:41:18,511 --> 00:41:19,810
I'm going to follow him now.

720
00:41:29,681 --> 00:41:31,350
Where on earth is he going?

721
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,491
Don't get too close. We might get caught.

722
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:47,630
This must be it.

723
00:41:52,841 --> 00:41:54,781
A Japanese restaurant is easier to wiretap...

724
00:41:54,781 --> 00:41:55,940
because they have separate rooms.

725
00:41:56,741 --> 00:41:59,281

726
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:00,750

728

729
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:25,371

- You said you charged it. - When did I say that?

744
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,721
You said that you would do it earlier.

745
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:52,230

I was telling you I was unplugging your phone to charge mine.

747

753

754
00:44:15,181 --> 00:44:17,281

00:59:52,933 --> 00:59:54,373
I guess you saw it all now.

893
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:56,844
The evidence Mr. Kang handed to you.

894
00:59:56,844 --> 00:59:58,003
My brother...

895
00:59:58,973 --> 01:00:00,174
You killed my brother.

896
01:00:00,543 --> 01:00:01,844
Why would you say that?

897
01:00:01,844 --> 01:00:03,114
You already heard...

898
01:00:03,114 --> 01:00:04,884
that Seo Ki Tae killed him, from Han Do Kyung.

899
01:00:04,884 --> 01:00:06,083
Don't spout nonsense.

900
01:00:06,484 --> 01:00:08,413
All the evidence points to you.

901
01:00:08,413 --> 01:00:09,683
Why do you keep bringing up Seo Ki Tae?

902
01:00:09,683 --> 01:00:11,054
Why do you think...

903
01:00:11,054 --> 01:00:14,353
I didn't stop any of that evidence from falling into your hands?

904
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,594
Even though it's obvious that if it were revealed,

905
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:19,264
my political career would be over.

906
01:00:19,264 --> 01:00:22,264
Why do you think I risked that to do all this?

907
01:00:24,304 --> 01:00:27,404
You didn't know your brother had another cell phone, did you?

908
01:00:33,114 --> 01:00:36,114
(Democratic People's Party)

909
01:00:38,813 --> 01:00:41,054
I don't care if my political career comes to an end,

910
01:00:43,123 --> 01:00:47,194
as long as I can block that scum, Seo Ki Tae, from becoming President.

911
01:00:53,063 --> 01:00:54,163
(Voice recording file)

912
01:00:54,163 --> 01:00:56,804
Don't escalate things any further, Geun Woo.

913
01:00:56,804 --> 01:00:58,364
We need to get to the Blue House together.

914
01:00:58,904 --> 01:01:01,433
I promise if you let this slide just this one time...

915
01:01:01,433 --> 01:01:02,844
I'm taking this public.

916
01:01:03,143 --> 01:01:07,114
Before I do, please acknowledge your wrongs and step down.

917
01:01:07,313 --> 01:01:09,484
That's my final request, Mr. Seo.

918
01:01:09,484 --> 01:01:11,244
This is my final warning to you too.

919
01:01:11,614 --> 01:01:15,284
If you don't stop now, I'll have to block you.

920
01:01:15,884 --> 01:01:18,353
No matter what, I'll stop you using any means necessary.

921
01:01:18,924 --> 01:01:22,054
I know you're not so rotten that you'd do something to harm me.

922
01:01:22,453 --> 01:01:24,594
I still have that much faith in you.

923
01:01:24,793 --> 01:01:28,234
That's why I told you this first before I went to reporters.

924
01:01:33,473 --> 01:01:36,373
Now, do you believe Han Do Kyung?

925
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,413
Why didn't you believe him from the start?

926
01:01:40,844 --> 01:01:43,183
If you had, Mr. Han might still be all right.

927
01:01:47,484 --> 01:01:50,154
(Yoon Soo Hyun)

928
01:01:50,154 --> 01:01:52,284
Mom, I got a job.

929
01:01:52,284 --> 01:01:54,324
I became an aide for Seo Ki Tae.

930
01:01:54,324 --> 01:01:55,523
Your second son did that.

931
01:01:55,523 --> 01:01:57,464
I should've protected him,

932
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,494
and I should've taken care of him.

933
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:03,203
But I couldn't take care of Geun Woo, your brother,

934
01:02:03,503 --> 01:02:05,764
properly, and I'm sorry for that.

935
01:02:06,773 --> 01:02:08,973
Let's do it. Let's save Mr. Seo.

936
01:02:13,444 --> 01:02:15,674
That jerk killed Geun Woo.

937
01:02:16,074 --> 01:02:18,014
The presidential candidate of the Democratic People's Party,

938
01:02:18,014 --> 01:02:19,114
Seo Ki Tae.

939
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:22,253
I'll tell you the truth you seek, Mr. Lee.

940
01:02:22,654 --> 01:02:25,054
It's true. I killed Geun Woo.

941
01:02:31,364 --> 01:02:32,393
Now.

942
01:02:35,464 --> 01:02:37,734
What will you do now, Mr. Lee?

943
01:02:45,444 --> 01:02:47,444
(Presidential Report)

944
01:02:53,654 --> 01:02:55,214
Connect me to Jung In, please.

945
01:02:56,623 --> 01:02:59,824
I just wanted to hear my daughter's voice.

946
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:47,503
(Campaign Office Assassination)

947
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,913
(Why did Lee Jin Woo kill my father?)

948
01:04:25,574 --> 01:04:28,214
(Times)

949
01:04:28,214 --> 01:04:30,844
The truth that Geun Woo tried to reveal, I'll do it for him.

950
01:04:31,683 --> 01:04:33,984
Please let me know what happened.

951
01:04:33,984 --> 01:04:36,424
I was going to give you a special to show my gratitude.

952
01:04:36,424 --> 01:04:37,784
Look for more definitive proof.

953
01:04:37,784 --> 01:04:39,484
You're trying to smash a rock with an egg.

954
01:04:39,484 --> 01:04:41,623
It was all a plot to cover this up.

955
01:04:41,623 --> 01:04:44,393
You really have the evidence that Jin Woo left behind, right?

956
01:04:44,393 --> 01:04:46,734
We can resolve everything once we find that.

957
01:04:46,734 --> 01:04:48,333
Catch Jung In and take her phone.

958
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:49,833
Run away!

959
01:04:49,833 --> 01:04:52,433
I'll find out everything. I'll put everything right.

960
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:55,634
We can return both of them, both Jin Woo and my father.
