I'm sure he spent several sleepless nights digging it up.

141
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,306
He contacted JC Telecom employees one by one,

142
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,676
until he finally got to Choi Cheol Ho.

143

We can't prove anything with just this.

153
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,361
That's why I won't leave it to the police anymore.

154
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:20,930
I'll have to find evidence and publish on it first,

155
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,190
and grab the attention of the media.

156
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,956

157
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:48,086

164
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,310
I'll still have to report on this to our superior.

165
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,176
He told me he trusts me, and that I can do as I wish.

166
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:19,946
You already told him? Without even consulting me?

167
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:24,255
You consult with others when you don't know what to do.

168

that these statements are connected to Seo Ki Tae.

172
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,336
That's true, since that was the motive behind Geun Woo's murder.

173
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,841

174

176
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:54,650
Everyone involved was sacrificed, including Geun Woo,

177
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,019

178
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,755
I can report on this much.

179
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,560

180
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,796
is actually Seo Ki Tae.

181
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:07,296
That won't be easy.

182
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:10,365
We'll take it step by step. Where should we begin?

183
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,670
Should we tail the CEO of JC Telecom?

184
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,336
Or search Seo Ki Tae's campaign offices?

185
00:12:14,371 --> 00:12:15,605
Would that even be possible?

186
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,471
It won't just be a couple of security guards there.

187
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,535
As you said, let's take it step by step.

188
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:22,211
This person took financial ledgers from the company.

189
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:24,650
Those happened to be connected to a political figure.

190
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,976
Let's start there.

191
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,245
I'll start with meeting with some informants.

192
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,755
What I told you last time was everything I know.

193
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:37,831
I already told you everything on the phone.

194
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:40,395
I know. I know all that.

195
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,030
But if Mr. Choi...

196
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,836
ever spoke with you about anything political,

197
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,096
I'm begging you to let me know.

198
00:12:51,211 --> 00:12:55,206
Every year, our company sponsors a small event.

199
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:57,716
You should look into that.

200
00:12:57,951 --> 00:12:59,275
Cheol Ho started acting strange...

201
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,015
after managing that event.

202
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:04,290
Yes, Jin Woo.

203
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,390
I just met with the publicity manager.

204
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,426
The event is larger in scale than we thought.

205
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,430
It's the third Saturday of October each year.

206
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,131
It's an event managed by JC Telecom's Human Resources.

207
00:13:13,131 --> 00:13:15,930
We'd like to welcome everyone...

208
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,371
to the 2014 Charity Auction Event.

209
00:13:17,371 --> 00:13:19,971
We'll start our event now,

210
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:23,940
but first, we'd like to thank all of you gathered here today.

211
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,981
Today, we'll be...

212
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:27,650
But this wasn't attended just by JC Telecom people.

213
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:31,316
Other businesses also attend and give philanthropic donations.

214
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:34,751
They run a charity auction and other things like that.

215
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:37,790
So you're saying all the money is sent to a JC Telecom fund, right?

216
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,760
Most of the funds are spent on scholarships.

217
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,790
I met with one of those scholarship students.

218
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,591
Both the amount received and other benefits given...

219
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:45,426
were in line with what the company said they would do.

220
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:50,270
It's a list of politicians who attend every year.

221
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,895
It's a lot more than expected, so it's hard to investigate.

222
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:55,611
Seo Ki Tae attended for the first time last year.

223
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:58,040
I'm sure we'll find something out if we go tomorrow.

224
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,275
Good work. You should go home and rest.

225
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,751
We did not discover any reasons to rule out suicide.

226
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:09,821
There were shoes left on the roof,

227
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:12,721
and there is testimony from those around him...

228
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:14,260
that he suffered from depression.

229
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,930
It was revealed that he also...

230
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,426
searched for information related to suicide.

231
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,946
It's tough, right?

232
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:41,621
Is there anything I can help with?

233
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:45,015
I can't get burnt out already. This is just the start.

234
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:48,255
But at times like these,

235
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:52,096
I wish Geun Woo were still by my side.

236
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,971
Maybe it's because it will soon be the anniversary of his death,

237
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:56,426
but I've been feeling emotional about it these days.

238
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,871
What was Aide Lee like as a person?

239
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:03,611
He was kind and hard-working.

240
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,275
And always well-mannered.

241
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:06,806
More than anything,

242
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:12,775
he was really similar to you.

243
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:13,981
To me?

244
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:17,145
No matter what external pressures or stresses he faced,

245
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,861
he never strayed from the course he'd chosen.

246
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:21,186
He stuck to his beliefs, just like you.

247
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:25,255
Sometimes, I remember him and miss him.

248
00:15:25,631 --> 00:15:28,666
I thought of him as my own son.

249
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:33,666
It appears he committed suicide as a compulsion.

250
00:15:33,971 --> 00:15:35,936
We are continuing to monitor the situation.

251
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,881
The person you have reached is not available.

252
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:46,716
Please leave a message after the tone.

253
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,916
Jin Woo.

254
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:55,826
My father really loved Geun Woo, his aide.

255
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,426
I'm sure...

256
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:02,270
there is a hidden truth about this somewhere.

257
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,495
I'll find out...

258
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,765
what that truth is.

259
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:10,806
I'll save both you and my father,

260
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,005
so please wait a little longer.

261
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,216
Why are you being like this by yourself?

262
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,755
If you wanted to drink, you should've asked us.

263
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:30,560
Jin Woo, I'm sorry.

264
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,831
When you were going to the police, saying Geun Woo wasn't a suicide,

265
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:34,430
I thought you should just accept it,

266
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,471
and wondered why you were going so far.

267
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:37,895
I didn't know any of this.

268
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,871
Geun Woo loved Seo Ki Tae...

269
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:42,265
and looked up to him.

270
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,806
- To kill someone like that... - I was a fool.

271
00:16:47,711 --> 00:16:49,976
I couldn't do anything for him as his older brother.

272
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,745
I didn't even know how he died.

273
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:56,615
The truth that Geun Woo tried to reveal,

274
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,091
I'll do it for him.

275
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:00,316
Once I do,

276
00:17:01,591 --> 00:17:04,326
I'll find the person who murdered Geun Woo.

277
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,285
Please tell me.

278
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Tell me what happened before Jin Woo...

279
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,595
killed my father.

280
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,926
You know what happened.

281
00:17:37,571 --> 00:17:38,795
Young Jae, you're the only one...

282
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,510
I mean, Mr. Do. You're the only one...

283
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,966
who can tell me this.

284
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,176
Leave.

285
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,946
Whether it takes 10 years or 20 years...

286
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,515
Whether it takes 10 years or 20 years,

287
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,446
I'm going to make everything right.

288
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:59,756
We need to make things right.

289
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,625
We can return both of them,

290
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:05,156
both Jin Woo and my father.

291
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,295
I'm going to put everything back in its original place.

292
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,666
Please tell me. I'm asking you.

293
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:15,706
I had no idea I would hear that again...

294
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,805
from you, Ms. Seo.

295
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,775
Here.

296
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:27,416
I'm only doing this because my wife suggested we give you a chance.

297
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,661
You're a reporter for DBS,

298
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:34,430
so I figure you might be better than us in some way,

299
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,625
so don't be mistaken.

300
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,496
We're not on your side, Ms. Seo.

301
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,930
We're on Jin Woo's side.

302
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,331
Here. Do you see "K", the guy who pocketed the most money?

303
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,565
That's Seo Ki Tae.

304
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:47,341
He didn't pocket it. He received it.

305
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:49,065
Receive or pocket. It means the same thing.

306
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:52,980
My father isn't the only politician with the initial K.

307
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,051
Kim Young Ju also...

308
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,746
This is what Jin Woo thought.

309
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:57,750
If the source of the slush funds...

310
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,716
was the JC charity event,

311
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,250
then they would also handle the expenses through JC Foundation.

312
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,690
Do you see the baseball bat and baseball...

313
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,990
sitting in front of me?

314
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,391
There is one baseball bat,

315
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,486
and there are three baseballs.

316
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:13,196
That's why Jin Woo and I went to that charity event.

317
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,125
These belong to the baseball player, Kim Ji Hyun.

318
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:18,670
Keep in mind that they all contain his autograph.

319
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:22,840
We'll start the auction at 500 dollars.

320
00:19:22,841 --> 00:19:25,676
- 500. - Okay. We have 500.

321
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,780
- 700. - We have 700.

322
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,315
- 1,000. - We have 1,000. That's the highest.

323
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,780
- 1,200. - We have 1,200.

324
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,821
- 1,500. - We have 1,500.

325
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:37,246
It keeps going up.

326
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,656
2,000.

327
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,486
Okay, 2,000. We have 2,000.

328
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,025
Do we have any takers?

329
00:19:44,631 --> 00:19:48,230
Okay, then. It has been sold for 2,000 dollars.

330
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,396
Congratulations.

331
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:06,121
Entrance to the upper floors is prohibited today.

332
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,585
- Why? - You can't go.

333
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:09,845
- Let us go up. - You can't.

334
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:15,131
We left something upstairs.

335
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,756
- You can't go up. - It will only take a moment.

336
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,656
They're with me.

337
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,065
Let's go.

338
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,775
You're here because of "K", who's written in the ledger, right?

339
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,375
You're here to find out who it is, right?

340
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,875
Get off at the floor below and take the stairs up.

341
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,785
Then you'll be able to find out who "K" is yourself.

342
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:51,426
Aren't you getting off?

343
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,545
Darn it.

344
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:37,911
This is the place we saw in the photograph, right?

345
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:39,236
Yes, it is.

346
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,506
After we waited for a while, he came out.

347
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:46,976
I'll work hard till the end and get good results.

348
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,651
- Please take good care of me. - Right. Mr. Seo.

349
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:51,285
Thank you.

350
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,186
My father passed a bill related to communications once.

351
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,930
He might've met him for a consultation,

352
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,061
- or they could've just talked. - Don't you see it?

353
00:22:00,061 --> 00:22:01,769
He came out with a suitcase that he didn't have when he went in.

354
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,730
He didn't have one when he went in, but he has one when he came out.

355

Where did you get this?

359
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,605
He didn't budge when Jin Woo went to him to ask,

360
00:22:19,081 --> 00:22:20,775
but he came to the charnel house.

361
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,486
I'm sure it bothered him to see Jin Woo die like that,

362
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,595
but he still didn't cooperate with us.

363
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,795
He came here recently.

364
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:38,496
He said he was putting this behind and immigrating as he gave me this.

365
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,436
How nice would it have been if he gave it to us five years ago?

366
00:22:44,811 --> 00:22:46,506

00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:48,210

Don't you think we already did that?

Nothing came from it.

370
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,916
They've already gone bankrupt, so there's nothing to look into.

371
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:55,051
But look at it.

372
00:22:55,051 --> 00:22:56,551
The day they gave money to IDK...

373
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:58,190
paid the space rental fee,

374
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,420
and gave K money...

375
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,625
were all on the same day.

376
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,430
It's not like they would wire bribes to one another.

377
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,030
On the day of the event, they gave it to him since he was there.

378
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,825
That's just an assumption though.

379
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,035
If that's the conclusion you want to make,

380
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,035
you need to verify that there was money in this bag...

381
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:17,105

Yes. The car repair will take a bit more time.

491
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,201
It appears he fled the country.

00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:27,635
I'm sorry, I should've noticed from the beginning.

493
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:34,540
I checked the security footage at the hospital and saw...

495
00:30:37,481 --> 00:30:38,850

Lee Jin Woo is a reporter.

503
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,445
He probably knows better than anyone if he tries to run the story...

505
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,276

What if we let him go around, digging for evidence,

Don't worry.

512
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,326
He will never be able to get that close.

00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,846
he told me not to trust Detective Oh and other detectives.

532
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:28,385
That's when I started to feel something was off.

533
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:34,026
To be honest, I got scared. So I didn't ask him.

534
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,100
That's why I asked to meet at the church...

535
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,695
and give you the evidence quietly.

536
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,701
The thing is,

537
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:43,266
Mr. Han committed suicide out of the blue like that.

538
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,635
But no one seems to care.

539
00:32:51,151 --> 00:32:54,875
To be honest, I watched the video in the SD card.

540
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,651
The one Mr. Han hid.

541
00:32:56,651 --> 00:32:58,486
That's the evidence for your brother's case, right?

542
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,125
Do Kyung wanted to...

543
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,026
tell me the truth before he left.

544
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,030
I want to know the truth...

545
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,865
about what Mr. Han and other detectives did.

546
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,635
It took a lot of courage for me to come here.

547
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:17,465
- Are you sure about that? - Yes.

548
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,921
Then, can you be more courageous?

549
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,076
Of course.

550
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,286
But how much more are you talking about?

551
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,555
You don't want me to die, right?

552
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:44,325
(Detective Division)

553
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,145
It's me.

554
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,820
The case file we have...

555
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,590
and the file you have are identical.

558
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:18,701
I checked.

559
00:34:18,701 --> 00:34:20,070
I have the record that says...

560
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,535
they talked before Choi Cheol Ho died.

561
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:27,336
(Field Vehicle)

562
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,221
Hey, Jin Woo.

563
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:34,716
Aren't you close to Kang Shin Wook?

564
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,685
Can you get him on the phone now?

565
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:44,190
Hello. I heard I had a visitor.

566
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,455
He's over there.

567
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,995
"Times".

568
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,336
Things must be tough over there.

569
00:34:58,311 --> 00:35:00,535
I heard what this meeting is about on the phone.

570
00:35:01,511 --> 00:35:03,645
So you are following up on Choi Cheol Ho's case.

571
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,021
You looked into Choi Cheol Ho's death.

572
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,616
Why didn't it air on TV?

573
00:35:07,721 --> 00:35:08,791
I'm sure you know.

574
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:11,116
There are a lot of reporters in our newsroom.

575
00:35:11,221 --> 00:35:13,391
Even if I have a story, when there's a lot to cover,

576
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:14,685
mine will get pushed down.

577
00:35:16,261 --> 00:35:19,895
You talked to him on the phone right before he died, right?

578
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,026
Yes. He wanted to give me a tip-off.

579
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,530
But when I listened to it, it wasn't that important.

580
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,095
I doubt that.

581
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,736
Wasn't that about the ledger with initials?

582
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:31,566
So you know everything.

583
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,106
Okay.

584
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,480
But there's no evidence that can connect the initials to people.

585
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,150
And the informant said he would never publicly make a statement.

586
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,250
Then, who would believe that?

587
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,316
But you could have still looked into that.

588
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,555
I need some kind of guarantee even if I go on a wild goose chase.

589
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:51,130
Why would I start digging not knowing where the ledger is...

590
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:53,325
and who would have the ledger with real names?

591
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,756
Hello, Ms. Kim, it's me.

592
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:24,926
Jin Woo just asked me about Choi Cheol Ho.

593
00:36:25,201 --> 00:36:26,856
I thought you should know.

594
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:28,296
All right.

595
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:30,696
Thank you for letting me know.

596
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:37,805
As a token of my gratitude, I'll give you a special.

597
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:41,276
Of course, it's been given a go-ahead by Mr. Seo.

599
00:36:44,011 --> 00:36:46,320

600

You will be charged after the tone.

602
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,785
Are you even looking for evidence?

603
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:55,486
If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I'll have to...

604
00:37:16,181 --> 00:37:19,176
October 18, 11:37pm, Mapo Bridge.

605
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:20,875
Don't go to Mapo Bridge that evening.

606
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,645
You'll die there.

607
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:04,685
Aren't you going to drive properly?

608
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,736
Who are you? Who ordered you to do this?

609
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:20,410
- Let go of me. - Who ordered you to do this?

610
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:21,506
Guys, come on.

611
00:38:21,911 --> 00:38:23,006
All right.

612
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,915

618
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,785
around the JC Telecom Charity Event.

619
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:08,955
I think this was done by Seo Jung In.

620
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,550
The leger with the real names will be with JC Telecom's CEO.

621
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:35,745
I think it would be faster to get Kim Young Ju to confess.

622
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,086
Is that possible?

623
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,756

That look in your eye.

663
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,192
You do resemble your father quite a bit.

664
00:43:12,296 --> 00:43:15,531
Your father's looked at me with that same look before.

665
00:43:17,467 --> 00:43:19,562
That's why he's dead.

666
00:43:20,137 --> 00:43:23,777
He looked down on those who helped him, just like that.

667
00:43:23,777 --> 00:43:25,272
That's why he's dead.

668

At the very least,

669
00:43:30,516 --> 00:43:33,011

708
00:45:19,257 --> 00:45:21,557

885
00:54:37,746 --> 00:54:38,872
Okay.

886
00:54:44,117 --> 00:54:46,882
Detective Oh. I think Seong Ho is up to something.

887
00:54:47,726 --> 00:54:49,551
This idiot.

888
00:54:49,856 --> 00:54:51,922
I think he fell for what Seo Jung In said.

889
00:54:52,296 --> 00:54:53,462
Yes, sir.

890
00:54:58,836 --> 00:55:02,201
I'm the one who sent you the bag. I thought you might need it.

891
00:55:50,287 --> 00:55:51,582
Mr. Lee.

892
00:55:51,686 --> 00:55:52,781
Why did you do it?

893
00:55:54,887 --> 00:55:56,752
Why did you kill my brother?

894
00:55:58,427 --> 00:56:01,091
(President Who Works for the People! Candidate 1, Seo Ki Tae)

895
00:56:01,496 --> 00:56:02,761
You have been...

896
00:56:04,597 --> 00:56:07,732
deceiving my brother and me all this time.

897
00:56:09,936 --> 00:56:12,132
My poor brother wanted to be like you.

898
00:56:13,277 --> 00:56:15,542
And I saved you twice not knowing what you did.

899
00:56:18,217 --> 00:56:20,111
You fooled both of us.

900
00:56:24,217 --> 00:56:26,781
Put down the gun.

901
00:56:27,027 --> 00:56:28,482
We can talk then.

902
00:56:29,057 --> 00:56:32,622
(Presidentital Candidate Seo Ki Tae)

903
00:56:34,327 --> 00:56:36,967
Don't escalate things any further, Geun Woo.

904
00:56:36,967 --> 00:56:38,562
We need to get to the Blue House together.

905
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:41,666
I promise if you let this slide just this one time...

906
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:43,201
I'm taking this public.

907
00:56:43,307 --> 00:56:46,347
Before I do, please acknowledge your wrongs...

908
00:56:46,347 --> 00:56:47,876
and step down.

909
00:56:47,876 --> 00:56:49,546
- That's my final request, Mr. Seo. - Are you suspecting me...

910
00:56:49,546 --> 00:56:51,111
because of this?

911
00:56:52,077 --> 00:56:53,341
Who gave you this?

912
00:56:53,947 --> 00:56:57,257
Who gave you this recording to have deceived you like this?

913
00:56:57,257 --> 00:56:58,411
Shut it!

914
00:56:59,456 --> 00:57:01,252
I'm not here to listen to your lies.

915
00:57:02,956 --> 00:57:04,051
Just admit it.

916
00:57:04,527 --> 00:57:06,292
Admit that you killed my brother.

917
00:57:06,967 --> 00:57:09,022
Even if the bullet lodges in my head,

918
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:11,861
I cannot admit something that I hadn't done.

919
00:57:24,376 --> 00:57:25,942
(Seo Jung In)

920
00:57:53,347 --> 00:57:55,542
- You can't go inside. - What?

921
00:57:58,717 --> 00:58:00,482
You can't go inside.

922
00:58:05,617 --> 00:58:06,852
Please.

923
00:58:08,887 --> 00:58:10,152
Because of you,

924
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:14,721
I became a piece of trash who couldn't even protect my brother.

925
00:58:15,296 --> 00:58:16,832
So you should know...

926
00:58:17,836 --> 00:58:19,232
how I'm feeling right now.

927
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:23,931
Jin Woo.

928
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:28,071
Say it. Your daughter is listening.

929
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:30,571
Tell her what kind of man you are!

930
00:58:30,777 --> 00:58:32,312
That way, your daughter...

931
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:34,442
will despise you even when you die.

932
00:58:36,186 --> 00:58:37,312
Say it!

933
00:58:40,157 --> 00:58:41,281
Why...

934
00:58:43,257 --> 00:58:44,792
Why is my daughter...

935
00:58:46,726 --> 00:58:49,126
Jin Woo, if you kill my dad,

936
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:50,391
you'll die too.

937
00:58:50,936 --> 00:58:52,066
You were fooled.

938
00:58:52,066 --> 00:58:53,637
They are playing you.

939
00:58:53,637 --> 00:58:55,706
I found out whose initials are written...

940
00:58:55,706 --> 00:58:57,931
on the ledger your brother left behind.

941
00:58:58,706 --> 00:59:01,071
Kim Young Ju, Nam Seong Beom, and Baek Kyu Min.

942
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,976
And they were behind my father's death too.

943
00:59:03,976 --> 00:59:05,777
If your brother died because of the ledger,

944
00:59:05,777 --> 00:59:07,542
they are your suspects.

945
00:59:07,787 --> 00:59:10,911
We couldn't get to the bottom of it even in 2020.

946
00:59:11,016 --> 00:59:12,511
Those jerks stopped it.

947
00:59:12,516 --> 00:59:14,157
They made you kill my father.

948
00:59:14,157 --> 00:59:15,781
And after they killed you,

949
00:59:16,126 --> 00:59:18,821
they covered up everything just like they did to Han Do Kyung.

950
00:59:20,967 --> 00:59:22,126
That shouldn't happen.

951
00:59:22,126 --> 00:59:23,796
You must live to get to the bottom of the truth.

952
00:59:23,796 --> 00:59:25,296
Move when I ask nicely, Seong Ho.

953
00:59:25,296 --> 00:59:27,031
You were in on it with Mr. Han,

954
00:59:27,307 --> 00:59:28,602
right?

955
00:59:30,936 --> 00:59:33,077
Yes, you were. But we are detectives.

956
00:59:33,077 --> 00:59:37,071
Why did you betray your duties like that? You coward!

957
00:59:44,586 --> 00:59:45,911
You jerk.

958
00:59:47,487 --> 00:59:49,352
Hey, that's enough. Let's go.

959
00:59:57,697 --> 01:00:00,062
Ms. Seo, run!

960
01:00:00,066 --> 01:00:01,861
Run away!

961
01:00:05,376 --> 01:00:08,042
There are people who want you to come back alive.

962
01:00:08,847 --> 01:00:11,111
I'm sure you know how these people must feel.

So please...

966
01:00:22,487 --> 01:00:23,991
don't die.

967
01:00:24,327 --> 01:00:25,752
We should meet in the future.

968
01:00:27,896 --> 01:00:29,391
I believe in you.

969
01:00:30,266 --> 01:00:33,232
I know that you will change the past once again.

970
01:00:50,387 --> 01:00:51,551
Hey!

971
01:01:13,976 --> 01:01:15,071
Get her.

972
01:01:46,976 --> 01:01:48,502
Don't think this is over.

973
01:01:50,717 --> 01:01:52,911
Whether I drag you down or I climb up,

974
01:01:53,447 --> 01:01:55,411
I will fight you again on an equal footing.

975
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,066
- Jung In. Good work. - Good work.

976
01:02:14,066 --> 01:02:15,201
Okay.

Sir. Sir!

979
01:02:28,387 --> 01:02:30,557
Are you okay? We should call the police first.

980
01:02:30,557 --> 01:02:31,681
Hold on.

981
01:02:32,086 --> 01:02:34,622
- Pardon? - I haven't...

982
01:02:36,597 --> 01:02:39,252
sorted out my thoughts yet.

983
01:02:41,827 --> 01:02:43,591
Don't just stand there. Check the security footage.

Please help me...

989
01:04:14,387 --> 01:04:16,451
bring down Seo Ki Tae.

990
01:04:16,626 --> 01:04:18,321
My phone changed.

991
01:04:18,427 --> 01:04:20,266
I want to know what had happened.

992
01:04:20,266 --> 01:04:21,566
You've become someone else.

993
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,066
We finally meet face to face.

994
01:04:23,066 --> 01:04:24,097
What are you doing?

995
01:04:24,097 --> 01:04:27,206
Give up. Jin Woo got rid of all the evidence.

996
01:04:27,206 --> 01:04:29,507
What did you do? The truth got completely covered up.

997
01:04:29,507 --> 01:04:30,907
He covered it up knowing everything.

998
01:04:30,907 --> 01:04:32,632
I came here to see the truth myself.

999
01:04:32,836 --> 01:04:35,046
That jerk, Seo Ki Tae, killed my brother.

1000
01:04:35,046 --> 01:04:36,376
He should have died that day.

1001
01:04:36,376 --> 01:04:38,217
I promise to destroy it into pieces.

1002
01:04:38,217 --> 01:04:40,712
Make me the President.
