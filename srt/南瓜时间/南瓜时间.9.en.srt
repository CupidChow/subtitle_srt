00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:58,395
Why Creation Party not Democratic People's Party?

6
00:00:58,395 --> 00:01:00,525
Are you trying to start an argument about the name or what?

7
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:01,925
Seriously.

8
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:04,035
It's Creation Party because it's a newly-created party.

9
00:01:04,035 --> 00:01:07,466
The party that was created as my Jin Woo joined.

10
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:09,165
So it's Creation Party. You know it.

12
00:01:13,146 --> 00:01:15,705

13
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:19,285
and explain everything. So please wait.

15
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:23,485
Seriously.

16
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:25,756
Write something good about it. We're alumni of the same college.

17
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:28,425

18

19
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:30,995
- Okay. - I got it.

20
00:01:34,296 --> 00:01:35,496
Just a moment.

21
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:40,306
It's almost time. Why is he not coming?

22
00:01:56,815 --> 00:02:00,485
Your daughter is listening. Tell her what kind of man you are.

23
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:01,755
That way, your daughter...

24
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:03,796
will despise you even when you die.

25
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:05,656
Say it!

26
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:52,276
Yes, Mr. President. I called you before the press conference.

27
00:02:52,436 --> 00:02:56,646
The moment you enter there, you and I are on the same boat.

28
00:02:57,216 --> 00:03:00,315

29
00:03:00,586 --> 00:03:02,486
and enter the Blue House.

30
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:03,486

31
00:03:03,855 --> 00:03:07,056

In this ledger, there's a list of politicians...

47
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:29,936
CEO Park Chan Yong of JC Telecom has been lobbying for a long time.

50

to tell the truth.

51
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:43,056
You must take responsibility for your mistakes yourselves.

52
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:46,126
That's how you show respect to our people.

53
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:48,226
And those who do not show respect...

54
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:50,626
do not deserve your positions!

from the JC Foundation's charity event, President Baek Kyu Min,

57
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,195
and candidate Kim Young Ju,

58
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:00,505
as well as President Seo, who gave preferential treatment...

59
00:05:00,905 --> 00:05:02,536
to JC Telecom through the 5G Communications Network Auction,

60
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,976
receiving an astronomical sum in return...

(A man of principles and firm beliefs! Lee Jin Woo)

66
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:22,955
I'm Kim Dong Gyu, a reporter for the Kyungchun Daily.

67
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,926
What is the reason you chose this timing to reveal this?

68
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:27,666
Is it because candidates Kim Young Ju...

69
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,996
and Kim Sung Guk have joined forces?

70
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,166
Are you trying to upend the election?

71
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,205
You're asking if it was a political move.

72
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:35,536
It was not, at all.

73
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:38,075
Today, I'm not here as a presidential candidate.

74
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:40,405
I'm here as a voting member of the general electorate.

75
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:43,116
Those who were the president, or is the president,

76
00:05:43,116 --> 00:05:46,885
or dream of becoming the president, should not be acting this way.

77
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:48,945
Next question.

78
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,085
I'm Kim Young Jo, reporter for JBS.

79
00:05:54,686 --> 00:05:56,356
I'm curious about one thing.

80
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,666
Are you going to share those documents with us?

81
00:05:59,895 --> 00:06:02,596
Of course. We're going to upload these documents to our website,

82
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,666
so anyone who would like them can download them directly.

83
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:07,065
Next question.

84
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:12,236
I'm Kim Hyun Chul, reporter for the Seowon Daily.

85
00:06:12,236 --> 00:06:15,445
I believe this information will have wide repercussions.

86
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,876
Have you considered the potential of defamation as a result?

87
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,476
Of course, I have considered it.

88
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:22,686
That is something I am prepared to handle, if need be.

89
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:25,356
Rather than protecting the rotten honor of those in power,

90
00:06:25,616 --> 00:06:28,356
I believe the priority lies in protecting the nation's honor.

91
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:29,556
Next question.

92
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:32,356
Reporter Jo.

93
00:06:32,356 --> 00:06:33,726
I'm reporter Jo Eun Jeong, from the Daily News.

94
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,565
Was this really the only way?

95
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:40,405
I'm reporter Seo Jung In from DBS.

96
00:06:40,736 --> 00:06:42,005
I'm sure you all know...

97
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:44,005
that I am also President Seo's daughter.

98
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:46,676
I'm sure some of you also believe...

99
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:49,145
that it's inappropriate for me to ask this question.

100
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:51,476
But I ask, not as the President's daughter,

101
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:54,015
but as a fellow journalist, without personal emotions involved.

102
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:55,686
As you stated yourself,

103
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,655
did you really need to expose the corruption of those...

104
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:01,126
who were the president, who is the president,

105
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:04,325
and who dream of becoming president, in this way?

106
00:07:04,455 --> 00:07:06,325
Was there really no other way?

107
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:08,395
What is the point of your question?

108
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:09,765
I am aware that you obtained those documents...

109
00:07:09,765 --> 00:07:11,536
while you were still a journalist.

110
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:16,135
Why did you keep them hidden until this moment?

111
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:21,445
With your disclosure,

112
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:24,376
the Republic of Korea will undergo a corruption scandal...

113
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:26,585
that is unparalleled in scope, with former and current presidents,

114
00:07:26,585 --> 00:07:29,486
as well as a presidential candidate, all involved in Corruption-gate.

115
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:31,916
It will turn into a political fight.

116
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:35,525
In such a fight, the truth is no longer important.

117
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:37,796
All you need is power.

118
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:39,325
To win a fight, all you need is the logic of power.

119
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,626
You staked everything on this when you were a reporter.

120
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:46,096
To turn your life's work into a political fight...

121
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,635
is that really what you want, Candidate Lee?

122
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,346
Jin Woo, don't you think it's wrong to use the case connected to...

123
00:07:54,346 --> 00:07:56,246
Geun Woo's death in this fashion?

124
00:07:56,546 --> 00:07:59,476
If it gets involved with politics, the truth doesn't matter anymore.

125
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:00,986
From that moment, there will be no right or wrong,

126
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:02,986
and it'll just become a political mudslinging fight.

127
00:08:05,455 --> 00:08:06,556
Are you done asking your question?

128
00:08:06,556 --> 00:08:08,455
I have one last favor to ask.

129
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:11,455
What you said to me earlier...

130
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:15,226
- Give back my cell phone. - I broke it.

131
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:17,536
I broke it because I knew you would do this someday.

132
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,835
I hope that wasn't the truth.

133
00:08:20,806 --> 00:08:23,575
I think you might regret it, Mr. Lee,

134
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,405
enough that you might want to turn back time.

135
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:33,286
I believe Ms. Seo has given me her personal opinion on the matter.

136
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:35,145
I'll take it into consideration.

137
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:37,815
Next question.

138
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:39,556
Yes?

139
00:08:39,556 --> 00:08:41,126
I'm Sang Mun Sik from Rise News.

140
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:44,556
I'd like you to clarify something about the political lobbying.

141
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:46,126
You said that the JC Charity Event...

142
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,126
and the 5G Auction were involved.

143
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:50,296
(Candidate 2, Lee Jin Woo)

144
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,335
- Let's go, Young Jae. - Yes, sir.

145
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:00,405
- Wait just a minute. - Yes, sir.

146

147
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,015
- Chang Soo, let me take this call. - Yes, sir.

148
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:13,055
(Changing Korea's New Leader, Candidate 2, Lee Jin Woo)

149
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:14,456
("I will guide this country as changing Korea's new leader.")

150
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:19,155
- Yes, Mr. President? - What are you doing?

151
00:09:19,155 --> 00:09:22,466
I took a mutt off the streets and made him a presidential candidate.

152
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:23,635
Then you turn and bite the hand that fed you?

153
00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:25,535
What kind of dog bites its owner?

154
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:27,135
I told you earlier.

155
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:29,165
That I'd show you whether I was a dog,

156
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:30,505
or a baby tiger.

157
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:34,505
Anyway, you always act as though you're going to hunt me down...

158
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,246
and slaughter me to eat afterward, so how could I not bite?

159
00:09:37,045 --> 00:09:39,216
Why did you meet with Nam Seong Beom?

160
00:09:39,216 --> 00:09:40,846
You should've just left it to me.

161
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,616
You think you'll be safe after all this?

162
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,185
How can a former president speak that way?

163
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:48,755
I think I'll remain pretty safe.

164
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,196
As for you, Mr. President, if you have anywhere to run to,

165
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:53,165
I think you might want to head there now.

166
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:55,326
After some time, you might be forbidden from leaving the country,

167
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:56,466
and it'll be hard for you to run away then.

168
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,566
- Jin Woo, you punk. - Anyway,

169
00:09:59,836 --> 00:10:01,265
thank you for your help until now.

170
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:05,706
From now on, I'll try becoming President with my own strength.

171
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:19,086
- Let's go home. - Yes, sir.

172
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:21,326
I'll start now.

173
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,055
Turn the car around.

174
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:28,626
- Where are you going at this hour? - At this hour?

175
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:31,596
Do you think I'm going for a late-night snack, you punk?

176
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:33,765
Just turn the car around if I say so.

177
00:10:41,405 --> 00:10:44,316
I got a phone call from Kim Sung Guk on my way over here.

178
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,116
He says he wants to withdraw from joining together.

179
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:48,015
What should we do now?

180
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:50,086
The prosecutor's office likely won't leave us alone either.

181
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:54,655
We need to hold out until the election, at least.

182
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:01,096
Ki Tae, what should I do?

183
00:11:01,096 --> 00:11:02,326
Please, Ki Tae.

184
00:11:04,736 --> 00:11:06,905
Please save me.

185
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:10,106
The only person who can save me now is you, Ki Tae.

186
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:11,675
You're going to save me, right?

187
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:15,645
Right now, I do not have the power to save you, Kyu Min.

188
00:11:17,015 --> 00:11:18,275
What do you mean?

189
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:20,515
You're still the president.

190
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:23,685
I can't do it with my power alone.

191
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:25,915
If we're to survive, we need to survive together.

192
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,086
We should combine forces.

193
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:31,655
If you betray me again, I won't let you get away with it.

194
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:32,996
Do you understand me?

195
00:11:33,395 --> 00:11:35,795
I understand.

196
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:38,996
I'll do anything you ask.

197
00:11:39,905 --> 00:11:41,236
What should I do first?

198
00:11:41,236 --> 00:11:44,635
You just have to publicly announce your stance,

199
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:46,946
and lend us your strength.

200
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:56,885
It's been a while, everyone.

201
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,956
So many of you have come.

202
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:00,986
Isn't it cold outside?

203
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:03,856
Say that you're disappointed in him...

204
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,456
for denouncing his colleagues...

205
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:08,025
because of his ambitions in the presidential election.

206
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:11,935
As the person who introduced Lee Jin Woo...

207
00:12:11,935 --> 00:12:13,866
to the world of politics, you feel responsible for this.

208
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:18,175
I'm the person who stood by Lee Jin Woo...

209
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:19,775
when he first entered the political arena.

210
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,976
I didn't give birth to him, but I raised him as my own.

211
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,076
You know how I feel, right?

212
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:25,876
I don't know why someone I considered my own son...

213
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:28,385
is running around telling lies.

214
00:12:28,385 --> 00:12:29,816
My goodness.

215
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:34,755
Is it really right for him...

216
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,356
to be so ungrateful to someone who's been like a father to him?

217
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:40,966
That's right.

218
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:43,696
But I can't just sit and do nothing in the middle of the fire.

219
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,466
Still, do nothing.

220
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,135
We'll take charge of the offensive.

221
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:05,555
(A Future for the People! A Hopeful Tomorrow! Kim Young Ju)

222
00:13:07,255 --> 00:13:08,685
(Candidate 1, Kim Young Ju)

223
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:12,155
(Emergency Press Conference, Candidate 1, Kim Young Ju)

224
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:14,126
Due to Mr. Lee's press conference,

225
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,836
I am currently the object of several allegations.

226
00:13:17,836 --> 00:13:21,405
Because they aren't true, I didn't want to refute them one by one,

227
00:13:21,405 --> 00:13:23,066
but I have a question for Candidate Lee...

228
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:24,476
which is why I'm here today.

229
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,135
This is my question.

230
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:29,606
Candidate Lee. Where did you get that ledger?

231
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:31,175
It's 1 of 2 ways.

232
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:34,015
Either you made it with the intent to slander me,

233
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:36,956
or you illegally broke into CEO Park's home and stole it.

234
00:13:37,155 --> 00:13:39,086
If what you're saying is true...

235
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,655
and you managed to get your hands on such a ledger,

236
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:45,655
you will have to take responsibility for your actions.

237
00:13:48,366 --> 00:13:50,736
Then do you think Jin Woo would stay still?

238
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:53,606
He'll change the frame and say that we must not...

239
00:13:53,606 --> 00:13:55,866
stray from the essence of this case in a press conference.

240
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:58,206
While watching Candidate Kim Young Ju try to get out...

241
00:13:58,206 --> 00:14:01,045
of this situation without acknowledging her wrongdoings,

242
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:04,446
I was embarrassed as a fellow politician.

243
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:08,285
Candidate Kim must acknowledge her wrongdoings now...

244
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:13,255
and seek forgiveness from the people.

245
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:15,086
Of course, he will.

246
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:17,025
That's what I want too.

247
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:19,956
The bigger the situation gets, the better it is.

248
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:22,925
If more people begin to gain interest in this case,

249
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,665
it will be advantageous to us.

250
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:26,395
I will make sure of it.

251
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:29,905
How? How will you make sure of it?

252
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,905
You received a call from Seong Beom recently, right?

253
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,675
My fellow citizens.

254
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:43,755
I bow my head in apology for causing such public concern...

255
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:45,586
over the past few days.

256
00:14:45,856 --> 00:14:48,826
But the suspicions that Candidate Lee Jin Woo...

257
00:14:48,826 --> 00:14:50,425
raised about me...

258
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:52,626
are false.

259
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:56,226
I can only express my deepest regrets for...

260
00:14:56,226 --> 00:15:00,635
Candidate Lee's political maneuver to change the public opinion...

261
00:15:00,805 --> 00:15:03,435
with lies and make the people feel a sense of deprivation.

262
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:06,405
However, in the process of checking all the facts,

263
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,376
we were able to verify that Assemblyman Nam Seong Beom...

264
00:15:10,846 --> 00:15:14,015
used Candidate Kim Young Ju and my name to get illegal political funds.

265
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:17,716
I am reflecting on myself for being unaware of this fact,

266
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,885
and I take full responsibility for being unable to manage...

267
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,055
those around me.

268
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:24,795
I bow my head in apology once again.

269
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:33,336
We must cut off people like Seong Beom whose alliances change...

270
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:34,665
for the sake of his own survival.

271
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:39,275
That's how you and I can survive.

272
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:42,976
If you hear from Seong Beom again,

273
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:44,846
ignore him completely.

274
00:15:45,746 --> 00:15:47,446
(Nam Seong Beom)

275
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:54,885
We have to get rid of the pus for the world to go around.

276
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,255
Okay.

277
00:15:56,895 --> 00:15:57,956
We should do that.

278
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:10,275
Can we trust him?

279
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:13,645
He's as conniving as a snake.

280
00:16:13,645 --> 00:16:15,376
Let's keep an eye on him for now.

281
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:17,645
I have a plan.

282
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:19,145
Yes, sir.

283
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,716
I'll take care of this situation,

284
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:24,155
so don't waver...

285
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:26,055
and continue what you're doing and focus on the campaign.

286
00:16:27,356 --> 00:16:29,726
There isn't much time left before you become the owner of this place.

287
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,326
Don't forget.

288
00:16:31,626 --> 00:16:33,795
You need to become president...

289
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:36,126
for Korea to stand upright.

290
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,265
Yes, sir. I will bear that in mind, Mr. President.

291
00:16:49,246 --> 00:16:51,476
Lee Jin Woo's rock bottom has come to light.

292
00:16:51,915 --> 00:16:54,346
He didn't know anything, but he wanted to start a buzz.

293
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:56,545
He wanted to release it first to see what happened.

294
00:16:56,986 --> 00:16:58,685
It was obvious that he had foul intentions.

295
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:00,086
Right.

296
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:02,726
Even if it was true, the timing of it all is repulsive.

297
00:17:02,986 --> 00:17:05,025
But it turned out to be false so, there's nothing more to say.

298
00:17:05,596 --> 00:17:06,795
The ledger is real.

299
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:16,435
Regardless of what Candidate Lee's intentions were,

300
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,935
we must continue doing our jobs.

301
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:21,476
We must ensure that facts don't get buried,

302
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:23,376
and the truth doesn't get hidden.

303
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:25,275
I told you this before.

304
00:17:25,616 --> 00:17:27,685
That there's an illegal connection between JC and politicians...

305
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:28,915
since 2014...

306
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,155
No, it might've started before then.

307
00:17:32,155 --> 00:17:34,586
I think that we should make a team to look into...

308
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,225
what they did and what they covered up right away.

309
00:17:37,826 --> 00:17:38,826
Jung In.

310
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:42,796
Don't you understand the situation?

311
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:45,596
If what Lee Jin Woo said is true,

312
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:47,866
your father became president with CEO Park's money.

313
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,205
Who would agree to do an interview with you?

314
00:17:51,006 --> 00:17:52,776
I'll try. I can do it.

315
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:55,106
Even if you cover the story, who would believe you?

316
00:17:56,546 --> 00:17:58,175
It doesn't matter to me.

317
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,445
I'll give you a call when things calm down,

318
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:03,756
so don't come to work starting tomorrow and wait at home.

319
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:06,056
Shin Wook!

320
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:07,955
Wait.

321
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,635
Fine.

322
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:29,806
I don't think this is where I should be either.

323
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:34,586
Jung In.

324
00:18:36,185 --> 00:18:37,286
Seo Jung In.

325
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:45,526
What are you doing? Aren't we going to continue our meeting?

326
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,060
(Times)

327
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:36,791
Who are you? Hey!

328
00:19:41,231 --> 00:19:43,331
Su Kyung! Hold on!

329
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:46,061
Young Jae?

330
00:19:47,471 --> 00:19:48,900
- What is this? - Young Jae!

331
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,571
What are you doing here?

332
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:53,971
I came to see you!

333
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:55,910
What did you spray into my eyes?

334
00:19:56,581 --> 00:19:59,841
Why did you have the lights off? Are you a pervert?

335
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:03,051
It's because I thought you'd yell at me about the electricity bill!

336
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:05,981
What should I do?

337
00:20:05,981 --> 00:20:08,021
Why did you show up like this?

338
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,360
What should I do about my eyes?

339
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,200
- Su Kyung. - Yes?

340
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:31,140
Let's start again.

341
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,081
- What? - I love you.

342
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:36,450
- Are you crazy? - I'm crazy.

343
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,721
I'm completely out of my mind.

344
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:42,150
How can I not go crazy when someone as beautiful as you...

345
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,221
are sitting in front of me?

346
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,460
You sprayed it again!

347
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,460
You crazy lunatic.

348
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,261
Am I that easy to you?

349
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,501
You left me without turning back when I asked you to say,

350
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:57,301
but why would you think I'd start again with you?

351
00:20:58,001 --> 00:20:59,801
Just go to Lee Jin Woo and...

352
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:01,811
- Jin Woo. - Jin Woo?

353
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:03,281
Jin Woo? Jin Woo who?

354
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:05,140
Who is it? Are you seeing someone new?

355
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,680
Gosh. Who is it? Who's this jerk?

356
00:21:10,981 --> 00:21:12,551
Ask him why he came?

357
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:17,061
He asked why you came.

358
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,561
Well...

359
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:23,930
I came because I'm sorry.

360
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,670
I thought I was a bit mean.

361
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,670
Tell him not to be sorry.

362
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:34,571
Why don't you talk to each other directly?

363
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:42,781
He says that you don't need to be sorry.

364
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:44,850
I'm sorry, so how can I not feel...

365
00:21:46,081 --> 00:21:48,821
How long are we going to talk like this? It's not like we're kids!

366
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,761
Fine. Let's talk directly without Su Kyung in the middle.

367
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,660
"I can't do it without you," "Come back to me."

368
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,001
"I won't do that again," "I'll be good to you."

369
00:21:58,001 --> 00:22:00,200
Are you here to say those things to me?

370
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:01,331
Yes.

371
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:07,041
You think I'll go back to you if you say such things?

372
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:08,811
After the humiliation?

373
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,610
You didn't even send me the salary.

374
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,910
Please do it for me.

375
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,511
It's really hard without you.

376
00:22:16,581 --> 00:22:18,021
Who would I trust other than you?

377
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,791
Can I go back?

378
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,390
Why do you ask me that?

379
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,930
We agreed to start over.

380
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,660
So I'm asking if I can go back to him.

381
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,971
I better not, right?

382
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,670
Why are you blinking?

383
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:41,940
Are you still sick?

384
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:45,380
Is it because it's expired?

385
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,350
All right. I'll go.

386
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:50,821
I'll go, but there's a condition.

387
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,021
- Can you do it? - Okay. Whatever it is.

388
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:55,221
- Are you sure? - Yes.

389
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:57,160
You're really going to do it? Whatever it is?

390
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,561
I said I can. What's the condition?

391
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,831
Isn't your condition too humble?

392
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:08,331
It's so nice to take the seat of honor.

393
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,170
You must've been very comfortable.

394
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,811
Right?

395
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,841
Oh, my.

396
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,410
I laugh because of you.

397
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,081
I will take you home comfortably, sir.

398
00:23:24,081 --> 00:23:26,420
Be gentle when you drive over a speed bump. Okay?

399
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:28,690
I'm sensitive. Got it?

400
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,860
That's how you escort a person of talent like me.

405
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,690
Yes, Ms. Seo.

406
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:14,600
You want to run a story on Times?

407
00:24:15,331 --> 00:24:17,741
Yes. Please help me out.

408
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,241
What about DBS?

409
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,241
- Did you get fired? - No.

410
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:25,481
It just feels like I don't belong there.

411
00:24:26,281 --> 00:24:27,910
I want to do it on Times.

412
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,981
I know you didn't remove the website and the channel.

413
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:33,650
You don't post articles, but you're still managing them.

414
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,350
When I'm finished with the coverage,

415
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,920
please just let me post the article.

416
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:41,091
I don't think it's possible.

417
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:43,600
Ms. Myung.

418
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,360
Why would you collect the materials by yourself?

419
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,761
We should do it together if you're going to do it.

420
00:24:48,001 --> 00:24:50,301
Isn't that what reporters should do?

421
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,670
- Thank you. - Save it for later.

422
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,241
Let's map out the route first.

423
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:57,610
Who's the first one you're going to digging into?

424
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,581
Should we pry into Assemblyman Nam Seong Beom first?

425
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,321
The person you have reached is not available.

426

00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,571
(Nam Seong Beom)

428
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:56,831
Why does he keep calling me?

429
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,811
The person you have reached is not available.

430
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,281
Answer me! Darn it!

431
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,971
You're not avoiding my calls, are you?

432
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,341
You can't forget what I know.

433
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:45,620
Seong Beom.

434
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,521
I turned my phone on silent mode.

435
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,261
Where are you?

436
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,041
Oh, my. You look terrible.

437
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,110
Did you eat? Let's eat first.

438
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,051
Look at how I look.

439
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:15,811
Do you think I can enjoy the food now?

440
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:18,880
I see. Let's eat later then.

441
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:20,551
Then...

442
00:27:21,521 --> 00:27:22,850
Do you want to go to a sauna first?

443
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,521
After washing up,

444
00:27:24,521 --> 00:27:26,420
- let's take time and talk... - You know it too, right?

445
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,390
That of all the people, you can't throw me away.

446
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:31,660
You know it well as well.

447
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,130
What do you think will happen...

448
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,971
if I tell everything I know to Lee Jin Woo?

449
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:36,370
Then, you will also...

450
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:38,100
Shut your mouth.

451
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,710
If you hit the bottom because you said something you shouldn't say,

452
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,811
you should control your mouth first, don't you think so?

453
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:47,311
The weights of the crimes are different. Bribery and murder.

454
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:49,950
That's not what I did.

455
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,081
Someone else gave an order and committed murder.

456
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,390
Seong Beom, don't think about dying...

457
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,061
because you don't want to get hurt.

458
00:27:57,061 --> 00:27:58,821
Go to prison quietly and come out of it several years later.

459
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,031
I'll watch your back. Do you understand?

460
00:28:01,031 --> 00:28:04,761
Do you know the reporters started to smell it as well?

461
00:28:05,731 --> 00:28:06,731
Kyu Min.

462
00:28:07,031 --> 00:28:10,231

463
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:11,440
Hey, Nam Seong Beom.

464
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,041
You can't get away with it. Do you know that?

465
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:15,041
- Hey! - If Lee Jin Woo realizes...

466
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,170
he was fooled, he will...

467
00:28:18,341 --> 00:28:21,311
Don't raise your voice and get it together first.

468
00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:24,481
I understand what you mean, Mr. Nam.

469
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,850
I'll find a way no matter what.

470
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,591
Stay low for now.

471
00:28:31,221 --> 00:28:33,221
If you do crazy things for no good reason and lose Ki Tae's trust,

472
00:28:33,221 --> 00:28:34,890
everyone will die including you and I.

473
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,241
Kyu Min! I...

474
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,271
I even thought of dying.

475
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,180
I thought I would not have to face such humiliation if I die.

476
00:28:56,981 --> 00:28:59,051
Why would you die, Mr. Nam?

477
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:03,251
Leave the city just until things are quieted down.

478
00:29:03,551 --> 00:29:06,561
Give me a few days to come up with a way. I'll call you.

479
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:10,761
Just until then, stay low and silent as if you're dead.

480
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,400
Thank you, Kyu Min.

481
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:17,600
I'll only wait for you.

482
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,991
I guess it's already out. The snake inside there.

00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:02,850
Yes, this is me.

Yes, I watched it.

Does that make sense?

00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,321
It is known that CEO Park Chan Yong stated that what President Seo...

said at the press conference...

504
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:46,890
is all true.

I only gave money to Baek Kyu Min through Nam Seong Beom.

510
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:03,741
Then, what about the ledger?

511
00:31:03,741 --> 00:31:06,511
I don't know. He must've made it up.

512
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,781

If I don't give it to him,

529
00:31:50,551 --> 00:31:52,821
he said he will make it impossible for me to do business in Korea.

532
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,331
is an extremely greedy man.

533
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,501
I'm a victim too.

534
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:04,140
After concluding the investigation into CEO Park,

535
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,940
the prosecutor's office is planning to subpoena...

536
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,571
former President Baek Kyu Min and Assemblyman Nam Seong Beom.

537
00:32:08,571 --> 00:32:09,571
What's going on?

538
00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:28,660
Get him.

539
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:36,630
(Available)

540
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,001
- Get him. - Catch him.

541
00:32:38,301 --> 00:32:39,400
Stop.

542
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:40,870
Get him.

543
00:32:41,341 --> 00:32:42,410
Hey, stop!

544
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:49,880
Baek Kyu Min, that dog.

545
00:32:50,821 --> 00:32:54,051
There are also questions about whether Seo Ki Tae's...

546
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:57,460
former Aide Lee was also involved in this incident.

547
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,031
On the Internet, there has been much interest in the relationship...

548
00:33:01,031 --> 00:33:02,531
between Seo Ki Tae and Lee Jin Woo,

549
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:04,900
leading to a flurry of rumors.

550
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,370
If this happens,

551
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:09,430
they might reinvestigate Geun Woo's case.

552
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,471
Was Mr. Lee's death really related to this case?

553
00:33:10,471 --> 00:33:12,100
We will have to wait and see.

554
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,541
Between President Seo and Candidate Lee...

555
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:15,440
I think I need to meet with Park Chan Yong.

556
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,210
With CEO Park's disclosure,

557
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:21,480
Candidate Kim Young Ju's ratings are rebounding in the polls.

558
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,750
So Seo Ki Tae and Kim Young Ju will survive this too.

559
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,020
That's impressive.

560
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,621
There are suspicions about whether Mr. Lee's relationship has soured...

561
00:33:32,621 --> 00:33:35,761
I think I need to meet him.

562
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,230
Who?

563
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,330
(General Civil Service Office)

564
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:42,000
At the moment, we cannot arrange a meeting with Mr. Park Chan Yong.

565
00:33:46,571 --> 00:33:48,011
I looked into it,

566
00:33:49,411 --> 00:33:51,940
and it seems he's not seeing anyone besides his lawyer.

567
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,011
No outside meetings.

568
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,351
The detention center said they can't help either.

569
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:56,880
What should we do?

570
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:07,091
(Times)

571
00:34:08,531 --> 00:34:12,161
There is one way.

572
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:16,170
But can you do it?

573
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:20,270
It's a little dirty and messy for you, Jung In.

574
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:22,411
I'm willing to do anything.

575
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:23,871
What is it?

576
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,880
You're bound to go here at least once if you're being questioned.

577
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,411
If you're a person.

578
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:32,951
I see.

579
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:36,121
All right, thank you.

580
00:34:36,851 --> 00:34:38,391
Jin Woo, amazing news.

581
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,491
I think you may have to give up on meeting Park Chan Yong,

582
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,531
but we're not in despair yet.

583
00:34:45,531 --> 00:34:47,400
I'm a victim too.

584
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,371
It's true.

585
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:54,040
I know you're here because of the ledger,

586
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,940
but that's not all we're interested in.

587
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,511
Some lunatic prosecutor...

588
00:34:58,511 --> 00:35:02,080
has been digging up info on Mr. Park and JC Telecom.

589
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,150
He's investigating several charges.

590
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,181
Embezzlement, tax evasion, systematic destruction of evidence.

591
00:35:05,621 --> 00:35:06,920
There's a lot.

592
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,190
But this whole time,

593
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:13,190
whether it was Baek Kyu Min or Seo Ki Tae,

594
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:14,891
one of them had blocked his progress.

595
00:35:14,891 --> 00:35:16,761
But now neither of them can block him.

596
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:17,801
Exactly.

597
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,761
So this lunatic prosecutor is super excited.

598
00:35:20,761 --> 00:35:23,330
He's been interrogating Mr. Park since this morning.

599
00:35:28,371 --> 00:35:30,440
Mr. Do, I need to tell you something.

600
00:35:34,511 --> 00:35:36,110
What is it? What's wrong?

601
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,621
Just a minute.

602
00:35:46,161 --> 00:35:48,860
(Candidate 2, Lee Jin Woo)

603
00:35:56,971 --> 00:36:00,170
What should we do? He came since no one would take his calls.

604
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:03,270
I'll just turn him back nicely.

605
00:36:03,471 --> 00:36:04,741
Tell him to wait a minute.

606
00:36:05,141 --> 00:36:06,911
- Let's think this over. - Why?

607
00:36:07,281 --> 00:36:10,511
I'm sure he didn't come empty-handed to ask us to save him.

608
00:36:30,701 --> 00:36:33,400
Could I use the restroom?

609
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:41,580
It is on a different floor from the press room,

610
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,051
but I'm friends with the janitorial supervisor there.

611
00:36:50,451 --> 00:36:51,460
He's inside.

612
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:04,638
Do you know what happened to me?

613
00:37:07,078 --> 00:37:09,377
I nearly died, really.

614
00:37:09,578 --> 00:37:12,647
I thought if I got on that boat, I could leave Korea.

615
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,747
But I nearly left this earth instead.

616
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:19,687
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

617
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:23,057
I didn't ask to meet just to tell you my miseries.

618
00:37:23,057 --> 00:37:26,227
What is it then, that you needed to tell me no matter what?

619
00:37:28,368 --> 00:37:30,227
If you keep pausing like this,

620
00:37:30,227 --> 00:37:32,468
I just end up with greater expectations and disappointments.

621
00:37:32,468 --> 00:37:33,497
Your brother.

622
00:37:34,238 --> 00:37:36,368
This is about...

623
00:37:37,908 --> 00:37:39,178
Aide Lee Geun Woo's death.

624
00:37:54,587 --> 00:37:55,727
Give me just three minutes.

625
00:37:57,488 --> 00:38:00,198
Is it true that Lee Jin Woo's ledger is a fake one?

626
00:38:00,897 --> 00:38:02,127
Listen, Ms. Seo.

627
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:04,837
I'm in the same boat as your father now.

628
00:38:05,298 --> 00:38:06,837
I don't care about that.

629
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:08,837
What's the truth?

630
00:38:09,937 --> 00:38:12,977
Did my father take the money, and kill Aide Lee?

631
00:38:13,278 --> 00:38:14,348
Is that the truth?

632
00:38:15,178 --> 00:38:16,578
What are you talking about?

633
00:38:17,107 --> 00:38:18,778
You don't need to pretend you don't know anything.

634
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:21,087
I know you're a co-conspirator.

635
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:28,127
After the death of the employee who turned over the materials...

636
00:38:28,127 --> 00:38:30,428
to Aide Lee, you investigated his entire department.

637
00:38:30,428 --> 00:38:32,457
That means you know why he died.

638
00:38:32,457 --> 00:38:35,698
Then it follows that you must know who killed him as well.

639
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:38,667
You misunderstand.

640
00:38:39,868 --> 00:38:41,807
Do you think your father is really that kind of person?

641
00:38:43,568 --> 00:38:44,977
What does that mean?

642
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:49,377
I will tell you this because I think you're misunderstanding.

643
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:56,488
The person who killed Lee Geun Woo...

644
00:39:00,758 --> 00:39:01,888
It wasn't Seo Ki Tae.

645
00:39:05,198 --> 00:39:06,328
What are you talking about?

646
00:39:09,127 --> 00:39:10,667
The day Geun Woo died...

647
00:39:12,897 --> 00:39:15,437
It's Geun Woo. Aren't you picking up?

648
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:17,167
No.

649
00:39:21,448 --> 00:39:23,647
(Aide Lee Geun Woo)

650
00:39:24,107 --> 00:39:25,278
Is it Geun Woo again?

651
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:32,318
Kim Young Ju gave you the recorded conversation, right?

652
00:39:32,318 --> 00:39:33,758
The one between Seo Ki Tae and Geun Woo?

653
00:39:34,258 --> 00:39:36,287
I was there when he took that phone call.

654
00:39:36,528 --> 00:39:38,897
Don't escalate things any further, Geun Woo.

655
00:39:38,897 --> 00:39:40,727
We need to get to the Blue House together.

656
00:39:40,997 --> 00:39:42,167
I promise...

657
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:43,897
if you let this slide just this one time...

658
00:39:43,897 --> 00:39:45,437
I'm taking this public.

659
00:39:46,098 --> 00:39:48,968
Before I do, please acknowledge your wrongs...

660
00:39:48,968 --> 00:39:50,107
and step down.

661
00:39:52,008 --> 00:39:54,307
That's my final request, Mr. Seo.

662
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:56,048
This is my final warning to you too.

663
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:59,718
If you don't stop now, I'll have to block you.

664
00:39:59,977 --> 00:40:02,548
No matter what, I'll stop you using any means necessary.

665
00:40:02,548 --> 00:40:05,687
I know you're not so rotten that you'd do something to harm me.

666
00:40:05,687 --> 00:40:07,687
I still have that much faith in you.

667
00:40:08,258 --> 00:40:09,687
That's why I told you this first...

668
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:11,627
before I went to reporters.

669
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,098
Geun Woo. Geun Woo?

670
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:27,977
Ms. Kim, you'll have to send someone over right away.

671
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:29,747
Geun Woo will head to Times.

672
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:32,477
No, no, don't do that.

673
00:40:32,477 --> 00:40:34,988
Just bring him to me. I can persuade him.

674
00:40:35,147 --> 00:40:37,548
He'll do what I say.

675
00:40:37,548 --> 00:40:40,957
Mr. Seo didn't order anyone to kill Geun Woo.

676
00:40:42,428 --> 00:40:43,727
If it wasn't Seo Ki Tae,

677
00:40:44,428 --> 00:40:45,828
then who killed him?

678
00:40:48,598 --> 00:40:50,028
It's me, Mr. President.

679
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:51,537
What are you talking about?

680
00:40:52,037 --> 00:40:54,068
If he was going to follow me, he would've done from the start.

681
00:40:54,098 --> 00:40:55,167
That's enough.

682
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:57,068
Take care of it before Ki Tae arrives.

683
00:40:57,107 --> 00:40:58,678
It's dangerous to keep him alive.

684
00:40:58,877 --> 00:41:00,778
Be careful so that Ki Tae doesn't find out.

685
00:41:01,607 --> 00:41:04,307
I agree with you. Don't worry.

686
00:41:11,857 --> 00:41:13,258
Is this CEO Park?

687
00:41:14,287 --> 00:41:17,227
Something bothersome happened.

688
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:19,497
No. You don't need to get involved.

689
00:41:19,497 --> 00:41:21,127
I took care of it instead.

690
00:41:21,127 --> 00:41:23,767
He said to make sure that something like this didn't happen again.

691
00:41:23,997 --> 00:41:26,497
I'm telling you this for your benefit.

692
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,508
Your father...

693
00:41:28,508 --> 00:41:31,167
isn't as bad as that Baek Kyu Min.

694
00:41:32,307 --> 00:41:34,037
It all happened because of Baek Kyu Min...

695
00:41:34,747 --> 00:41:36,408
and that wench, Kim Young Ju.

696
00:41:37,747 --> 00:41:40,678
I wanted to tell you sooner,

697
00:41:41,247 --> 00:41:42,888
but I didn't get a chance to.

698
00:41:43,618 --> 00:41:46,417
Isn't it good that you know now?

699
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,057
If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have known until the day you died.

700
00:41:49,528 --> 00:41:52,627
Candidate Lee.

701
00:41:53,158 --> 00:41:56,068
Candidate Lee. Please save me.

702
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:57,667
Please.

703
00:41:58,337 --> 00:42:01,968
I should at least be able to show my face in Korea.

704
00:42:02,267 --> 00:42:04,537
My youngest kid hasn't graduated from college yet.

705
00:42:04,537 --> 00:42:06,937
I have to see him get a job and get married too.

706
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:09,477
Please save me. Please?

707
00:42:09,477 --> 00:42:12,247
I really almost died.

708
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:14,417
Please save me.

709
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:16,388
Candidate Lee!

710
00:42:17,017 --> 00:42:19,658
I will do whatever you tell me to!

711
00:42:19,658 --> 00:42:21,888
- Go and see him out. - I will do whatever you tell me to!

712
00:42:21,888 --> 00:42:24,087
Take the emergency stairwell so that nobody sees him.

713
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:25,627
Candidate Lee!

714
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:27,897
Ju Hee. Let's go clean up in here.

715
00:42:27,897 --> 00:42:29,497
I'll do whatever you tell me to!

716
00:42:29,997 --> 00:42:31,667
(Changing Korea)

717
00:42:32,738 --> 00:42:34,837
(Lee Jin Woo)

718
00:42:34,837 --> 00:42:36,908
- Where's Jin Woo? - Isn't he inside?

719
00:42:45,417 --> 00:42:47,118
What is it? Go out and check.

720
00:42:58,127 --> 00:42:59,357
Did you kill him?

721
00:43:00,528 --> 00:43:02,167
- Did you do it? - You punk!

722
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:03,497
Did you kill him?

723
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:04,767
- Let go! - Drag him out!

724
00:43:04,767 --> 00:43:06,767
Let go! Did you have fun?

725
00:43:06,937 --> 00:43:09,508
Did you have fun playing with me for five years?

726
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,408
You... I'll kill you!

727
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:14,278
I'll kill you!

728
00:43:14,948 --> 00:43:17,477
You arrogant little punk. You don't know your place.

729
00:43:40,568 --> 00:43:44,638
We only have good things to look forward to, both of us.

730
00:43:44,807 --> 00:43:46,337
We can only go up from here.

731
00:43:47,337 --> 00:43:49,278
Both my brother and me.

732
00:44:18,607 --> 00:44:19,908
Is that true?

733
00:44:21,307 --> 00:44:23,448
Baek Kyu Min killed Geun Woo,

734
00:44:23,448 --> 00:44:24,747
and he made Young Ju do it?

735
00:44:27,147 --> 00:44:28,147
Yes.

736
00:44:28,147 --> 00:44:30,818
CEO Park said he'd testify if needed.

737
00:44:30,818 --> 00:44:32,718
That he received a call from Baek Kyu Min...

738
00:44:33,118 --> 00:44:34,758
saying he took care of Aide Lee Geun Woo.

739
00:45:00,877 --> 00:45:04,287
So, Dad. It's time to tell the truth and put an end to this.

740
00:45:05,417 --> 00:45:06,557
I can't do that.

741
00:45:06,557 --> 00:45:10,158
Because while you didn't kill him, you received a bribe?

742
00:45:11,057 --> 00:45:12,698
I heard about everything from CEO Park.

743
00:45:12,698 --> 00:45:15,328
That the ledger Lee Jin Woo has is real.

744
00:45:15,528 --> 00:45:17,828
Seong Beom received it under my name...

745
00:45:17,828 --> 00:45:20,468
and used it as funds for my presidential campaign.

746
00:45:22,568 --> 00:45:24,267
I found out later.

747
00:45:26,207 --> 00:45:27,508
Did you know...

748
00:45:29,408 --> 00:45:31,408
that Aide Lee Geun Woo didn't commit suicide too?

749
00:45:36,848 --> 00:45:37,888
Mr. Seo.

750
00:45:37,888 --> 00:45:41,017
I heard Geun Woo's case was closed as a suicide.

751
00:45:41,457 --> 00:45:44,328
I got a call from Chief Kim too.

752
00:45:45,158 --> 00:45:47,028
Okay. Keep up the good work.

753
00:45:49,568 --> 00:45:51,638
Let's stop somewhere first.

754
00:46:12,388 --> 00:46:15,227
Even if I knew, there was nothing I could do about it.

755
00:46:16,888 --> 00:46:19,598
That's why I wanted to obtain this position more.

756
00:46:19,598 --> 00:46:21,968
I didn't want Geun Woo's death to go to waste.

757
00:46:22,227 --> 00:46:25,568
No. That isn't what he would've wanted.

758
00:46:26,037 --> 00:46:28,368
Make sure that everything will be revealed now...

759
00:46:29,138 --> 00:46:30,707
and admit to your wrongdoings, Dad.

760
00:46:30,937 --> 00:46:32,477
The more you hide it, the bigger the suspicions will become,

761
00:46:32,477 --> 00:46:36,078
and at this rate, people might start saying you killed Aide Lee.

762
00:46:36,977 --> 00:46:38,008
Jung In.

763
00:46:38,778 --> 00:46:41,888
I need another chance right now.

764
00:46:41,888 --> 00:46:43,448
You know that for the past five years,

765
00:46:43,448 --> 00:46:45,818
there was nothing that I did properly.

766
00:46:47,457 --> 00:46:48,627
If I have...

767
00:46:49,587 --> 00:46:51,758
If I have one more chance,

768
00:46:51,758 --> 00:46:54,258
I'm confident that I can do everything I intended to do.

769
00:46:58,437 --> 00:46:59,468
Jung In.

770
00:47:00,238 --> 00:47:02,607
This is my last request as your father.

771
00:47:08,138 --> 00:47:10,207
If I were to tell you as your daughter,

772
00:47:10,477 --> 00:47:12,318
I believe it's only right to report on this story.

773
00:47:13,218 --> 00:47:16,087
It's because I don't want you to be framed for murder too.

774
00:47:16,848 --> 00:47:19,488
I think this is all I can do for you.

775
00:47:19,818 --> 00:47:21,488
From the bribe you received...

776
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:24,187
to the truth behind Aide Lee Geun Woo's death.

777
00:47:25,557 --> 00:47:27,397
I'll report on just the facts.

778
00:47:33,298 --> 00:47:35,607
Jung In.

779
00:48:07,897 --> 00:48:10,207
(Seo Jung In)

780
00:48:15,307 --> 00:48:16,548
(Seo Jung In)

781
00:48:20,178 --> 00:48:21,218
Jin Woo.

782
00:48:21,687 --> 00:48:25,017
Baek Kyu Min was behind what happened to Aide Lee Geun Woo.

783
00:48:25,417 --> 00:48:27,758
We have to reveal what happened from the beginning.

784
00:48:28,457 --> 00:48:29,888
I'm on my way to Times.

785
00:48:30,328 --> 00:48:31,357
I'll wait for you there.

786
00:48:52,977 --> 00:48:54,178
Mr. Kim.

787
00:48:54,178 --> 00:48:56,348
Find out where Jung In is and bring her to me.

788
00:49:13,497 --> 00:49:14,767
What is this?

789
00:49:16,437 --> 00:49:17,568
We will escort you back.

790
00:49:56,278 --> 00:49:57,348
She went over there!

791
00:50:22,207 --> 00:50:23,238
What is this?

792
00:50:23,468 --> 00:50:24,667
You guys go that way,

793
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:25,678
- and you follow me. - Yes, sir.

794
00:50:48,698 --> 00:50:50,627
(Times)

795
00:51:05,747 --> 00:51:08,818
(Times)

796
00:51:11,747 --> 00:51:13,218
Jin Woo. Can we meet up right now?

797
00:51:13,218 --> 00:51:14,658
I'll go to your office.

798
00:51:15,127 --> 00:51:16,357
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

799
00:51:18,028 --> 00:51:19,897
I guess he left.

800
00:51:20,928 --> 00:51:22,328
I'm on my way to Times.

801
00:51:22,828 --> 00:51:23,868
I'll wait for you there.

802
00:52:16,247 --> 00:52:17,247
She's over there!

803
00:52:20,787 --> 00:52:22,357
Where are you after telling me to come?

804
00:52:22,857 --> 00:52:24,187
Don't come here, Jin Woo!

805
00:52:24,187 --> 00:52:25,897
Catch her quickly! Stop there!

806
00:52:25,897 --> 00:52:27,098
I said run away!

807
00:52:27,457 --> 00:52:28,868
Jung In. Seo Jung In.

808
00:52:45,048 --> 00:52:46,948
The person you have reached is not available.

809
00:52:55,888 --> 00:52:57,127
(Daughter)

810
00:54:04,888 --> 00:54:05,897
Jin Woo!

811
00:54:10,828 --> 00:54:11,868
Jung In!

812
00:54:36,328 --> 00:54:37,388
Jung In!

813
00:54:37,828 --> 00:54:38,828
Jung In!

814
00:54:39,557 --> 00:54:43,068
Jung In! Wake up, Jung In.

815
00:54:43,598 --> 00:54:44,727
Mr. President.

816
00:55:00,977 --> 00:55:03,147
What are you doing? Call the ambulance right now!

817
00:55:06,057 --> 00:55:08,388
Wake up, Jung In. Jung In.

818
00:55:09,727 --> 00:55:10,787
My...

819
00:55:11,857 --> 00:55:12,857
My dad...

820
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:15,868
Don't resent him too much...

821
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:21,837
Jung In.

822
00:55:23,437 --> 00:55:24,468
Jung In.

823
00:55:26,437 --> 00:55:27,778
Jung In, wake up.

824
00:55:31,348 --> 00:55:32,377
Jung In.

825
00:55:57,107 --> 00:56:01,107
What can I do now? I've come too far.

826
00:56:02,848 --> 00:56:03,948
I'm sorry.

827
00:56:05,207 --> 00:56:07,017
But you still need to do it.

828
00:56:08,348 --> 00:56:10,118
You've been afraid a lot.

829
00:56:11,048 --> 00:56:14,658
Wondering if you made the wrong decision and if you will regret.

830
00:56:16,187 --> 00:56:18,227
That's why you've been running only looking forward.

831
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:21,557
We cannot change the past,

832
00:56:21,557 --> 00:56:23,928
but we can make the right decision in the present.

833
00:56:25,598 --> 00:56:27,568
Let's not regret again.

834
00:56:28,267 --> 00:56:29,607
I'll be waiting, Jin Woo.

835
00:56:30,738 --> 00:56:33,107
You know it.

836
00:56:34,138 --> 00:56:35,778
That I've always trusted you.

837
00:56:57,928 --> 00:57:00,397
Reporter Seo Jung In, the daughter of President Seo Ki Tae...

838
00:57:00,397 --> 00:57:03,807
died in a car accident yesterday at 3:23pm.

839
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:06,607
President Seo Ki Tae announced he will hold a family ceremony,

840
00:57:06,607 --> 00:57:10,048
receiving only a few guests.

841
00:57:10,807 --> 00:57:14,377
We, DBS, also send condolences to Reporter Seo Jung In.

842
00:58:10,307 --> 00:58:12,607
(We thank actor Ha Jun for the cameo.)
