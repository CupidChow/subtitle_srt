Kim Young Ju.

180
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,488
I'm sure you realized that every time you connect with the past,

181
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,819
your cell phone acts up.

182
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:14,529
You don't have any more chances to change the past.

183
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:17,529
She won't be able to remember...

184
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,529
what happened to me in 2020.

185
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,238
I know that you will change the past once again.

186
00:13:24,468 --> 00:13:26,569
After my last phone call with Jin Woo,

187
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,539
everything changed.

188
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,579
After the truth was buried in 2015.

189
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:34,648
What are you doing?

190
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:36,679
A way to find out what it is.

191
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:41,289
Someone capable of investigating the case even now...

192
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:46,358
There is someone.

193
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,589
There is someone like that.

194
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:56,598
The people's choice of 2020, the presidential debate...

195
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:59,898
among candidates will air tonight on DBS at 9pm.

196
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:02,709
After moving past Candidate Kim Sung Guk, third in approval ratings,

197
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,439
she has moved into second place.

198
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:06,878
Currently, candidate Kim Young Ju...

199
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:08,709
of the Democratic People's Party,

200
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:10,378
and the Creation Party's candidate, Lee Jin Woo,

201
00:14:10,378 --> 00:14:13,348
are expected to face off.

202
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:16,819
All eyes are on this debate,

203
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:20,689
and each candidate has prepared to win...

204
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:24,128
- and will participate in today's... - Gosh.

205
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:25,758
Why hello.

206
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:29,128
You came all this way, my dear Assemblymen.

207
00:14:29,128 --> 00:14:31,439
It was no trouble at all.

208
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:33,138
Let's go in first.

209
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:34,709
This way.

210
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,138
Here.

211
00:14:41,978 --> 00:14:44,648
So you talked things over with Kim Sung Guk?

212
00:14:44,648 --> 00:14:46,419
He suggested uniting...

213
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,848
with Candidate Lee Jin Woo.

214
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:50,348
But we'll have to wait and see.

215
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,189
We'll set up a meeting soon.

216
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,128
If we help Candidate Lee,

217
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,758
I'm sure he'll pay us back amply.

218
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,228
I taught him that well.

219
00:15:00,228 --> 00:15:01,398
Kindnesses should be repaid, even after death.

220
00:15:01,398 --> 00:15:03,898
No matter what, you repay those who helped you.

221
00:15:05,768 --> 00:15:07,939
I think that's what it means.

222
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:10,709
You're right. It's correct.

223
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,478
What a relief.

224
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:16,508
What does this mean, that I'll support justice?

225
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:19,279
I'll just take this.

226
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,319
You can refer to this.

227
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,018
I already arranged everything with the emcee.

228
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,789
If it looks like you're losing to Lee Jin Woo,

229
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:28,358
he'll cut him off.

230
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:31,098
(Presidential Debate)

231
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,299
It's one minute to air. Please wrap up.

232
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,699
Jin Woo, you're so handsome.

233
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:35,728
(The people's choice of 2020, Lee Jin Woo)

234
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:40,909
(Kim Young Ju, Lee Jin Woo, Kim Sung Guk)

235
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:43,008
(The people's choice of 2020, Kim Young Ju)

236
00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:46,978
What were you talking about?

237
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:49,579
Excuse me?

238
00:15:50,478 --> 00:15:52,679
You think I'll lose again, like five years ago, don't you?

239
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:56,218
Candidate Lee, to bring that up here, of all places...

240
00:15:56,218 --> 00:15:58,618
I'm bringing it up here because I have no occasion to run into you.

241
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:01,559
I won't be manipulated the way I was back then.

242
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,488
I've grown up since then.

243
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,478
(Police)

244
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:24,648
It's time for the debate to start, right?

245
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,949
Yes, sir. It should be starting now.

246
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:32,218
I saw both candidate's pledges,

247
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:35,258
and Ms. Kim had many good pledges.

248
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:38,059
Increase welfare for the needy.

249
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:41,998
Increase labour income share by 75 percent.

250
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,138
Increase employment of permanent employees.

251
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:47,098
Increase medical support in isolated areas.

252
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:49,069
- I enjoyed reading it. - Thank you.

253
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:50,138
There's no need to thank me.

254
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:53,508
Your pledges were so good that I wanted to change them with mine.

255
00:16:53,508 --> 00:16:56,248
There were many great aspects about your pledges as well, Mr. Lee.

256
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,449
That is, if you take out a few.

257
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,718
I know you don't mean it, but thank you.

258
00:16:59,848 --> 00:17:01,648
But there's something that I'm curious about.

259
00:17:02,348 --> 00:17:03,488
May I ask?

260
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:05,358
Yes, go ahead.

261
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,529
You have such great pledges,

262
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:10,089
but why weren't you able to fulfill them for the past five years?

263
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:11,329
Pardon?

264
00:17:12,228 --> 00:17:14,998
President Seo Ki Tae is also a part of the Democratic People's Party,

265
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:17,299
and he had five years to fulfill...

266
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,069
these great pledges.

267
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:22,169
But why didn't he do anything? That's what I'm asking.

268
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,348
That's why I read the pledges that President Seo made...

269
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,819
five years ago.

270
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:34,319
They're identical to your pledges, Ms. Kim.

271
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,948
You just changed the percentage of the labour income share...

272
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:39,489
from 70 percent to 75 percent.

273
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:42,658
Are you giving false hope to the people?

274
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:45,128
Can you change things just because you say it?

275
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:47,098
Nice. He got her.

276
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:48,969
Aren't you going to clap?

277
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:53,969
Furthermore, you were...

278
00:17:53,969 --> 00:17:57,039
the police director for President Seo Ki Tae's campaign...

279
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,638
during the 2015 elections,

280
00:17:58,938 --> 00:18:01,848
and I believe you were the one who came up with these pledges.

281
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,819
Wouldn't this be considered self-welfare?

282
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,589
Isn't this plagiarism? Plagiarism of your pledges.

283
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:14,289
In the interest of time, we will end our debate on pledges here.

284
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:16,029
- We'll move on to the next... - Please be quiet.

285
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:17,188
Pardon?

286
00:18:17,188 --> 00:18:19,428
Don't cut me off and be quiet.

287
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:20,829
I don't know...

288
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:23,428
what kind of conversation you had with Ms. Kim's party...

289
00:18:23,428 --> 00:18:26,198
If I do it, it will be different.

290
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:31,708
I'm saying that I can fulfill those pledges.

291
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,178
That's why I stepped up for the presidency.

292
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,848
You're running for office to fulfill these pledges?

293
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:40,118
The pledges that President Seo failed to fulfill...

294
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,158
Why did you stop talking?

295
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:48,729
What about the pledged that President Seo failed to fulfill?

296
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:56,628
You're saying that you will fulfill the pledges...

297
00:18:57,198 --> 00:18:59,368
that you have failed to fulfill for such a long time.

298
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:03,239
How do you intend to fulfill them?

299
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:06,908
Yes, it's me.

300
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:08,448
- Tell her to acknowledge it. - Pardon?

301
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,148
Tell her to say that the Seo Administration failed,

302
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:12,479
and it was the worst administration that should never exist again.

303
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:14,049
Tell Young Ju to say that.

304
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:15,348
That's the only way to turn the tables.

305
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,719
"I'll do my best. Just trust me."

306
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,618
- Stop saying these things. - Yes, sir.

307
00:19:21,158 --> 00:19:23,229
Please give us a specific answer...

308
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,358
about what you will do and how you will do it.

309
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:37,138
Right. Everything you said was right, Mr. Lee.

310
00:19:37,138 --> 00:19:40,138
The Seo Administration was inadequate in all aspects,

311
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,809
and it gave rise to doubt instead of confidence...

312
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:46,319
and division rather than harmony amongst the citizens of Korea.

313
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,749
It also had a pledge fulfilment rate of 12 percent...

314
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:50,589
which is the lowest in history.

315
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,319
Are you satisfied with this?

316
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:54,928
You pointed out the weaknesses of the current administration,

317
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,658
and you made personal attacks and puns...

318
00:19:56,658 --> 00:19:58,458
to embarrass your opposing candidate.

319
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,958
Are you satisfied with yourself?

320
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:05,868
I know how Mr. Lee started out in politics...

321
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:09,339
and how he ended up in this position.

322
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:12,108
However, there's one thing I would like to say.

323
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:15,378
Politics isn't a variety show.

324
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,749
Saying whatever comes to mind, behaving in any way,

325
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,178
and only saying and doing nice things...

326
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,388
to provide the citizens with amusement...

327
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,918
isn't the behaviour of a proper politician.

328
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:30,458
I would like Mr. Lee to take this opportunity to ask himself this.

329
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,999
"Is Candidate Lee Jin Woo..."

330
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:37,898
"qualified to be a presidential candidate for Korea?

331
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:46,579
The debate is getting heated, so I will intervene.

332
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:49,749
He got her once, but she got him twice.

333
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:52,819
Why are you clapping?

334
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,648
We should give all the candidates...

335
00:20:54,648 --> 00:20:57,188
an equal opportunity to speak during this debate.

336
00:20:57,188 --> 00:20:58,358
Let's just listen to the radio.

337
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,789
For everyone in the Gangwon area...

338
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:04,928
Since we have run out of time,

339
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:08,029
we cannot allow anyone to give more answers.

340
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:12,198
Next is Candidate Kim Sung Guk's turn to speak on his initiative.

341
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:16,339
Next, according to the last public opinion poll,

342
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:19,539
Kim Young Ju had 44 percent, and we had 32 percent.

343
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:22,309
We were behind by over 10 percent,

344
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:26,049
but the response to the TV debate is really good.

345
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:28,589
I believe that it will be reduced to a single-digit figure.

346
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,489
(I will be sure to do it! Lee Jin Woo)

347
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,989
If Kim Sung Guk agrees to unify with us,

348
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:37,799
won't this mean that we will win no matter what?

349
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:41,628
Of course. If Candidate Kim's supporters vote for us,

350
00:21:41,628 --> 00:21:43,229
the game will be over.

351
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,499
I heard he was very good at tennis.

352
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,368
Hey, Jin Woo. I mean Mr. Lee.

353
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,408
I might not be able to get Federer,

354
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:52,908
but I'll find a top-ranking tennis coach for you.

355
00:21:52,908 --> 00:21:55,908
I'll take care of that, so you should focus on your work.

356
00:21:55,908 --> 00:21:57,249
Let's end our meeting here.

357
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,918
- Okay. Good work, everyone. - Good work, everyone.

358
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,118
Good work.

359
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:09,259
Hey. Why...

360
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:12,829
Why would you talk like that to me in front of so many people?

361
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,668
What's so bad about telling you to focus on your work?

362
00:22:14,928 --> 00:22:17,898
Learning tennis and getting close to Kim Sung Guk isn't your job.

363
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,368
Even still...

364
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:23,608
I'm doing all of this so that you can be elected.

365
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:27,979
Hey, Jin Woo. That's that.

366
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:29,408
I have something to say.

367
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:31,848
Baek Kyu Min...

368
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:53,701
Jin Woo came to me...

369
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:56,272
and said, "Mr. President. I respect you. Please accept me."

370
00:22:56,272 --> 00:22:57,671
"I will treat you like a father for the rest of my life."

371
00:22:57,671 --> 00:22:59,072
That's what he said.

372
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,312
Were you talking about me?

373
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:03,612
Goodness, Mr. Lee. Welcome.

374
00:23:03,612 --> 00:23:04,812
You got here faster than I expected.

375
00:23:04,812 --> 00:23:06,012
There wasn't any traffic.

376
00:23:06,012 --> 00:23:09,022
Is that so? Why wasn't there any traffic? There's always traffic.

377
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:10,992
Good question.

378
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:13,522
It's been a while since we met. Have you all been well?

379
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:16,092
Goodness, Mr. Lee. It's a lot of hard work, right?

380
00:23:16,191 --> 00:23:18,362
No, sir. It's not hard work.

381
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,492
Let's go in. It's cold.

382
00:23:20,492 --> 00:23:22,362
I heard they've prepared some good food today.

383
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:31,742
I enjoyed the debate last night.

384
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:34,282
You expressed yourself very clearly.

385
00:23:34,842 --> 00:23:36,141
I was defeated very clearly.

386
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:40,012
I'll work harder next time.

387
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:44,352
But where's Candidate Kim Sung Guk?

388
00:23:44,352 --> 00:23:46,522
What? He should be here by now.

389
00:23:47,151 --> 00:23:48,691
Is he stuck in traffic?

390
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:52,292
- Hey. Give him a call. - Yes, sir.

391
00:23:56,332 --> 00:23:57,502
I'm sorry for being late.

392
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:59,671
No, it's fine. No need to apologize.

393
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,542
This is Candidate Kim.

394
00:24:03,671 --> 00:24:06,871
He will be on the same boat as us from now on.

395
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:08,512
He's our comrade from now on.

396
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:12,782
I’m looking forward to working with you.

397
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:15,381
Same for me too, President Lee Jin Woo.

398
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:18,352
Gosh, how heartwarming.

399
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:20,992
There's no need for a heater when things are this heart-warming.

400
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:23,522
Let's drink.

401
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:25,832
- Here. Have a drink, Sung Guk. - Yes, sir.

402
00:24:28,032 --> 00:24:29,032
Cheers!

403
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:30,231
Cheers!

404
00:24:48,782 --> 00:24:52,092
(Times)

405
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,012
Who is...

406
00:25:17,612 --> 00:25:19,082
Ms. Seo?

407
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:20,651
You're reporter Myung Su Kyung, right?

408
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:23,151
Yes, I am.

409
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,191
What brings you here?

410
00:25:28,121 --> 00:25:32,592
Actually, I heard about this case from Jin Woo.

411
00:25:33,891 --> 00:25:37,262
I used to know him.

412
00:25:37,262 --> 00:25:40,102
But why didn't he tell us?

413
00:25:40,102 --> 00:25:41,871
(Times)

414
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:45,542
Jin Woo said I'll come here someday.

415
00:25:45,941 --> 00:25:47,371
While he's talking about the wiretap, right?

416
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:49,711
What?

417
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:51,881
Help Seo Jung In whenever she comes asking for help?

418
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:53,512
Just help her if I say so.

419
00:25:53,681 --> 00:25:56,082
I need you to do something. A wiretap.

420
00:25:56,082 --> 00:25:57,121
- What? - A wiretap?

421
00:25:57,121 --> 00:25:59,621
Whenever you have time, study up on wiretapping.

422
00:25:59,621 --> 00:26:00,852
Oh, yes.

423
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:03,492
I remember.

424
00:26:03,492 --> 00:26:06,292
You're right. He told me then.

425
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:08,332
Unbelievable.

426
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:13,832
But since when have you been working alone at Times?

427
00:26:13,832 --> 00:26:15,471
When did Jin Woo quit?

428
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:18,342
In 2015.

429
00:26:19,072 --> 00:26:21,981
There was another guy called Young Jae.

430
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,552
But he left with him then.

431
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:25,552
Why?

432
00:26:27,582 --> 00:26:29,981
I've actually been having a hard time understanding it.

433
00:26:29,981 --> 00:26:33,221
That Jin Woo left Times and became a politician.

434
00:26:33,221 --> 00:26:34,891
I still can't understand.

435
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:39,691
That's how five years have passed.

436
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:43,401
I thought he would come back soon until then.

437
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:49,471
Anyway, you said you came...

438
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:51,242
because of the coverage of JC's charity event, right?

439
00:26:51,971 --> 00:26:55,411
Yes. I've been looking for those behind the incident.

440
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:58,552
Whatever your reason is, give up.

441
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:00,451
Because there's no way.

442
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:03,981
Evidence or whatever. They're all gone now.

443
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:08,461
While we were preparing the report, it all disappeared.

444
00:27:08,891 --> 00:27:10,292
What about the ledge with initials?

445
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:12,691
You know everything.

446
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:15,862
It's gone too.

447
00:27:15,862 --> 00:27:18,131
Why? Did someone take it?

448
00:27:19,131 --> 00:27:20,772
- Who... - Jin Woo did.

449
00:27:21,502 --> 00:27:25,112
Jin Woo got rid of all the evidence.

450
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,711
To stop the coverage of the case.

451
00:27:30,512 --> 00:27:32,951
It's really not far off now.

452
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:36,552
It's right in front of your nose. The place you want to go to.

453
00:27:38,752 --> 00:27:40,391
It's all thanks to you, Mr. President.

454
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,921
I will repay you all my life.

455
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,862
Of course, I will keep the promise I made as well.

456
00:27:46,862 --> 00:27:48,701
Of course, you have to keep it.

457
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:52,772
If not, there's no reason for me to help you like this.

458
00:27:52,931 --> 00:27:57,641
From the beginning, you've been grabbing my neck for five years.

459
00:28:06,411 --> 00:28:08,582
Sit down. You came all the way.

460
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,421
I wanted to meet you today...

461
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:14,822
because I felt so sorry for what you had gone through.

462
00:28:15,621 --> 00:28:17,691
What are you talking about?

463
00:28:17,691 --> 00:28:19,592
Your brother, Aide Lee Geun Woo.

464
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:21,231
I heard Seo Ki Tae, that guy killed him.

465
00:28:21,731 --> 00:28:23,262
It's not what a human can do.

466
00:28:23,762 --> 00:28:25,602
How can he kill his aide working for him?

467
00:28:27,502 --> 00:28:29,342
If you trust me and hand over that evidence to me,

468
00:28:29,342 --> 00:28:31,572
I'll take sweet revenge for your brother.

469
00:28:31,572 --> 00:28:33,941
Honestly, do you think you can associate him...

470
00:28:33,941 --> 00:28:35,881
with your brother's incident with such a thing?

471
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:36,881
You can't.

472
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,582
Seo Ki Tae, that punk will find his way out like a loach.

473
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,651
That means if I give you the evidence I have,

474
00:28:44,151 --> 00:28:46,322
you're going to reveal my brother's incident, doesn't it?

475
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,592
And you'll remove Seo Ki Tae as well.

476
00:28:48,592 --> 00:28:50,221
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

477
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:55,302
Mr. Lee is very quick at understanding what people say.

478
00:28:56,231 --> 00:29:00,171
Is that why you became a reporter? Because you understand so well?

479
00:29:00,401 --> 00:29:02,641
Hand the evidence to me.

480
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,572
Then I'll kill Seo Ki Tae and all his family.

481
00:29:04,572 --> 00:29:06,012
Just be honest with me.

482
00:29:06,941 --> 00:29:09,211
What? Be honest about what?

483
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:11,881
"My life is at stake on the evidence you got."

484
00:29:12,282 --> 00:29:15,522
"So don't think about using it and taking revenge on Seo Ki Tae."

485
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:17,992
"It will hurt me as well."

486
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:20,292
That's what you want to say.

487
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:24,391
But to put it bluntly, how can you get Seo Ki Tae?

488
00:29:24,391 --> 00:29:26,961
A president with a month left can do it the presidential candidate?

489
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:29,302
It makes no sense.

490
00:29:30,161 --> 00:29:31,371
That's right.

491
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:34,231
It's awful to hear it, but it is true.

492
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:35,572
Gosh.

493
00:29:36,201 --> 00:29:38,112
I didn't want to make things awkward between us.

494
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:40,572
So I tried to beat around the bush.

495
00:29:40,971 --> 00:29:43,981
But you're too straightforward.

496
00:29:43,981 --> 00:29:45,451
You make me embarrassed.

497
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:49,052
I know very well about the impact...

498
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:50,852
of the evidence I have on the country.

499
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:53,292
It will cause utter chaos and conflicts.

500
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,822
That's not what I want.

501
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,931
You getting hurt is even farther from what I want.

502
00:29:59,062 --> 00:30:01,931
Let's be real. What politician has never taken a bribe?

503
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:03,431
Right. You're absolutely right.

504
00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:06,471
It's nice of you that you have such a progressive idea.

505
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:13,471
But Mr. President, if I save your life,

506
00:30:13,471 --> 00:30:16,282
if I help you go back to your warm private house,

507
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,252
not a cold prison,

508
00:30:19,252 --> 00:30:22,282
what will you do for me?

509
00:30:22,282 --> 00:30:24,522
I should do whatever you want. Tell me.

510
00:30:25,221 --> 00:30:27,852
I can do anything for you except for one thing.

511
00:30:29,191 --> 00:30:30,391
Give me power.

512
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,431
A power to take Seo Ki Tae down.

513
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:37,332
I was about to say I can do anything for you...

514
00:30:37,332 --> 00:30:39,401
except for bringing down Seo Ki Tae.

515
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:41,131
But that's what you wanted.

516
00:30:43,772 --> 00:30:44,842
Mr. Lee.

517
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:49,211
Seo Ki Tae will sit here soon.

518
00:30:49,211 --> 00:30:50,512
Do you know what it means?

519
00:30:51,012 --> 00:30:53,252
It means he will become number one in Korea.

520
00:30:55,881 --> 00:30:57,451
To catch Seo Ki Tae,

521
00:30:57,951 --> 00:31:01,891
you need to be a president for the next-next term at least.

522
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:06,062
Is the power...

523
00:31:06,661 --> 00:31:09,731
you were talking about earlier, is the power I'm talking about now?

524
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,401
The next-next president of Korea?

525
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:17,371
Are you joking?

526
00:31:18,112 --> 00:31:21,842
This is the only way for a guy like me to catch Seo Ki Tae.

527
00:31:21,842 --> 00:31:23,441
Please don't ignore what I said.

528
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:28,052
Make me a president exactly five years later.

529
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,252
It's not the position I can appoint.

530
00:31:30,381 --> 00:31:32,052
You think democracy is nothing?

531
00:31:32,052 --> 00:31:33,451
I'll earn the hearts of the public.

532
00:31:33,451 --> 00:31:35,492
I'm only asking you to establish a political foothold for me.

533
00:31:35,762 --> 00:31:37,062
I need your support.

534
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,092
I need the support of the assembly members on your side.

535
00:31:39,092 --> 00:31:40,492
If I give you my support,

536
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:43,062
are you sure you can get rid of Seo Ki Tae?

537
00:31:43,062 --> 00:31:44,562
- Can I trust you? - Trust me.

538
00:31:44,901 --> 00:31:47,971
I saved his life. I'll be the one who will trample on his life.

539
00:31:47,971 --> 00:31:49,371
I like the spirit.

540
00:31:50,002 --> 00:31:52,112
Although I'm not sure if I can trust the spirit.

541
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,881
All right. To trample on Seo Ki Tae,

542
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,052
what should I do for you first?

543
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:00,881
Mr. Next-Next President.

544
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:03,181
First, before you leave the office,

545
00:32:03,181 --> 00:32:05,752
make the people on your side leave Democratic People's Party...

546
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:07,552
and form a new party.

547
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:10,822
Before that, throw away Nam Seong Beom and Kim Young Ju.

548
00:32:10,822 --> 00:32:13,731
They wouldn't want me to work under you.

549
00:32:14,092 --> 00:32:17,762
Does it mean a callus needs to be cut off to heal?

550
00:32:19,201 --> 00:32:21,272
You talk like a tiger cub who is going to bite me later.

551
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,742
I can't really tell.

552
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:26,871
There are so many crazy dogs that talk like a tiger cub.

553
00:32:26,871 --> 00:32:30,612
Whether I'm a dog or a tiger cub, I'll show you from now on.

554
00:32:31,512 --> 00:32:33,881
You're definitely a dog,

555
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:35,681
but I can't trust you.

556
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:37,451
Even if you don't trust me, there's no other way.

557
00:32:37,782 --> 00:32:39,421
If you reject my suggestion,

558
00:32:39,421 --> 00:32:41,862
you'll spend the rest of your life in prison after leaving the office.

559
00:32:42,562 --> 00:32:43,592
Mr. President.

560
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:47,191
You have nothing to lose. Just hold my hand.

561
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:51,901
Then I will cover your corruption for the rest of my life.

562
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:02,911
At that time, I was forced to do it...

563
00:33:02,911 --> 00:33:04,582
as my life was at stake.

564
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,651
But who knew things would turn out like this?

565
00:33:06,812 --> 00:33:08,381
Thank you, Candidate Lee.

566
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:13,352
How dare can I grab your neck, Mr. President?

567
00:33:13,352 --> 00:33:15,992
You shouldn't think so. I received so much from you.

568
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:19,362
You're the only person I can trust now.

569
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:20,931
I'm not sure if I'm being greedy,

570
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:23,302
but I hope you feel the same.

571
00:33:23,532 --> 00:33:24,772
What are you talking about?

572
00:33:25,802 --> 00:33:27,431
Are you confessing your love or something?

573
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:30,441
No, I'm not.

574
00:33:30,572 --> 00:33:33,842
On the way here, I heard something.

575
00:33:33,842 --> 00:33:35,181
I have something to say.

576
00:33:35,342 --> 00:33:37,342
Baek Kyu Min, that guy...

577
00:33:37,342 --> 00:33:38,811
I heard you ordered a person in my campaign to look...

578
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:42,222
into the donation I had received.

579
00:33:45,751 --> 00:33:47,421
(Times)

580
00:33:49,921 --> 00:33:53,432
Jin Woo suddenly disappeared for a while.

581
00:33:54,662 --> 00:33:56,802
Then he came back to Times.

582
00:33:58,032 --> 00:34:01,331
He said he got a call from Former President Baek Kyu Min.

583
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:04,342
I don't know what they talked about.

584
00:34:05,242 --> 00:34:09,211
But after meeting him, he became a different person.

585
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,881
He told me that he doesn't have to reveal the truth.

586
00:34:14,881 --> 00:34:17,081
That it's useless anyway.

587
00:34:17,981 --> 00:34:21,521
That instead of doing things like that, he should take revenge.

588
00:34:22,662 --> 00:34:24,521
After that, he left Times...

589
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:27,691
and became a politician following Baek Kyu Min.

590
00:34:27,892 --> 00:34:32,001
That's when Jin Woo started to stop the truth from getting out.

591
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:34,231
He removed...

592
00:34:34,231 --> 00:34:35,702
all the evidence I had collected.

593
00:34:35,702 --> 00:34:39,242
He even stopped other reporters other than me from reporting it.

594
00:34:42,211 --> 00:34:44,682
To be honest, I'm tired now.

595
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:45,851
I don't want to do it anymore.

596
00:34:47,012 --> 00:34:50,552
No one wants the truth anyway.

597
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:58,092
(Assemblywoman Kim Young Ju)

598
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,601
Did you want to know about it so bad?

599
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:11,342
Whether I received illegal election funds or not?

600
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:14,041
Oh, my. The alcohol is getting me.

601
00:35:14,142 --> 00:35:16,342
I guess I'm old now.

602
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:20,711
I understand why you did that.

603
00:35:21,151 --> 00:35:24,182
Trust in politics comes from mistakes.

604
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:27,521
Because you don't trust each other, you rely on using weaknesses.

605
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:29,421
And once someone has a hold of your weakness, you trust them.

606
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,631
That's how it is.

607
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:35,162
That's right. Don't misunderstand.

608
00:35:35,162 --> 00:35:36,831
I'll apologize to you.

609
00:35:37,032 --> 00:35:39,171
It's not like you got involved in bribery.

610
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:40,831
You're clean a whistle.

611
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:46,211
You've always been a man who's plain with his words.

612
00:35:47,842 --> 00:35:50,941
Stop that.

613
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,952
The person you're with will have bad luck for three years.

614
00:35:53,052 --> 00:35:54,112
Here you go.

615
00:35:55,421 --> 00:35:56,851
- Thank you. - Of course.

616
00:36:09,532 --> 00:36:10,662
Take care on your way home.

617
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,932
Should we have another drink somewhere close by?

618
00:36:13,932 --> 00:36:16,702
- Let's do that next time. - All right.

619
00:36:16,702 --> 00:36:18,271
- Take care. - Okay, okay.

620
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:24,412
He's got his wish. Let's go.

621
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:30,622
That old rascal.

622
00:36:31,251 --> 00:36:32,592
Scheming away.

623
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:45,532
Do you know who Jin Woo reminds me of?

624
00:36:45,731 --> 00:36:47,032
Who, sir?

625
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:48,472
Seo Ki Tae.

626
00:36:49,842 --> 00:36:52,711
I keep thinking of Seo Ki Tae.

627
00:36:52,972 --> 00:36:54,872
They both think they're so great,

628
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,311
but they're actually quite similar.

629
00:36:57,612 --> 00:37:01,651
The things they do, the things they see and learn,

630
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:04,322
they're very similar.

631
00:37:04,552 --> 00:37:06,521
Every time I see them, I get a bad taste in my mouth,

632
00:37:06,822 --> 00:37:09,222
and the more time passes, the ruder they get.

633
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,032
Gosh.

634
00:37:14,262 --> 00:37:16,731
I suddenly miss my mother.

635
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,532
Let's turn the car around and go to Pyeongchang-dong.

636
00:37:18,532 --> 00:37:19,601
Yes, sir.

637
00:37:26,472 --> 00:37:30,112
I heard this from someone in Jin Woo's camp today.

638
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:34,912
Apparently, Jin Woo and Sung Guk are currently thinking of unifying.

639
00:37:35,552 --> 00:37:40,421
It appears to be the doing of Baek Kyu Min again.

640
00:37:40,622 --> 00:37:41,622
I'm sure that's the case.

641
00:37:42,622 --> 00:37:43,862
I'm sure he made a deal.

642
00:37:44,222 --> 00:37:45,961
That's Baek Kyu Min's specialty, after all.

643
00:37:46,262 --> 00:37:49,561
The Democratic People's Party hasn't changed at all.

644
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:53,731
They're always dividing or splitting the members internally.

645
00:37:54,702 --> 00:37:58,001
We have these ruptures in politics because of people like that.

646
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,441
Half the Democratic People's Party broke off and left,

647
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:03,642
and now they're doing evil deeds with the Creation Party.

648
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:08,282
Whenever the President tries to get them to act,

649
00:38:08,282 --> 00:38:09,452
they all just filibuster and block it with Jin Woo.

650
00:38:09,452 --> 00:38:12,151
Is the National Assembly their living room...

651
00:38:12,151 --> 00:38:14,691
that they just hang around there doing nothing? Do that at home.

652
00:38:14,691 --> 00:38:17,892
That's why this election is so important.

653
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:20,561
Think about what would happen if they were in power.

654
00:38:20,961 --> 00:38:22,331
What would happen to this country?

655
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:26,131
That's why we're struggling so hard now.

656
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,302
In the next administration, President Kim...

657
00:38:30,302 --> 00:38:31,972
will chase out all of those scoundrels.

658
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,052
I'm sorry.

659
00:38:43,381 --> 00:38:45,351
I was being rude in front of our current President.

660
00:38:46,251 --> 00:38:50,021
Korea's one and only President is you, President Seo.

661
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,892
Jung In asked me a question.

662
00:38:54,061 --> 00:38:56,762
What am I going to do if the people who tried to...

663
00:38:58,231 --> 00:39:00,631
kill me five years ago, were you two?

664
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:06,583
That's why I called you here today.

665
00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:13,654
It's happened.

666
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:16,654
The thing I can't believe,

667
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,094
that unbelievable thing.

668
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:21,194
(Seo Ki Tae)

669
00:39:24,335 --> 00:39:26,734
We confirmed everything through Secretary Choi.

670
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:29,674
Kim Young Ju and Nam Seong Beom were the masterminds.

671
00:39:31,975 --> 00:39:33,174
What should we do, Mr. Seo?

672
00:39:33,174 --> 00:39:36,214
(President Who Works for the People! Candidate 1, Seo Ki Tae)

673
00:39:42,045 --> 00:39:43,355
Step outside for a moment.

674
00:39:43,355 --> 00:39:46,225
- Will you be all right? - Why wouldn't I be?

675
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:48,924
My killer has come to me with her own two feet.

676
00:39:50,795 --> 00:39:52,054
Don't worry, and step outside.

677
00:39:55,665 --> 00:39:56,665
All right, sir.

678
00:40:19,654 --> 00:40:23,424
Proof that Mr. Nam, President Baek, and I tried to kill you...

679
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:27,065
is all in here.

680
00:40:27,065 --> 00:40:30,864
With this, the evidence should be sufficient.

681
00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:35,304
Why are you giving this to me?

682
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,005
I want to regain your trust.

683
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:41,245
In politics, you can't trust anyone.

684
00:40:41,545 --> 00:40:42,875
You trust in others' weaknesses.

685
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,375
Why should I accept you?

686
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:49,444
Why should I keep you by my side, when you betrayed me?

687
00:40:49,444 --> 00:40:50,955
If you want to stop Lee Jin Woo,

688
00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:54,225
you'll need me.

689
00:40:55,984 --> 00:40:57,054
What?

690
00:41:02,764 --> 00:41:06,165
Hold onto my weakness, and use me.

691
00:41:08,205 --> 00:41:12,435
I'll do anything you ask me to.

692
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:16,775
I'll leave my political career in your hands.

693
00:41:28,855 --> 00:41:30,395
You want me to take you back,

694
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,764
with just that?

695
00:41:38,065 --> 00:41:39,134
Ms. Kim,

696
00:41:40,105 --> 00:41:41,764
are you playing games with me?

697
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,475
You were also planning to betray us, though.

698
00:41:46,134 --> 00:41:47,344
What are you talking about?

699
00:41:47,344 --> 00:41:50,545
I know that you were planning to get rid of us...

700
00:41:50,915 --> 00:41:52,214
and Baek Kyu Min after you become President.

701
00:41:53,085 --> 00:41:56,455
I got a phone call from Mr. Nam in 2019, and found out that way.

702
00:41:58,784 --> 00:42:00,355
Once you become President,

703
00:42:01,455 --> 00:42:03,094
you abandon us all.

704
00:42:03,795 --> 00:42:05,725
Those within the party who were corrupt,

705
00:42:06,154 --> 00:42:08,194
those you worked with unwillingly to rise to power,

706
00:42:08,194 --> 00:42:09,795
Baek Kyu Min, and all the others.

707
00:42:10,964 --> 00:42:13,264
He told me you were planning to end their political careers.

708
00:42:28,614 --> 00:42:31,484
So you tried to kill me...

709
00:42:31,484 --> 00:42:33,185
because of something that will happen in a few years?

710
00:42:33,824 --> 00:42:36,324
So you're asking me to believe that?

711
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:38,355
You must.

712
00:42:39,194 --> 00:42:41,525
The reason you've stayed alive till now...

713
00:42:41,924 --> 00:42:43,464
is because of that as well.

714
00:42:45,935 --> 00:42:49,835
The Jung In of five years from now is the one who saved you.

715
00:42:50,304 --> 00:42:51,505
She used Lee Jin Woo to do so.

716
00:42:55,844 --> 00:42:57,475
Because of Lee Jin Woo,

717
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:01,214
so many things have gone awry.

718
00:43:01,384 --> 00:43:02,415
Now,

719
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,315
he's even gotten to Jung In.

720
00:43:09,424 --> 00:43:11,594
(A Future for the People! A Hopeful Tomorrow! Kim Young Ju)

721
00:43:11,594 --> 00:43:12,625
I'm sorry.

722
00:43:12,855 --> 00:43:15,094
I called you here, and then made you wait.

723
00:43:17,335 --> 00:43:20,005
- The reporters suddenly rushed me. - It's no problem.

724
00:43:20,804 --> 00:43:22,764
Why did you want to meet?

725
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:26,875
Do I really need a reason?

726
00:43:27,045 --> 00:43:30,014
I just wanted to talk.

727
00:43:30,014 --> 00:43:31,045
I see.

728
00:43:31,045 --> 00:43:32,214
Don't talk rubbish.

729
00:43:32,775 --> 00:43:34,614
I don't need money from scum like you.

730
00:43:35,085 --> 00:43:36,384
"Scum like you"?

731
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,114
You're getting so rash, Jung In.

(Democratic People's Party)

733
00:43:48,995 --> 00:43:50,034
There's a misunderstanding...

734
00:43:51,335 --> 00:43:52,995
between the two of us that we need to resolve.

735
00:43:54,105 --> 00:43:55,105
Isn't that right?

736
00:43:55,404 --> 00:43:56,505
What kind of misunderstanding?

737
00:43:59,234 --> 00:44:01,444
You don't need to act. I know everything.

738
00:44:01,574 --> 00:44:03,444
In 2015,

739
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:05,214
Lee Jin Woo told me everything.

740
00:44:05,645 --> 00:44:09,614
You got in contact with him by phone and stopped us.

741
00:44:11,455 --> 00:44:14,554
I understand how you feel. You must hate me.

742
00:44:15,324 --> 00:44:17,625
But all of that is in the past now.

743
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:19,924
It might be in the past to you,

744
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:22,225
but to me, it was only a few days ago.

745
00:44:22,525 --> 00:44:24,864
The person I remember you to be is someone who tried to kill my father,

746
00:44:24,864 --> 00:44:26,734
and you did things that were even worse...

747
00:44:32,105 --> 00:44:34,245
It seems like you don't remember anything.

748
00:44:34,245 --> 00:44:37,574
I don't know how I was a couple of days ago in your memory,

749
00:44:39,174 --> 00:44:40,944
but I'm not interested in that anymore.

750
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,484
What on earth did you do?

751
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:46,725
What did you do? The truth got completely covered up.

752
00:44:47,054 --> 00:44:48,284
I didn't do anything.

753
00:44:48,484 --> 00:44:49,554
Things...

754
00:44:50,324 --> 00:44:52,995
just turned around because of someone.

755
00:44:55,725 --> 00:44:56,895
Who is it?

756
00:44:58,094 --> 00:44:59,134
Jung In.

757
00:45:00,904 --> 00:45:02,705
Must you know everything?

758
00:45:03,304 --> 00:45:04,734
Everything is good now.

759
00:45:04,734 --> 00:45:06,174
President Seo is alive,

760
00:45:06,174 --> 00:45:07,875
and the elections are right around the corner for me too.

761
00:45:08,174 --> 00:45:10,415
Isn't it better for all of us if we forget the past...

762
00:45:10,915 --> 00:45:12,375
and focus on the present?

763
00:45:12,915 --> 00:45:14,545
How is it good for everyone?

764
00:45:16,315 --> 00:45:18,085
It's just good for you.

765
00:45:22,355 --> 00:45:23,995
If you don't want to tell me, forget it.

766
00:45:23,995 --> 00:45:26,025
I'll just do a cover on it, or...

767
00:45:26,795 --> 00:45:28,495
If I want you to understand,

768
00:45:29,364 --> 00:45:31,264
what on earth must I do?

769
00:45:31,665 --> 00:45:33,565
Sitting down and trying to convince you doesn't work.

770
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:35,605
Nothing I do works with the likes of you...

771
00:45:35,605 --> 00:45:36,875
Even if you try to kill me,

772
00:45:39,944 --> 00:45:41,045
it won't work.

773
00:45:44,114 --> 00:45:45,614
You tried to kill me.

774
00:45:45,614 --> 00:45:47,284
Then what should I do?

775
00:45:47,284 --> 00:45:48,545
Just be honest with me.

776
00:45:49,984 --> 00:45:51,415
How did all of this...

777
00:45:52,554 --> 00:45:54,054
happen?

780
00:46:08,034 --> 00:46:10,634
- What? - That we tried to kill him.

781
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,505
He covered it up knowing everything.

782
00:46:13,545 --> 00:46:15,074
It's because he needs us...

783
00:46:16,205 --> 00:46:19,574

Don't you think things are weird right now?

787
00:46:39,694 --> 00:46:42,565
Why is Lee Jin Woo sticking with Baek Kyu Min?

788
00:46:42,835 --> 00:46:45,935
And why is Mr. President treating me so well?

789
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:50,114
Lee Jin Woo has something on your father.

790
00:46:50,114 --> 00:46:52,545
As a result, he has something on us as well.

791

796
00:47:11,364 --> 00:47:13,335
or Lee Jin Woo survives.

I want to relay a message from him.

807

Why would you surprise someone by showing up suddenly?

822
00:49:14,525 --> 00:49:16,085
I came to find out the truth.

823
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,594
What truth?

824
00:49:19,194 --> 00:49:20,764
Are you still obsessing over the truth?

825

- will you be able to accept it? - Yes.

833
00:49:42,745 --> 00:49:45,284

834

Yes, it is.

I obtained this in 2015.

841
00:50:47,384 --> 00:50:48,714
Since it has real names in it,

842
00:50:48,714 --> 00:50:51,315
it's obvious that the person who gave them the money wrote it.

843
00:50:52,154 --> 00:50:55,424
I thought so which is why I tailed CEO Park for a while.

That's how I ended up finding this in CEO Park's secret office.

00:54:18,795 --> 00:54:20,324
Mr. Nam.

884
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:21,424
Mr. Lee.

885
00:54:22,795 --> 00:54:23,964
How are you?

886
00:54:24,234 --> 00:54:25,864
Thank you for the gift yesterday.

887
00:54:25,964 --> 00:54:27,034
Well, it's not a big deal.

888
00:54:28,364 --> 00:54:30,875
There's something I always wanted to ask.

889
00:54:30,875 --> 00:54:34,745
Have you decided to work under Ms. Kim?

890
00:54:36,645 --> 00:54:38,815
What do you mean "under"?

891
00:54:38,815 --> 00:54:41,384
That's true though. You always clean up after her.

892
00:54:41,384 --> 00:54:43,344
Your life is basically a tissue.

893
00:54:44,085 --> 00:54:45,554
Wiping her bum and stuff.

894
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:48,654
What? "A tissue"?

895
00:54:49,355 --> 00:54:52,094
Hey! Do you want to get beaten up?

896
00:54:52,154 --> 00:54:53,324
Come here, you punk!

897
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:54,395
I'll apologize for him.

898
00:54:54,395 --> 00:54:56,395
What he said was too harsh.

899
00:54:56,395 --> 00:54:59,534
You look great in this suit today.

900
00:55:00,094 --> 00:55:03,404
If I put this in your pocket, you'll look much better.

901
00:55:03,404 --> 00:55:05,105
A tissue. The embossed.

902
00:55:09,174 --> 00:55:11,375
What the...

903
00:55:13,245 --> 00:55:14,344
My goodness.

904
00:55:15,944 --> 00:55:17,154
Darn it!

905
00:55:34,534 --> 00:55:37,174
I heard you met Jung In yesterday.

906
00:55:37,174 --> 00:55:38,435
How did you know?

907
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,404
I guess you're spying on a presidential candidate.

908
00:55:40,404 --> 00:55:41,645
What did you say?

909
00:55:43,005 --> 00:55:44,344
What did you say to my daughter?

910
00:55:44,344 --> 00:55:46,074
She asked me to tell her the truth,

911
00:55:46,074 --> 00:55:48,784
so I showed her all the evidence I got.

912
00:55:48,984 --> 00:55:50,755
She should know the truth.

913
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:53,355
The truth about the father...

914
00:55:53,355 --> 00:55:54,455
she tried to save so many times.

915
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:57,054
- Lee Jin Woo, you... - Don't get mad.

916
00:55:57,525 --> 00:55:58,995
Why are you getting mad about things like this?

917
00:55:58,995 --> 00:56:00,594
There will be many more things you'll get mad about.

918
00:56:37,764 --> 00:56:39,634
Mr. President is coming.

919
00:56:55,614 --> 00:56:56,915
It's nice to see you, Ms. Kim.

920
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:00,014
Thank you very much for the invitation.

921
00:57:11,234 --> 00:57:13,495
Thank you for the invitation.

922
00:57:21,844 --> 00:57:24,045
Why don't you hold my hand? The reporters are watching.

923
00:57:27,284 --> 00:57:28,685
Then I'll hold it for a moment.

924
00:57:30,484 --> 00:57:31,585
A dirty hand.

925
00:57:35,255 --> 00:57:36,424
Just wait a little.

926
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:39,225
Because the moment you leave the office,

927
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:41,964
you'll lose everything you have.

928
00:57:41,964 --> 00:57:44,034
Okay, try it.

929
00:57:45,065 --> 00:57:48,005
Because by the moment I leave the office,

930
00:57:48,864 --> 00:57:51,435
I'll make you lose everything you have.

931
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:26,534
(Times)

932
00:58:26,804 --> 00:58:29,375
Why are you stopping the truth from coming out?

933
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:30,815
Just live an ordinary life.

934
00:58:30,815 --> 00:58:33,514
Don't interrupt what I do. Or you'll get hurt along with your father.

935
00:58:33,514 --> 00:58:35,484
The two are on the complete opposite side of the spectrum.

936
00:58:35,484 --> 00:58:37,145
How can they agree to be unified?

937
00:58:37,145 --> 00:58:40,725
I'm asking if you had Lee Jin Woo's brother die.

938
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:42,554
Hold my hand, Kyu Min.

939
00:58:42,554 --> 00:58:45,355
Seo Jung In from DBS.

940
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:48,025
If it's involved with politics, the truth doesn't matter anymore.

941
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,625
Jin Woo, why did you become like this?

942
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:51,665
If you're going to leave, leave without saying such things!

943
00:58:51,665 --> 00:58:54,864
I'm going to get the ledger from the Jin Woo I know.
