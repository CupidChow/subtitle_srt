1
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:53,732
I don't think it will end just by stopping one incident.

2
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:55,471
The situation's gotten worse.

3
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:56,601
A hit-and-run?

4
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:58,072
Because of his involvement,

5
00:00:58,432 --> 00:00:59,971
my father is murdered again.

6
00:01:00,572 --> 00:01:02,641
Please follow my father.

7
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:04,972
To see how the incident was fabricated...

8
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:07,042
And who fabricated it, right?

9
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,811
Secretary Choi committed perjury.

10
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:11,512
Have you been having a change of heart recently?

11
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:15,452
Some guy was dressed just like Seo Ki Tae.

12
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:16,792
Did you lose him?

13
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:19,961
What if they changed their plans again?

14
00:01:20,762 --> 00:01:24,461
The more we try to do something, it seems things are getting worse.

15
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:27,662

20
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:37,301
Jin Woo,

21
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:39,502
you seem to be caught up in a lot of cases these days.

22
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:45,782
How did you know about today's hit-and-run?

23
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:49,012
- You had another informant? - Yes.

24
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:51,812
Something like an informant.

25
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:53,681
I couldn't stop it,

26
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:55,752
even though I could've.

27
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:57,252
How could you have stopped that?

28
00:02:57,252 --> 00:02:58,852
You couldn't know there would be an accident.

29
00:02:58,852 --> 00:02:59,861
That's true.

30
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:03,692
It would've been better if I didn't know.

31
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:13,542
Do Kyung, I don't think I'm up to this task.

32
00:03:14,271 --> 00:03:19,211
Can't you stop this in my place instead?

33
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:20,641
What exactly do you want me to do in your place?

34
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:23,352
Tell me properly.

35
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:25,181
I just...

36
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:30,621
I just don't know how to explain this to you.

37
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:34,461
Just tell me. Stop holding back.

38
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:44,232
I heard someone's trying to kill Seo Ki Tae.

39
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:48,141
Even that hit-and-run was all a part of their plot.

40
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,572
Who said that?

41
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:54,181
Never mind.

42
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:56,752
Pretend you never heard this.

43
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:58,912
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

44
00:04:00,322 --> 00:04:01,782
Just tell me.

45
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:03,521
Who said that?

46
00:04:03,722 --> 00:04:04,921
I'll hear you out,

47
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:07,062
and I'll help you if I think it's worth it.

48
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:15,431
I got a phone call from Seo Ki Tae's daughter.

49
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:17,972
She asked me to save her father.

50
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:19,542
What?

51
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:25,611
But that phone call was from five years away, from 2020.

52
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,651
I knew it. That's why I said I didn't want to tell you.

53
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:34,982
You don't believe me.

54
00:04:35,282 --> 00:04:38,452
That's right, you shouldn't have said anything.

55
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:40,792
Now I can't even help you.

56
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:43,562

Friends are indeed the best.

61

Talking with you while having a drink like this...

62
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:06,382

is that you can't even say why you were at the scene.

00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:46,981
Yes, I confirmed them.

182
00:11:50,052 --> 00:11:52,652
Let's go eat, and get going.

183
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:55,361
We should wrap up before it gets too late.

184
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:57,162
All right. Let's go.

185
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:08,672
(Times Lee Jin Woo)

186
00:12:12,642 --> 00:12:13,881
Please pick up.

187
00:12:14,782 --> 00:12:18,711
The person you have reached is not available. Please leave a message.

188
00:12:18,711 --> 00:12:20,221
You will be charged after the tone.

189
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:22,851
Jin Woo,

190
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:25,491
I don't know if you'll get this message in time,

191
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:27,522
but I'll leave it just in case,

192
00:12:27,522 --> 00:12:30,491
since I'm in desperate need of your help.

193
00:12:43,272 --> 00:12:44,611
The details of the incident have changed.

194
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:47,142
But this time, it's not just my father who dies.

195
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,711
Eight other innocent people at the scene...

196
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:51,412
will also die.

197
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:54,121
We need to stop this from happening no matter what.

198
00:12:54,552 --> 00:12:56,591
At 10:47am, Jo Kang Shik will cause an accident...

199
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:59,292
at the sit-in site against Excellent Industrial's unfair dismissal.

200
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:05,761
Through this, many people got hurt...

201
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:07,831
and died.

202
00:13:07,831 --> 00:13:08,861
(Received a tip and went to the scene but can't disclose informant.)

203
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:15,841
I don't know who they are,

204
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,111
but they're using people to kill my father.

205
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:23,912
Jo Kang Shik.

206
00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:26,552
Jo Yu Jin.

207
00:13:28,251 --> 00:13:30,292
The same goes for Secretary Choi.

208
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:34,392
So...

209
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:36,991
even if it's hard...

210
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:38,331
(Times Lee Jin Woo)

211
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:39,902
and painful and we get worn out,

212
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:43,871
let's endure it a bit longer.

213
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:48,241
In the video released by Candidate Seo Ki Tae's campaign last week,

214
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:50,111
Candidate Seo Ki Tae's daughter, Seo Jung In,

215
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:52,011
was revealed for the first time.

216
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:54,711
My father is the most righteous person I know,

217
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:58,111
and he's someone with the power to create the reform we need now.

218
00:13:58,152 --> 00:14:00,381
Please trust my father, and...

219
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:03,192
We need to get everyone out before the accident happens.

220
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:04,322
And...

221
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:07,491
we need to catch the guys who planned this,

222
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:11,032
but you already know that the only person who can stop them...

223
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:13,631
is you.

224
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:16,402
From the beginning and even now,

225
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:19,532
the only person who can change the past...

226
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:23,042
is you, Mr. Lee.

227
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:25,471
Please help me.

228
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:31,912
She was very bright unlike how she is now.

229
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:34,322
What?

230
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:38,322
It's nothing. By the way,

231
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:39,961
how long will you hold me here?

232
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:41,621
Are you just going to keep me here without asking me anything?

233
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:42,861
- I'm just going to leave then. - No.

234
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,231
- I'm leaving. - No.

235
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:46,461
Where are you going? Goodness, Mr. Lee.

236
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:48,662
Have a seat. Hurry.

237
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:53,142
You have to cooperate with us properly.

238
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:17,162
Yes, Ms. Kim.

239
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:19,932
I'll take Mr. Choi,

240
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:22,032
so please look into a safe place for him.

241
00:15:22,202 --> 00:15:24,072
I think he should stay in hiding for the time being.

242
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:27,241
You didn't hear anything specific yet?

243
00:15:27,241 --> 00:15:28,741
I'm going to ask him when I see him.

244
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:31,312
He just kept telling me not to trust anyone.

245
00:15:31,642 --> 00:15:34,812
Okay. I'll prepare everything, so don't worry about it.

246
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,952
But are you really going there alone?

247
00:15:38,282 --> 00:15:41,322
- Don't do that. Why don't you... - It's fine. I'll call you later.

248
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:43,922
- Even still... - Don't worry. Goodbye.

249
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:50,961
Mr. Choi.

250
00:16:00,902 --> 00:16:02,172
Mr. Choi?

251
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:19,052
Are you okay? What about your injury?

252
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:25,062
Yes, I'm fine.

253
00:16:25,662 --> 00:16:28,802
Don't worry anymore. I'll take you someplace safe.

254
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:36,812
What happened yesterday?

255
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:39,341
It was them, wasn't it?

256
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:41,511
They went looking for you to kill you, right?

257
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,881
That's not important.

258
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:46,522
This was all meant to happen.

259
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:50,152
Why would you say that? That won't happen.

260
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:53,022
I'm going to protect you from now on,

261
00:16:53,022 --> 00:16:55,091
and I'm going to make everyone who made you perjure yourself...

262
00:16:56,221 --> 00:16:59,802
I joined hands with them five years ago.

263
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:03,032
That's how I saved my daughter,

264
00:17:03,032 --> 00:17:05,272
and that's why all of this is happening right now.

265
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,341
It's all my fault.

266
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:11,341
It's all my fault, and I need to make things right.

267
00:17:13,142 --> 00:17:14,981
But I'm too scared to do that.

268
00:17:17,981 --> 00:17:19,552
I can't trust you either.

269
00:17:20,251 --> 00:17:22,322
I can't trust your abilities.

270
00:17:22,522 --> 00:17:24,552
Mr. Seo isn't around anymore,

271
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:27,091
and you, who don't have any power,

272
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:30,491
can't do anything against them.

273
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:32,692
Why are you doing this?

274
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:34,162
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:35,801
Mr. Choi.

276
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:42,997
Mr. Seo isn't around anymore,

277
00:17:43,598 --> 00:17:45,537
and you, who don't have any power,

278
00:17:46,908 --> 00:17:48,938
can't do anything against them.

279
00:17:49,138 --> 00:17:51,208
Why are you doing this?

280
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:52,577
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,408
Mr. Choi.

282
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:01,047
They...

283
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:03,987
are using my daughter again.

284
00:18:11,227 --> 00:18:12,527
What is this?

285
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:15,698
I'm sorry, Ms. Seo.

286
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,968
Mr. Choi.

287
00:18:34,718 --> 00:18:35,948
Han Do Kyung.

288
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:38,958
It was you?

289
00:18:46,398 --> 00:18:47,868
Ms. Kim, I...

290
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:55,237
Jung In.

291
00:19:01,178 --> 00:19:02,208
Jung In?

292
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:20,468
Why did you make things more difficult for both of us?

293
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:23,598
If you had never called Jin Woo,

294
00:19:23,638 --> 00:19:25,797
we wouldn't have ended up like this.

295
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:28,208
Why are you trying to change the past?

296
00:19:29,438 --> 00:19:30,807
How meaningless.

297
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:56,267
Do you all remember what happened at...

298
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:58,368
the sit-in site against Excellent Industrial's unfair dismissal?

299
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,868
The incident happened exactly five years ago today.

300
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:06,237
The criminal, Jo Kang Shik, caused an accident...

301
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:08,777
where a total of nine people including Assemblyman Seo Ki Tae...

302
00:20:08,777 --> 00:20:11,277
passed away because his daughter died...

303
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,517
from Assemblyman Seo Ki Tae's hit-and-run accident.

304
00:20:23,827 --> 00:20:25,658
(Sarang Funeral Home)

305
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:32,468
Mr. Han. What will you do...

306
00:20:32,468 --> 00:20:34,737
if Jo Kang Shik doesn't do what we want?

307
00:20:35,337 --> 00:20:37,138
- We have to kill him. - What?

308
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,047
We have no choice. It's not like we can die instead.

309
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,888
Hey, you jerk!

310
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,527
Stop right there, you jerk!

311
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:07,868
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

312
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,138
Look here, Detective Yoon.

313
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,737
If you're going to hold me here like this,

314
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:14,448
shouldn't you at least give me food?

315
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:16,148
I can't do it right now,

316
00:21:16,148 --> 00:21:17,878
but I'll get you something after I'm done with this.

317
00:21:19,017 --> 00:21:21,487
Is that so? Then I'll go out and get some food.

318
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:23,047
I can get investigated after I come back from eating.

319
00:21:24,557 --> 00:21:27,428
What are you doing? This isn't a joke.

320
00:21:27,428 --> 00:21:29,557
Why are you making such a fuss when I'm spending my own money to eat?

321
00:21:29,557 --> 00:21:31,557
- Okay then. - Come with me then.

322
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,267
I'll order you some food.

323
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:35,198
Really? What will you order me?

324
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:36,837
I'll just order something.

325
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,337
Fine. Okay.

326
00:21:38,337 --> 00:21:40,108
What would you like to eat?

327
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,277
If you were going to order jjajangmyeon,

328
00:21:44,277 --> 00:21:45,638
what's the point of asking me?

329
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,277
You knew I was going to order jjajangmyeon.

330
00:21:47,277 --> 00:21:49,077
Why did you say you wanted short rib soup?

331
00:21:49,077 --> 00:21:50,648
I only said it because you asked me.

332
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:54,718
Detective Yoon.

333
00:21:54,718 --> 00:21:57,618
Let's be honest. Don't you think you're being too harsh on me?

334
00:21:58,587 --> 00:22:00,257
Why are you keeping me here when I'm innocent?

335
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:02,158
Do Kyung has been acting weird lately.

336
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:05,398
Actually, there are some things I don't understand either.

337
00:22:05,398 --> 00:22:06,398
Right?

338
00:22:08,968 --> 00:22:11,537
But Mr. Han was never unreasonable.

339
00:22:14,108 --> 00:22:16,307
I'm sure this is all necessary to follow the protocol.

340
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:21,307
I don't think he's keeping you here because he suspects you.

341
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,747
So don't resent him.

342
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:28,547
I mean, I'm sure you know him too.

343
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:29,918
Mr. Han worked really hard...

344
00:22:29,918 --> 00:22:32,487
for your brother's case.

345
00:22:32,487 --> 00:22:34,158
You came to the station every day,

346
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:35,987
so it was a bit of a hassle for us.

347
00:22:36,158 --> 00:22:38,398
But every time, Mr. Han said we should be more understanding.

348
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,658
That's what he told us.

349
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,468
I'm saying that something doesn't add up because I know how he is.

350
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:44,098
Seeing how he told me to keep you here...

351
00:22:44,098 --> 00:22:45,968
instead of processing you,

352
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:48,567
I was certain that he did that for your sake.

353
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,908
Then, he shouldn't have brought me here.

354
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:52,507
You know that this makes no sense.

355
00:22:55,878 --> 00:22:59,178
If you cooperate with me, it will be over before you know it.

356
00:23:02,188 --> 00:23:04,458
So can you tell me who gave you the tip?

357
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:05,888
I told you it was anonymous!

358
00:23:05,888 --> 00:23:07,027
Don't you know what that means?

359
00:23:07,027 --> 00:23:09,057
My noodles got soggy because you kept talking to me!

360
00:23:09,057 --> 00:23:11,398
- Darn it. - Gosh.

361
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:12,997
Come on!

362
00:23:13,368 --> 00:23:15,168
How could you order me jjajangmyeon?

363
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:16,567
You should've ordered jjamppong for me.

364

(A country where people can dream! Candidate 1, Seo Ki Tae)

365
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,208
There he is.

366
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:24,608
Mr. Seo, anything for the people?

367
00:23:24,608 --> 00:23:25,878
Even after Kim Jin Chul's attempt to assassinate you,

368
00:23:25,878 --> 00:23:27,848
you decided to proceed with your schedule. Why is that?

369
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:33,077
I do not fear getting shot...

370
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:35,587
or the sniper, Kim Jin Chul.

371
00:23:35,817 --> 00:23:39,257
I fear losing the public's trust the most.

372
00:23:39,888 --> 00:23:43,727
Whatever happens, I will not let it affect how I behave.

373
00:23:43,727 --> 00:23:46,098
Even if something like this happens again,

374
00:23:46,898 --> 00:23:48,227
I will not fear.

375
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:52,138
I will stay the same until the end.

376
00:23:54,108 --> 00:23:55,108
We should go.

377
00:23:55,108 --> 00:23:57,737
- Mr. Seo. Answer this question. - Mr. Seo, one more comment.

378
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:59,337
- Mr. Seo! - Mr. Seo, a word, please!

379
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,007
- Mr. Seo. - Mr. Seo.

380
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:04,218
You are working very hard this morning.

381
00:24:04,547 --> 00:24:06,787
Make sure to eat your meal.

382
00:24:06,787 --> 00:24:08,087
Have a good day.

383
00:24:13,188 --> 00:24:14,987
Is Secretary Choi running late?

384
00:24:15,257 --> 00:24:17,257
Yes. The car repair will take a bit more time.

385
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,598
We should take this car for the day.

386
00:24:37,878 --> 00:24:41,618
By the way, why did you push up the visit to Kim Jin Chul?

387
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,888
You said we were visiting him a few days later.

388
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,918
Like you said,

389
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:48,227
if there's someone else behind Kim Jin Chul,

390
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:50,858
I thought that must take priority over anything else.

391
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,497
I'm sorry,

392
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:55,628
but I made a judgment call for this matter.

393
00:24:55,868 --> 00:24:57,497
You don't have to apologize.

394
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,767
I was going to meet him anyway.

395
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:03,477
That guy, Kim Jin Chul, will be quite flustered...

396
00:25:03,678 --> 00:25:05,337
when he sees my face out of the blue today.

397
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:11,817
How's the food?

398
00:25:13,688 --> 00:25:15,517
I hope you're doing okay in there.

399
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,888
Let me know if you're having a hard time or need help.

400
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:23,598
I'll help you as much as I can if possible.

401
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:25,458
I'm okay.

402
00:25:26,898 --> 00:25:28,168
But your visit...

403
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:31,438
makes me very uncomfortable.

404
00:25:32,138 --> 00:25:35,608
If that's the case, I'll get to the point and keep this visit short.

405
00:25:36,408 --> 00:25:37,678
Mr. Kim Jin Chul.

406
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:42,047
Who gave you the order to kill me?

407
00:25:44,848 --> 00:25:48,718
Whatever the people ordering you promised you,

408
00:25:48,718 --> 00:25:50,047
I can give you ten times...

409
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:51,757
No. 100 times more than what they promised.

410
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,858
I have enough influence to make that happen.

411
00:25:57,027 --> 00:26:00,198
So far, I've been avoiding using my influence this way.

412
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:07,938
I'll at least hear you out. Tell me what you can do for me.

413
00:26:11,077 --> 00:26:13,777
After the presidential campaign, exactly three years later,

414
00:26:13,777 --> 00:26:15,777
I'll get you out of here.

415
00:26:17,378 --> 00:26:19,277
As a pardon from the President.

416
00:26:21,218 --> 00:26:22,888
Wouldn't that be beneficial for both?

417
00:26:23,287 --> 00:26:25,688
You'll be able to get out of here.

418
00:26:25,688 --> 00:26:26,827
And as for me,

419
00:26:27,358 --> 00:26:30,797
I can catch those jerks, trying to kill me. So that's a plus for me.

420
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:33,198
Can I...

421
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,267
take your word for that?

422
00:26:37,898 --> 00:26:39,168
You must.

423
00:26:39,968 --> 00:26:41,668
If someone else says this to you,

424
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:43,537
it's just a promise.

425
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:46,178
But when this comes from me, it will be a pledge.

426
00:26:46,178 --> 00:26:48,047
A pledge from a presidential candidate.

427
00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:53,448
Trust me and let's shake on it.

429
00:26:56,487 --> 00:26:58,688
that will put you in danger too.

430
00:26:59,287 --> 00:27:00,587
But you don't have to be in danger.

431
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:05,027
You just followed the order from those jerks.

432
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:09,727
Take it easy and tell me the truth. Don't worry about a thing.

433
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:14,968
Who ordered you...

434
00:27:16,537 --> 00:27:18,237
to kill me?

Okay.

00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:26,678
Is that true?

Yes. We did get the evidence.

446
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:34,418

What do you mean?

00:28:39,858 --> 00:28:41,587

All right.

I'm sorry. Excuse me.

452
00:28:58,837 --> 00:28:59,878
Okay.

453
00:29:07,688 --> 00:29:10,087
Gosh, why do you keep calling me? I'm busy with...

454
00:29:11,587 --> 00:29:12,658
What?

455
00:29:13,688 --> 00:29:15,688
What on earth are you saying?

456

Hey, don't move.

Why did Kim Jin Chul give up my name all of a sudden?

483
00:30:37,638 --> 00:30:41,277
Exactly. You could have stopped him from giving me up from the get-go.

484
00:30:45,848 --> 00:30:48,247
What should I do? What?

485
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:07,698
Is there really...

486
00:32:09,267 --> 00:32:10,567
no other way?

487
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:13,337
How can I do that right now? That's absurd.

488
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:15,567
That's telling me to commit suicide.

489
00:32:15,908 --> 00:32:17,277
Why did you murder...

490
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:20,678
my father?

491
00:32:21,577 --> 00:32:25,148
Because he was someone who needed to be killed.

492
00:32:26,777 --> 00:32:29,787
Your father has done me wrong many times.

493
00:32:29,787 --> 00:32:31,918
You asked me why I am trying to change the past.

494
00:32:34,257 --> 00:32:35,587
What's that expression?

495
00:32:37,158 --> 00:32:39,497
Do you know that I'm connected to the past?

496
00:32:39,497 --> 00:32:40,668
I do.

497
00:32:42,368 --> 00:32:43,997
Jin Woo told me five years ago.

498
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,337
Don't rely on Jin Woo anymore.

499
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,678
There's nothing he can do.

500
00:32:51,908 --> 00:32:53,408
I made it that way.

501
00:32:54,108 --> 00:32:57,007
- Confiscate his cell phone. - My cell phone? Why?

502
00:32:57,477 --> 00:32:58,618

503
00:32:58,618 --> 00:32:59,747

507
00:33:13,128 --> 00:33:16,567
All right, I'll do it. I said I'll do it.

508
00:33:18,668 --> 00:33:21,007
But in return, make sure you prepare the ships...

511
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:25,608
don't make any mistakes.

512
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:31,517
I'll see you after it's done. I'll be in touch.

514
00:34:20,198 --> 00:34:23,498
only fight those you can handle, and bite those who won't bite back.

515
00:34:24,768 --> 00:34:27,167
Instead of becoming a victim like this again. All right?

516
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:42,417
You're making a mistake.

517
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:45,917

00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:16,421
(Lee Jin Woo of Times became a hero that saved Seo Ki Tae...)

716
00:53:16,921 --> 00:53:18,722
(Han Do Kyung)

717
00:53:18,722 --> 00:53:20,622
("What Is the Motive Behind Han Do Kyung's Attempt to Murder?")

718
00:53:20,992 --> 00:53:23,191
(He was arrested for attempting to murder Seo Ki Tae.)

719
00:53:23,191 --> 00:53:25,032
(He had no connections with the candidate.)

720
00:53:30,501 --> 00:53:32,901
Hello? Are you okay? Are you hurt?

721
00:53:33,801 --> 00:53:35,542
There were reporters at the hospital.

722
00:53:35,542 --> 00:53:38,812
Did you really stop it by crashing into the van?

723
00:53:38,812 --> 00:53:41,742
Of course. It's not like I can crash into the van with my body.

724
00:53:41,912 --> 00:53:43,912
Sometimes, you ask such ridiculous...

725
00:53:43,912 --> 00:53:46,381
Are you crazy? What if you really got hurt?

726
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:48,551
Hey. Ms. Seo Jung In.

727
00:53:48,551 --> 00:53:49,722
My junior reporter.

728
00:53:50,122 --> 00:53:51,821
You always ask me to do something crazy.

729
00:53:51,821 --> 00:53:53,521
Of course, I'm bound to do crazy stuff.

730
00:53:55,122 --> 00:53:58,162
But still. You could have been a bit more careful.

731
00:54:01,202 --> 00:54:02,932
So you're okay, right?

732
00:54:02,932 --> 00:54:04,271
I think you are okay.

733
00:54:04,271 --> 00:54:07,202
To be honest, I wish I broke something too.

734
00:54:07,372 --> 00:54:09,441
Then, I wouldn't have to be mixed up in this mess.

735
00:54:09,441 --> 00:54:10,812
But I never get hurt.

736
00:54:10,812 --> 00:54:12,881
I had to stop a sniper and crash into a van.

737
00:54:12,881 --> 00:54:15,512
And I didn't even catch a cold at the change of seasons.

738
00:54:15,512 --> 00:54:18,751
Don't get sick or hurt.

739
00:54:18,821 --> 00:54:21,251
You and I won't have to call each other again.

740
00:54:21,321 --> 00:54:23,321
We really did it this time.

741
00:54:23,651 --> 00:54:24,722
My dad...

742
00:54:26,691 --> 00:54:27,892
is back.

743
00:54:28,062 --> 00:54:29,231
Really?

744
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:32,231
Then, this is all over now.

745
00:54:32,231 --> 00:54:34,231
Yes. It's all thanks to you, Mr. Lee.

746
00:54:35,631 --> 00:54:37,102
I mean, Jin Woo.

747
00:54:37,271 --> 00:54:38,432
Thank you.

748
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:41,202
I want to say something more than just a thank-you.

749
00:54:42,111 --> 00:54:43,512
But I don't know what that is.

750
00:54:43,512 --> 00:54:47,282
Hey, I don't have to know. It's going to make me cringe.

751
00:54:47,312 --> 00:54:50,412
Well, to be honest, it was impossible not to help you.

752
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,812
My friend was the culprit.

753
00:54:52,821 --> 00:54:54,481
What happens to Do Kyung?

754
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:03,191
- He died. - What?

755
00:55:03,361 --> 00:55:05,131
Two days after he got arrested.

756
00:55:05,131 --> 00:55:06,901
He committed suicide at the lockup.

757
00:55:06,901 --> 00:55:08,062
Suicide?

758
00:55:09,631 --> 00:55:12,872
Yes. Why would he do something like that?

759
00:55:12,901 --> 00:55:15,372
I don't know. Nothing has been confirmed yet.

760
00:55:15,372 --> 00:55:16,972
They proved that he was the culprit,

761
00:55:16,972 --> 00:55:18,682
but they haven't found the motive.

762
00:55:19,211 --> 00:55:21,682
How does that make sense? How could they not find the motive?

763
00:55:22,782 --> 00:55:25,321
Exactly. This is a bit odd.

764
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:29,021
To be honest, I don't think Do Kyung acted alone.

765
00:55:29,021 --> 00:55:31,551
I'm sure someone else ordered him behind the curtains.

766
00:55:37,861 --> 00:55:41,432
Hello? Hello? Seo Jung In.

767
00:55:43,372 --> 00:55:44,702
What happened to my phone?

768
00:55:48,602 --> 00:55:49,812
What?

769
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,042
The reception isn't working?

770
00:55:55,111 --> 00:55:56,151
(Powering off)

771
00:56:13,032 --> 00:56:14,262
(Cell phone repair)

772
00:56:17,631 --> 00:56:19,071
Do you have to fix this?

773
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:21,472
Why? You can't fix it?

774
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:22,941
No. It's not that.

775
00:56:22,941 --> 00:56:24,742
I don't think you can use it for long anyway.

776
00:56:24,941 --> 00:56:28,881
As you can see, the mainboard and battery are busted.

777
00:56:28,912 --> 00:56:30,852
You were supposed to change the parts,

778
00:56:30,852 --> 00:56:32,352
but they don't manufacture the parts anymore.

779
00:56:32,682 --> 00:56:34,921
Are you sure this was working before?

780
00:56:35,182 --> 00:56:37,421
Yes. I've used it for years and it was fine.

781
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:39,122
But it started to act up only a few days ago.

782
00:56:39,122 --> 00:56:40,591
The battery suddenly bottoms out.

783
00:56:40,591 --> 00:56:42,091
That's not possible.

784
00:56:42,591 --> 00:56:44,762
By the way, this model isn't in the market anymore, right?

785
00:56:44,762 --> 00:56:46,332
I've never seen this model before.

786
00:56:46,332 --> 00:56:47,662
Right.

787
00:56:47,832 --> 00:56:50,901
I heard they manufactured only a few in 2014.

788
00:56:54,401 --> 00:56:55,671
Ta-da.

789
00:57:01,782 --> 00:57:03,151
This is pretty.

790
00:57:06,582 --> 00:57:08,952
I don't know the details. It was a present.

791
00:57:08,952 --> 00:57:10,321
So I've been using it.

792
00:57:10,952 --> 00:57:13,321
Anyway, please repair this well.

793
00:57:13,321 --> 00:57:15,532
This is a really important cell phone to me.

794
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,131
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

795
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,551
Why are you here? Seeing me here can't do any good.

796
00:57:40,352 --> 00:57:42,051
You're so shameless.

797
00:57:45,321 --> 00:57:47,191
You framed your own friend as the culprit.

798
00:57:47,191 --> 00:57:48,832
You tried to kill Mr. Seo Ki Tae.

799
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:50,231
And after hiding all this...

800
00:57:50,691 --> 00:57:52,461
What? Why am I here?

801
00:57:52,461 --> 00:57:54,361
Then, what else could I say to you now?

802
00:57:55,401 --> 00:57:57,301
If I apologize, will you accept my apology?

803
00:57:57,301 --> 00:57:58,702
Of course, not.

804
00:57:58,901 --> 00:58:01,071
There's only one thing I want from you.

805
00:58:01,071 --> 00:58:04,472
I came here, so you could tell me why you did all this.

806
00:58:07,312 --> 00:58:08,441
Do Kyung.

807
00:58:09,182 --> 00:58:11,551
If you considered me as your friend,

808
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:13,251
don't lie to me.

809
00:58:13,251 --> 00:58:15,792
Please tell me the truth!

810
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:21,792
Are you sure you can handle it?

811
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:23,191
Of course!

812
00:58:23,191 --> 00:58:25,392
What you did was enough to scare the wits out of me.

813
00:58:27,102 --> 00:58:29,231
Fine. I'll tell you...

814
00:58:29,901 --> 00:58:31,332
why I did it.

815
00:58:34,401 --> 00:58:35,542
Jin Woo.

816
00:58:36,441 --> 00:58:40,381
You kept asking me to reinvestigate Geun Woo's case.

817
00:58:41,042 --> 00:58:43,481
Why are you bringing him up now?

818
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,372
You were right.

819
00:59:03,872 --> 00:59:05,401
Geun Woo didn't commit suicide.

820
00:59:06,441 --> 00:59:07,872
But he was murdered.

821
00:59:08,472 --> 00:59:10,441
And I've been keeping it from you all this time.

822
00:59:10,912 --> 00:59:13,642
What... What do you mean?

823
00:59:13,642 --> 00:59:16,051
You're making a fool of yourself right now.

824
00:59:16,051 --> 00:59:19,551
That jerk whose life you saved twice. That jerk...

825
00:59:20,251 --> 00:59:21,481
Dad.

826
00:59:22,082 --> 00:59:23,292
He killed Geun Woo.

827
00:59:24,091 --> 00:59:25,662
The presidential candidate of the Democratic People's Party,

828
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:27,262
Seo Ki Tae.

829
00:59:58,452 --> 01:00:01,191
Seo Jung In played you.

830
01:00:03,062 --> 01:00:04,631
This isn't right, Jin Woo.

831
01:00:05,532 --> 01:00:08,562
If you help him, Geun Woo would be heartbroken.

832
01:00:08,702 --> 01:00:10,032
All because of what you did.

833
01:00:18,642 --> 01:00:20,912
(We thank Yoo Jae Myung for his special appearance.)

834
01:00:38,932 --> 01:00:41,401
(Times)

835
01:00:41,731 --> 01:00:44,202
Is there something I don't know about Geun Woo's death?

836
01:00:44,202 --> 01:00:46,771
Someone told me that you killed my brother.

837
01:00:46,771 --> 01:00:48,341
You made me do it!

838
01:00:48,341 --> 01:00:49,941
You told me to kill Seo Ki Tae.

839
01:00:49,941 --> 01:00:52,142
I found out who the mastermind behind Han Do Kyung is.

840
01:00:52,142 --> 01:00:53,142
Are you sure?

841
01:00:53,142 --> 01:00:55,341
Geun Woo might have died because of that.

842
01:00:55,341 --> 01:00:56,412
I have to find it.

843
01:00:56,412 --> 01:00:57,912
I need to find it to figure out who killed him.

844
01:00:57,912 --> 01:00:59,881
I'm going to follow his traces and find out.

845
01:00:59,881 --> 01:01:02,521
So that he gets scared and goes to the mastermind himself.

846
01:01:02,521 --> 01:01:04,651
If that material was what they planned to give me...

847
01:01:04,651 --> 01:01:05,792
They came here.

848
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:07,021
I saw it.

849
01:01:07,021 --> 01:01:09,591
You killed my brother.
