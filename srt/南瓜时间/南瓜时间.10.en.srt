00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,210
Do you expect me to believe...

183
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,919
I got a phone call from Mr. Nam in 2019, and found out that way.

184
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:23,179
Over there! Get him!

185
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,620
Stop right there!

186
00:17:27,889 --> 00:17:28,950
Stop right there!

187
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,239
Candidate Lee. I know you're in here.

188
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,290
We'll leave quietly as long as you give us your cell phone.

189
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,620
We don't want to do this either.

190
00:18:10,229 --> 00:18:12,499
Stop playing around and come out.

191
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:24,810
Because of me, who covered up the truth to get revenge,

192
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,810
and you, who covered up the truth to get to your position,

193
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:30,949
your daughter, Seo Jung In, ends up dying...

194
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:32,449
in five years.

195
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,389
Come out. I said, come out!

196
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:41,729
Come out!

197
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,159
Give me your cell phone!

198
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,040
Myself from five years later asked for a favor...

199
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:01,580
of you and me.

200
00:19:01,949 --> 00:19:04,919
While getting revenge for my brother and becoming president is important,

201
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,350
if we only focus on that,

202
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,649
we'll both end up losing something precious to us.

203
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,030
That's why I'm here to ask you for your help.

204
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:16,989
Become president...

205
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,729
and reveal...

206
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,100
the truths you concealed yourself.

207
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:25,040
That's the only way you can protect this country that you love...

208
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,570
and your daughter.

209
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,550
I've experienced a lot of unbelievable things recently.

210
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:40,550
However, today is the most shocking.

211
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
I ended up hearing...

212
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,620
that my daughter will die in five years.

213
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:56,570
After hearing what you said,

214
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,639
I think I thought politics was all about compromise.

215
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,870
Keep my friends close, but my political enemies closer.

216
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,909
I put my faith in this phrase and practiced politics until now.

217
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,249
I never thought...

218
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,120
my daughter's death would be at the end of it.

219
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:22,659
What do you plan to do?

220
00:20:50,689 --> 00:20:51,760
My daughter...

221
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:56,790
My dear Jung In...

222
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:02,929
I should protect her.

223
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,370
Even if I have to destroy myself.

The Minister of Education, Lee Hyun Chul,

225

and the CEO of ESA, Ko Min Jun,

226
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,309
signed an agreement that will promote...

227
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:45,009
a project to stop bullying at school.

228
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:46,110
Gosh. Where am I?

229
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,249
To stop bullying at school,

230
00:21:48,249 --> 00:21:50,479
there will be a special training period...

231
00:21:50,749 --> 00:21:53,319
and they decided to develop educational programs for the agenda.

232
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:55,519

235
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,469
which was launched in 2018...

236
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:07,299
showed an excellent result.

237
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,509
And the ongoing convergence network project with 5G...

238
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:13,709
will be implemented in real businesses as well.

239
00:22:13,969 --> 00:22:15,880
Once the network is successfully set up,

240
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,309
with the use of the 5G network,

241
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:19,350
we can freely go back and forth...

242
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,819
between the internal and external administration networks.

243
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,920
As the administration will be more convenient,

244
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,350
we can efficiently handle our administration matters.

245
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,719

00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,769
Gosh.

365
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:22,459
Who are these people?

366
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:25,130
I've never seen them before.

(Kim Hye Joo)

369
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,100
Hello? Jin Woo?

370
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,130
Is that you?

371
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,430
Hello. I'm Lee Jin Woo from Times.

372
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:01,170
I can't reach Young Jae and Su Kyung.

373
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:03,569
What happened with Times?

374
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:06,969
Well,

375
00:31:07,469 --> 00:31:09,340
they told me not to tell you.

376
00:31:11,979 --> 00:31:14,749
The news coverage we did that day was the problem.

377
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,380
So we were sued.

378
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,120
Young Jae ended up with most of the debt.

379
00:31:23,489 --> 00:31:26,630
You should ask him what happened in person.

380
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,469
The phone is turned off.

381
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,180
One more bottle of soju, Auntie.

382
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,190
You're going to settle your tab today, right?

383
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,190
Settle up again?

384
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,289
I spent the whole day settling things at the warehouse.

385
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:03,630
That's not what I mean.

386
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,299
I mean your tab. Are you going to pay or not?

387
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:08,269
I wouldn't drink if I couldn't pay. I got paid,

388
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:11,039
so I'll pay my tab, drink some more on a new tab,

389
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,340
and then leave.

390
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,769
Really?

391
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:15,940
What do you want to eat? It's on the house.

392
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,610
Fried eggs. Sunny side up.

393
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,080
Just a minute, okay?

394
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,110
Gosh.

395
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,950
Jin Woo?

396
00:32:54,209 --> 00:32:55,350
- Thank you for the food. - Please come again.

397
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,519
- We will. - Bye.

398
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,519
How did you know I was here?

399
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,690
I went to the warehouse where they said you were working,

400
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,789
and they told me you were here.

401
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:10,130
I'm sorry, Jin Woo. I've been so out of it,

402
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,999
I didn't even know you were out.

403
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,700
Out from where?

404
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:16,799
Life is so...

405
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,180
- I hope you understand. - Young Jae.

406
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,150
I don't understand this situation at all.

407
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:26,380
What situation?

408
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,319
What happened to Times, and what happened to you?

409
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:32,149
What kind of incredible change happened to create this situation?

410
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,790
Why are you pretending not to know?

411
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,960
That won't change what's happened.

412
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,969
- So what... - I know.

413
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,799
I know I shouldn't have done that, back then.

414
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,169
But Jin Woo,

415
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:52,109
after sending you off alone,

416
00:33:52,109 --> 00:33:54,879
I tried my best to go it alone.

417
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:56,140
You need to understand that.

418
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,910
- So what... - And,

419
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,910
I'm about to burst right now.

420
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:03,180
I'm going to the restroom.

421
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:06,989
Hey, Young Jae.

422
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,489
Young Jae, are you all right? Hey, Do Young Jae?

423
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,529
Gosh.

426
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,719
Young Jae, what is it?

427
00:35:17,259 --> 00:35:20,129
- Su Kyung. - Jin Woo.

428
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,390
What happened, Jin Woo?

429
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,890
When did you get out?

430
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,129
Are you ill anywhere?

431
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,370
Why do you guys keep saying I got out from somewhere?

432
00:35:59,629 --> 00:36:02,040
Why is he keep saying sorry?

433
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,770
I have no idea what's going on.

434
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,509
How could we not be sorry,

435
00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:08,480
when you're the only one who ended up like that.

436
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,680
Please tell me what's happened over the past five years.

437
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,310
What? What's wrong?

438
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,850
Did something happen to you in there?

439
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,589
Let's say something did happen. Just start explaining.

440
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:21,919
Everything that happened from November 2, 2015, till yesterday.

441
00:36:21,919 --> 00:36:23,460
Explain everything that's happened.

442
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,069
In 2015, you decided to quit politics...

443
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:36,100
and returned to Times.

444
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,069
For about two years, everything was peaceful.

445
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:40,410
Hello, we're a pioneering media company trying to change the world.

446
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,040
That was already finalized with the head of admissions.

447
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,839
- Min Ji, this is English. - I'll take it.

448
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:46,710
It's French! Bonjour?

449
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,719
Looking back, those were such happy times.

450
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,219
We had junior colleagues too.

451
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:55,319
That's why Young Jae always talks about those days too,

452
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,060
saying he misses them.

453
00:36:57,489 --> 00:36:59,430
Anyway, the problem started...

454
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:03,160
in 2017, after getting that phone call.

455
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,000
- Hyun Soo, are you ready? - Yes, I'm ready.

456
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,069
- Let's go. - All right.

457
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:07,969
- Jin Woo, I'll be back. - Where are you going?

458
00:37:07,969 --> 00:37:10,540
- Incheon, to Daejin Port. - Don't skip meals!

459
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,669
- Ask him to buy you a meal. - We'll be back.

460
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,839
Must be nice.

461
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,710
Aren't you going to pick up?

462
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,710
What? Do it yourself.

463
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,310
Geez.

464
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:23,719
Hello, this is Times.

465
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:27,989
There's corruption in the country's telecommunications industry.

466
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:29,790
That process was...

467
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,689
This is information on JC Telecom's government contracts...

468
00:37:32,689 --> 00:37:34,629
nationwide after 2017.

469
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:37,500
After CEO Park Chan Yong got out of prison,

470
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,899
JC Telecom earned more than five nationwide contracts,

471
00:37:40,899 --> 00:37:42,000
all of which are long-term.

472
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,939
I found out that they were trying to promote JC Telecom...

473
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:46,810
by cheating their way through the game.

474
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,910
I dug into it,

475
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:50,239
and I found out it was true.

476
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:54,549
But that wasn't the only thing strange about the case.

477
00:37:54,549 --> 00:37:56,350
Even fitness center contracts.

478
00:37:56,419 --> 00:37:58,180
I got a bad feeling about it.

479
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,850
Thinking about it now,

480
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,219
We should've quit.

481
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,489
Then that wouldn't have happened.

482
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,759
- He's here. - He's arriving.

483
00:38:08,759 --> 00:38:09,799
- He's here. - He's here.

(In-depth investigations and journalistic explorations of 2018)

485
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:16,239
Jin Woo, where did you get this information?

486
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:18,000
What was your goal in covering this scandal?

487
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,210
- Now, now. - Please answer us.

488
00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:26,450
After reporting on the corruption scandal in telecommunications,

489
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:29,620
everything became falsified.

490
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:32,620
Witnesses who agreed to testify suddenly changed their statements.

491
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,819
All of the evidence disappeared.

492
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:36,660
That's how we became known...

493
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:39,759
as a trash rag creating fake news.

494
00:38:43,899 --> 00:38:45,000
So is it because of that incident...

495
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,770
that you guys are living like this?

496
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:51,739
- Because of that, you two... - We're not the problem.

497
00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:53,770
You suffered the most.

498
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:56,009
You even went to prison because of that.

499
00:38:56,009 --> 00:38:58,450
Why are you worrying about us?

500
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,649
I went where?

501
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,480
Did you hurt your head?

502
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,020
- Why do you keep... - Say that again.

503
00:39:05,189 --> 00:39:06,390
I went where?

504
00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:08,620
Jin Woo, at that time,

505
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:12,189
you were arrested and charged with spreading false information.

506
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,629
You took the blame for all of us.

507
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,129
You really don't remember?

508
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:25,640
- I forgot. - How could you forget that?

509
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,239
Who do you think made us this way?

510
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:30,710

512
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:34,279
You said so, back then.

513
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,620
What's wrong?

514
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,149
You should've been better at judging the situation.

515
00:39:38,149 --> 00:39:40,649
If you'd taken my words to heart,

516
00:39:40,649 --> 00:39:42,620
the situation wouldn't have gotten this extreme.

517
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,620

00:42:03,237 --> 00:42:04,438
Why?

542
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,108
If I didn't stop you,

543
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:09,338
you almost caused damages to this country.

544
00:42:09,338 --> 00:42:10,777
Times tried to ruin...

545
00:42:10,777 --> 00:42:14,078
an important business opportunity with a small flaw.

546
00:42:15,248 --> 00:42:16,277
Mr. President.

547
00:42:17,317 --> 00:42:19,047
Are you still the same person that I knew?

548
00:42:19,217 --> 00:42:20,317
It doesn't seem like...

549
00:42:21,788 --> 00:42:24,358
you're the same Lee Jin Woo I knew either.

550
00:42:25,688 --> 00:42:28,697
In 2015, you came to me...

551
00:42:28,697 --> 00:42:30,157
and said this.

552
00:42:30,157 --> 00:42:32,567
You said you received a call from yourself, five years in the future.

553
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:34,527
You said the Lee Jin Woo from 2020...

554
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:35,697
told you about Geun Woo...

555
00:42:36,938 --> 00:42:38,737
and about Jung In.

556
00:42:39,237 --> 00:42:40,737
Isn't that Lee Jin Woo...

557
00:42:42,407 --> 00:42:43,777
you right now?

558
00:42:45,447 --> 00:42:47,547
Don't try too hard to find out...

559
00:42:47,547 --> 00:42:49,347
what happened since then.

560
00:42:49,677 --> 00:42:52,688
You never went through it anyway. Don't you agree?

561
00:42:53,347 --> 00:42:55,657
I have no personal feelings against you.

562
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,018
Rather, I'm grateful.

563
00:42:57,188 --> 00:42:58,757
The reason I'm here today...

564
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:01,228
is all because of you too.

565
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:05,297
Before, I thought that politics was all about...

566
00:43:05,297 --> 00:43:06,867
compromise and tolerance.

567
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:10,038
I thought I should convince and wait for those who were against me...

568
00:43:10,038 --> 00:43:12,067
to go further with them,

569
00:43:14,538 --> 00:43:15,978
but you were the one to tell me...

570
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:18,808
that if I live like that Jung In will die.

571
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:20,847
That's when I realized...

572
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:23,047
I have to get rid of those who need to be removed,

573
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:25,047
and overtake those that I need to overtake.

574
00:43:25,047 --> 00:43:26,617
Pushing forward with my beliefs...

575
00:43:26,617 --> 00:43:28,288
and winning is what politics is about.

576
00:43:28,657 --> 00:43:29,757
In order to do that,

577
00:43:30,717 --> 00:43:34,088
there are times when I need to remove people like you temporarily.

578
00:43:39,668 --> 00:43:42,797
That's why I pardoned you yesterday.

579
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:44,867
Because I was waiting for you.

580
00:43:46,268 --> 00:43:50,038
If I gave you another chance,

581
00:43:50,038 --> 00:43:51,708
today, November 2, 2020,

582
00:43:51,938 --> 00:43:54,447
I thought you might give me a different answer.

583
00:43:56,047 --> 00:43:58,277
What opportunity are you talking about?

584
00:43:58,447 --> 00:44:02,688
I made a suggestion to you in 2018.

585
00:44:03,117 --> 00:44:05,317
Of course, if Geun Woo had been alive,

586
00:44:05,317 --> 00:44:07,088
I would've made this offer to him instead.

587
00:44:09,998 --> 00:44:11,027
Soon...

588
00:44:12,668 --> 00:44:14,498
Park Chan Yong will end up taking over...

589
00:44:16,398 --> 00:44:18,567
this situation that I invested so much in creating.

590
00:44:20,938 --> 00:44:22,108
After that...

591
00:44:31,347 --> 00:44:33,487
I'm telling you that I'll compensate you...

592
00:44:33,487 --> 00:44:36,688
for everything you went through if you join hands with me.

593
00:44:39,987 --> 00:44:41,027
Of course,

594
00:44:42,027 --> 00:44:45,967
you have to get rid of Times and everyone useless around you.

595
00:44:49,137 --> 00:44:50,567
To be honest with you,

596
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:53,108
I had no idea things would end up like this.

597
00:44:54,668 --> 00:44:58,538
This wasn't the 2020 I had wanted.

598
00:45:04,717 --> 00:45:07,918
So what do you want from me?

599
00:45:07,918 --> 00:45:10,387
Reveal the truth in 2015.

600
00:45:10,558 --> 00:45:12,188
You have to undo the wrong decisions we made in the past...

601
00:45:12,188 --> 00:45:13,558
to change the present.

602
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:15,527
Back then,

603
00:45:17,998 --> 00:45:19,998
I thought I could turn everything back.

604
00:45:25,608 --> 00:45:27,208
I don't know...

605
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:30,378
what I should do now?

606
00:45:30,378 --> 00:45:32,308
If it doesn't look like what you wanted,

607
00:45:32,308 --> 00:45:34,748
you should start making things into what you want now.

608
00:45:35,617 --> 00:45:38,817
When I bowed my head in front of people out of guilt,

609
00:45:38,817 --> 00:45:42,157
everyone probably thought I would step down from my position.

610
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:43,487
But I'm still here.

611
00:45:43,887 --> 00:45:45,188
All matters of this world...

612
00:45:47,088 --> 00:45:48,757
depend on what you decide,

613
00:45:48,757 --> 00:45:51,898
and in the end, it depends on who you are with.

614
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:55,697
I understand what you mean.

615
00:45:59,067 --> 00:46:00,808
Give me some time to think about it.

616
00:46:02,777 --> 00:46:04,838
I won't wait long.

617
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:07,878
I'll give you a call.

618
00:46:11,648 --> 00:46:12,717
Yes, sir.

619
00:46:15,248 --> 00:46:16,418
I'll get going now.

620
00:46:42,677 --> 00:46:44,677
(Lee Geun Woo)

621
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,717
(Yoon Soo Hyun)

622
00:46:57,097 --> 00:46:58,427
Darn it.

623
00:47:09,208 --> 00:47:10,938

624

625
00:47:27,157 --> 00:47:33,927
(Times)

626
00:47:51,317 --> 00:47:53,648
Gosh, I pity her future husband...

627
00:47:53,648 --> 00:47:55,018
the most in the world.

628
00:47:55,018 --> 00:47:56,887
Don't worry about my future husband!

629
00:47:56,887 --> 00:47:58,418
Look at your bug-looking face.

630
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:01,128
(Times)

631
00:48:05,797 --> 00:48:06,967
(Times)

632
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:08,797
You should've stayed at Times with Su Kyung.

633
00:48:08,797 --> 00:48:10,097
Why did you follow me out?

634
00:48:10,097 --> 00:48:13,507
Honestly speaking, Su Kyung can live without me.

635
00:48:13,507 --> 00:48:15,308
It was because I was afraid you'd die!

636
00:48:15,538 --> 00:48:17,538
I was afraid you'd end up dead if I wasn't by your side.

637
00:48:17,538 --> 00:48:18,907
That's why I followed you out.

638
00:48:22,478 --> 00:48:26,447
I'm telling you that I'll compensate you for everything you went through

639
00:48:26,447 --> 00:48:27,887
if you join hands with me.

640
00:48:28,487 --> 00:48:29,657
Of course,

641
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:33,657
you have to get rid of Times and everyone useless around you.

642
00:48:57,918 --> 00:48:59,347
My gosh.

643
00:49:01,518 --> 00:49:04,757
How did I end up here again?

644
00:49:07,387 --> 00:49:08,427
Here.

645
00:49:08,858 --> 00:49:11,128
I guess you couldn't sleep again because of me.

646
00:49:13,027 --> 00:49:14,027
I'm sorry.

647
00:49:18,067 --> 00:49:20,367
I think I saw Jin Woo.

648
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:22,608
Was it a dream?

649
00:49:26,248 --> 00:49:28,277
(Certificate of Release, Lee Jin Woo)

652
00:49:44,527 --> 00:49:45,628
Hey, you jerk!

653
00:49:46,427 --> 00:49:47,867
(Times)

654
00:49:52,067 --> 00:49:53,237
What are you doing?

655
00:49:55,808 --> 00:49:57,308
Welcome back!

656
00:50:01,878 --> 00:50:03,478
What are you doing?

657
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:10,418
- Why do you look like that? - What about you?

658
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:12,558
I don't think you're one to talk.

659
00:50:13,387 --> 00:50:14,558
My goodness.

660
00:50:16,228 --> 00:50:18,998
We should've taken care of this place while you were gone.

661
00:50:18,998 --> 00:50:20,197
I'm sorry. I have no excuses.

662
00:50:20,828 --> 00:50:23,898
Since you're back, let's start again.

663
00:50:23,898 --> 00:50:25,438
Let's not look into scary things anymore.

664
00:50:25,438 --> 00:50:28,067
Let's just work harmoniously and have fun.

665
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,338
Yes.

666
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:30,878
Let's do a cheer. Right here.

667
00:50:30,878 --> 00:50:32,237
- Let's do it. - Let's do this!

668
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:33,407
Forget it.

669
00:50:33,407 --> 00:50:36,047
- We can do it! - We can do it!

670
00:50:40,018 --> 00:50:41,518
That's what I just want to do now.

671
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:43,588
I've given it a lot of thought.

672
00:50:43,588 --> 00:50:46,228
What are you talking about? You just got out.

673
00:50:46,228 --> 00:50:48,027
- Think about it a bit more. - Jin Woo.

674
00:50:48,858 --> 00:50:51,858
If you are doing this because you resent us...

675
00:50:51,858 --> 00:50:53,498
That's not why.

676
00:50:53,768 --> 00:50:56,297
I'm still a bit confused, but I'm glad it was me, not you guys.

677
00:50:56,297 --> 00:50:58,538
If it were you guys, I wouldn't have been able to live with myself.

678
00:50:58,538 --> 00:51:01,507
Then, what is it? Why do you want to do that now?

679
00:51:01,507 --> 00:51:02,677
I want to quit now.

680
00:51:03,507 --> 00:51:05,277
I'm tired of setting things right now.

681
00:51:05,808 --> 00:51:06,847
I'm giving up.

682
00:51:07,748 --> 00:51:09,478
Don't I deserve to throw in the towel at least once?

683
00:51:09,478 --> 00:51:11,217
I want to stop caring about others and think about only myself.

684
00:51:11,217 --> 00:51:12,947
I just want to have what I want in life.

685
00:51:12,947 --> 00:51:14,748
I want to live for myself now.

686
00:51:16,088 --> 00:51:18,088

This is Lee Jin Woo, Mr. President.

690
00:52:03,268 --> 00:52:06,007
Does your offer still stand?

691
00:52:07,038 --> 00:52:09,067
It would've been great if you accepted my offer right away.

692
00:52:09,067 --> 00:52:11,137
Then, you wouldn't have gone to prison in the first place.

693
00:52:12,608 --> 00:52:15,708
The weak breaks, not the powerful.

694
00:52:16,447 --> 00:52:19,117
I see. I was foolish.

695
00:52:19,117 --> 00:52:21,847
I want to put the past behind me and only focus on my future.

696
00:52:21,947 --> 00:52:22,987
Yes.

697
00:52:23,588 --> 00:52:25,657
Tell me if there's anything you need.

698
00:52:27,328 --> 00:52:28,328
Well,

699
00:52:29,427 --> 00:52:30,898
I wonder if this is possible.

700
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,328
As I'm an ex-convict,

701
00:52:32,597 --> 00:52:35,027
I need to recover my social standing first.

702
00:52:36,797 --> 00:52:41,038
If you can't help me with that, I'll give up.

703
00:52:43,578 --> 00:52:45,007
What is it? Tell me.

704
00:52:46,108 --> 00:52:47,507
Here's the next news.

705
00:52:47,507 --> 00:52:50,918
President Seo Ki Tae who is reaching the end of his term...

706
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:54,117
will appear on a TV show to hold a discussion about the direction...

707
00:52:54,117 --> 00:52:55,918
and the current status of the administration.

708
00:52:55,918 --> 00:52:58,717
The spokesperson of the Blue House, Choi Jin Hyuk...

709
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,157

will be held at the Blue House.

712

Lee Jin Woo of Times will be leading...

713
00:53:06,467 --> 00:53:09,367
this 1-on-1 discussion live on TV.

714
00:53:09,367 --> 00:53:12,398
His administration's philosophy as well as social and economic...

715
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:13,467
The questions from the public...

716
00:53:13,467 --> 00:53:16,078
Who settled my tabs? I never settled them.

717
00:53:16,438 --> 00:53:19,447
The guy you came with the other day paid everything on your tabs.

718
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:22,047
Before the TV broadcast, an honest discussion...

719
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:25,148
Why did you accept his money? Gosh.

720
00:53:25,148 --> 00:53:26,617
Get out of my way. I'm busy.

721
00:53:26,717 --> 00:53:29,558
The selected MC of President Seo Ki Tae's discussion...

722
00:53:29,558 --> 00:53:32,688
is Reporter Lee Jin Woo. I'm sure his name is familiar to some of you.

723
00:53:32,688 --> 00:53:34,387
The reporter had been...

724
00:53:34,387 --> 00:53:36,697
in the limelight for saving the President...

725
00:53:36,697 --> 00:53:38,257
twice in 2015.

726
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:41,498
Why him?

727
00:53:42,737 --> 00:53:44,597
How does this make sense?

728
00:53:44,867 --> 00:53:47,268
He served time in prison for not just any crime,

729
00:53:47,268 --> 00:53:49,168
but for spreading false information.

730
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:53,208
Do you know anything?

731
00:53:53,378 --> 00:53:55,648
This is my first time hearing it too.

732
00:53:55,648 --> 00:53:57,578
It's been over a month since I saw my dad.

733
00:53:58,617 --> 00:54:01,817
Even if you don't want to get mixed up politically with your dad,

734
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:04,918
you ought to tell him about this as you are his daughter.

735
00:54:05,418 --> 00:54:06,858
"Why is it Lee Jin Woo?"

736
00:54:06,858 --> 00:54:08,728
"What would people think?"

737
00:54:08,728 --> 00:54:10,628
"You should reconsider."

738
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:13,998
"How about Kang Shin Wook?"

739
00:54:29,617 --> 00:54:31,018
I was just worried.

740
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:32,817
A lot of people are talking about this.

741
00:54:32,918 --> 00:54:34,788
That's something I must deal with.

742
00:54:34,788 --> 00:54:37,757
Anyway, he is the reason why I'm here.

743
00:54:38,018 --> 00:54:39,757
Even if he saved you,

744
00:54:39,757 --> 00:54:41,427
Lee Jin Woo doesn't sound like a good candidate.

745
00:54:41,427 --> 00:54:43,628
He seems a bit off in his head too.

746
00:54:43,628 --> 00:54:45,228
He seems like an inadequate...

747
00:54:46,597 --> 00:54:49,067
Well, I'm sure you have your reasons.

748
00:54:49,228 --> 00:54:50,797
But I'm not completely on board with this.

749
00:54:50,797 --> 00:54:53,308
He was a pretty good reporter before his career was ruined.

750
00:54:53,308 --> 00:54:55,938
It seems like he repented a lot and regretted what he did...

751
00:54:55,938 --> 00:54:58,407
when he was in prison. So I ought to give him a second chance.

752
00:55:00,277 --> 00:55:03,648
If he only saved me, I wouldn't be this generous.

753
00:55:03,748 --> 00:55:05,748
Did he save someone else too?

754
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,188
I'm just saying you don't have to worry.

755
00:55:09,657 --> 00:55:12,188
Anyway, make some time for me next week.

756
00:55:12,188 --> 00:55:14,288
At this rate, I might forget how you looked.

757
00:55:14,288 --> 00:55:17,328
Okay, Dad. I'll call you again.

758
00:55:27,608 --> 00:55:29,168
Come in if you're ready.

759
00:55:39,887 --> 00:55:41,648
(Healthy and Comfortable Environment with Everyone's Help)

760
00:55:41,648 --> 00:55:43,418
(Collection of Achievements)

761
00:55:46,628 --> 00:55:49,088
Right here. Focus on this part.

762
00:55:49,088 --> 00:55:50,757
You're talking about the part...

763
00:55:50,757 --> 00:55:51,858
where contract workers became permanent workers, right?

764
00:55:51,858 --> 00:55:52,867
Yes.

765
00:55:57,737 --> 00:56:00,538
- You should polish this again. - Okay.

766
00:56:22,657 --> 00:56:23,927
Is this why?

767
00:56:25,157 --> 00:56:26,567
Is this why?

768
00:56:30,038 --> 00:56:32,038
To join hands with Seo Ki Tae?

769
00:56:32,038 --> 00:56:34,038
Is that why you're leaving us?

770
00:56:38,237 --> 00:56:39,308
Jin Woo!

771
00:56:40,407 --> 00:56:41,407
Jin Woo.

772
00:57:38,797 --> 00:57:40,507
The special discussion with...

773
00:57:40,507 --> 00:57:42,567
President Seo Ki Tae will air shortly.

774
00:57:46,177 --> 00:57:49,208
You don't have to be nervous. Just do as we practiced.

775
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,878
Okay.

776
00:57:52,817 --> 00:57:53,987
I'll do my best.

777
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,847
Let's get ready.

778
00:57:56,387 --> 00:57:57,688
You have five seconds.

779
00:57:58,217 --> 00:58:02,128
5, 4, 3,

780
00:58:02,128 --> 00:58:04,858
2, 1. Rolling.

781
00:58:05,197 --> 00:58:06,297
Hello.

782
00:58:06,668 --> 00:58:09,027
You're watching "2020 Straight from the President".

783
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:12,438
I'm your host, Lee Jin Woo of Times.

784
00:58:13,867 --> 00:58:16,578
- Hello, Mr. President. - It's nice to see you.

785
00:58:17,038 --> 00:58:20,677
Thanks to you, I was able to finish my campaign safely...

786
00:58:20,677 --> 00:58:22,308
and come this far.

787
00:58:22,447 --> 00:58:24,277
And it's quite meaningful to have you here...

788
00:58:24,277 --> 00:58:26,177
as my term reaches its end.

789
00:58:27,518 --> 00:58:30,858
I am also very pleased to talk to you in person.

790
00:58:31,418 --> 00:58:33,588
Then, let us begin.

791
00:58:35,157 --> 00:58:38,797
For the last five years, you have been focusing on...

792
00:58:38,797 --> 00:58:41,268
Let see how good he is. I have my eyes on you.

793
00:58:41,527 --> 00:58:44,038
- He looks great on camera. - They were quite effective.

794
00:58:44,697 --> 00:58:47,838
We are the first country to commercialize the 5G network.

795
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:50,608
And now, we are pushing forward to commercialize...

796
00:58:50,608 --> 00:58:52,277
autonomous vehicles.

797
00:58:52,277 --> 00:58:54,608
So we are seen as the leading country in this industry.

798
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:56,518
I'm curious to find out...

799
00:58:56,518 --> 00:58:59,717
what you consider to be your proudest achievement.

800
00:59:01,047 --> 00:59:04,157
It's a bit embarrassing to point that out myself.

801
00:59:04,317 --> 00:59:07,958
I don't want this to come across as bragging.

802
00:59:07,958 --> 00:59:10,958
But I did try to keep my promises to the people the best I could.

803
00:59:11,058 --> 00:59:15,297
And I deem my effort for that the proudest achievement I have.

804
00:59:15,527 --> 00:59:17,967
You are talking about having the highest rate...

805
00:59:17,967 --> 00:59:19,907
of fulfilling your campaign pledges. Am I correct?

806
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:21,808
That's right.

807
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:23,938
Investing in the three aforementioned industries...

808
00:59:23,938 --> 00:59:27,277
and achieving good results was one of my pledges.

809
00:59:27,277 --> 00:59:30,148
As you showed your promises with the results,

810
00:59:30,148 --> 00:59:32,447
you have the highest approval ratings of over 70 percent...

811
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:35,047
compared to the previous presidents.

812
00:59:35,047 --> 00:59:37,157
You are the first president who is not labeled as a lame duck.

813
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:39,358
With this solid support from the people,

814
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:42,157
I have no doubt that you will successfully finish your term.

815
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,898
Here's my last question.

816
00:59:45,527 --> 00:59:48,268
Before that, could I ask a question...

817
00:59:48,268 --> 00:59:49,967
that wasn't on the question list?

818
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,038
Of course.

819
00:59:53,608 --> 00:59:57,137
That is the beauty of a live broadcast, isn't it?

820
00:59:59,078 --> 01:00:01,248
When you were a reporter,

821
01:00:01,248 --> 01:00:03,148
you fought for the freedom of speech.

822
01:00:03,547 --> 01:00:05,518
And you suffered a great deal because of that.

823
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,817
That is why a lot of reporters consider you...

824
01:00:07,817 --> 01:00:11,418
as their greatest senior reporter and role model to this day.

825
01:00:11,688 --> 01:00:13,688
As their senior reporter,

826
01:00:13,688 --> 01:00:16,027
is there any advice for the reporters?

827
01:00:16,257 --> 01:00:18,128
Please say a few words.

828
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:22,898
I'm sure some people already know that my daughter is also a reporter.

829
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:26,938
I say this to my daughter when she goes out to investigate a story.

830
01:00:27,467 --> 01:00:29,538
"We must right what is wrong."

831
01:00:29,777 --> 01:00:32,578
"Turning a blind eye to it won't make it go away."

832
01:00:32,578 --> 01:00:34,677
"Rather than ignoring it, we must face it..."

833
01:00:34,677 --> 01:00:36,007
"and go head-on."

834
01:00:36,148 --> 01:00:37,817
"That's the only way the world will change."

835
01:00:37,817 --> 01:00:39,918
If you cover stories with this kind of faith...

836
01:00:39,918 --> 01:00:41,447
and sense of responsibility,

837
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:45,058
I believe you can become a good reporter.

838
01:00:46,757 --> 01:00:49,927
"A reporter must not ignore the corruptions in the world."

839
01:00:50,427 --> 01:00:51,697
Is that what you mean?

840
01:00:51,697 --> 01:00:54,567
Yes. That's the role of the press.

841
01:01:13,317 --> 01:01:14,788
Then why did you...

842
01:01:16,188 --> 01:01:17,358
do that?

843
01:01:20,157 --> 01:01:21,257
Why did you...

844
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,498
send me to prison?

845
01:01:50,657 --> 01:01:53,088
(Times)

846
01:01:53,387 --> 01:01:55,228
I will not turn a blind eye to select media outlets...

847
01:01:55,228 --> 01:01:57,527
that habitually release malicious reports.

848
01:01:57,527 --> 01:01:59,898
Make them give up their votes.

849
01:01:59,898 --> 01:02:02,228
They won't be able to accuse us of criticizing without any basis.

850
01:02:02,628 --> 01:02:04,498
We have no choice but to break the speakers.

851
01:02:04,498 --> 01:02:06,538
They've never pressured the media...

852
01:02:06,538 --> 01:02:07,668
What are you doing?

853
01:02:07,668 --> 01:02:10,378
Your father, President Seo Ki Tae, made me do it.

854
01:02:10,378 --> 01:02:11,378
Are you satisfied now?

855
01:02:11,378 --> 01:02:13,177
I'm sure about this one thing.

856
01:02:13,177 --> 01:02:15,277
I didn't know anything until now.

857
01:02:15,277 --> 01:02:17,518
We must first tell people about this truth.

858
01:02:17,518 --> 01:02:18,518
What?

859
01:02:18,518 --> 01:02:21,088
That's why you never should've crossed the line.
