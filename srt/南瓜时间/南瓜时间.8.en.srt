(All characters, organizations, places, and events are fictional.)

2
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:14,255
Mr. President is coming.

3
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:31,725
It's nice to see you, Ms. Kim.

4
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,195
Thank you very much for this invitation.

5
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,175
Thank you for the invitation.

6
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,755
Why don't you take my hand? The reporters are watching.

7
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,555
Then I'll take it for a moment.

8
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:06,464
A dirty hand.

9
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,594
Didn't I tell you last time...

10
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,240
that I need to turn back...

11
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,604
all that nonsense I did with you?

12
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,835
Your father... That jerk, Seo Ki Tae, who killed my brother...

13
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,275
should have died that day.

14
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:24,945
Just wait a little.

15
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:26,844
Because the moment you leave the office,

16
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:29,484
you'll lose everything you have.

17
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:31,514
Okay, try it.

18
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,725
Because by the moment I leave the office,

19
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:39,094
I'll make you lose everything you have.

20
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,934
(Times)

21
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,015
(Episode 8)

22
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,760
My daughter. You haven't left yet?

23
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,015
You wanted to see me before you leave?

24
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,154
What's wrong? Did something happen?

25
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,825
Let's sit down.

26
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:24,805
Dad, is there anything you're hiding from me?

27
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,344
She should know the truth.

28
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:32,275
The truth about the father she tried to save so many times.

29
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:34,344
What do you mean?

30
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,754
Did you hear something from Lee Jin Woo?

31
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,290
I heard you met with him.

32
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,499
If there's something you wanted to know, ask me directly.

33
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:46,765
Why did you meet with that guy?

34
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,494
No matter what you heard, that's not the truth.

35
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,110
I've tolerated this for five years now.

36
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,474
No matter what rubbish he talks or how he slanders me,

37
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,249
he's still the one who saved my life.

38
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:03,075
He's still Geun Woo's brother, so I tolerated it.

39
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,490
But now, even you...

40
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,585
Is it absolutely,

41
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,119
absolutely untrue?

42
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,485
What are you talking about?

43
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:16,629
That Aide Lee found out you were taking bribes,

44
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:19,154
and that in order to cover up the truth,

45
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:24,664
you killed Aide Lee, Jin Woo's brother.

46
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:29,904
Is that absolutely untrue?

47
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,934
What's with your expression?

48
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,244
Do you really believe...

49
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:40,015
that your father killed Geun Woo?

50
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,515
Do you regret...

51
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,930
saving a father like that?

52
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,160
- Dad. - I know...

53
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,600
everything you and Jin Woo did five years ago.

54
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,765
If not for that, why would I have left him alone?

55
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,135
Jin Woo...

56
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,664
did everything in his power,

57
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,734
and even things that weren't in his power to help me.

58
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,335
That's how I know...

59
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,009
that he's not someone who would lie to me.

60
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,015
So you believe him,

61
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,945
and therefore cannot believe me.

62
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,019
"Jin Woo and I did everything to save my father."

63
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,730
"I told Jin Woo everything."

64
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,294
"How could my father do this?"

65
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,164
Is that what you want to say, Jung In?

66
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,275
Don't escalate things any further, Geun Woo.

67
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,974
We need to get to the Blue House together.

68
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,005
I promise if you let this slide just this one time...

69
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,414
I'm taking this public.

70
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,685
Before I do, please acknowledge your wrongs and step down.

71
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,889
That's my final request, Mr. Seo.

72
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:52,614
This is my final warning to you too.

73
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:56,794
If you don't stop now, I'll have to block you.

74
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,094
No matter what, I'll stop you using any means necessary.

75
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:02,664
- I know you're not so rotten... - I even found this out.

76
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,734
I still have faith in you.

77
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,935
How could I not believe him?

78
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:09,765
Do you really think...

79
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,980
that the person you've seen as your father for 30 years,

80
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,604
could be that kind of person?

81
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:18,280
Murdering someone to cover up my own wrongdoings,

82
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,614
and lying about it to cover up the truth?

83
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:24,519
Do I appear like such a shameless person to you?

84
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,554
It doesn't matter what I think.

85
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:29,490
All the evidence points to you.

86
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,594
That's...

87
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:33,424
a misunderstanding.

88
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:35,269
I did make that phone call,

89
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,970
but I never murdered Geun Woo.

90
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,470
I explained this to Jin Woo...

91
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,664
countless times already.

92
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:44,404
Do I need to do that with you too?

93
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,885
If it's that hard for you, you don't need to do it with me.

94
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,720
I'll find out the truth for myself.

95
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,325
It's not like the truth will go away just because you ignore it.

96
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,959
Rather than ignoring it,

97
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,860
we must face it and go head-on.

98
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,094
Since I need take it head-on in order for the world to change.

99
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,515
(Candidate 2, Lee Jin Woo)

100
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,284
(Candidate 2, Lee Jin Woo)

101
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:45,864
- You should eat first. - You're here! Hello.

102
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:47,869
Let's all eat first.

103
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:49,635
(Changing Korea, Lee Jin Woo will create a better country!)

104
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:53,104
Do you have the result?

105
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,009
Yes.

106
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,819
What, Kim Young Ju has 41.5?

107
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:57,974
What about us?

108
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,284
Tell me what we have already.

109
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,815
All right, I'm hanging up.

110
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,554
(Lee Jin Woo)

111
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:08,284
What is it? What do we have?

112
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,025
Did we drop a lot?

113
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:12,594
Yes, a lot.

114
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,724
How many points?

115
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,364
Stop keeping me in suspense and tell me already.

116
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,904
We lost four percentage points?

117
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,234
34?

118
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,180
Kim Young Ju, 41.5 percent.

119
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,180
We have 40.

120
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,914
It's within the margin of error, and it's close!

121
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,255
This is amazing.

122
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,755
- Lee Jin Woo. - Lee Jin Woo.

123
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,724
- Lee Jin Woo. - Lee Jin Woo.

124
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,860
- Lee Jin Woo. - Lee Jin Woo.

125
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,069
- Lee Jin Woo. - Lee Jin Woo.

126
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,800
The Democratic People's Party candidate, Kim Young Ju,

127
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,069
and the Creation Party candidate, Lee Jin Woo,

128
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:53,240
are within the margin of error from polling percentages.

129
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,209
The results of approval ratings collected nationwide...

130
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:58,639
have showed Candidate Kim has 41.5 percent,

131
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,910
and Candidate Lee has 40 percent,

132
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,074
while Candidate Kim...

133
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:05,544
Now, now.

134
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:07,615
Let's not be too disappointed yet.

135
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,515
We're still winning by 1.5 points.

136
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,520
If we keep doing well, we won't have any problems.

137
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,855
Is that all you have?

138
00:09:14,729 --> 00:09:16,559
- What? - "Don't be disappointed."

139
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,924
"Things will all turn out well."

140
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:21,400
Is that all you have to say?

141
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,839
I'd like to hear something more productive for once.

142
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,339
(Candidate 1, Kim Young Ju)

143
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:27,904
What is it? Do I have to wait?

144
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,235
How long do I have to wait for a good idea from you?

145
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:35,804
Mr. Chairman, just head on home.

146
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,319
What?

147
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:39,615
(A Future for the People! A Hopeful Tomorrow!)

148
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,715
You're kicking me out?

149
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:47,890
I'm to be appointed as your Prime Minister.

150
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,189
I need to be in the meeting.

151
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,554
How can you say that when we're about to lose?

152
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,130
You're not going to contribute anything to the meeting anyway.

153
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,334
So just go on home.

154
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:00,365
We'll have the meeting ourselves.

155
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,904
What are you doing? Prep for the strategy meeting.

156
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,010
Yes, ma'am.

157
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,044
Let's prepare for the meeting.

158
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:16,985
Yes, Mr. President?

159
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,160
- You saw the results? - Yes.

160
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,824
I'm sorry for worrying you.

161
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:22,930
I'll try harder.

162
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,859
It's all right. If you got to 41.5 percent,

163
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,569
you've done all you can.

164
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:29,000
You don't need to try any harder.

165
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,640
That's not true. Jin Woo has nearly caught up.

166
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,010
- If I don't do anything now... - From now on, Candidate Kim,

167
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,505
you can't win unless you throw something away.

168
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,309
In order to become President,

169
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:41,704
to take the seat I have now, what can you throw away?

170
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:48,645
I understand.

171
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,095
I'll do as you say. Thank you, Mr. President.

172
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,140
- Great. - Let's toast.

173
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,479
- Cheers. - Drink up, everyone.

174
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:14,804
Now, now. Attention, attention.

175
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,550
I know that if I say this now,

176
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,520
I'm sure there will be some among you...

177
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,059
that say I'm jumping the gun,

178
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,260
but I have to say this now.

179
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,829
If we just keep going, Candidate Lee Jin Woo,

180
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:33,630
my friend Jin Woo, will be the President, right?

181
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,569
- Yes. - Right.

182
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,395
- Yes. - That's right.

183
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,939
Now, now, now.

184
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:42,809
In that case, Candidate Jin Woo,

185
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:47,375
no, President Jin Woo, will now share some words with us.

186
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,719
Please give him a round of applause.

187
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:53,784
- Lee Jin Woo. - Lee Jin Woo.

188
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,250
- Lee Jin Woo. - Lee Jin Woo.

189
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,189
- Lee Jin Woo. - Here.

190
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:59,284
- Lee Jin Woo. - Lee Jin Woo.

191
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,885
What should I say?

192
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,829
Just say whatever.

193
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:07,000
- Or you can sing for us. - Yes, sing!

194
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,300
- Sing for us. - Now, now.

195
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,995
Stop that.

196
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,534
Whenever someone's asked to say a few words,

197
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,410
they always talk in cliches,

198
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,510
so for today, I'll just take questions.

199
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,349
If there's anything you wanted to know about me,

200
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:23,920
you can ask me now.

201
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,975
- I have a question. - There's a question.

202
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:28,489
Candidate Lee, you're so good-looking.

203
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:29,949
- He's right. - Lee Jin Woo,

204
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,520
the handsome Lee Jin Woo.

205
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,959
- Lee Jin Woo. - Lee Jin Woo.

206
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,059
We love you, Lee Jin Woo.

207
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,794
Give me a hug, Lee Jin Woo.

208
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,365
He's drunk.

209
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,140
Whenever he gets drunk, he says I'm handsome.

210
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,599
Didn't he say that to you too?

211
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,105
Twice, he said it to me twice.

212
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,010
Questions, any questions?

213
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,034
- Me! - Yes.

214
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:55,550
After you become President,

215
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,074
what's the first thing you want to do?

216
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,275
- Wow. - What?

217
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,989
As soon as the inauguration is complete,

218
00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:05,260
what's the first thing you will do?

219
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,160
Like a lifelong wish?

220
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,284
A lifelong wish.

221
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,465
Revenge.

222
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:27,444
I'm going to use the power of the Presidency to take revenge.

223
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:31,680
Our President is so amazing.

224
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,890
- You're amazing. - You're so impressive.

225
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,020
Jin Woo is the best.

226
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,319
The vengeful Jin Woo, we'll be cheering for you.

227
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:38,319
Fighting.

228
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:41,859
- Revenge. - Revenge.

229
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:44,660
- Revenge. - Calm down, everyone.

230
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,329
- Revenge. - Revenge.

231
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:49,064
Let's all give ourselves a toast.

232
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,294
- Fighting. - Fighting.

233
00:13:54,969 --> 00:13:56,164
That's great.

234
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,814
Is that really the first thing you're going to do?

235
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,184
- What? - Revenge.

236
00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:13,924
If you become President, you'll really take revenge first?

237
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,084
I do want to.

238
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,355
I'm not sure if I can, though.

239
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,569
Jin Woo, when we were reporters,

240
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:28,804
those were the people we hated the most.

241
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:33,704
People who used their power to fulfill personal desires.

242
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:36,574
I hope you don't turn out...

243
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,449
to be that kind of person, Jin Woo.

244
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,715
What are you doing?

245
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,959
Why are you suddenly trying to lecture me?

246
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,525
It's because I feel pity.

247
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,199
Who's pitiful?

248
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,300
If I seem pitiful now in the eyes of the country,

249
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,965
- who wouldn't? - Not you.

250
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:00,469
The people who elected you.

251
00:15:00,469 --> 00:15:03,135
I feel pity for those who vote for you.

252
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,804
To be honest,

253
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,620
I'm not going to vote for you.

254
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,819
I'm not even going to go to the voting booth.

255
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:15,414
I abstain.

256
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:17,985
As soon as you become President,

257
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:21,829
you'll take revenge for your brother first, before anything else?

258
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:23,954
I can't accept that.

259
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,599
Fine.

260
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:33,804
Then what do you think I should do first, as President?

261
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,540
I don't know that either, since I'm not the one running.

262
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,475
But I know this for sure. I wish you'd do something...

263
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,414
more impressive and greater than anything I can think of.

264
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,314
I want someone like that to be my President.

265
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,615
Someone who knows how to tolerate the things I can't,

266
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:56,855
who knows how to endure suffering in a way I don't.

267
00:15:57,229 --> 00:16:00,694
Someone greater than me, a common man.

268
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,534
From that perspective, you're not President-material.

269
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:12,534
If you want revenge, go sharpen a knife from afar.

270
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,349
Go to a Shaolin temple somewhere and learn kung fu.

271
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,510
Kung fu.

272
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:19,715
You fool. Trying to be President.

273
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,084
Does the country seem like that much of a joke to you?

274
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:26,454
Do you want a taste of the country's moves?

275
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,760
I'll teach you kung fu myself.

276
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,855
Hey.

277
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,794
You...

278
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,595
- Goodness. - Hey.

279
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:37,765
You punk. Gosh.

280
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,845
What I said earlier was a mistake.

281
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,454
I apologize.

282
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,025
I apologize.

283
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,255
- Hey, Chang Soo. - Yes, sir.

284
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,424
Are you going to vote for me?

285
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,895
Of course. I will go vote as soon as the clock strikes six.

286
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,265
- Why are you going to vote for me? - Pardon?

287
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,934
There must be a reason why you want to vote for me.

288
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:22,605
Aside from the real reasons like I pay you.

289
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,219
May I think about my answer and get back to you?

290
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:28,250
The fact that you need to think about it means...

291
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,420
you can't think of any reasons right now, right?

292
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,359
No, it's not like that, sir.

293
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,515
No, it's fine.

294
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:35,884
I'm sorry about taking a dig at what you said.

295
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,955
It's just because...

296
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:41,165
I suddenly feel like I don't know anything either.

297
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:47,405
I don't know how I ended up in this position.

298
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:57,249
(Creation Party, Lee Jin Woo)

299
00:17:57,249 --> 00:17:58,975
- Good morning. - Hello.

300
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:05,155
Goodness. What is everyone doing sitting down?

301
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:08,985
It's a critical moment where all the votes matter.

302
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,955
If Candidate Lee fails to win...

303
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,265
- When did you get here? - What are you doing?

304
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:16,064
- What? - Why are you overreacting?

305
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,594
- What did I do? - Is it because of what you said?

306
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,594
I don't remember.

307
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,009
- You really don't remember? - No, I don't.

308
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:26,580
I remember talking to you about Kung Fu,

309
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,044
but I don't remember anything after that. What can you do about it?

310
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:31,019
You should be the one in politics.

311
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:32,350
You always say you don't remember.

312
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,775
I'll go into my office...

313
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:36,245
to grind the axe I have against you.

314
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,854
We're in trouble!

315
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,485
We...

316
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:42,554
What is it?

317
00:18:43,143 --> 00:18:44,948
To the citizens whom I respect.

318
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:47,923
As of today, I will drop out of the race for the presidency.

319
00:18:47,923 --> 00:18:51,052
Rather than becoming the president and starting a new administration,

320
00:18:51,052 --> 00:18:55,163
I've decided that keeping the promise I made with the people...

321
00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:59,228
to create a better Korea is more important to me...

322
00:18:59,332 --> 00:19:00,798
which is why I came to this decision.

323
00:19:00,863 --> 00:19:02,597
Ms. Kim, please come up.

324
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:03,873
(Candidates Kim Young Ju and Kim Sung Guk...)

325
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:04,998
(announce their unification.)

326
00:19:05,572 --> 00:19:06,698
Gosh.

327
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:11,208
Please give Candidate Kim Young Ju...

328
00:19:11,473 --> 00:19:12,812
your full support...

329
00:19:12,812 --> 00:19:15,613
and actively endorse her.

330
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:18,383
What is this? My gosh!

331
00:19:18,383 --> 00:19:21,748
I will work alongside Candidate Kim Young Ju to ensure that...

332
00:19:21,752 --> 00:19:23,723
she keeps the promises she made to the people.

333
00:19:23,723 --> 00:19:25,292
Candidate Kim Young Ju of the Democratic People's Party...

334
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:27,262
and Candidate Kim Sung Guk of the Korean Financial Party...

335
00:19:27,262 --> 00:19:29,818
have agreed to unify their campaigns this morning,

336
00:19:30,262 --> 00:19:31,632
and they...

337
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:33,863
How can Kim Sung Guk do this to me?

338
00:19:33,863 --> 00:19:35,532
I helped him out so much.

339
00:19:35,532 --> 00:19:37,798
When he got thrown out of his party and had nowhere to go,

340
00:19:38,373 --> 00:19:40,373
I took him in three times.

341
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:41,698
That's probably why he did it.

342
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:44,107
He's your typical migrant.

343
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:46,673
You're right. He is a migrant who follows me.

344
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:48,137
So how can he do that?

345
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:50,282
What will you do now?

346
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:54,423
If things continue on this way, Kim Young Ju, that witch,

347
00:19:54,423 --> 00:19:55,847
will end up becoming president.

348
00:19:56,183 --> 00:19:57,687
You know what that means, right?

349
00:19:58,292 --> 00:20:00,623
Seo Ki Tae's puppet will be sitting in that seat.

350
00:20:00,623 --> 00:20:03,357
Then it will be over for you and me.

351
00:20:03,393 --> 00:20:04,627
Sir.

352
00:20:05,492 --> 00:20:08,927
It's already in the past, so there's no need to complain further.

353
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:11,433
As of this moment, can we think about the future?

354
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:12,572
Okay. Go ahead.

355
00:20:12,572 --> 00:20:14,103
If they managed to move Kim Sung Guk,

356
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:16,068
that means they used a sure card.

357
00:20:16,443 --> 00:20:18,042
I'll look into what that is,

358
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:21,377

00:20:22,883 --> 00:20:24,048

360
00:20:24,613 --> 00:20:26,113
Why should I?

361
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:27,653

363
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:31,847

368
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,738

369
00:20:52,312 --> 00:20:53,907

371

373

379
00:21:16,802 --> 00:21:18,203
I didn't do anything wrong, so why should I hide?

380
00:21:18,203 --> 00:21:20,127
Hey, Kim Young Ju. You...

381
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:27,877
What on earth happened?

382
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:29,637
Explain yourself.

383
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:34,048
You're really consistent. You know that?

384
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:37,251
Is asking me to explain myself the only thing you can say right now?

385

386

394
00:22:05,153 --> 00:22:08,077
You came up with this decision on your own, didn't you?

395
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:11,893
Ki Tae had nothing to do with this, right?

396
00:22:11,893 --> 00:22:13,087
That's enough.

It's the first time we're talking on the phone in the same year, right?

You're right. It feels fresh.

Why did you do that to Soo Kyung?

455
00:25:00,453 --> 00:25:02,863
- What did I do? - Why didn't you let her cover it?

00:25:06,562 --> 00:25:07,927
I told you last time.

459
00:25:08,002 --> 00:25:11,198
It's because I need to turn back all the nonsense I did with you.

460
00:25:11,232 --> 00:25:13,072
Do you still not understand what's going on?

461
00:25:13,072 --> 00:25:15,042

464
00:25:19,443 --> 00:25:21,177
thought everything would be better now.

465

466
00:25:24,282 --> 00:25:26,677

00:25:27,353 --> 00:25:29,123

468
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:31,552

469
00:25:31,552 --> 00:25:34,048
No, it was my fault.

474
00:25:43,332 --> 00:25:44,732
I'll check every name on it.

475
00:25:44,732 --> 00:25:48,002
And if everything on that ledger is true, I'll run the story.

476
00:25:48,002 --> 00:25:49,798
How will you get that ledger?

477
00:25:53,873 --> 00:25:56,883
Don't tell me you called me to ask for that ledger now.

478
00:25:56,883 --> 00:25:58,613
You wouldn't have gotten rid of it...

479
00:25:58,613 --> 00:26:00,248

Fine. Go ahead.

536
00:29:40,802 --> 00:29:42,637
I'm Reporter Seo Jung In from the newsroom.

537
00:29:42,742 --> 00:29:44,812
I would like to get the footage of the 2015 Orientation...

538
00:29:44,812 --> 00:29:46,742
for college interns.

539
00:29:46,742 --> 00:29:49,607
I need to check something. Please message me back.

00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:56,117
(Assemblyman Nam Seong Beom)

541
00:30:04,393 --> 00:30:06,657
I asked to see you today...

542
00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:11,433
because I'm in a tight spot.

543
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:15,068
And you are the only one who can help me.

544
00:30:16,302 --> 00:30:18,742
What kind of tight spot are you in?

545
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:21,208
Well, the thing is...

546
00:30:21,342 --> 00:30:24,213
Can you meet with the President...

547
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:26,077
and put in a good word for me?

548
00:30:26,713 --> 00:30:28,778
I mean, that witch, Young Ju...

549
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,687
I mean,

550
00:30:32,252 --> 00:30:36,562
Candidate Kim completely made a fool out of...

551
00:30:36,562 --> 00:30:40,258
If that's what you need, I cannot help you.

552
00:30:43,863 --> 00:30:44,933
Right.

553
00:30:44,933 --> 00:30:47,937
I know why you are so hostile against me.

554
00:30:48,203 --> 00:30:49,302
I know.

555
00:30:49,302 --> 00:30:52,443
I know that it has to do with the incident in 2015.

556
00:30:52,443 --> 00:30:56,778
But it was that with, Kim Young Ju, who set up the entire thing.

557
00:30:56,812 --> 00:30:58,153
I had no idea.

558
00:30:58,153 --> 00:31:00,607
So you didn't do anything wrong?

559
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:03,282
Is that all you got for me?

560
00:31:03,282 --> 00:31:06,187
Gosh. Of course, not.

561
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,022
Do you think a grown man like me...

562
00:31:08,022 --> 00:31:10,657
wanted to meet with you just to say stuff like that?

563
00:31:12,933 --> 00:31:14,157
Jung In.

564
00:31:15,363 --> 00:31:17,298
You've been looking into the corruption behind JC.

565
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:23,973
I'll tell you everything you want to know.

566
00:31:23,973 --> 00:31:25,437
Everything from A to Z.

567
00:31:25,973 --> 00:31:28,677
No matter how long it takes, I'll tell you everything.

568
00:31:28,842 --> 00:31:30,837
Put in a good word for me with your father.

569
00:31:31,752 --> 00:31:34,478
- Okay? - Let's hear it.

570
00:31:35,423 --> 00:31:38,853
You know the cell phone we had?

571
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:40,322
- Yes. - The cell phones...

572
00:31:40,322 --> 00:31:43,458
Geun Woo got these phones from JC Telecom.

573
00:31:43,522 --> 00:31:45,663
(Assemblyman Seo Ki Tae)

574
00:31:45,663 --> 00:31:46,857
This is nice.

575
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:50,262
(Democratic People's Party)

576
00:31:50,262 --> 00:31:53,427
Why are they giving cell phones to the assemblymen and women?

577
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:56,242
Because of those cell phones,

578
00:31:56,242 --> 00:31:59,068
Geun Woo must have gotten curious which wasn't good for anybody.

579
00:31:59,713 --> 00:32:00,812
That's when he started to follow...

580
00:32:00,812 --> 00:32:03,208
the relationships between politicians and JC.

581
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:06,508
And he finally got to the bottom of the truth.

582
00:32:06,953 --> 00:32:10,048
He figured out the long-standing relationship...

583
00:32:10,322 --> 00:32:13,548
between the CEO of JC Telecom, Park Chan Yong, and the President.

584
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:16,187
That's why he died.

585
00:32:17,492 --> 00:32:20,187
- When did Park Chan Yong... - I don't know.

586
00:32:20,393 --> 00:32:22,698
If you want to ask more questions, ask Kim Young Ju.

587
00:32:25,103 --> 00:32:26,327
I'm serious.

588
00:32:27,302 --> 00:32:29,903
I don't know anything except for taking a small bribe.

589
00:32:29,903 --> 00:32:31,137
I'm telling you the truth.

590
00:32:34,272 --> 00:32:36,107
Then, let me ask you one question.

591
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:40,248
You were connected to the past in 2019, right?

592
00:32:41,723 --> 00:32:43,177
Well,

593
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:45,748
I don't remember that.

594
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:50,822
I only know what I heard from Young Ju in 2015.

595
00:32:50,822 --> 00:32:52,357
She said I called her or something.

596
00:32:52,863 --> 00:32:56,357
You know, the cell phones we had were pretty special.

597
00:32:56,463 --> 00:32:59,002
JC was trying to research 5G networks or something.

598
00:32:59,002 --> 00:33:01,667
They were like prototypes to test out the networks.

599
00:33:02,072 --> 00:33:04,907
There were only four models.

600
00:33:05,312 --> 00:33:06,568
Four...

601
00:33:06,973 --> 00:33:08,677
Jin Woo and me.

602
00:33:09,383 --> 00:33:11,407
But after a single phone call,

603
00:33:11,853 --> 00:33:13,252
I came to find out that wasn't the case at all.

604
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:15,252
Why do you think...

605
00:33:15,252 --> 00:33:17,478
that you're the only person to have that special experience?

606
00:33:17,853 --> 00:33:20,147
- Kim Young Ju... - And me.

607
00:33:20,592 --> 00:33:22,018
I know how you must feel.

608
00:33:23,463 --> 00:33:27,463
When you start connecting to the past, you can't stop.

609
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,427
I felt the same way.

610
00:33:29,463 --> 00:33:32,667
But now, I can't do anything. I don't have that phone now.

611
00:33:32,903 --> 00:33:34,473
- Mr. Nam. - Young Ju was also...

612
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:36,742
- connected to 2019 a few times. - I can't hear you.

613
00:33:36,742 --> 00:33:38,767
- Hello? - But it broke down quickly.

614
00:33:39,473 --> 00:33:41,683
The phone doesn't break if you use it for regular calls.

615
00:33:41,683 --> 00:33:43,937
Are you sure this was working before?

616
00:33:44,282 --> 00:33:47,908
Soon it won't even charge, and then it will break.

617
00:33:48,322 --> 00:33:51,448
I told you. I went through it all too.

618
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:55,123
When you keep trying to connect the past with the future,

619
00:33:55,123 --> 00:33:57,063
- that's what broke the phones. - Hello?

620
00:33:57,063 --> 00:33:58,227
You can't hear me?

621
00:33:59,492 --> 00:34:02,357
Anyway, my phone stopped working too.

622
00:34:02,462 --> 00:34:05,667
And both you and Jin Woo don't have the phones either.

623
00:34:06,103 --> 00:34:08,897
So stop wasting your time on this...

624
00:34:09,242 --> 00:34:12,468
and digging into the corruption behind JC Telecom too.

625
00:34:13,873 --> 00:34:16,138
I get your point.

626
00:34:17,413 --> 00:34:19,747
Well, that's it, right?

627
00:34:20,112 --> 00:34:21,377
Bye.

628
00:34:22,552 --> 00:34:23,718
Jung In.

629
00:34:26,422 --> 00:34:27,948
- What? - You'll...

630
00:34:28,922 --> 00:34:31,087
talk to your dad, right?

631
00:34:33,192 --> 00:34:35,433
Too bad. I had a fight with my dad.

632
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:37,333
What? Why?

633
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,428
Because of what you just told me.

634
00:34:39,603 --> 00:34:42,373
If I end up reconciling with my dad,

635
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:43,698
I'll tell him then.

636
00:34:44,072 --> 00:34:46,408
But I think that will be after his term is over.

637
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,807
Hey!

638
00:34:56,753 --> 00:34:58,517
Do you also think I'm a pushover?

639
00:34:59,353 --> 00:35:00,488
Is that it?

640
00:35:00,953 --> 00:35:02,957
Do you think I'll go down this easily?

641
00:35:05,293 --> 00:35:07,187
I won't go down alone.

642
00:35:07,532 --> 00:35:09,563
If I decide to talk,

643
00:35:09,563 --> 00:35:11,672
you, your brother, and Young Ju can...

644
00:35:11,672 --> 00:35:13,098
Go ahead. Do it.

645
00:35:14,103 --> 00:35:16,043
It all started from what you said.

646
00:35:16,043 --> 00:35:18,267
Let's see if you can put an end to it too.

647
00:35:18,973 --> 00:35:21,638
That's what I want the most too.

648
00:35:23,143 --> 00:35:24,638
Thanks for the coffee.

649
00:35:42,032 --> 00:35:43,957
Why, these little...

650
00:35:46,132 --> 00:35:47,698
I can't let this slide now.

651
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:04,278
What should I do, sir?

652
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,787
Candidate Kim seemed very worried.

653
00:36:18,503 --> 00:36:19,973
President Seo has invited...

654
00:36:19,973 --> 00:36:22,643
former President Baek Kyu Min to the Blue House tomorrow...

655
00:36:22,643 --> 00:36:24,968
for a morning meeting.

656
00:36:25,043 --> 00:36:27,873
This is the first time President Seo has invited the former President...

657
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:29,107
to the Blue House since he was inaugurated.

658
00:36:47,793 --> 00:36:48,957
Yes, Mr. President.

659
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:54,072
So they're offering to make Kim Sung Guk...

660
00:36:54,072 --> 00:36:56,473
the Prime Minister, I hear?

661
00:36:56,473 --> 00:36:59,512
It's probably Seo Ki Tae's idea, not Kim Young Ju's.

662
00:36:59,512 --> 00:37:01,638
I trapped them.

663
00:37:01,712 --> 00:37:04,437
Didn't I do well? I've still got it.

664
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:07,747
That's true. You've still got it.

665
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:11,623
Who is the person you wanted me to meet?

666
00:37:11,623 --> 00:37:13,118
I've just arrived.

667
00:37:13,123 --> 00:37:15,262
Do you know Canaan?

668
00:37:15,262 --> 00:37:17,123
The land flowing with milk and honey.

669
00:37:17,123 --> 00:37:21,258
I've gotten you tickets for an express train there.

670
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:23,028
The person you're going to meet,

671
00:37:23,503 --> 00:37:26,402
give him some drinks,

672
00:37:26,402 --> 00:37:28,098
and comfort his wounds a bit.

673
00:37:28,842 --> 00:37:30,103
That's all you need to do.

674
00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:32,643
All right. It sounds like an impressive person indeed.

675
00:37:32,643 --> 00:37:35,337
I'll call you back after our meeting.

676
00:37:47,953 --> 00:37:49,357
I'm sorry, but are you...

677
00:38:03,273 --> 00:38:04,568
What a disappointment.

678
00:38:05,512 --> 00:38:07,368
I thought you'd be someone really impressive.

679
00:38:08,342 --> 00:38:09,537
Would you like a drink?

680
00:38:10,112 --> 00:38:11,483
It's lonely drinking by myself.

681
00:38:11,483 --> 00:38:13,678
No, I have to drive.

682
00:38:13,753 --> 00:38:17,052
But how did you end up under President Baek again?

683
00:38:17,052 --> 00:38:19,548
He's simply accepted a prodigal son,

684
00:38:19,723 --> 00:38:22,223
who returned despite being ungrateful to his father,

685
00:38:22,223 --> 00:38:23,787
who raised him.

686
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:27,357
I'm just grateful to him.

687
00:38:28,092 --> 00:38:30,658
So how will you act the good son to him?

688
00:38:32,402 --> 00:38:35,638
If you want Kim Young Ju, you need to get Seo Ki Tae first.

689
00:38:36,442 --> 00:38:39,537
Without Seo Ki Tae,

690
00:38:40,072 --> 00:38:42,508
Young Ju's just a naive little girl.

691
00:38:46,753 --> 00:38:50,278
I'll give you a card that can catch both scumbags.

692
00:38:50,282 --> 00:38:53,223
Who's going to play it? Will you play it yourself?

693
00:38:53,223 --> 00:38:54,787
Do you even have that card?

694
00:38:55,563 --> 00:38:57,017
You don't play cards, do you, Candidate Lee?

695
00:38:57,663 --> 00:39:00,758
If you want to catch your opponent at the card table,

696
00:39:01,192 --> 00:39:03,497
there's no way to do it fair and square.

697
00:39:03,563 --> 00:39:05,703
Whether you hustle, cheat, or lie,

698
00:39:05,703 --> 00:39:07,798
you have to do something like that in order to win.

699
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,337
The political arena is just like the card table.

700
00:39:10,942 --> 00:39:14,138
Playing fair and square just doesn't work.

701
00:39:16,382 --> 00:39:17,912
That's how things work.

702
00:39:17,913 --> 00:39:19,178
That's why we should do that too.

703
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:22,623
Candidate Lee, let's lie to them.

704
00:39:22,623 --> 00:39:24,578
A lie based on the truth.

705
00:39:25,692 --> 00:39:28,758
What lie? I don't know what you're talking about.

706
00:39:32,032 --> 00:39:36,158
Seo Jung In is at DBS.

707
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:38,631
Can't you just see it now?

708
00:39:38,632 --> 00:39:40,572
Seo Ki Tae's closest ally, Kim Young Ju,

709
00:39:40,572 --> 00:39:42,837
and her illegal business deal.

710
00:39:43,072 --> 00:39:46,143
What a coincidence,

711
00:39:46,143 --> 00:39:47,968
his daughter happens to work there.

712
00:39:48,172 --> 00:39:51,307
We need to tie it in with something that people despise.

713
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:52,977
Let's go with corruption in employment practices.

714
00:39:55,223 --> 00:39:58,318
Are you telling me we should create fake news?

715
00:39:59,293 --> 00:40:03,388
In the past, these baseless rumors could travel 1,000 miles.

716
00:40:03,492 --> 00:40:08,192
These days, thanks to developments in Internet news and individuals,

717
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,262
it can travel as far as 10,000, or 100,000 miles.

718
00:40:10,262 --> 00:40:11,727
You know this already.

719
00:40:11,873 --> 00:40:15,238
If you lay the base with talk of employment corruption,

720
00:40:15,773 --> 00:40:18,298
people will create subsequent news items on their own.

721
00:40:18,512 --> 00:40:19,807
You know that.

722
00:40:19,913 --> 00:40:22,043
You know it will spread far and wide.

723
00:40:22,043 --> 00:40:25,678
Let's just think of another way, instead of something like this.

724
00:40:26,612 --> 00:40:30,083
No matter how much I want to win, this isn't the way.

725
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:31,453
You can't take innocent people who aren't involved...

726
00:40:31,453 --> 00:40:33,253
and make them suffer over something that isn't true.

727
00:40:33,253 --> 00:40:35,192
Why aren't they involved?

728
00:40:35,192 --> 00:40:36,922
Jung In is Seo Ki Tae's daughter.

729
00:40:36,922 --> 00:40:39,433
Even if she's his daughter, she's not involved in this.

730
00:40:39,433 --> 00:40:42,758
I've told you my thoughts on this. I'll be leaving now.

731
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:46,798
You'll regret this.

732
00:40:47,402 --> 00:40:48,767
If you don't take my hand,

733
00:40:49,873 --> 00:40:52,437
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

734
00:40:59,052 --> 00:41:01,353
You should worry about yourself rather than me.

735
00:41:01,353 --> 00:41:02,822
Look at the state your in.

736
00:41:02,822 --> 00:41:04,578
Go take a bath first.

737
00:41:05,052 --> 00:41:07,348
You look like a mutt that's run away from home.

738
00:41:25,672 --> 00:41:28,837
Why does everyone leave after having the last word?

739
00:41:30,742 --> 00:41:32,107
I'm always the one left alone.

740
00:41:41,322 --> 00:41:42,488
What?

741
00:41:43,462 --> 00:41:45,192
Jin Woo really said that?

742
00:41:45,192 --> 00:41:46,328
Yes.

743
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,627
All right. Hang up for now.

744
00:41:49,402 --> 00:41:51,598
I said, hang up now, you fool.

745
00:41:56,842 --> 00:41:59,837
What? Nam Seong Beom said what?

746
00:42:01,212 --> 00:42:02,583
What a piece of trash.

747
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:04,678
How can a human being say that?

748
00:42:04,683 --> 00:42:06,313
He can say it because he's not even human.

749
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:08,647
Don't worry about it, and let's just do our work properly.

750
00:42:09,623 --> 00:42:11,718
Oh, hello.

751
00:42:13,092 --> 00:42:14,287
My goodness.

752
00:42:14,753 --> 00:42:17,917
- Hello. - Nice to see you.

753
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:21,028
Isn't it tough?

754
00:42:22,003 --> 00:42:24,258
Gosh.

755
00:42:24,632 --> 00:42:26,227
I know how it feels.

756
00:42:28,233 --> 00:42:30,873
Oh, hello, Candidate Lee. You must be working hard.

757
00:42:30,873 --> 00:42:33,072
Hello. It's not bad.

758
00:42:33,072 --> 00:42:34,373
What brings you here?

759
00:42:34,373 --> 00:42:36,212
What do you mean?

760
00:42:36,212 --> 00:42:38,138
I'm just here to congratulate you.

761
00:42:38,983 --> 00:42:41,012
Where should I offer my congratulations?

762
00:42:41,012 --> 00:42:42,747
I want it to be just the two of us.

763
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:45,888
- Then please come this way. - All right.

764
00:42:49,462 --> 00:42:51,488
How was your meeting with Mr. Nam?

765
00:42:52,893 --> 00:42:55,132
It went as expected.

766
00:42:55,132 --> 00:42:57,658
Are you saying you found him to be trash, as you expected?

767
00:42:58,632 --> 00:43:02,937
That piece of trash said he could get you elected.

768
00:43:03,273 --> 00:43:04,373
Is that not what you want?

769
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,537
He made me an offer I couldn't help but refuse.

770
00:43:06,973 --> 00:43:08,012
I apologize.

771
00:43:08,012 --> 00:43:10,912
Employment corruption is relatively clean.

772
00:43:10,913 --> 00:43:13,683
In my day, we did everything besides murder and kidnapping.

773
00:43:13,683 --> 00:43:16,483
It's just an employment scandal. It's quite noble.

774
00:43:16,483 --> 00:43:18,822
Creating fake news isn't a noble thing to do.

775
00:43:18,822 --> 00:43:21,592
It's noble exactly because it's creating fake news.

776
00:43:21,592 --> 00:43:24,618
No one would listen if just anyone said that.

777
00:43:24,822 --> 00:43:27,492
It's because we nobles are saying it that the commoners...

778
00:43:27,492 --> 00:43:30,658
believe it to be true.

779
00:43:31,362 --> 00:43:33,227
I understand what you're saying,

780
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,537
but it won't change my mind.

781
00:43:35,603 --> 00:43:37,572
I will not create an employment corruption scandal around Jung In.

782
00:43:37,572 --> 00:43:39,638
Don't just trust your conscience.

783
00:43:39,913 --> 00:43:41,242
Trust my intuition.

784
00:43:41,242 --> 00:43:45,413
As someone who lived in the Blue House before you,

785
00:43:45,413 --> 00:43:46,983
this game will work.

786
00:43:46,983 --> 00:43:48,552
If you just play this properly,

787
00:43:48,552 --> 00:43:51,282
you can get to Canaan, flowing with milk and honey.

788
00:43:51,282 --> 00:43:52,848
I won't go there, then.

789
00:43:54,152 --> 00:43:57,017
- What? - I have no wish...

790
00:43:57,023 --> 00:43:58,663
to become President by creating suffering for others to do so.

791
00:43:58,663 --> 00:44:01,388
Then what? What about revenge for your brother?

792
00:44:02,203 --> 00:44:03,933
That will come in time.

793
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:07,028
I can't create another me just to get my own revenge.

794
00:44:08,072 --> 00:44:12,667
I'm tempted to say something quite harsh to you.

795
00:44:13,342 --> 00:44:14,667
I'm holding myself back right now.

796
00:44:15,913 --> 00:44:17,178
You don't need to hold back.

797
00:44:31,563 --> 00:44:32,828
All right.

798
00:44:33,933 --> 00:44:35,758
I know I went too far.

799
00:44:35,902 --> 00:44:38,798
I ruined my own son too.

800
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:40,767
By not holding back my temper.

801
00:44:44,103 --> 00:44:45,568
I'll be going now, Candidate Lee.

802
00:44:46,442 --> 00:44:49,178
Now that I've aged, I just feel sleepy all the time.

803
00:44:59,192 --> 00:45:02,187
(I will be sure to do it! Lee Jin Woo)

804
00:45:15,692 --> 00:45:16,856
This way.

805
00:45:21,391 --> 00:45:22,626
- Have a seat. - Thank you.

806
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:29,101
I should've invited you sooner...

807
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,802
and gotten help in government administration.

808
00:45:31,802 --> 00:45:33,066
I apologize for inviting you so late.

809
00:45:33,141 --> 00:45:35,937
I'm grateful that you've invited me.

810
00:45:36,681 --> 00:45:38,851
After my term ended and I left the Blue House,

811
00:45:38,851 --> 00:45:41,207
I was relieved,

812
00:45:41,811 --> 00:45:43,647
but I was also upset.

813
00:45:43,851 --> 00:45:46,316
It feels new to be back here like this today.

814
00:45:47,152 --> 00:45:48,546
Let's look at the cameras.

815
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:50,857
Be sure to smile so the pictures come out great.

816
00:45:54,132 --> 00:45:56,262
You're behind the fact that...

817
00:45:56,262 --> 00:45:58,426
Kim Sung Guk unified with you, aren't you?

818
00:45:58,532 --> 00:46:00,327
I can't say I was behind it.

819
00:46:01,501 --> 00:46:03,866
Candidate Kim Young Ju made a lot of efforts.

820
00:46:04,072 --> 00:46:08,636
My goodness. You know how to be modest too now, Ki Tae.

821
00:46:13,181 --> 00:46:15,176
What does it matter? It's just the two of us here.

822
00:46:15,351 --> 00:46:17,446
We were always close. You and I.

823
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:22,291
It reminds me of the old days...

824
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:24,386
as we sit here together after a long time.

825
00:46:24,621 --> 00:46:26,661
Back in the day, you came to me and said,

826
00:46:26,661 --> 00:46:29,201
"Kyu Min. I want to get into politics. Please help me."

827
00:46:29,201 --> 00:46:32,366
So I said, "Really? Do you want to get into politics?"

828
00:46:32,701 --> 00:46:34,101
"Drink this first."

829
00:46:34,101 --> 00:46:38,096
"This drink is to signify our unchanging friendship."

830
00:46:38,271 --> 00:46:42,176
While I said that, I thought you and I would stay friends forever.

831
00:46:42,811 --> 00:46:44,937
How did we end up like this?

832
00:46:45,311 --> 00:46:48,147
I took care of a lot of things for you.

833
00:46:48,652 --> 00:46:51,116
Back in the day, I had Young Ju and Seong Beom...

834
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:54,517
help create sludge funds for you.

835
00:46:55,092 --> 00:46:58,787
But that keeps coming back to haunt me.

836
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:02,057
It seems like you're mistaken.

837
00:47:02,161 --> 00:47:03,862
I'm not the only one who benefited from that.

838
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:07,072
If you didn't get that money from him, you wouldn't be here right now.

839
00:47:07,072 --> 00:47:08,296
Don't you remember?

840
00:47:08,802 --> 00:47:11,871
I put together the money we got from Park Chan Yong of JC...

841
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,342
and set up the 5G Communications Network Auction,

842
00:47:14,342 --> 00:47:15,942
and I did everything I could...

843
00:47:15,942 --> 00:47:19,647
both physically and psychologically to make you the next president.

844
00:47:20,351 --> 00:47:23,681
Yes, I know. How could I not know that?

845
00:47:23,681 --> 00:47:25,486
No. You don't know.

846
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:27,451
After everything I've done for you,

847
00:47:27,451 --> 00:47:29,121
you turned around and stabbed me in the back.

848
00:47:29,121 --> 00:47:32,931
I was so surprised back then.

849
00:47:32,931 --> 00:47:34,632
If Young Ju didn't tell me,

850
00:47:34,632 --> 00:47:36,862
imagine what would've happened to me. Don't you agree?

851
00:47:36,862 --> 00:47:38,526
I heard about it too.

852
00:47:39,032 --> 00:47:41,526
During a time I don't remember in 2019,

853
00:47:41,601 --> 00:47:43,402
I revealed all the corruption...

854
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,771
that you, Young Ju, and Seong Beom had done.

855
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:46,966
But here's the thing.

856
00:47:47,512 --> 00:47:50,382
I'm not completely sure as it's not something I went through myself,

857
00:47:50,382 --> 00:47:53,411
but I heard that back then in 2019,

858
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:57,316
I was a president with approval ratings at nearly 70 percent.

859
00:47:57,652 --> 00:48:00,216
But that's not the case now.

860
00:48:01,221 --> 00:48:03,721
What are you talking about? Why are you saying that now?

861
00:48:03,721 --> 00:48:06,692
I'm telling you that things are different from then and now.

862
00:48:06,692 --> 00:48:08,462
What kind of power could a president...

863
00:48:08,462 --> 00:48:09,997
with half that approval rating have?

864
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:14,397
I have no intention of putting my life on the line...

865
00:48:14,871 --> 00:48:17,201
to reveal your corruption.

866
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:18,906
You have no intention to bring me down?

867
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:22,681
You're not the type to do that.

868
00:48:22,681 --> 00:48:24,937
I have to think about my own life.

869
00:48:25,141 --> 00:48:27,382
That's what all politicians have to deal with.

870
00:48:27,382 --> 00:48:30,247
I need to survive to have a future,

871
00:48:30,482 --> 00:48:33,692
and that's the only way I can do what I need to do.

872
00:48:33,692 --> 00:48:37,256
So, Ki Tae, you're saying that...

873
00:48:38,931 --> 00:48:40,526
You should join hands with me.

874
00:48:40,992 --> 00:48:44,627
We shouldn't get controlled by someone as green as Lee Jin Woo...

875
00:48:44,931 --> 00:48:48,096
who doesn't know anything about politics, don't you agree?

876
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:50,771
It doesn't look good.

877
00:48:50,771 --> 00:48:55,342
So you should let go of Lee Jin Woo's hand from now on...

878
00:48:55,342 --> 00:48:56,707
and grab onto mine.

879
00:48:56,982 --> 00:49:00,276
If you turn your back on Lee Jin Woo and join hands with Young Ju,

880
00:49:00,382 --> 00:49:03,382
the 20 percent that supports you completely...

881
00:49:03,382 --> 00:49:06,391
will leave Lee Jin Woo and join us.

882
00:49:06,391 --> 00:49:10,187
Then we will have this election in the bag for sure.

883
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:15,287
I understand what you're saying,

884
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:19,902
but how can I trust Young Ju?

885
00:49:19,902 --> 00:49:22,442
You should trust me, not Young Ju.

886
00:49:22,442 --> 00:49:25,807
Why do you think I pushed Young Ju to be a presidential candidate?

887
00:49:26,712 --> 00:49:28,207
It's because she's got her hands dirty.

888
00:49:28,311 --> 00:49:30,807
Someone who's dirty has a lot of weaknesses,

889
00:49:31,012 --> 00:49:32,882
and someone with a lot of weaknesses...

890
00:49:32,882 --> 00:49:34,877
has no choice but to do as their told.

891
00:49:35,552 --> 00:49:37,917
They must do whatever the person who holds their weaknesses say.

892
00:49:38,221 --> 00:49:41,886
In this situation, if you keep holding onto Lee Jin Woo,

893
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,756
you will sink with him.

894
00:49:45,762 --> 00:49:49,156
We must stand strong for the nation to stay steady.

895
00:49:51,061 --> 00:49:53,026
Aren't you aware of this too?

896
00:50:00,371 --> 00:50:02,707
Gosh, I might end up getting indigestion.

897
00:50:03,641 --> 00:50:05,776
We can talk about this later. We have plenty of time.

898
00:50:16,462 --> 00:50:19,831
Today, Seo Ki Tae told me that...

899
00:50:19,831 --> 00:50:22,462
if I continue trusting Lee Jin Woo, I'll sink with him.

900
00:50:22,462 --> 00:50:25,997
He said I should join hands with him like back in the day.

901
00:50:26,172 --> 00:50:29,037
Do you remember what I said a while back?

902
00:50:29,701 --> 00:50:31,442
Lee Jin Woo and I...

903
00:50:31,442 --> 00:50:34,136
have a problem that we haven't been able to resolve for a long time.

904
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:36,081
What is it, sir?

905
00:50:36,081 --> 00:50:39,512
I can't tell you everything,

906
00:50:39,512 --> 00:50:44,046
but Jin Woo had rubbed me the wrong way once.

907
00:50:44,782 --> 00:50:46,922
I need to cut off all of Jin Woo's hands and feet...

908
00:50:46,922 --> 00:50:49,521
for him to stop acting up to me, don't you think?

909
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:51,316
Yes, that's true.

910
00:50:51,621 --> 00:50:54,426
If he causes trouble for you,

911
00:50:54,962 --> 00:50:56,756
it will be hard for us to continue with him too.

912
00:50:58,132 --> 00:51:00,471
- I see everyone is here. - Did you just get here?

913
00:51:00,471 --> 00:51:02,397
- Yes. I just got here. - Have a seat.

914
00:51:04,701 --> 00:51:08,612
How come you guys haven't contacted me all this time?

915
00:51:08,612 --> 00:51:11,342
Just because you've changed parties and are in Creation Party,

916
00:51:11,342 --> 00:51:13,652
it doesn't mean our relationships can disappear that easily.

917
00:51:13,652 --> 00:51:16,017
You guys are so cold-hearted.

918
00:51:17,922 --> 00:51:20,046
Let me pour you all a drink.

919
00:51:23,061 --> 00:51:24,917
It's been a while, sir.

920
00:51:27,232 --> 00:51:28,627
Have you been well?

921
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:43,081
It's me, sir.

922
00:51:43,081 --> 00:51:45,506
It seems like President Seo made him a proposition.

923
00:51:45,782 --> 00:51:47,647
He suggested that they join hands like back in the day,

924
00:51:48,052 --> 00:51:50,676
but before that, he said that you must be thrown out first.

925
00:51:51,221 --> 00:51:53,486
He was discussing that with the other assemblymen.

926
00:51:54,652 --> 00:51:56,791
I heard what Mr. Nam said,

927
00:51:56,791 --> 00:51:59,092
and he said that there's something that you have,

928
00:51:59,092 --> 00:52:01,357
and they must get rid of that first.

929
00:52:01,561 --> 00:52:02,926
Okay.

930
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,296

931
00:52:20,851 --> 00:52:23,247
(Creation Party, Lee Jin Woo)

932
00:52:26,322 --> 00:52:28,187
Young Jae. Come to the roof.

933
00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:29,616
I'm heading up right now.

934
00:52:31,962 --> 00:52:33,687
What? Are you serious?

935
00:52:34,962 --> 00:52:37,997
Of course, I'm serious. Would I say this if I wasn't?

936
00:52:38,132 --> 00:52:41,066
I understand that you're saying this because you feel pressured,

937
00:52:41,431 --> 00:52:42,641
but this isn't the time.

938
00:52:42,641 --> 00:52:45,442
The former president, the current president,

939
00:52:45,442 --> 00:52:47,112
their presidential candidate,

940
00:52:47,112 --> 00:52:49,041
and their campaign chairman are all connected to this case.

941
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,681
If that goes out, the entire nation will be filled with chaos.

942
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:53,052
If you create that atmosphere before the elections,

943
00:52:53,052 --> 00:52:55,077
- the public opinion won't be quiet. - I know.

944
00:52:55,451 --> 00:52:57,851
I know which is why I suggested it. That's why I want to do it.

945
00:52:57,851 --> 00:52:58,851
What?

946
00:52:58,851 --> 00:53:00,291
If we release this and things go well,

947
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:02,457
we could even get Kim Young Ju to resign.

948
00:53:02,492 --> 00:53:05,156
Even if that doesn't happen, the game will be changed...

949
00:53:05,161 --> 00:53:07,732
because the trust in everyone connected will fall to the ground.

950
00:53:07,732 --> 00:53:09,661
There's isn't a better card than this right now.

951
00:53:09,661 --> 00:53:12,296
I kept getting kicked around when I held all the cards.

952
00:53:12,701 --> 00:53:14,072
Even still. Don't do it.

953
00:53:14,072 --> 00:53:17,497
If you release that now to win the election...

954
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:19,807
Then do you want to lose like this?

955
00:53:19,971 --> 00:53:21,672
Do you want to lose everything due to Kim Young Ju and Kim Sung Guk...

956
00:53:21,672 --> 00:53:23,512
unifying their campaigns when we've gotten this far?

957
00:53:23,512 --> 00:53:25,946
I know full well what kind of situation we're in right now.

958
00:53:26,282 --> 00:53:27,506
But...

959
00:53:27,612 --> 00:53:30,822
Jin Woo, don't you think it's wrong to use the case connected to...

960
00:53:30,822 --> 00:53:32,687
Geun Woo's death in this fashion?

961
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:35,822
If it gets involved with politics, the truth doesn't matter anymore.

962
00:53:35,822 --> 00:53:37,422
From that moment, there will be no right or wrong,

963
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,486
and it'll just become a political mudslinging fight.

964
00:53:39,891 --> 00:53:41,032
This isn't right.

965
00:53:41,032 --> 00:53:43,201
Even if we lose, let's lose in a good fashion.

966
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:44,926
Aren't you sick of losing in good fashion?

967
00:53:45,232 --> 00:53:47,997
We've always lost in good fashion since our days at Times.

968
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:50,001
What did we end up with after losing in a good fashion?

969
00:53:50,001 --> 00:53:51,371
All we ended up with was debt.

970
00:53:51,371 --> 00:53:53,072
- Jin Woo. - Stop calling my name.

971
00:53:53,072 --> 00:53:54,866
You always act so clean at times like this.

972
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:56,882
If you're so clean...

973
00:53:56,882 --> 00:53:58,911
If you didn't want to work with someone as dirty as me,

974
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,251
you should've stayed at Times with Soo Kyung.

975
00:54:00,251 --> 00:54:01,712
- Why did you follow me out? - What?

976
00:54:01,712 --> 00:54:04,021
Let's be honest. You followed me out because you wanted to succeed.

977
00:54:04,021 --> 00:54:06,391
- That's not true. - Of course, it is true.

978
00:54:06,391 --> 00:54:07,721
You wanted to get into politics,

979
00:54:07,721 --> 00:54:09,492
succeed, and meet a good woman.

980
00:54:09,492 --> 00:54:11,291
Isn't that why you left Soo Kyung and followed me out?

981
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:13,327
It was because I was afraid you'd die!

982
00:54:14,592 --> 00:54:16,497
Because I was afraid you'd die!

983
00:54:19,001 --> 00:54:20,931
I was afraid you'd end up dead if I wasn't by your side.

984
00:54:20,931 --> 00:54:22,497
That's why I followed you out.

985
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:24,497
Are you satisfied?

986
00:54:25,072 --> 00:54:27,942
Honestly speaking, Soo Kyung can live without me.

987
00:54:27,942 --> 00:54:30,041
She will do whatever she needs to survive.

988
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:31,337
But you...

989
00:54:33,811 --> 00:54:35,207
Forget it.

990
00:54:35,382 --> 00:54:38,282
My gosh. What's the point of saying all this now?

991
00:54:38,282 --> 00:54:39,951
Anyway, don't do that.

992
00:54:39,951 --> 00:54:42,192
If you play that card, I'm leaving.

993
00:54:42,192 --> 00:54:43,691
I don't care if that gets you killed.

994
00:54:43,692 --> 00:54:44,816
Suit yourself.

995
00:54:45,732 --> 00:54:48,331
- Then, leave. - You...

996
00:54:48,331 --> 00:54:51,101
Whether I die or not, I'll still pay you. Get lost.

997
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:52,672
Jin Woo, why did you become like this?

998
00:54:52,672 --> 00:54:54,601
If you're going to leave, leave without saying such things!

999
00:54:54,601 --> 00:54:55,966
I'll still pay you.

1000
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:18,316

1001
00:55:21,962 --> 00:55:25,156
I lost an item there in 2015.

1002
00:55:25,501 --> 00:55:27,497
Could you share the footage with me?

1003
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:42,977

1004
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:50,017

00:59:41,251 --> 00:59:43,957
to tell the truth.

1057
00:59:44,161 --> 00:59:46,787
You must take responsibility for your mistakes yourselves.

1058
00:59:46,962 --> 00:59:48,732
That's how you show respect to our people.

1059
00:59:48,732 --> 00:59:50,501
And those who do not show respect...

1060
00:59:50,501 --> 00:59:53,572
do not deserve your positions!

1061
00:59:53,572 --> 00:59:55,827
That jerk, Lee Jin Woo.

1062
00:59:58,402 --> 01:00:00,066
("Presidential Candidate Lee Reveals CEO Park's Ledger")

1063
01:00:23,532 --> 01:00:25,727
(Times)

1064
01:00:25,931 --> 01:00:27,931
I need you to get involved now.

1065
01:00:27,931 --> 01:00:30,172
Let's get rid of these headaches now.

1066
01:00:30,172 --> 01:00:32,667
Don't forget what I know.

1067
01:00:32,672 --> 01:00:35,011
From now on, I'll do it on my own.

1068
01:00:35,012 --> 01:00:36,236
Becoming the President, I mean.

1069
01:00:36,482 --> 01:00:38,641
It's time to tell the truth and put an end to this.

1070
01:00:38,641 --> 01:00:39,652
I cannot do that.

1071
01:00:39,652 --> 01:00:41,351
This is about Aide Lee Geun Woo's death.

1072
01:00:41,351 --> 01:00:42,707
I'll kill you!

1073
01:00:43,052 --> 01:00:45,021
We cannot change the past,

1074
01:00:45,021 --> 01:00:47,316
but we can make the right decision in the present.

1075
01:00:47,391 --> 01:00:50,187
What can I do now? I've come too far.

1076
01:00:51,391 --> 01:00:54,026
Did you kill him? Did you do it?
