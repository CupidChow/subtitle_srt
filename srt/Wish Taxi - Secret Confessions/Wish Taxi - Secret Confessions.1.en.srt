00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,416
Cheers!

2
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:26,041
You guys want to go to a
room salon? It's been awhile.

3
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:30,500
A room salon?
Get out of here.

4
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,083
Let's go get massage instead.

5
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:41,500
We need to use what we
got regularly to keep in shape.

6
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,375
Am I right?

7
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,666
I'm down. We should do
it as much as possible.

8
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,750
Let's go!

9
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,750
I'm down but who's paying?

10
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,458
You bastard.

11
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:03,333
What do you mean?
Everyone pays for their own shit.

12
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:11,666
Don't you know what dutch pay it?
It's too much for one person to pay for it.

13
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:17,791
They could at least offer knowing
my situation. Cheap bastards.

14
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:22,291
This is going to be fun.

15
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:30,458
The office is calling me.
They need me right away.

16
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:37,541
I'll catch you guys later. I don't want to get
fired. Let's do this again some other time.

17
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,250
- I'll see you later.
- Where you going?

18
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,708
Let's go inside.

19
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,666
I was almost there.

20
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,583
Yes sir.

21
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:49,291
Come here now. We got a
VIP customer and clean the cab.

22
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll fly right over as
soon as I clean the cab.

23
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,666
You think your Superman?
Just step on the gas and get here quick.

24
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:02,791
Ok I'll step on the gas and be there...

25
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,958
What kind of person just cuts me
off like that?! No manners...

26
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,916
He always hangs up first.
Would it kill you to say goodbye.

27
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,416
That's why your still a bouncer.

28
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:37,000
[Secret Confession]

29
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,041
Tonight is our night.

30
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:00,750
We're going to go far far away.

31
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,041
- After you.
- You first.

32
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:28,541
You're killing me you know that.

33
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,333
Sir where to?

34
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:38,541
Let's have a long hot night.

35
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:44,291
- Sir?
- Take me to the hotel.

36
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:58,083
Just a little bit more...

37
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:06,750
Just... a little... bit... more...

38
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,583
What are you doing? Let's go.

39
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,250
Yes sir.

40
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,666
It was good.

41
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:53,250
Friend? Who's friend?
The one with the pretty legs?

42
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,791
- Who?
- Don't you remember?

43
00:06:55,458 --> 00:07:00,583
Are you an idiot?

44
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,708
What is this?

45
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Huh?

46
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,291
What is it?

47
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,166
Trash belongs in the trash can.

48
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,750
Ah yes the trash...

49
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,666
Do you know her?

50
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:34,208
Lee Jieun the prettiest girl in
our school. You don't know her?

51
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,833
Every guy wants to talk to her.

52
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,916
But she's not my style. She's too fierce.

53
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,458
It's not very attractive.

54
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,208
Hey man let's go.

55
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,458
Jieun...

56
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,166
Lee Jieun.

57
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,375
Do you have a lot of money?

58
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:22,291
My in-laws own Jeena hotel.

59
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:28,750
The Arum department store is
mine so I'm pretty comfortable.

60
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,000
Jeena Hotel.

61
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:39,791
The restaurant there is famous.
You must be happy you're so rich.

62
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:47,958
I guess that was the
reason you're so handsome.

63
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,416
I am?

64
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:54,000
You should've seen me
when I was younger.

65
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,666
This is why I like you so much.

66
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:08,458
They say just because your poor
doesn't mean your dreams have to be.

67
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,583
Bullshit.

68
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:18,000
When you're born into poverty it's
like you're born with a curse.

69
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:23,500
You wouldn't understand. Right?

70
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:31,333
It doesn't matter. I'm giving
up on this cursed life.

71
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:40,083
Screw it. You don't
have to pay me tonight.

72
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,041
My body would go to
waste when I die anyway.

73
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:49,458
If anything I can give
you more money.

74
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:56,708
But you have to stay with
me longer than usual.

75
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:04,041
The night is pretty short just like life.

76
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:09,083
My Jieun sounds like a poet.

77
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:18,000
A poet? I'll write you a poem
with my body just wait.

78
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,541
Baby come here.

79
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,333
Come here.

80
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,458
Take me to Shilimdong.

81
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,166
- Huh?
- Shilimdong.

82
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,708
Yes. Okay.

83
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:28,208
Mister can you pass by the
Han river? I'll pay you extra.

84
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,958
How could she remember
we never even spoke.

85
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,125
Excuse me?

86
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:42,083
It's nothing. You said Han River?

87
00:12:56,916 --> 00:13:02,666
Mister the Han River scares me.

88
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,166
The Han River?

89
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,291
A lot of people have died there.

90
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:17,500
I wonder how many souls
are trapped there unable to rest.

91
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,458
I get these thoughts.

92
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:30,250
If I fell into the river right now
how cold would the water be?

93
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,625
Would I die from cardiac arrest?

94
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:37,083
If you want to die
let me know anytime.

95
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,291
Pardon?

96
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:50,291
Honestly, I plan on dying soon too.

97
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,541
Really?

98
00:13:55,458 --> 00:14:02,375
Why kill yourself trying to live?
I want to decide when and how I die.

99
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:08,291
Choosing when and how I die...

100
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:15,375
Are you part of a suicide club?

101
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,541
Suicide club?

102
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:26,291
Yes I am part of a suicide club.

103
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,583
Here you are mister.

104
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,041
Can I get your cellphone?

105
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:07,875
I'm giving you my number
because of your honesty.

106
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:14,625
I want to be part of the club to. Honest.

107
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,791
Contact me when you have a meeting.

108
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:34,041
Is there really such a
weird club like a suicide club?

109
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:43,041
Wait this could is an opportunity.

110
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,291
I should start by making a suicide club.

111
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,833
So pretty.

112
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,500
Suicide... Die...

113
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,291
Suicide well...

114
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:13,750
How to... good suicide...

115
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,958
Okay.

116
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:21,958
You choose when and how

117
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:29,625
you want to spend your
last moments and before you

118
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:36,125
die we will fulfill your three final wishes.

119
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,791
To those wanting to commit suicide.

120
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:48,833
I wish you happy memories.

121
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,125
Great!

122
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:30,166
Tomorrow the Well-being Die
club meets at 10PM.

123
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,625
Hello friend.

124
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,125
Is it just you and me?

125
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:16,291
She should be coming soon.

126
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,041
Got room for one more?

127
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:40,041
This isn't going to
be an easy discussion.

128
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:44,208
Friends wait here.

129
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,958
Cheers!

130
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,291
This is great!

131
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:31,208
Hello are you here for the
Well-being Die club meeting?

132
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,208
Have a seat.

133
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,250
Would you like a beer?

134
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,958
Okay you don't have to drink.

135
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Here.

136
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,333
Have this instead.

137
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:21,708
As you can see I'm
a male and in my 30's.

138
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,875
I'm a taxi driver...

139
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:35,958
That was a pretty pathetic introduction.
So boring. Watch and learn.

140
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,791
Hello friends.
I'm so happy to meet you all.

141
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:49,083
As you can see I'm the youngest
but age doesn't matter when we die.

142
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,291
So please don't pity me too much.

143
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,750
Hello I'm Lee Jieun.

144
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:08,166
I'm in my 30s and make really good cocktails.

145
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:17,041
This is awkward for me but we have the
same goal so I think we can connect easily.

146
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:23,041
Let's be good friends
with the time we have left.

147
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,916
Can you at least tell us your name?

148
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:39,083
I'm in my 30s and my name is Cho Hee.

149
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:46,583
Your voice sounds mysterious as well.

150
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,083
Cheers!

151
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,333
Why did you decide to join the club?

152
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:11,666
Love was a trap and the
guy was like a disease.

153
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:20,291
I fell in love with them but I guess
they never loved me back.

154
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:27,250
How could they treat me like such a fool.

155
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:33,416
So I want to live in a place
where there is no love.

156
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,625
Then I won't ever get hurt again.

157
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,708
What about you?

158
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:43,500
Me?

159
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,333
Money was the issue.

160
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:57,041
I was born poor and was told a
good education can get me out of it.

161
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:03,166
It wasn't a top college
but I got my degree.

162
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:08,875
But what's the point I
ended up with a lot of debt.

163
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:14,291
Time flew by so fast.

164
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:21,958
I couldn't get a job and decided to
work at a room salon to pay by debt.

165
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,833
But instead got into more
debt and was sold off.

166
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:35,125
Now I'm being sold off to some island.

167
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,333
What about you?

168
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:46,958
I have no reason to live.

169
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:53,916
I see...but no one here
has a reason to live.

170
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,708
What about you?

171
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:10,416
I made this club because I wanted to die.

172
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,916
I didn't like that I was living
because I couldn't die.

173
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:19,625
So why not choose the death I want.

174
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:30,958
Wait then what about our wishes?

175
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:32,708
Wish?

176
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:37,375
That's what it said on the website.

177
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:43,333
Before you die we will fulfill
each other's wishes.

178
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:50,208
We're going to die anyway so
whatever you want to try or do

179
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:53,416
just do it.

180
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,958
So like a bucket list?

181
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:02,833
I wanted to live a life of luxury.

182
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:09,458
People catering to me while having dinner in
a expensive hotel and buying designer items.

183
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:13,875
All you need is lots of money.

184
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:19,125
Should we rob a bank?

185
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:22,625
You want to be put in
handcuffs before we die?

186
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:24,583
I guess not.

187
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,208
What's your wish?

188
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:34,625
My wish is too have
lots of sex with girls.

189
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:43,041
That's not what I meant...

190
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:47,375
That's adorable.

191
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:53,041
You're in luck.

192
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:56,541
We're all girls here.

193
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,416
Our action begins!

194
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:01,500
- Hey friend!
- Yes friend.

195
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,791
- Where are we going?
- Check off our bucket list.

196
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:14,708
Whose bucket list?

197
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:17,583
You'll find out when we get there.

198
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:22,125
Mine?

199
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:27,208
We will fulfill all of your wishes
today. You can trust me ladies!

200
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:40,458
If everything goes well it'll only be a matter
of time before I get to do it with Jieun.

201
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,250
This way.

202
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:35,125
It's so expensive.

203
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,666
What's the most popular dish?

204
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:49,750
I recommend our chef's
special course menu.

205
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:54,958
You won't regret it.

206
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:57,625
Today's special...

207
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:58,833
What do you say?

208
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:03,000
Okay. It doesn't matter to me.

209
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:08,250
- We'll have the special.
- Yes sir.

210
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:41,000
He's waiting outside.

211
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:50,083
Excuse me for a moment.

212
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:01,500
Hey mister!

213
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,583
Can I help you?

214
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:09,125
- Can you take a picture?
- Of course.

215
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:27,208
One two three.

216
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:04,750
The rumor is that this
hotel belongs to your in laws.

217
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:10,125
Forget the small talk what do you want.

218
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:13,666
You think like a business man.

219
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:16,583
Like the CEO of Arum Department store.

220
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:19,583
Get to the point.

221
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:22,125
Alright.

222
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:27,875
You have an image to uphold
so I won't mention prostitution

223
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:31,208
since it might irritate you a bit.

224
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,208
How much?

225
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:41,875
I plan on having dinner
at the hotel restaurant today.

226
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:46,583
I want you to cover our bill.

227
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,208
That's all.

228
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:51,791
Thanks for dinner.

229
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:56,541
This mean we won't
ever meet again right?

230
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:06,416
Since this is the last time we meet...

231
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:15,750
I want a credit card so
I can do some shopping.

232
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:21,000
I'll get rid of the card
as soon as I'm done.

233
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:24,708
You can trust me.

234
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,208
If I feel it's too excessive
I'm going to report it stolen.

235
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:42,333
- I'll leave it to you.
- I wish you good fortune.

236
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:56,583
He seems to be pretty
calm so let's not worry.

237
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:16,875
Who paid the for the meal?

238
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:19,750
The gentlemen paid for it.

239
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:22,250
For real?

240
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,958
Tell us the truth what happened?

241
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:32,458
I'm capable to do anything.

242
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:37,333
You don't look like your
from an wealthy family.

243
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:40,041
Or look all that prestigious.

244
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:43,166
Or are you hiding
something in the cab?

245
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:46,333
This is just the beginning.

246
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:50,416
- Really?
- That's not necessary.

247
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:56,416
Toss your negative thoughts to Andromeda.

248
00:34:56,666 --> 00:35:04,458
Follow my lead and enjoy
your bucket list adventure.

249
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:19,500
You two stay and rest here.

250
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:25,208
- Only you two are going?
- Of course.

251
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:28,208
This is her bucket list.

252
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:33,000
Unless you want this
to be your bucket list.

253
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,333
Not really but we can
at least go window shop.

254
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:43,333
- Let's just all go together.
- No then it won't be your bucket list.

255
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:48,750
- You can't go.
- I didn't want to go anyway.

256
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,875
Let's go get some dessert.

257
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:00,125
Shall we?

258
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,875
It's so pretty.

259
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:01,791
This one.

260
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:12,125
Please consult with
me first from now on.

261
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:15,291
I'm sorry.

262
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:23,083
How would you like to pay for it?

263
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,041
Put it on this credit card.

264
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:33,875
- All of these items?
- Yes all of them.

265
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:39,833
- Right ma'am?
- Okay. Please wait.

266
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:45,291
We can stop by other shop
if you wish ma'am.

267
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:53,041
Are you happy?

268
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:56,708
I'm pretty well satisfied.

269
00:37:57,791 --> 00:38:01,625
I feel satisfied just
looking at them.

270
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:04,458
How much did everything
cost? In the thousands?

271
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:09,083
It looks expensive but it really wasn't much.

272
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:14,750
Your saying this isn't expensive?
Are you made of diamonds?

273
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,916
Where are your diamonds?

274
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:20,958
They're right here
can you see it?

275
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:22,500
I don't see it.

276
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,250
Getting catered to feels
like work. I'm exhausted.

277
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:32,375
Except for one person.

278
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:36,958
You're right. I'm super
energetic and can last for days.

279
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:40,333
Where we going to next?

280
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:44,500
Shouldn't we get some rest?

281
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:49,333
I want to wash up and
have a cold beer.

282
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,000
How does that sound?

283
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,708
- That's not a problem.
- You came prepared!

284
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:02,458
You're quite resourceful.

285
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:05,541
Ladies get in.

286
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,375
I want to do it with
her in a nice place.

287
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:39,583
It's so nice here.

288
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,875
- The air is fresh.
- Come this way.

289
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,041
Unload your luggage.

290
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:19,458
Get some rest. Let's go.

291
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:53,750
Girl's rooms are...

292
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:58,708
Let's go have dinner.

293
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,750
Inman!

294
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:30,125
Let's go.

295
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:44,458
Meat more meat!

296
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:53,375
Okay. In a minute you'll try
Inman's famous barbecue.

297
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:58,833
This is pretty bad.

298
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:07,208
- Are you okay?
- Yes I'm alright.

299
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:11,750
Here some meat. One.. two...

300
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,291
How could he... do this to me...?

301
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:26,125
He used to chase after me.

302
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:32,333
He said he wanted to move
in together and get married.

303
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:38,958
So I moved in with him.
Do you know what he said?

304
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:44,375
He said he's going to
find a girl better than me

305
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:49,250
and get married.

306
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,875
He threw me away
like some old shoe.

307
00:42:55,583 --> 00:43:02,958
If he ends up happy what
happens to me? What about me?

308
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:14,500
The mistake that I made was loving him.

309
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:19,500
Why am I always the
one that ends up hurting?

310
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:29,041
I feel fine.

311
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:37,458
I'm okay I just need to slow down.

312
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:40,291
I'm okay. I'm okay.

313
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:57,041
She's way too drunk. She's a buzzkill.

314
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:03,500
Let's call it a night.

315
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:16,541
Go inside. The guy is
supposed to do these things.

316
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:26,791
Thank you mister. I mean Inman.

317
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,250
I'm not mister anymore?

318
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:05,000
It's time for your bucket list.

319
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:17,000
Finally it's happening!
It's been such a long time.

320
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,541
I'm going to give it to you tonight!

321
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,208
She's so hot.

322
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:07,333
No this is not happening!

323
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:17,750
Want to go drink some more?

324
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:28,500
Leaving already?

325
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:33,458
That wasn't the real thing.

326
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:39,250
Can we try it again?

327
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:44,958
That wasn't my fault. It was yours.

328
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:50,583
But still... c'mon...

329
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:55,500
If you want another drink
come out if not get some rest.

330
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:01,625
Wait for me.

331
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:10,958
I usually have high tolerance.
I'll just sleep for one minute.

332
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:32,375
Don't be like that. We should have
take some time and go slower.

333
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:39,500
I'm so upset. How about we go
inside Jieun and try it again?

334
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:43,333
Let's have a drink.

335
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:48,583
Okay I'm coming.

336
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:51,416
Fine. Whatever I give up.

337
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:03,250
Drink this and let's...

338
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:13,666
Let's drink this then go...

339
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:19,750
Cheers.

340
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:23,791
There are so many stars.

341
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:28,541
There's what? Oh that?

342
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:32,000
Can you even see straight?

343
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:35,875
Of course.

344
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:39,625
So lets...

345
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:45,166
You're going to regret like before.

346
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:47,166
I won't regret it.

347
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:54,500
I wasn't ready earlier. Are you
disregarding my bucket list?

348
00:52:55,666 --> 00:53:01,916
- You said you wouldn't talk about it!
- Okay I won't say anything.

349
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:03,500
Really?

350
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:07,333
Then...

351
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:13,958
But today was the
end of your bucket list.

352
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:21,583
I'm going to turn in. Goodnight.

353
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:26,208
Fine! Goodnight!

354
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:33,166
It's cold I should get some clothes.

355
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:49,541
Cho-hee!

356
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:00,833
Cho-hee! Cho-hee!

357
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:03,708
Cho-hee!

358
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:11,416
Cho-hee! Cho-hee!

359
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:23,541
Why did you do this? We're
supposed to do it together.

360
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,833
Are you okay?

361
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:35,833
Try to get up.

362
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:48,791
That's not even my car.

363
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:54,625
How could you do this?
Do you want me to get into trouble?

364
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:09,625
Here take it. It means a lot to you.

365
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:20,500
I'll clean this up so just
go inside and get some rest.

366
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:31,916
That was a close call.

367
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:35,791
What's up with her?

368
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:48,416
Ouch that's hot.

369
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:52,541
Did you have a good night Inman?

370
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:57,625
Thanks to you I had a goodnight.

371
00:55:57,916 --> 00:56:01,333
What's with you two?

372
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:05,166
Did you two spend
the night together?

373
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:06,833
Spend the night?

374
00:56:08,416 --> 00:56:10,916
I guess so...

375
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:15,791
Then why the face?

376
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:23,083
You're to young to understand it.

377
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:32,083
Why are you talking like that?

378
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:38,416
Did you sleep okay?

379
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,166
Get in.

380
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:14,125
Who's next?

381
00:57:15,416 --> 00:57:19,250
Can we listen to my wish?

382
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,958
Here comes the bride.

383
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:20,583
What the? How?!

384
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:31,125
- What are your doing?
- You said you would marry me!

385
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:35,541
- Are you insane?!
- Let go of me!

386
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:06,333
Did you see his face?

387
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:10,666
Of course!
You were so awesome!

388
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:14,166
How did you think
of kicking him there?

389
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:16,875
I got so pissed when I saw him.

390
00:59:16,875 --> 00:59:21,916
Don't be hurt again
over a scumbag like him.

391
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:26,125
I was never hurt by a guy like him.

392
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:30,125
Doesn't matter now just
don't be hurt again in the future.

393
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:39,625
- Wait a sec...
- What is it?

394
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:44,083
- What about the bride?
- Oh her?

395
00:59:44,083 --> 00:59:45,166
Why?

396
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:47,625
What are you doing?

397
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:51,125
You said you would marry me!

398
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:52,333
Babe!

399
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:56,291
Babe!

400
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:04,916
My dress!

401
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:15,750
Are you okay?

402
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:32,791
This is so fun!

403
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:40,000
Faster faster!

404
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:46,125
When her bucket list is over

405
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:51,708
I'm next and I will overcome
that embarrassing moment.

406
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:57,125
And then... wait I'm not crazy
enough to die with them.

407
01:00:57,416 --> 01:01:00,750
I need to leave quietly.

408
01:01:16,458 --> 01:01:21,708
Can you pullover
over there I'm thirsty.

409
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:46,541
What's taking so
long to buy water?

410
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:49,708
Go start the car.

411
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:51,375
What?

412
01:01:52,416 --> 01:01:54,000
Run!

413
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:13,541
Was it that fun?

414
01:02:15,875 --> 01:02:20,250
But what happens if we get caught?

415
01:02:20,833 --> 01:02:27,291
Does it matter? We're going to die
anyway there's not much they can do.

416
01:02:27,291 --> 01:02:31,916
The police have better things
to do than come after us.

417
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:36,708
We'll just pay it back
if we do get caught.

418
01:02:36,708 --> 01:02:43,333
You've really got guts Jieun.
What do you want to eat?

419
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:52,750
It was just for fun. How
did we end up here?

420
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:57,541
I guess the police have
nothing better to do.

421
01:02:57,541 --> 01:03:02,250
Who gets brought into the
police station for stealing snacks?

422
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:14,291
Why would you do such a bad thing?
You don't look like the type.

423
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:21,916
We were just playing around
and forgot to go back and pay.

424
01:03:21,916 --> 01:03:24,875
- I'm really sorry so..
- What?!

425
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:30,083
So you stole from me for fun?

426
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:34,125
We didn't even steal
much just a few things.

427
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:35,875
What a weirdo.

428
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:44,375
A weirdo? Are you serious?
Do you want to be thrown into jail?

429
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:47,708
We will pay you back .

430
01:03:47,708 --> 01:03:50,750
- I beg you.
- Let go of me.

431
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:55,833
I don't even want to speak to
you. Officer thrown them in jail.

432
01:03:55,833 --> 01:04:00,416
Miss watch your attitude
this happened because of you.

433
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:03,000
How do you plan on settling.

434
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,416
He was being out of line and

435
01:04:07,416 --> 01:04:12,791
wasn't accepting our apology or settlement.

436
01:04:12,791 --> 01:04:16,708
If he plans on throwing us into jail

437
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:20,166
why did he come here and start it.

438
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:26,791
Are we free to go if we
settle with him amicably?

439
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:33,833
Well it since it started as a
joke and it wasn't intentional...

440
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:37,875
I suggest you settle with him first.

441
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:49,291
I would like to deeply apologize
for the trouble we caused you.

442
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:50,541
Whatever!

443
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:55,833
Please settle with us. We will
give you whatever amount you want.

444
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:58,291
Please.

445
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:02,875
Let us know how much you want.

446
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:12,041
I agree to settle with you
because you apologized sincerely.

447
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:18,125
Then I'll come up with a
figure and contact you soon.

448
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:20,000
Thank you.

449
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,541
Let's go.

450
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:25,791
Have a nice day.

451
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:31,250
We'll be going too officer.

452
01:05:32,541 --> 01:05:34,958
- Let's go.
- Everyone stop.

453
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:42,625
Where do you think your going?
Come back and have a seat.

454
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:49,416
We've settled everything
amicably with the owner.

455
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:51,541
You just saw it!

456
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:55,958
There's another matter.
Someone filed a lawsuit.

457
01:05:55,958 --> 01:06:01,041
- What?! A lawsuit?
- Who sued us?

458
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:05,083
Lee Juno filed a lawsuit.

459
01:06:05,083 --> 01:06:09,000
Lee Juno? It's not me!

460
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:13,833
I've been looking for you guys!

461
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:17,833
Did you think I was
going to let you off easy?

462
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:20,541
What are you doing here?

463
01:06:20,541 --> 01:06:23,583
He's Lee Juno.

464
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:25,708
What?!

465
01:06:26,958 --> 01:06:31,666
What you going to do?
We're in the police station!

466
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:33,625
Talk to me.

467
01:06:34,625 --> 01:06:37,041
Do you know what you did?

468
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:41,125
You ruined our wedding
and held my fiance hostage.

469
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:46,958
Do you know what you did to me?

470
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:50,541
I should be the one
asking you that question!

471
01:06:50,541 --> 01:06:56,541
Shut up! I'm going to put
all of you bitches in jail!

472
01:06:57,708 --> 01:06:59,416
What!

473
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:08,500
What you going to kick me again?

474
01:07:09,833 --> 01:07:13,208
Are you trying to
turn me into a eunuch?

475
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,375
You must be an idiot.

476
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:17,291
What?!

477
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:23,541
This is the police station. It's
where they put away bad people.

478
01:07:23,541 --> 01:07:27,250
Didn't you con her into moving in
with you by saying you'll marry her?

479
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:31,666
She agreed to it. It was mutual!

480
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:36,041
You can get arrested for obtaining
sex under false pretenses of marriage.

481
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:39,500
Get arrested for what?

482
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:46,208
She can sue you too if she wanted to!
When will you get your shit together and learn?

483
01:07:46,625 --> 01:07:50,500
If you don't want to do
time drop the charges.

484
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:58,750
That law is no longer in effect.

485
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:02,500
Really?

486
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:08,541
You don't know shit.

487
01:08:08,541 --> 01:08:12,125
You're all going to regret this.

488
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:15,166
I'm going to take you all out!

489
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:22,291
But you can get
arrested for conning Hyeri.

490
01:08:22,916 --> 01:08:27,583
Are you saying I'm a con artist?

491
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:36,875
Now what are you going to do?
Should we all go to jail together?

492
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:43,833
This is a police station. Settle down.

493
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:49,791
You are all are making
spectacle of yourselves.

494
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:52,500
So what do you plan on doing?

495
01:08:52,791 --> 01:08:58,333
It was just an argument between
acquaintances. No need to file a lawsuit.

496
01:08:59,083 --> 01:09:00,375
Am I right?

497
01:09:04,333 --> 01:09:07,458
Get out!

498
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,541
What a day. I'm so exhausted.

499
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:34,250
Where shall we go?

500
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:38,333
I want to go somewhere
to relax my body.

501
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:40,333
Me too! Let's go.

502
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:46,208
Okay let's go!

503
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:16,041
Did you have fun while I was
alone in the men's section?

504
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:23,125
Hey guys, I have my
own my bucket list too.

505
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:27,458
- Bucket list?
- Yes.

506
01:10:27,458 --> 01:10:30,166
What is it?

507
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:35,708
I want all of us to go on vacation.

508
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:39,541
- A vacation?
- Yes.

509
01:10:39,541 --> 01:10:44,083
That's not too hard.
Let's go right now.

510
01:10:44,083 --> 01:10:47,458
Where do you want to go?

511
01:10:48,125 --> 01:10:55,000
Instead of the crowded beach I want
to go somewhere isolated by the river.

512
01:10:55,458 --> 01:10:59,000
- The river?
- I know a place.

513
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:01,583
You do?

514
01:11:01,583 --> 01:11:05,791
I do but it's been awhile
since I've been there.

515
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:12,541
Let's go there. Since it's
been awhile so let's go.

516
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:15,583
Are you okay with it?

517
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:36,541
Shouldn't they ask about my bucket
list after all I've done for them.

518
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:40,333
They are just too much
How could they?!

519
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:44,375
Inman let's stop and rest.

520
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:47,083
Are you tired?

521
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:49,666
Yeah sort of.

522
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:55,083
How bout over there?

523
01:11:57,083 --> 01:12:02,708
Alright this is my opportunity.

524
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:05,375
If I straight up ask for
it they will think I'm a sleaze.

525
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:08,583
Either way this is my chance.

526
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:33,083
I want to add something to my list.

527
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:39,166
I will listen to your
wish tonight. Let's go.

528
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:44,833
- Me?
- Yes.

529
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:46,916
With me? Really?

530
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:51,000
Wasn't it your wish to sleep with girls?

531
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,833
You helped me with my bucket
list so I'm returning the favor.

532
01:12:56,833 --> 01:13:01,375
This is nothing compared
to what you did for me.

533
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:04,583
Let's go inside. Quickly.

534
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:08,166
Let's go.

535
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:09,458
Have fun.

536
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:16,416
This isn't what I had in mind...
Just wanted to rest... Good night!

537
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:19,666
Coming?

538
01:13:21,208 --> 01:13:24,041
I'm going to bed.

539
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:29,000
Doors are unlocked. Did you have...

540
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,583
It's okay. It happens to everyone.

541
01:16:32,583 --> 01:16:34,541
It happened again?

542
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:40,500
I didn't think it could happen again.

543
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:46,833
Happen again? It wasn't your first time?

544
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:49,750
Say something?

545
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:53,625
It's from lack of experience... whatever..

546
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:56,041
It's not like I
committed a crime?

547
01:16:56,041 --> 01:16:58,375
Don't get angry with
me for your mistake.

548
01:16:58,375 --> 01:17:03,458
A mistake? I'm angry at you?
I thought you would be nicer.

549
01:17:11,416 --> 01:17:14,000
Can you stop laughing?

550
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,458
I'm sorry Inman.

551
01:17:16,458 --> 01:17:19,000
This is all part of a process
of becoming an adult.

552
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,333
You're too much!

553
01:17:23,083 --> 01:17:26,875
Is this why you wanted
to sleep with so many girls?

554
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:33,291
You always had to
use your hand right?

555
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:36,583
No I didn't!

556
01:17:36,583 --> 01:17:42,583
It's nothing to be embarrassed
about what else could you use?

557
01:17:42,583 --> 01:17:45,666
Everyone does it.

558
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:49,250
Stop teasing me!

559
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:43,875
What a tiring day.

560
01:19:48,208 --> 01:19:49,666
Let's go.

561
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:52,250
I...

562
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:57,458
- Have a bucket list.
- Right now?

563
01:19:58,333 --> 01:20:01,541
- Yes.
- Why?

564
01:20:01,541 --> 01:20:03,000
What is it?

565
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:06,125
My bucket list is...

566
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:10,666
To sleep with Inman.

567
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,041
Wow...Cho Hee.

568
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:17,541
Are you serious?

569
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:20,791
With me?

570
01:20:21,916 --> 01:20:26,666
I thought I could get
used to being lonely.

571
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:34,000
Once you get used to it
you lose the reason to live.

572
01:20:35,166 --> 01:20:43,791
That's why I wanted to die
but instead I met all of you.

573
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:49,333
But I still felt lonely.

574
01:20:50,333 --> 01:20:55,875
I didn't like that I
felt like an outsider.

575
01:20:56,500 --> 01:21:03,291
I want to be a part
of this group and share.

576
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:08,208
I understand how you feel.

577
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:14,750
It's going to take more than will
power to do that. Will you be okay?

578
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:19,583
As long as with Inman I'm okay.

579
01:21:22,541 --> 01:21:24,125
Really?

580
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:29,625
Even though it's me?

581
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:35,458
Because it's you it's possible.

582
01:21:35,958 --> 01:21:42,791
You're the only one that
truly cares about us.

583
01:25:57,208 --> 01:26:01,291
I lost my chance to escape again.

584
01:26:02,041 --> 01:26:05,291
Now I really don't have
a chance to escape.

585
01:26:08,375 --> 01:26:13,250
Is she better now?

586
01:26:21,375 --> 01:26:24,083
I...think...we...

587
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:27,000
I want to use my last wish.

588
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,125
What is it?

589
01:26:32,375 --> 01:26:38,916
Since we're going to die I think we
should have a day or two to ourselves.

590
01:26:38,916 --> 01:26:41,500
For two days?

591
01:26:42,291 --> 01:26:48,125
I think it's a great idea
to have some time alone.

592
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:49,666
See you later.

593
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:53,833
Trunk please.

594
01:26:57,375 --> 01:26:59,166
See you later.

595
01:27:11,875 --> 01:27:15,458
I have nowhere to go.

596
01:27:15,458 --> 01:27:20,916
I'll just stay around here.

597
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:34,291
I like women and being with
them but I don't want to die here.

598
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:37,208
This is my last chance.

599
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:18,458
These items were never used.

600
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:19,666
I can't give you more.

601
01:28:19,666 --> 01:28:21,208
Mister...

602
01:28:55,208 --> 01:28:58,208
Where are you Jieun?

603
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:00,625
Why do you need money?

604
01:29:00,625 --> 01:29:04,541
The loan sharks are looking for you.

605
01:29:04,541 --> 01:29:05,750
What?!

606
01:29:07,166 --> 01:29:10,708
Why did you do such a thing?

607
01:29:11,416 --> 01:29:17,333
Even though you have no good parents
I could have given you the money.

608
01:29:17,708 --> 01:29:19,708
That's bullshit.

609
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:23,041
I decided to sell our property.

610
01:29:23,333 --> 01:29:24,125
What?!

611
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:27,041
We're not profiting
from it anyway.

612
01:29:27,041 --> 01:29:30,416
Why did you sell it?

613
01:29:30,416 --> 01:29:33,833
They told me you were
being sold to an island!

614
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:38,458
I wanted to prevent you
from doing something stupid.

615
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:42,333
- Mom!
- It's all settled.

616
01:29:42,875 --> 01:29:47,916
So don't get any
bad thoughts okay?

617
01:29:48,666 --> 01:29:50,208
Jieun!

618
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:51,416
Jieun!

619
01:29:57,333 --> 01:30:00,208
Mom... I'm sorry.

620
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:04,000
I'm sorry mom.

621
01:30:22,041 --> 01:30:23,833
Was I too harsh?

622
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:32,208
This will be the last time I
see his face and meet with him.

623
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:44,041
Hey babe!

624
01:30:44,041 --> 01:30:45,916
Are you tired?

625
01:30:45,916 --> 01:30:49,791
- I'm hungry.
- What do want to eat?

626
01:30:50,041 --> 01:30:52,791
How about bibimbap?

627
01:30:52,791 --> 01:30:54,791
Let's get something better.

628
01:30:58,083 --> 01:30:59,916
I must be crazy.

629
01:31:00,916 --> 01:31:06,666
Crying and drinking
over that asshole.

630
01:31:08,125 --> 01:31:13,583
Even thinking about
dying... how could I?

631
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:17,875
Over that asshole?!

632
01:31:24,666 --> 01:31:26,166
Jieun...

633
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:31,833
I wish you were here.

634
01:31:32,541 --> 01:31:36,541
I miss you so much.

635
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:39,541
Bastard.

636
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:55,583
Are you well?

637
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,750
I'm sorry I cheated on you.

638
01:32:03,083 --> 01:32:07,500
Do you hate me?

639
01:32:09,291 --> 01:32:15,166
But I really wanted to be
a part of the group.

640
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:23,458
I felt guilty for being
alive and wanted to die.

641
01:32:24,625 --> 01:32:29,541
But after meeting them
I felt like I could breathe.

642
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:33,583
I could eat well and sleep well.

643
01:32:35,541 --> 01:32:40,791
I'm alive because of them.

644
01:32:41,916 --> 01:32:46,875
But please don't forgive me.

645
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,708
If you forgive me it
will make me a bad person.

646
01:32:57,875 --> 01:33:05,666
I didn't know that you would also
be in pain leaving me alone here.

647
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:11,416
I thought I was the
only one hurt and in pain.

648
01:33:13,041 --> 01:33:20,708
I learned through them that
other people were hurting as well.

649
01:33:23,166 --> 01:33:30,166
Just wait for me just a
little bit longer dear.

650
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:34,416
I'll see you soon.

651
01:33:36,166 --> 01:33:42,000
So just be patient
and wait for me.

652
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:51,250
I'll let you cheat on
me once while you wait.

653
01:33:53,583 --> 01:33:58,916
Just like I did. You must have
been so lonely without me.

654
01:34:02,333 --> 01:34:03,916
I'm sorry.

655
01:34:14,833 --> 01:34:20,625
I should have never met
with them. What was I thinking?

656
01:34:22,666 --> 01:34:30,250
I was going to leave them from
the start so just go through with it!

657
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:39,750
I'm a moron.
I can't do this or that.

658
01:34:50,416 --> 01:34:53,375
I have no where to go.

659
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:58,291
I can't even run away.

660
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:18,333
I don't have any place to
go so I'll be around here.

661
01:35:19,166 --> 01:35:23,875
Is she really around here?

662
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:17,375
Why didn't you answer?

663
01:36:18,125 --> 01:36:23,666
- It was fascinating.
- How so?

664
01:36:24,291 --> 01:36:30,458
That someone was thinking
about me, looking for me.

665
01:36:31,291 --> 01:36:38,041
That someone called me.

666
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,625
But I thought we were
meeting tomorrow?

667
01:36:47,625 --> 01:36:52,208
I have no where to go either.

668
01:36:53,416 --> 01:36:59,750
I just realized that now. Actually I
might have just ignored that fact.

669
01:37:04,375 --> 01:37:10,333
I was feeling lonely
and thought of you.

670
01:37:11,708 --> 01:37:16,416
That if you would be
lonely just like I am.

671
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:22,916
You're a warm person Inman.

672
01:37:26,208 --> 01:37:27,583
I am?

673
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:35,166
You don't know me very well.

674
01:37:36,041 --> 01:37:37,875
I'm trash.

675
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:45,708
There's no such thing. Trash
is something that is useless.

676
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:51,250
But in this world
everything can be of use.

677
01:37:54,125 --> 01:37:58,291
You really think so?

678
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:06,833
The truth is I didn't want to die.

679
01:38:08,083 --> 01:38:16,833
I have no money but I
wanted to do it with girls.

680
01:38:18,083 --> 01:38:21,375
So I created this club.

681
01:38:24,458 --> 01:38:31,375
See I am a piece of trash. I was
taking advantage of all of you.

682
01:38:34,125 --> 01:38:39,750
Whatever the reason you were
being true to us every minute.

683
01:38:40,125 --> 01:38:48,875
You did your best to
fulfill all of our wishes.

684
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,250
You really think that?

685
01:39:12,125 --> 01:39:17,541
We still have time.
Want to go somewhere?

686
01:39:19,791 --> 01:39:24,541
I want to go back to the place
where we went on vacation.

687
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:31,208
You want to go back there? Okay.

688
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:58,958
You sleep well?

689
01:40:58,958 --> 01:41:02,375
How long was I asleep?

690
01:41:03,541 --> 01:41:07,791
I had to make sure you
were breathing a couple of time.

691
01:41:11,083 --> 01:41:14,000
I haven't slept that well in awhile.

692
01:41:14,916 --> 01:41:19,208
Without any dreams and for that long.

693
01:41:22,125 --> 01:41:26,791
I wonder what the others are doing.

694
01:41:27,125 --> 01:41:31,000
It feels like you're the one that's dying.

695
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:43,750
- Let's spray daddy!
- I surrender!

696
01:42:03,875 --> 01:42:08,083
What a beautiful family.

697
01:42:26,958 --> 01:42:28,500
Hello Hyeri?

698
01:42:31,208 --> 01:42:36,500
It's going to me some
time to get back to Seoul.

699
01:43:16,458 --> 01:43:19,625
So is this it?

700
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,500
Do they really plan on dying?

701
01:44:24,166 --> 01:44:28,041
Shouldn't someone prevent
them? Say something?

702
01:44:28,875 --> 01:44:32,291
We might all regret it.

703
01:44:39,083 --> 01:44:43,583
Do we really have to die?

704
01:44:45,041 --> 01:44:49,000
What are you saying?

705
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:54,291
Really think about it.

706
01:44:54,875 --> 01:45:01,125
We were able to fulfill all of our
wishes thinking it was out last day.

707
01:45:01,416 --> 01:45:05,458
We're able to accomplish
anything as long as we're alive.

708
01:45:05,458 --> 01:45:11,625
We're here because of you.
Your the one that made this club.

709
01:45:11,916 --> 01:45:16,125
And you don't want to die?
Are you kidding me?

710
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:25,916
You were the one that's
making us confused!

711
01:45:26,416 --> 01:45:28,125
Why are you doing this?

712
01:45:28,125 --> 01:45:33,291
I changed my mind after
spending time with you all.

713
01:45:35,833 --> 01:45:40,750
Is it just me? I know
you feel the same way!

714
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:46,458
Forget you! Your the same as everyone
else and only think about yourself.

715
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:51,291
Why are you backing out now?

716
01:45:53,250 --> 01:46:00,875
Why are you now trying
to change our minds? Why?

717
01:46:01,083 --> 01:46:05,166
I'm not the one trying to convince you.

718
01:46:05,166 --> 01:46:09,708
You thought you had a reason to die
but now you found a reason to live.

719
01:46:28,916 --> 01:46:33,250
I should have just died.

720
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:37,708
This is so irritating. Ouch!

721
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:42,625
Are you in a lot of pain?

722
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:48,291
I'm telling you the truth boss.
Come see for yourself.

723
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:51,708
I'll work overtime so please...

724
01:46:51,708 --> 01:46:54,875
Hello? Boss? Hello?

725
01:46:59,833 --> 01:47:01,583
Can you hear me?

726
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:05,833
If you can hear me
move your finger.

727
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:09,041
I didn't die.

728
01:47:09,791 --> 01:47:15,208
It's a miracle. We were worried
because you were in a coma.

729
01:47:15,666 --> 01:47:18,875
I should also let you know.

730
01:47:20,125 --> 01:47:24,416
You're pregnant. Congratulations.

731
01:47:24,916 --> 01:47:31,333
The mother and baby are
both well which is a miracle.

732
01:47:32,208 --> 01:47:35,875
Did you say I'm pregnant?

733
01:47:35,875 --> 01:47:38,875
Yes. Congratulations.

734
01:48:04,625 --> 01:48:05,833
Mom!

735
01:48:09,708 --> 01:48:11,166
Mom!

736
01:48:12,125 --> 01:48:13,833
Did you eat?

737
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:16,833
Yes I did.

738
01:48:18,458 --> 01:48:20,333
Are you okay?

739
01:48:20,833 --> 01:48:23,416
I'm okay.

740
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:27,250
Mom!

741
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:31,291
I'm nothing without you.

742
01:48:32,041 --> 01:48:37,541
I would be devastated if
something happened to you.

743
01:48:39,375 --> 01:48:43,333
I know mom... I know.

744
01:48:43,333 --> 01:48:48,000
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry.

745
01:48:52,416 --> 01:49:00,291
My precious daughter... you
must have been through so much.

746
01:49:01,416 --> 01:49:07,833
I'm sorry I couldn't provide you with more,
at least as much as everyone else.

747
01:49:08,333 --> 01:49:12,791
I'm sorry I'm an embarrassment.

748
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:18,791
I'm so sorry I'm your mother.

749
01:49:19,583 --> 01:49:21,500
I'm really sorry.

750
01:49:21,916 --> 01:49:25,666
Mom I'm sorry.

751
01:49:25,666 --> 01:49:32,458
It's all my fault so please don't cry.

752
01:49:33,583 --> 01:49:38,291
Okay.. okay.. please don't cry baby.

753
01:49:39,916 --> 01:49:44,833
Don't cry you'll ruin your pretty face.

754
01:49:46,458 --> 01:49:49,291
Don't cry okay?

755
01:49:52,166 --> 01:49:53,958
Mom!

756
01:49:57,166 --> 01:49:58,791
Mom...

757
01:51:03,916 --> 01:51:10,250
I have one last thing on my bucket list.

758
01:51:18,625 --> 01:51:22,750
I want to live with my baby.

759
01:51:26,333 --> 01:51:30,375
I wanted to die because I was lonely.

760
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:37,875
But now I have to take care of another being.

761
01:51:39,041 --> 01:51:47,083
I would feel terrible if this child
were to die without ever being loved.

762
01:51:49,541 --> 01:51:56,958
And I want all of to live together.

763
01:51:56,958 --> 01:52:00,125
That is my last bucket list.

764
01:52:05,250 --> 01:52:06,750
Yes!

765
01:52:14,916 --> 01:52:21,625
I don't really agree but since it's your wish...

766
01:52:22,125 --> 01:52:24,833
I guess I have to fulfill it.

767
01:52:25,958 --> 01:52:32,208
As long as it's with Jieun I'm happy.

768
01:52:53,416 --> 01:52:56,916
- Yes boss?
- You're fired!

769
01:52:57,416 --> 01:52:58,333
What?

770
01:53:07,541 --> 01:53:10,125
Goodbye!

771
01:53:42,958 --> 01:53:44,708
Welcome.

772
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:01,083
Not again. Stop
staring at her breasts.

773
01:54:01,083 --> 01:54:04,625
But they're so big...

774
01:54:04,625 --> 01:54:12,416
What do want to eat?
Pizza? Hamburger? Tonkatsu?

775
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:17,625
What are you doing? Hurry up!

776
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,250
You're useless.

777
01:54:21,541 --> 01:54:26,958
Always picking on me. Wait up!

778
01:54:40,875 --> 01:54:43,000
Where are you?

779
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,041
Right here!

780
01:54:48,625 --> 01:54:53,791
I'm so hungry. Cook us some
steak. Don't burn it this time!

781
01:54:59,958 --> 01:55:01,250
Hurry up!

782
01:55:01,250 --> 01:55:06,666
What am I servant? Cooking
and cleaning all the time.

783
01:55:09,291 --> 01:55:10,916
What's taking so long?

784
01:55:11,166 --> 01:55:12,375
Okay...

785
01:55:15,166 --> 01:55:17,500
I have to cook again...
