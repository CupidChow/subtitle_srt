(solely based on the fate plaque with birth date and time.)

7
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:54,089
(One day before their first encounter)

8
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:28,188
My divine spirit was about to come,

9
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:31,359
so I tried to compose myself and stay calm.

10
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:32,998
And clear my head.

11
00:02:34,558 --> 00:02:36,829
I tried to see the things that weren't visible to the eye.

12
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:41,768
(Blue Chicken, White Dog, Black Monkey,)

13
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:43,038
(Red Rabbit, and Black Horse)

14
00:03:13,938 --> 00:03:15,807
(Blue Chicken, White Dog, Black Monkey,)

15
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:17,669
(Red Rabbit, and Black Horse)

16
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:26,478
The spirit was possessing my body...

17
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:28,949
to bring me the sensation.

18
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:41,528
(Blue Chicken, May 4, 1993)

19
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:51,139
I whistle when I call for my divine spirit.

20
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:55,408
I go, "Please take a look at this person."

21
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:11,489
There was one person that my spirit showed me,

22
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:14,997
and she was petite and cute.

23
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:18,669
I felt she had a strong sense of divine and spiritual power.

24
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,769
(Black Monkey)

25
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:42,528
(Red Rabbit, December 2, 1995)

26
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:57,139
(Black Horse, April 21, 1995)

27
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,608
I could sense that the White Dog had a complicated mind.

28
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:07,379
It looked like she couldn't make decisions right away.

29
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:09,718
But I'm humanly interested in her.

30
00:05:10,488 --> 00:05:13,218
The White Dog and the Black Monkey.

31
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,389
I was most intrigued by those two.

32
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:34,237
(Black Monkey)

33
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:36,348
I try to feel the person while asking my spirit,

34
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:38,048
and my body starts to shiver.

35
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:39,449
It trembles.

36
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:41,718
I tried finding the one that gave me a bigger reaction.

37
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:48,788
(Black Monkey)

38
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:02,439
(White Dog, Black Monkey)

39
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,987
- It's like watching "Exhuma." - It's like the movie...

40
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:19,089
Right?

41
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:21,259
What was that?

42
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:23,759
I got goosebumps.

43
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:26,428
- He actually whistles.
- I just got chills.

44
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:29,797
- He's handsome.
- He's good-looking, though.

45
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:31,598
- He is.
- He's tall too.

46
00:06:32,228 --> 00:06:34,199
- I'm interested.
- Me too.

47
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:39,908
(Black Monkey)

48
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:44,178
While I was feeling it,

49
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:48,249
the one that gave me a bigger reaction was...

50
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:50,019
the Black Monkey.

51
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:54,259
(He chose the Black Monkey.)

52
00:06:54,918 --> 00:07:00,499
(Shaman, Jang Ho Am)

53
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:02,597
(Comedian, Shin Dong Yeob)

54
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:04,028
Mr. Jang Ho Am.

55
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:07,069
I thought, "He's cool, and he's good-looking,"

56
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:10,037
but that terrified me.

57
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:11,238
- Did it?
- Yes.

58
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:13,439
When you look at someone's face,

59
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:16,048
- you often feel their vibe or aura.
- Yes.

60
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:19,448
His face is fair-skinned, and his lips are thick and red.

61
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:22,617
Judging from his facial features,

62
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:24,487
I feel a strong sense of the Peach Blossom Fate,

63
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:26,389
which is a fate of popularity, that he needs to release.

64
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,787
I felt that too.

65
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:29,328
I think he has the Peach Blossom Fate.

66
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:30,888
Well, say that before he does.

67
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,657
Don't go, "I felt that too,"

68
00:07:32,658 --> 00:07:35,297
- after the expert explains it.
- I should have said it first.

69
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:36,527
I'll do that from now on.

70
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:38,028
(She got caught being a know-it-all.)

71
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:40,338
I wish I could see him fall in love soon...

72
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:41,967
and smile brightly.

73
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:45,108
Yes, I wonder what he looks like when he's smiling brightly.

74
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:46,439
So do I.

75
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:57,787
It feels like moving on to a new chapter...

76
00:07:57,788 --> 00:08:00,118
before an important matter.

77
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:17,368
I'm nervous.

78
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,178
I keep feeling this good sensation...

79
00:08:21,238 --> 00:08:23,608
bubbling up.

80
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,749
It makes my heart race.

81
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:30,718
But it felt strange.

82
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:33,787
(White Chicken, Blue Chicken, and Gold Dragon)

83
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:38,459
(The fate plaques of the 5 men)

84
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,298
I thought, "That's a lot."

85
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,129
"Yes!"

86
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:45,428
I was glad.

87
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:48,438
And I reckoned...

88
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:51,409
that their ages varied.

89
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:54,079
I was also glad about that.

90
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:56,648
I couldn't hide my smile.

91
00:09:04,488 --> 00:09:11,059
(Astrologer, Kim Yun Jeong)

92
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:12,858
- "Astrologer!" - "Astrologer."

93
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,997
- Astrology is super fun.
- That's a first.

94
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:16,799
- Like the zodiac signs.
- Zodiac signs?

95
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:19,237
Astrology is the Western version of saju,

96
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:21,868
- which uses the constellation.
- Western saju.

97
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:25,339
It believes that one's destiny is determined...

98
00:09:25,468 --> 00:09:27,178
by the arrangement of planets and stars...

99
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:28,877
based on the date, time, and place of birth.

100
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:30,579
- Using the constellation.
- Yes.

101
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:33,279
Astrology is so fun.

102
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:39,518
I had a quick scan of their sun coordinates.

103
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:42,988
Then, I looked for the moon signs.

104
00:09:57,738 --> 00:09:59,208
(Gold Dragon, August 20, 1992)

105
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:01,579
The Gold Dragon.

106
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:04,878
He was the one that I've been looking for.

107
00:10:05,378 --> 00:10:06,878
A Leo.

108
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:09,888
I thought, "It's a Leo that I've been looking for."

109
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:11,789
"He's here."

110
00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:15,618
So, I was glad and surprised at the same time.

111
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:19,857
Most people are familiar...

112
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:21,757
with the zodiac signs,

113
00:10:21,758 --> 00:10:24,628
but what matters more is the ascendant, rising signs.

114
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:29,438
(Gold Dragon)

115
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:31,137
And his ascendant was a Scorpio.

116
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:33,478
Scorpio is the symbol of seductive men.

117
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:37,107
I was like, "What's with him?"

118
00:10:37,108 --> 00:10:38,779
"How does he have everything?"

119
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:46,419
Aries and Virgo.

120
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:49,388
Taurus and Capricorn.

121
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:52,799
Taurus and Pisces. I got those three.

122
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:54,897
I liked the last one.

123
00:10:54,898 --> 00:10:57,268
The Pisces felt like mine.

124
00:10:57,398 --> 00:10:59,267
I like daydreaming,

125
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:02,439
and I spend a lot of time imagining things.

126
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:05,367
He's someone who can bring me back to earth...

127
00:11:05,368 --> 00:11:07,309
and emphasize with me.

128
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:10,877
He's able to lead me back to realistic topics.

129
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,878
I liked that as well. It helps me feel stable.

130
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:19,617
I thought, "Let's get to know each other."

131
00:11:19,618 --> 00:11:22,588
I was preoccupied with the thought, "I wonder who he is."

132
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:23,659
"Who would it be?"

133
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:30,829

(Shaman, Lee Gang Won)

136
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:55,789
My spirit was adamant.

137
00:11:56,228 --> 00:11:59,398
We almost got into a fight.

138
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:04,829
Before I'm a shaman, I'm a human.

139
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:07,439
Please give me someone I want.

140
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:11,168
I want a fiery woman.

141
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:14,279
Someone funny and honest.

142
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:16,348
A big eater.

143
00:12:19,978 --> 00:12:22,448
(Shaman, Jung Hyeon U)

144
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:26,357
I asked my spirit to tell me who will be...

145
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:27,617
compatible with me.

146
00:12:27,618 --> 00:12:29,559
She showed me through sensations.

147
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,929
It wasn't exactly a tough decision.

148
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:38,829
We had different opinions.

149
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:41,839
The one my grandma spirit picked for me...

150
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:44,338
and the one I wanted.

151
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,209
We had different opinions,

152
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:51,378
so I told her that I'd choose someone I wanted this time.

153
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,289
I thought it might be fun to spend time with her.

154
00:12:57,718 --> 00:12:58,918
I have a feeling...

155
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,659
she's someone who smells good.

156
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:06,029
(Shaman, Lee Ra Yun)

157
00:13:09,868 --> 00:13:10,998
What?

158
00:13:15,398 --> 00:13:16,539
Seriously?

159
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,968
You can't be serious.

160
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,847
My spirit told me it was the Monkey,

161
00:13:23,848 --> 00:13:26,518
and I was like, "What? Are you serious?"

162
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,518
"Why?"

163
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:32,448
I had never been in love with men who were born...

164
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:34,319
in the Year of the Monkey.

165
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:38,258
Why the White Monkey?

166
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,659
Why did it have to be the White Monkey?

167
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:47,968
To describe it in terms of taste,

168
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:50,209
malatang, which I like.

169
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:52,209
He's provocative.

(Saju reader, Hong Yu Ra)

171
00:13:56,108 --> 00:13:57,847
(Black Cow, October 10, 1991)

172
00:13:57,848 --> 00:14:01,679
I was drawn to the Black Cow.

173
00:14:02,018 --> 00:14:03,918
I compared our saju fortunes,

174
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,559
and we were incompatible. We're very different,

175
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:10,659
but I believe there will be some sparks between us.

176
00:14:10,728 --> 00:14:12,328
I thought, "Maybe I heard them wrong."

177
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:14,028
"I must be imagining things."

178
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:16,368
So, I asked them countless times, "Are you sure this will work?"

179
00:14:35,718 --> 00:14:36,818
Oh, my gosh.

180
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:40,218
(A parade of fortune readings by the 4 possessed participants)

181
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:43,628
(He's absolutely drained.)

00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:49,258
Whistling, folding fans, and bells.

183
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,528
We have a lot of shamans this time.

184
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:52,728
- Yes.
- Right.

185
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,898
Ra Yun seems fiery.

186
00:14:55,238 --> 00:14:56,908
Didn't someone say he wanted a fiery girl?

187
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:58,439
- Yes, I think it was Gang Won.
- Yes.

188
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:14,258
It was pretty much instinctive.

189
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:17,758
It felt like I had already known her.

190
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:20,758
I grabbed the plaque of the one my spirit picked for me.

191
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:28,768
(Jung Hyun U chooses the Blue Chicken.)

192
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:36,449
(Lee Gang Won chooses the Red Rabbit.)

193
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:42,779
(Hong Yu Ra chooses the Black Cow.)

194
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:52,757
(Lee Ra Yun chooses the White Monkey.)

195
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:55,128
My spirit kept talking about the Monkey.

196
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:59,737
I believed that my spirit was telling...

197
00:15:59,738 --> 00:16:02,699
the disciple for a reason.

198
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:05,138
There must be a reason.

199
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:06,878
There must be.

200
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:12,748
I'm in trouble.

201
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,348
What do I do?

202
00:16:16,848 --> 00:16:20,559
Ra Yun spent quite a while to make a decision.

203
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:24,458
It seemed that her choice differed from that of her spirit.

204
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:26,627
Yes. And I think she followed...

205
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:28,897
- her spirit's decision.
- She did.

206
00:16:28,898 --> 00:16:29,898
For the first time on our show,

207
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:33,538
we have a participant claiming to have fought his spirit.

208
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:37,607
Everyone but Gang Won followed their divine spirits.

209
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:39,908
But he decided to make his own decision this time.

210
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:40,909
Right.

211
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:42,778
That's new.

212
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:47,078
I thought that they were obliged to be obedient...

213
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:48,948
to their spirits.

214
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:53,017
This is my first time realizing that you can go against them.

215
00:16:53,018 --> 00:16:54,958
Gang Won seems like the type...

216
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,688
- He seems persistent.
- Yes.

217
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:57,929
He's fiery.

218
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:01,258
- They have such different charms.
- Indeed.

219
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:23,289
Let's see.

220
00:17:51,878 --> 00:17:54,848
(Startled)

221
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:05,089
I was startled.

222
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:07,628
I was scared.

223
00:18:07,928 --> 00:18:10,229
I think I'm the type to be drained.

224
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:14,069
Who will be your destined partner?

225
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:16,769
Please pick a fate plaque.

226
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:29,348
I have all the information.

227
00:18:29,648 --> 00:18:33,589
First, I read their saju...

228
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:36,289
and what fortunes they had at the moment.

229
00:18:37,928 --> 00:18:41,729
And I checked if any of them had the Red Charm Fate,

230
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:44,299
the Peach Blossom Fate,

231
00:18:44,628 --> 00:18:46,098
or the Wandering Fate.

232
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,178
(Saju reader, Ha Byeong Yeol)

233
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:08,089
(White Dog, November 4, 1997)

234
00:19:10,628 --> 00:19:13,829
(White Dog, November 4, 1997)

235
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:20,938
She seemed extraordinary.

236
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:23,868
I was so curious about the White Dog.

237
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:27,839
She had such a strong energy that she couldn't keep...

238
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:30,148
her original job.

239
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,049
Maybe she transitioned this year.

240
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:36,749
I definitely felt something from her.

241
00:19:37,618 --> 00:19:39,687
In that sense, I felt...

242
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:41,357
a sense of kinship,

243
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:42,758
and I was curious.

244
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:45,489
You could say that I was excited.

245
00:19:49,158 --> 00:19:50,668
(Sighing)

246
00:19:52,668 --> 00:19:56,168
(White Dog, November 4, 1997)

247
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:58,809
Oh, we're so incompatible.

248
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:08,878
She's scary.

249
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,719
"She's too strong." I got rid of it right away.

250
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:13,358
She scared me so much...

251
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:16,728
that I felt that we were incompatible.

252
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:19,529
After all, we're in an environment...

253
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:24,428
where we need to consider being in a romantic relationship.

254
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:28,698
I chose the Red Rabbit...

255
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,268
because she was filled with the Wood Energy...

256
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:32,638
and the Fire Energy.

257
00:20:32,938 --> 00:20:36,438
If there are energies that I lack,

258
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:39,309
I think she and I can compensate for them.

259
00:20:39,408 --> 00:20:42,117
This is a wild guess,

260
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:44,618
but I had a feeling that she'd be beautiful...

261
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:45,749
and tall.

262
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:56,799
(Ha Byeong Yeol chooses the Red Rabbit.)

263
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:26,927
Destiny is...

264
00:21:26,928 --> 00:21:28,658
a connection given by a higher power.

265
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,569
Something that no man can defy.

266
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:35,269
(Shaman, Chae Yu Gyeong)

267
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:38,309
When you try to keep it going only with your feelings,

268
00:21:39,438 --> 00:21:40,839
it's bound to come to an end.

269
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:44,249
But if you choose a destined partner chosen by a higher power,

270
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,579
there will be a new type of happiness.

271
00:21:51,918 --> 00:21:54,117
To be frank, I wasn't thinking about anything.

272
00:21:54,118 --> 00:21:57,657
But there was one plaque that caught my attention...

273
00:21:57,658 --> 00:21:58,989
as soon as I arrived.

274
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,667
I followed my heart with the other two.

275
00:22:03,668 --> 00:22:05,128
Someone who seemed fun...

276
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:07,898
and whom I'd like.

277
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:12,269
(Gold Dragon, White Monkey, and Black Cow)

278
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:21,819
(Gold Dragon, White Monkey, and Black Cow)

279
00:22:27,858 --> 00:22:30,259
The red flag is the Guardian of the Land,

280
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:33,428
and the yellow flag stands for the Great Divine Grandmother.

281
00:22:33,658 --> 00:22:36,529
My destined partner chosen by those two.

282
00:22:36,928 --> 00:22:39,598
And the one chosen by my divine spirit.

283
00:22:40,098 --> 00:22:41,299
That was the Gold Dragon.

284
00:22:41,698 --> 00:22:47,708
(Chae Yu Gyeong chooses the Gold Dragon.)

285
00:22:49,638 --> 00:22:52,779
(All fortune tellers have finished their pre-selections.)

286
00:22:54,348 --> 00:22:56,578
(Red Rabbit, Black Monkey,)

287
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:58,789
(Red Rabbit, and Blue Chicken)

288
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,657
(White Monkey, Gold Dragon,)

289
00:23:02,658 --> 00:23:04,729
(Gold Dragon, and Black Cow)

290
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:07,627
Oh, no.

291
00:23:07,628 --> 00:23:09,657
Two men and two women chose the same ones.

292
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:12,298
Right. There are popular ones...

293
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:13,539
even among the fate plaques.

294
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:17,207
Among men, it's the Gold Dragon. Among women, it's the Red Rabbit.

295
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,937
- They were chosen by two people.
- Right.

296
00:23:18,938 --> 00:23:21,838
I'm curious to find out if they'll recognize them instantly.

297
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,348
Do you remember back in Season One?

298
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:25,148
When they first gathered for the first time.

299
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:28,048
- That suffocating air.
- Exactly.

300
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:29,249
- Right.
- That mood.

301
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:31,887
The ones with powerful auras are gathering in one room.

302
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:34,917
The first encounter of the fortune tellers.

303
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:36,789
(Will they recognize their destined partners?)

304
00:23:37,388 --> 00:23:39,958
(This is the most entertaining part of the show!)

305
00:23:40,358 --> 00:23:42,529
(Excited)

306
00:23:43,098 --> 00:23:45,628
(The ridges of the Sobaek Mountains)

307
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:50,168
(The place that holds the energy of the Mudeungsan Mountain)

308
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:53,408
(Hwasun-gun, South Jeolla Province)

309
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:57,878
(Where there are good mountains and good waters)

310
00:23:58,178 --> 00:24:00,678
(In this region where there's even good energy,)

311
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:04,688
(the fortune tellers' romance blooms.)

312
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:18,498
Hello, I'm a shaman who's been practicing for nine months,

313
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:19,569
Jang Ho Am.

314
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:23,539
Ho stands for "broad," and Am stands for "rock."

315
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:25,208
A monk named me.

316
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,579
When my mother was pregnant with me,

317
00:24:27,908 --> 00:24:30,448
she must have gone to a fortune teller with someone.

318
00:24:32,908 --> 00:24:34,979
"You have a child who needs to be sold to the Dragon King,"

319
00:24:35,118 --> 00:24:36,378
was what he said to her.

320
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:39,489
I was born to be a man of religion,

321
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:41,457
so they tried to prevent that.

322
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:44,688
I heard that that was why they gave me this name.

323
00:24:45,188 --> 00:24:48,028
But when I started to serve in the military,

324
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,828
I experienced a severe case of self-loss.

325
00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:52,867
My great aunt performed a ritual to suppress my spiritual abilities.

326
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:54,167
She was asking for the divine spirit.

327
00:24:54,168 --> 00:24:56,097
But she suddenly collapsed in the middle of the ritual.

328
00:24:56,098 --> 00:24:58,339
Then she passed away on the spot.

329
00:24:59,368 --> 00:25:02,239
I believe that I was destined to become a shaman.

330
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:15,489
(He's the first one to enter the Possessed House.)

331
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:22,729
(He spots something.)

332
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:25,299
(Please take your name plaque.)

333
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:28,798
(Hong Yu Ra, Lee Gang Won, Ha Byeong Yeol, Kim Yun Jeong,)

334
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,069
(Jang Ho Am, Lee Ra Yun, Chae Yu Gyeong, Jung Hyeon U)

335
00:25:32,168 --> 00:25:35,979
(Chae Yu Gyeong, Lee Ra Yun, Jang Ho Am)

336
00:25:36,908 --> 00:25:40,479
(He grabs his name plaque.)

337
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:54,729
When I went upstairs, it was just me.

338
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:57,368
I realized that I was the first one to arrive.

339
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:06,938
(New connections will begin in the Possessed House.)

340
00:26:08,138 --> 00:26:09,708
(Hello)

341
00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:13,878
I felt a sense of magnificence in the house.

342
00:26:14,418 --> 00:26:17,117
It truly felt like as if I were in a place of prayer...

343
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,948
with a sense of purity.

344
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:21,887
(Rules of Possessed Love: Express your feelings truthfully...)

345
00:26:21,888 --> 00:26:23,558
(and look for your destined partner.)

346
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,289
(Your date of birth and saju will remain a secret.)

347
00:26:29,658 --> 00:26:32,769
I was just curious who would come in next.

348
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:36,698
I was focused before the next person entered.

349
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:01,998
Hello. I've been a shaman for two years.

350
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:03,428
My name is Chae Yu Gyeong.

351
00:27:03,598 --> 00:27:05,528
I'm a spiritualistic shaman.

352
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:08,367
I was handpicked by the divine spirit.

353
00:27:08,368 --> 00:27:11,469
It started when I was playing in the playground as a child.

354
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:14,809
There were faint figures I could see.

355
00:27:15,378 --> 00:27:16,878
I would talk to them.

356
00:27:17,608 --> 00:27:19,148
Or I saw things others didn't.

357
00:27:19,648 --> 00:27:21,278
I played house with them...

358
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,618
or built sandcastles.

359
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:25,418
Come to think of it,

360
00:27:25,618 --> 00:27:28,188
I must have had the abilities ever since I was a child.

361
00:27:29,118 --> 00:27:31,288
The abilities of a spiritual medium.

362
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:32,428
Of course, I have a goal.

363
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:34,358
Becoming a nationally recognized shaman.

364
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:38,628
I want to be a well-known shaman in Korea.

365
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:40,167
That's my goal...

366
00:27:40,168 --> 00:27:41,798
since I began on this path at a young age.

367
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:44,207
What do I want to do if I were to date...

368
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,339
another shaman?

369
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:49,638
I want to get a matching hanbok outfit.

370
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:51,448
That's it.

371
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:01,759
(Sensing a presence)

372
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:07,698
(Surprised)

373
00:28:14,668 --> 00:28:17,868
(He starts to get nervous now.)

374
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:20,509
(Swallowing hard)

375
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:33,226
Hello.

376
00:28:36,266 --> 00:28:38,006
- Hello.
- Hello.

377
00:28:44,776 --> 00:28:45,776
Look at them.

378
00:28:46,147 --> 00:28:49,916
(The first encounter of young shamans)

379
00:28:49,988 --> 00:28:51,046
I'm getting sweaty.

380
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:52,185
(Full of excitement)

381
00:28:52,186 --> 00:28:53,485
You know what?

382
00:28:53,486 --> 00:28:56,256
- How beautiful. Yes.
- I think they make a cute couple.

383
00:28:56,516 --> 00:28:58,327
- They give off similar vibes.
- Right.

384
00:29:06,627 --> 00:29:08,936
When Yu Gyeong first walked in,

385
00:29:09,397 --> 00:29:10,907
I thought she was pretty.

386
00:29:13,236 --> 00:29:16,005
I thought she was cute. That crossed my mind.

387
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:17,307
I thought he was handsome.

388
00:29:18,877 --> 00:29:20,107
"He's good-looking."

389
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,185
I didn't sense any bad energy from him.

390
00:29:24,186 --> 00:29:26,216
I didn't feel anything crazy.

391
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:29,617
I thought, "He seems nice. This is great. Neat."

392
00:29:29,956 --> 00:29:32,327
But I did think that he seemed quite young.

393
00:29:34,157 --> 00:29:37,465
I thought that she was 1 of the 2 people I was torn between.

394
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:39,466
And that made me smile.

395
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:41,796
You know, you become fixated on someone.

396
00:29:41,797 --> 00:29:44,266
I thought that she was the person I had in mind.

397
00:29:46,107 --> 00:29:47,807
He seemed calm and quiet.

398
00:29:48,006 --> 00:29:50,476
But once the waves start to lap,

399
00:29:50,907 --> 00:29:54,547
he will falter endlessly.

400
00:29:57,117 --> 00:29:59,046
Do you know where blankets are?

401
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,147
- Blankets?
- Yes.

402
00:30:01,186 --> 00:30:02,287
Blankets...

403
00:30:09,627 --> 00:30:10,726
Hold on.

404
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:13,326
He kept looking for them in his seat.

405
00:30:13,327 --> 00:30:15,536
(He only looked around for the blankets.)

406
00:30:15,537 --> 00:30:16,695
He should have made his move...

407
00:30:16,696 --> 00:30:17,867
- immediately. Right?
- "Blankets..."

408
00:30:18,807 --> 00:30:19,836
He should have gotten up...

409
00:30:19,837 --> 00:30:21,076
and said he would look for them.

410
00:30:21,077 --> 00:30:23,235
It would've been nice if he walked around the room.

411
00:30:23,236 --> 00:30:24,406
People like me would fall on purpose...

412
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:25,907
to make it look like we're trying hard.

413
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,975
(The middle-aged man makes a silly joke.)

414
00:30:28,976 --> 00:30:31,216
I went too far with that, didn't I?

415
00:30:31,617 --> 00:30:32,617
(Embarrassed)

416
00:30:32,618 --> 00:30:34,317
- Thanks for the tip.
- That's funny.

417
00:30:36,057 --> 00:30:37,057
(Looking around)

418
00:30:37,857 --> 00:30:38,857
(Looking around)

419
00:30:41,057 --> 00:30:42,696
I'll use this to cover my legs.

420
00:30:57,976 --> 00:31:04,347
(There's a sense of subtle energy between them.)

421
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:13,357
Hello.

422
00:31:13,486 --> 00:31:15,256
I've been a shaman for three years. My name is Lee Gang Won.

423
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:19,596
Everyone has a list of occupations they don't want to pursue.

424
00:31:19,597 --> 00:31:21,666
For me, a shaman was at the top of my list.

425
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:23,665
I was sick for over 20 years.

426
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:26,336
As I experienced self-loss for a long time,

427
00:31:26,337 --> 00:31:28,735
I started to become capable of sensing...

428
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:31,406
when there would be misfortune.

429
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:33,975
My mother kept telling me that she saw a woman...

430
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:37,117
in white mourning clothes ever since I was in the military.

431
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:40,246
She told me that once a week.

432
00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:43,186
Then...

433
00:31:46,226 --> 00:31:49,025
my maternal grandfather, my maternal uncle,

434
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:50,925
and my mother passed away in the same month...

435
00:31:50,926 --> 00:31:52,796
with the same cause of death.

436
00:31:52,797 --> 00:31:55,067
She went to them and said...

437
00:31:55,597 --> 00:31:57,266
"You won't accept me after all this?"

438
00:31:57,706 --> 00:31:59,936
I thought that I couldn't back out of this.

439
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:01,975
So I went to my divine spirit right away...

440
00:32:01,976 --> 00:32:03,637
and said I would do it.

441
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:11,486
Hello.

442
00:32:13,047 --> 00:32:14,216
- Hello.
- Hello.

443
00:32:17,557 --> 00:32:18,926
Hello.

444
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:29,297
(Sensing unusual energy)

445
00:32:33,236 --> 00:32:38,907
(The 3 zoomer shamans have met.)

446
00:32:41,547 --> 00:32:43,716
(Glancing)

447
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:47,087
"A shaman is here."

448
00:32:51,057 --> 00:32:52,156
How did she know?

449
00:32:52,157 --> 00:32:53,425
(She read his shamanistic energy at first glance.)

450
00:32:53,426 --> 00:32:54,827
- How did she figure it out?
- What? What was that?

451
00:32:58,827 --> 00:33:01,596
He looked over the space between me and Ho Am...

452
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:03,736
discreetly before he sat down.

453
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,136
When I saw him do that,

454
00:33:05,137 --> 00:33:06,607
I knew he was checking the atmosphere.

455
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:08,436
So I knew he was a shaman.

456
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,976
But he won't be able to read me easily.

457
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:15,117
I knew he was a shaman.

458
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:26,586
I had a dream the night before the first meeting.

459
00:33:27,057 --> 00:33:30,395
The divine spirit, my young lady, brought me a notebook with a name.

460
00:33:30,396 --> 00:33:33,125
She told me that there would be a male shaman whose last name...

461
00:33:33,126 --> 00:33:34,667
and the last syllable of his name would have an ieung.

462
00:33:35,437 --> 00:33:38,566
She said he and I wouldn't have a big age difference,

463
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:41,307
but he would look like a middle-aged man.

464
00:33:43,336 --> 00:33:44,746
What is that supposed to mean?

465
00:33:44,747 --> 00:33:47,816
Wait. Gang Won might get upset when he watches the show.

466
00:33:49,176 --> 00:33:50,485
Why are they trying to have the upper hand over one another?

467
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,946
Right. They're here to find love.

468
00:33:53,146 --> 00:33:54,716
- The three of them...
- Why the power struggle?

469
00:33:58,126 --> 00:34:00,727
But why are you two so quiet?

470
00:34:03,557 --> 00:34:05,727
What are your names?

471
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:07,266
My name is Jang Ho Am.

472
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:08,466
- Ho Am.
- Yes.

473
00:34:09,836 --> 00:34:11,667
My name is Chae Yu Gyeong.

474
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:13,976
- Come again?
- Chae Yu Gyeong.

475
00:34:13,977 --> 00:34:15,537
- Yu Gyeong?
- It's spelled "Chae."

476
00:34:18,646 --> 00:34:21,276
We had just met, so we couldn't make small talk.

477
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,316
It was awkward.

478
00:34:23,747 --> 00:34:26,316
It seemed they didn't want to reveal who they were.

479
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:29,086
They weren't talking, so I wondered who they were.

480
00:34:29,657 --> 00:34:31,057
That's how I felt.

481
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:36,497
(The silent power struggle begins.)

482
00:34:38,997 --> 00:34:42,336
(Whistling)

483
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:46,666
Hey. He's whistling.

484
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,207
- Why did he suddenly whistle?
- What? He's suddenly whistling.

485
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:52,006
He's basically screaming, "I'm a shaman."

486
00:34:52,276 --> 00:34:53,347
My gosh.

487
00:34:53,876 --> 00:34:55,017
He's something else.

488
00:34:59,387 --> 00:35:02,855
I've been studying saju for four years.

489
00:35:02,856 --> 00:35:05,926
I've been a saju counselor for a year. My name is Hong Yu Ra.

490
00:35:07,796 --> 00:35:11,097
It's been a year since great fortune came into my life.

491
00:35:11,396 --> 00:35:12,866
This fortune is favorable to marriage...

492
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:15,736
and will bring a lot of leads regarding my career.

493
00:35:16,896 --> 00:35:18,666
It's a dating app based on saju.

494
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:21,376
They were looking for a saju expert.

495
00:35:21,477 --> 00:35:24,247
So I signed a partnership contract with the company.

496
00:35:24,407 --> 00:35:26,605
I study the compatibility between the zodiac animals...

497
00:35:26,606 --> 00:35:29,616
of our clients and their dates...

498
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:32,985
and provide written insight about their compatibility...

499
00:35:32,986 --> 00:35:34,417
with my expert knowledge.

500
00:35:35,856 --> 00:35:40,727
(The 1st saju reader will join the 3 shamans.)

501
00:35:40,997 --> 00:35:42,097
We've got company.

502
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:44,426
(Shushing)

503
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:49,196
I'm getting nervous.

504
00:35:52,106 --> 00:35:53,667
I felt the same way when you came in.

505
00:35:54,537 --> 00:35:55,606
Is that so?

506
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:01,847
- Hello.
- Hello.

507
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:04,617
- Hello.
- Hello.

508
00:36:06,086 --> 00:36:07,856
- Hello.
- Hello.

509
00:36:09,157 --> 00:36:10,287
- Hello.
- Hello.

510
00:36:18,796 --> 00:36:20,597
(Feeling awkward)

511
00:36:22,637 --> 00:36:24,736
(Looking around)

512
00:36:26,566 --> 00:36:28,336
- You can cover your legs.
- Thank you.

513
00:36:32,606 --> 00:36:34,446
(Scowling)

514
00:36:38,247 --> 00:36:39,816
"What about the blanket I asked for?"

515
00:36:40,086 --> 00:36:41,255
She must have a lot of thoughts now.

516
00:36:41,256 --> 00:36:43,686
- Is he trying to make her jealous?
- Right.

517
00:36:43,687 --> 00:36:44,787
- What is this?
- My gosh.

518
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:55,997
It felt great.

519
00:36:56,367 --> 00:37:01,207
It felt like he was trying to soften the mood.

520
00:37:04,676 --> 00:37:06,446
I would like some water.

521
00:37:07,816 --> 00:37:08,876
Water...

522
00:37:10,676 --> 00:37:11,686
(Getting up)

523
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,347
Wouldn't we find it if we opened everything up one at a time?

524
00:37:23,557 --> 00:37:25,266
I have a water bottle I didn't finish.

525
00:37:25,267 --> 00:37:27,637
Thank you so much.

526
00:37:42,517 --> 00:37:44,746
Hello. I've been a shaman for two years.

527
00:37:44,747 --> 00:37:45,787
My name is Lee Ra Yun.

528
00:37:46,086 --> 00:37:48,016
When I became a shaman,

529
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:50,216
my friends weren't surprised by my decision.

530
00:37:50,827 --> 00:37:52,086
Only I didn't see it.

531
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:54,626
All of my dreams were spot on.

532
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:58,267
I also hear and see things.

533
00:37:58,566 --> 00:38:00,026
My connections to ancestral spirits are strong.

534
00:38:00,796 --> 00:38:03,037
I can see people's ancestral spirits.

535
00:38:03,236 --> 00:38:04,536
When I saw an ancestral spirit...

536
00:38:04,537 --> 00:38:07,936
Right. I have a funny story.

537
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:09,335
So many people are from the Jeonju Lee clan.

538
00:38:09,336 --> 00:38:11,406
Of everyone who claimed to be from the clan,

539
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:12,977
I saw only one person who was actually from the clan.

540
00:38:14,477 --> 00:38:15,746
I can see their ancestors.

541
00:38:15,747 --> 00:38:17,985
They all told me they came from noble families and so on.

542
00:38:17,986 --> 00:38:20,247
But when I saw their ancestors, they were all farming on the fields.

543
00:38:21,017 --> 00:38:22,617
I shouldn't say this.

544
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:25,656
But that's what I saw. What could I do?

545
00:38:25,657 --> 00:38:26,957
That's what I saw.

546
00:38:27,387 --> 00:38:29,097
Is anyone here from the Jeonju Lee clan?

547
00:38:31,327 --> 00:38:32,366
Oh, no.

548
00:38:32,367 --> 00:38:33,367
Really?

549
00:38:33,368 --> 00:38:36,037
(Checking the staff's ancestors)

550
00:38:36,236 --> 00:38:37,395
What? No.

551
00:38:37,396 --> 00:38:38,966
If I tell you, you might get upset.

552
00:38:46,006 --> 00:38:47,176
This is crazy.

553
00:38:51,046 --> 00:38:52,387
Seriously.

554
00:38:52,546 --> 00:38:54,017
- You heard that, right?
- Yes.

555
00:38:55,057 --> 00:38:56,187
- Someone is coming.
- Someone is coming.

556
00:38:56,457 --> 00:38:57,586
Really?

557
00:38:57,756 --> 00:38:59,256
I get nervous whenever someone is about to walk in.

558
00:39:04,767 --> 00:39:05,996
(The 4th shaman enters.)

559
00:39:05,997 --> 00:39:08,367
- Hello.
- Hello.

560
00:39:08,796 --> 00:39:09,966
Hello.

561
00:39:10,966 --> 00:39:12,335
- Hello.
- Hello.

562
00:39:12,336 --> 00:39:13,566
Hello.

563
00:39:17,276 --> 00:39:18,506
May I sit down?

564
00:39:25,517 --> 00:39:26,617
Everyone...

565
00:39:27,816 --> 00:39:29,286
We were bored.

566
00:39:29,287 --> 00:39:30,617
- Really? Why?
- Yes.

567
00:39:31,526 --> 00:39:33,227
Us? I'm not sure.

568
00:39:34,296 --> 00:39:36,896
Gang Won grabbed my attention first.

569
00:39:37,696 --> 00:39:39,566
As soon as I saw him, I knew it.

570
00:39:39,926 --> 00:39:41,267
"He's a shaman."

571
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:44,606
That crossed my mind.

572
00:39:45,707 --> 00:39:48,506
(She can only laugh at this unusual energy.)

573
00:39:48,977 --> 00:39:50,276
What's your name?

574
00:39:51,046 --> 00:39:53,246
My name is Lee Ra Yun.

575
00:39:53,247 --> 00:39:54,445
Which clan? The Jeonju Lee clan?

576
00:39:54,446 --> 00:39:55,716
- Pardon?
- The Jeonju Lee clan?

577
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,686
Oh, no. He asked her which clan her family was from.

578
00:39:59,687 --> 00:40:01,616
Nothing of this sort would happen...

579
00:40:01,617 --> 00:40:03,985
- on regular dating shows.
- Right.

580
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:05,686
- Yes.
- "Which clan? The Jeonju Lee clan?"

581
00:40:05,687 --> 00:40:07,286
(Aggressively asking about the family clan)

582
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:08,426
- "It's a secret." - My gosh.

583
00:40:08,696 --> 00:40:10,457
My gosh. It was...

584
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:13,597
- a subconscious thing for him.
- Right.

585
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:15,597
How entertaining. That's cute.

586
00:40:16,466 --> 00:40:17,806
Which clan? The Jeonju Lee clan?

587
00:40:17,807 --> 00:40:19,006
- Pardon?
- The Jeonju Lee clan?

588
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:20,835
- No, my family is from Hapcheon.
- Hapcheon.

589
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:21,907
Yes.

590
00:40:25,046 --> 00:40:26,407
Did it sound like I was scolding her?

591
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:29,077
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

592
00:40:29,577 --> 00:40:30,676
What's your name?

593
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:35,117
- Is your name Lee Gang Won?
- Yes.

594
00:40:35,787 --> 00:40:36,986
Is your family from the Jeonju Lee clan?

595
00:40:38,457 --> 00:40:39,557
It's a secret.

596
00:40:40,486 --> 00:40:41,597
It's a secret.

597
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:43,795
My family is from Gwangju.

598
00:40:43,796 --> 00:40:45,296
- Gwangju?
- Yes.

599
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:48,566
(Nicely played.)

600
00:40:49,696 --> 00:40:51,267
What's your MBTI?

601
00:40:51,466 --> 00:40:52,706
- It's...
- I bet you're an introvert.

602
00:40:52,707 --> 00:40:54,676
- Yes, I am. How did you know?
- I bet it's IN...

603
00:40:54,937 --> 00:40:56,736
- What?
- INFP?

604
00:40:57,776 --> 00:40:59,175
No. Hold on.

605
00:40:59,176 --> 00:41:02,077
(Trying to guess her MBTI after checking her family clan)

606
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:09,187
INF...

607
00:41:10,457 --> 00:41:11,526
Guess the next one.

608
00:41:14,256 --> 00:41:16,026
- P?
- No, I think it's J.

609
00:41:16,296 --> 00:41:17,926
- So you think it's INFJ?
- Yes.

610
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:20,497
Did I get it right?

611
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,097
How did you know?

612
00:41:22,497 --> 00:41:24,907
- How did you know?
- I got a feeling.

613
00:41:25,106 --> 00:41:27,207
(Dizzy)

614
00:41:27,676 --> 00:41:30,206
It's fascinating how you guessed all four of them correctly.

615
00:41:30,207 --> 00:41:32,046
Usually, people are off by 1 or 2.

616
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:34,977
Yours was the first one I got right. I got both of theirs wrong.

617
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:37,417
- Really?
- Yes. I...

618
00:41:49,796 --> 00:41:51,295
Hello. I've been studying saju for two years.

619
00:41:51,296 --> 00:41:52,566
My name is Ha Byeong Yeol.

620
00:41:54,396 --> 00:41:56,596
I believe I have the abilities to figure out...

621
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,836
people's Day Masters...

622
00:41:58,037 --> 00:41:59,505
just by looking at them...

623
00:41:59,506 --> 00:42:01,577
or having a short conversation with them.

624
00:42:01,876 --> 00:42:03,105
Their voices, the volume of their voices,

625
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:04,175
the way they talk, their style of conversation,

626
00:42:04,176 --> 00:42:05,246
and their choice of words.

627
00:42:05,247 --> 00:42:07,146
I consider all of these factors.

628
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:09,517
Based on that, I have built my own database per se.

629
00:42:09,716 --> 00:42:10,986
Is that so?

630
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,286
- So that's...
- Then...

631
00:42:13,287 --> 00:42:16,117
Can you guess from their faces if their energy is yin or yang?

632
00:42:16,316 --> 00:42:18,526
- I can guess, but I can't be sure.
- Can you guess mine?

633
00:42:19,687 --> 00:42:20,756
Two things come to my mind.

634
00:42:21,026 --> 00:42:22,256
Yin Water and Yin Fire.

635
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:24,626
- You're right.
- Yes.

636
00:42:24,966 --> 00:42:27,066
- I'm confident.
- I'm a Yin Fire.

637
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:28,366
That's fascinating.

638
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:29,666
Seriously. I'm sensing Yang Earth and Yang Fire.

639
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:30,736
I'm a Yang Fire.

640
00:42:31,106 --> 00:42:32,406
- You definitely have yang energy.
- Yes.

641
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:33,506
Yang Fire or Yang Metal.

642
00:42:34,577 --> 00:42:36,406
(He correctly guessed all of the staff members' Day Masters.)

643
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:38,006
- My gosh.
- Let's give it up for him.

644
00:42:38,546 --> 00:42:40,707
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

645
00:42:40,977 --> 00:42:43,146
- Goodness, he's so good.
- My gosh.

646
00:42:44,077 --> 00:42:45,215
- Really?
- My gosh.

647
00:42:45,216 --> 00:42:46,286
So this...

648
00:42:46,287 --> 00:42:47,386
- He's so gifted.
- Hold on.

649
00:42:47,387 --> 00:42:50,485
- Byeong Yeol is gifted.
- He could've gotten lucky.

650
00:42:50,486 --> 00:42:52,425
But I guess there's a certain energy he can sense.

651
00:42:52,426 --> 00:42:54,456
We can somewhat guess the Day Masters...

652
00:42:54,457 --> 00:42:56,326
by conversing with them, studying their faces,

653
00:42:56,327 --> 00:42:57,496
and observing how they talk.

654
00:42:57,497 --> 00:42:58,625
- My gosh.
- Goodness. Really?

655
00:42:58,626 --> 00:42:59,666
- Yes.
- I see.

656
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:03,637
- Then it wasn't pure luck.
- That's so fascinating.

657
00:43:04,296 --> 00:43:05,836
Doesn't that make him a psychic or something?

658
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,105
My gosh, that's amazing.

659
00:43:09,106 --> 00:43:10,707
(Psychic Byeong Yeol)

660
00:43:23,086 --> 00:43:24,486
(Putting away his shoes)

661
00:43:27,387 --> 00:43:29,596
(Thudding)

662
00:43:29,597 --> 00:43:31,996
(He enters powerfully.)

663
00:43:31,997 --> 00:43:33,497
I think he's angry.

664
00:43:34,097 --> 00:43:35,167
The sound of his footsteps...

665
00:43:37,637 --> 00:43:38,937
- Hello.
- Hello.

666
00:43:39,006 --> 00:43:40,006
Hello.

667
00:43:40,007 --> 00:43:41,536
- Hello.
- Hello.

668
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:42,537
- Hello.
- Hello.

669
00:43:43,506 --> 00:43:45,006
(Glancing over)

670
00:43:49,776 --> 00:43:51,076
What's your name?

671
00:43:51,077 --> 00:43:53,816
I'm Ha Byeong Yeol. Hello.

672
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:09,896
(The tension thickens.)

673
00:44:11,336 --> 00:44:12,867
(Sighing)

674
00:44:14,836 --> 00:44:16,006
My energy is getting drained.

675
00:44:19,207 --> 00:44:20,376
We didn't say much.

676
00:44:20,747 --> 00:44:22,876
You didn't say much, but my energy is getting drained.

677
00:44:23,446 --> 00:44:24,687
We didn't say much.

678
00:44:26,347 --> 00:44:27,387
His energy is getting drained.

679
00:44:31,457 --> 00:44:33,656
- It's understandable.
- Yes.

680
00:44:33,657 --> 00:44:35,096
I took a nap at home immediately after the shoot.

681
00:44:35,097 --> 00:44:36,097
Seriously.

682
00:44:36,098 --> 00:44:39,066
(They can feel a strong energy across the screen.)

683
00:44:39,497 --> 00:44:40,566
We need to replenish our energy.

684
00:44:42,566 --> 00:44:45,005
The energy is strong.

685
00:44:45,006 --> 00:44:46,136
I think those people gathered around...

686
00:44:46,137 --> 00:44:47,367
- for the show.
- That's right.

687
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:53,946
Among those people, I felt like my energy was getting drained.

688
00:44:54,376 --> 00:44:58,187
I adjusted to the atmosphere by myself.

689
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,886
- Really?
- I was torn between the two.

690
00:45:00,887 --> 00:45:02,287
Is this for us?

691
00:45:02,787 --> 00:45:03,787
I see.

692
00:45:04,787 --> 00:45:06,787
(He takes a bite of yakgwa.)

693
00:45:07,086 --> 00:45:08,157
Really?

694
00:45:13,097 --> 00:45:16,396
(He replenishes his blood sugar with sweet yakgwa.)

695
00:45:18,066 --> 00:45:19,106
Is it tasty?

696
00:45:19,367 --> 00:45:21,836
- Do you mean the water? This one?
- Not water.

697
00:45:22,006 --> 00:45:23,037
It's tasty.

698
00:45:23,876 --> 00:45:27,175
- I've been cutting down on sugar, - I see.

699
00:45:27,176 --> 00:45:28,276
but it's tasty.

700
00:45:29,917 --> 00:45:32,747
Usually, I can get a sense of someone.

701
00:45:33,347 --> 00:45:35,787
I was like, "Why can't I sense anything from him?"

702
00:45:36,117 --> 00:45:37,816
I found him fascinating.

703
00:45:40,126 --> 00:45:43,755
I couldn't sense anything from him, so I became curious.

704
00:45:43,756 --> 00:45:46,696
"Who is he? What does he have?"

705
00:45:47,727 --> 00:45:48,736
I'm curious about such things.

706
00:45:50,336 --> 00:45:53,836
(They're busy reading each other.)

707
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:02,276
Hello, my name is Jung Hyeon U. I've been a shaman for five months.

708
00:46:03,146 --> 00:46:06,446
My paternal grandma was a shaman.

709
00:46:07,316 --> 00:46:08,616
I've lived with her for 18 years.

710
00:46:08,617 --> 00:46:13,356
I've lived with her since birth until her death.

711
00:46:14,187 --> 00:46:16,057
I was 18 when she passed.

712
00:46:16,327 --> 00:46:17,997
When I realized...

713
00:46:18,796 --> 00:46:20,066
that it was my fate to be a shaman,

714
00:46:20,426 --> 00:46:22,896
my paternal grandma came as a divine spirit.

715
00:46:24,097 --> 00:46:27,666
I currently live in Haeinam in Mount Taebaek.

716
00:46:27,667 --> 00:46:29,577
One of its biggest characteristics is that...

717
00:46:29,776 --> 00:46:32,347
it is Korea's very first shrine for the local deity.

718
00:46:32,807 --> 00:46:35,617
It's a very good place for prayer.

719
00:46:36,876 --> 00:46:40,215
I've lived in Haeinam ever since I became a shaman.

720
00:46:40,216 --> 00:46:43,216
So it has been about five months.

721
00:46:44,086 --> 00:46:45,086
(A rookie shaman appears.)

722
00:46:45,087 --> 00:46:47,157
(He holds on to his name plaque.)

723
00:46:48,896 --> 00:46:51,666
These are the steps of a woman. Is it a man?

724
00:46:51,667 --> 00:46:53,026
(Expectant)

725
00:46:54,767 --> 00:46:56,166
- Hello.
- Hello.

726
00:46:56,167 --> 00:46:58,907
- Hello.
- It's a man.

727
00:47:09,176 --> 00:47:13,816
(He's the 5th shaman.)

728
00:47:17,756 --> 00:47:19,085
What's your name?

729
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,426
I'm Jung Hyeon U.

730
00:47:23,227 --> 00:47:24,557
What's your name?

731
00:47:26,227 --> 00:47:27,766
We show our name plaques...

732
00:47:27,767 --> 00:47:28,836
- every time someone comes.
- Let's show him.

733
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,137
I'm Ha Byeong Yeol.

734
00:47:31,736 --> 00:47:33,066
What's everyone's blood type?

735
00:47:35,037 --> 00:47:37,236
Who did you ask?

736
00:47:38,046 --> 00:47:39,976
- What's your blood type?
- Mine?

737
00:47:39,977 --> 00:47:41,046
- Yes.
- It's type B.

738
00:47:41,617 --> 00:47:43,546
- Really?
- Type B.

739
00:47:43,716 --> 00:47:44,847
What's your blood type?

740
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:46,146
- Guess.
- Type AB?

741
00:47:46,146 --> 00:47:47,146
It's type AB.

742
00:47:47,147 --> 00:47:49,986
- Why?
- They usually ask that question.

743
00:47:53,057 --> 00:47:54,926
- Is it type AB?
- Yes.

744
00:47:55,997 --> 00:47:57,557
- It's correct.
- Did I get it right?

745
00:47:59,466 --> 00:48:01,537
(She can't help but smile.)

746
00:48:03,767 --> 00:48:04,867
She's so happy.

747
00:48:07,937 --> 00:48:10,707
Does it mean she likes Hyeon U that much?

748
00:48:18,787 --> 00:48:20,715
She has been laughing ever since Hyeon U entered.

749
00:48:20,716 --> 00:48:22,117
She's become so cheerful.

750
00:48:24,586 --> 00:48:25,957
That's right.

751
00:48:26,457 --> 00:48:27,727
She got wrinkles between her eyebrows.

752
00:48:28,926 --> 00:48:30,557
How annoying.

753
00:48:35,896 --> 00:48:38,835
I thought that Hyeon U and I...

754
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:41,637
might become rivals.

755
00:48:41,736 --> 00:48:44,747
But I'm the type to give his most in all aspects.

756
00:48:44,847 --> 00:48:46,247
I don't think that I'll lose.

757
00:48:48,276 --> 00:48:50,017
I'll get punched if I tease her more.

758
00:48:54,856 --> 00:49:00,626
(The atmosphere changes after exchanging a few words.)

759
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:13,066
(He gets a headache.)

760
00:49:34,356 --> 00:49:37,125
Hello, I've been an astrologer for two years.

761
00:49:37,126 --> 00:49:38,497
My name is Kim Yun Jeong.

762
00:49:39,966 --> 00:49:44,036
In astrology, the positions of celestial objects...

763
00:49:44,037 --> 00:49:47,836
affect human affairs.

764
00:49:48,577 --> 00:49:50,977
It's a study that explains the human world.

765
00:49:51,747 --> 00:49:56,246
I think the movements of the constellations...

766
00:49:56,247 --> 00:49:58,077
are beautiful.

767
00:49:59,316 --> 00:50:00,347
They're romantic.

768
00:50:03,457 --> 00:50:06,486
Some people view astrology...

769
00:50:06,827 --> 00:50:09,196
as a superstition.

770
00:50:09,557 --> 00:50:11,966
But if you dig deeper,

771
00:50:12,296 --> 00:50:14,395
it's just like any other study.

772
00:50:14,396 --> 00:50:16,395
That's what I personally believe.

773
00:50:16,396 --> 00:50:18,707
And I want to make use of it.

774
00:50:19,606 --> 00:50:21,005
(The first astrologer enters.)

775
00:50:21,006 --> 00:50:22,636
- Hello.
- Hello.

776
00:50:22,637 --> 00:50:24,006
- Hello.
- Hello.

777
00:50:25,676 --> 00:50:26,776
Hello.

778
00:50:29,747 --> 00:50:31,375
Did you see his eyes just now?

779
00:50:31,376 --> 00:50:33,786
Please replay the video.

780
00:50:33,787 --> 00:50:36,356
I was so surprised. There was a slight smile.

781
00:50:37,316 --> 00:50:39,126
His eyes moved back and forth three times.

782
00:50:42,026 --> 00:50:43,856
- Hello.
- Hello.

783
00:50:45,896 --> 00:50:49,466
I was very surprised because she looked like a celebrity.

784
00:50:49,836 --> 00:50:53,066
I was like, "She's very pretty."

785
00:50:53,407 --> 00:50:54,407
- Hello.
- Hello.

786
00:50:54,407 --> 00:50:55,407
Hello.

787
00:50:57,736 --> 00:50:59,946
When she entered,

788
00:51:00,276 --> 00:51:01,847
I noticed her pretty looks.

789
00:51:02,247 --> 00:51:05,216
She was a welcome participant.

790
00:51:07,546 --> 00:51:08,557
This way?

791
00:51:15,657 --> 00:51:17,327
I could see her.

792
00:51:17,827 --> 00:51:20,066
I could see her right away.

793
00:51:22,137 --> 00:51:25,235
"She's the one I had in mind."

794
00:51:25,236 --> 00:51:26,836
I thought that right away.

795
00:51:27,707 --> 00:51:29,407
I thought that even without exchanging words.

796
00:51:32,247 --> 00:51:33,347
What will happen?

797
00:51:35,046 --> 00:51:37,247
Gosh, everyone is going wild.

798
00:51:37,676 --> 00:51:39,886
(This is interesting.)

799
00:51:39,887 --> 00:51:44,657
(She gets read even before she takes a seat.)

800
00:51:45,387 --> 00:51:46,387
Hello.

801
00:51:47,657 --> 00:51:50,657
I felt Yun Jeong's energy strongly.

802
00:51:50,997 --> 00:51:52,727
She seemed honest.

803
00:51:53,367 --> 00:51:55,966
She wouldn't hesitate to share her thoughts.

804
00:51:56,497 --> 00:51:57,637
She wouldn't beat around the bush.

805
00:52:01,537 --> 00:52:03,977
What were you guys talking about?

806
00:52:05,907 --> 00:52:07,247
Nice to meet you.

807
00:52:17,216 --> 00:52:18,387
(Glancing)

808
00:52:19,626 --> 00:52:20,626
(Turning around)

809
00:52:20,627 --> 00:52:22,296
You mean, liking pretty women?

810
00:52:22,396 --> 00:52:24,526
- She resembles Kim Tae Ri.
- What?

811
00:52:24,896 --> 00:52:26,166
- You're right.
- Kim Tae Ri.

812
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:27,895
- Kim Tae Ri.
- You have that vibe.

813
00:52:27,896 --> 00:52:28,896
Really?

814
00:52:31,066 --> 00:52:32,566
You're so pretty.

815
00:52:32,667 --> 00:52:35,407
Everyone is very pretty.

816
00:52:36,077 --> 00:52:37,077
Seriously.

817
00:52:40,546 --> 00:52:42,847
How many name plaques were there when you came upstairs?

818
00:52:43,316 --> 00:52:44,316
- The name plaques?
- Yes.

819
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:48,216
There was only one for me.

820
00:52:48,586 --> 00:52:50,657
What? Is this it then?

821
00:52:54,086 --> 00:52:58,227
(Are there no remaining name plaques?)

822
00:52:58,896 --> 00:52:59,996
- What?
- What's going on?

823
00:52:59,997 --> 00:53:00,997
(Startled)

824
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:03,267
- Why?
- Will there be a latecomer?

825
00:53:03,796 --> 00:53:05,167
- I guess so.
- Will there be a latecomer?

826
00:53:05,537 --> 00:53:07,605
Hold on. There were more name plaques earlier, right?

827
00:53:07,606 --> 00:53:08,775
- There were ten name plaques.
- Right?

828
00:53:08,776 --> 00:53:10,306
I guess there were five each.

829
00:53:10,307 --> 00:53:11,776
There are five women.

830
00:53:11,876 --> 00:53:13,546
What does that mean?

831
00:53:15,417 --> 00:53:16,616
(Black Monkey, November 16, 1999)

832
00:53:16,617 --> 00:53:17,875
(Red Rabbit, December 2, 1995)

833
00:53:17,876 --> 00:53:19,216
(White Dog, November 4, 1997)

834
00:53:20,146 --> 00:53:25,326
(There were 10 fate plaques at the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

835
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,327
(Black Cow, October 10, 1991)

836
00:53:26,327 --> 00:53:27,327
(White Monkey, July 7, 1999)

837
00:53:28,126 --> 00:53:29,957
- What's going on?
- What?

838
00:53:30,097 --> 00:53:31,696
It'll be so much fun.

839
00:53:32,497 --> 00:53:34,997
- Who will join belatedly?
- What?

840
00:53:36,736 --> 00:53:38,196
- What?
- What?

841
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:40,667
- What?
- Really?

842
00:53:41,736 --> 00:53:44,807
- Were there no remaining plaques?
- I don't think so.

843
00:53:47,577 --> 00:53:51,216
(The fortune tellers become confused.)

844
00:53:52,117 --> 00:53:54,847
(Last night, Hall of Sacred Spirits)

845
00:53:56,017 --> 00:54:00,086
(Two people secretly got a glimpse of their fated pairs.)

846
00:54:03,057 --> 00:54:07,827
(They'll bring a trickery of fate.)

847
00:54:09,336 --> 00:54:11,437
(He gets a headache again.)

848
00:54:13,836 --> 00:54:14,907
There's tea.

849
00:54:15,106 --> 00:54:17,776
- Can we drink it?
- Yes.

850
00:54:18,077 --> 00:54:19,207
I think I'll drink it.

851
00:54:20,106 --> 00:54:23,117
Tea. I like tea.

852
00:54:25,347 --> 00:54:27,616
Does anyone want tea?

853
00:54:27,617 --> 00:54:29,157
No thank you.

854
00:54:29,657 --> 00:54:31,387
I don't know how it works.

855
00:54:31,586 --> 00:54:33,585
- The powder...
- Does it go in there?

856
00:54:33,586 --> 00:54:34,855
- Here.
- My goodness.

857
00:54:34,856 --> 00:54:37,025
- There's a tea bag inside.
- Yes.

858
00:54:37,026 --> 00:54:39,426
- Do you want to drink this one?
- Yes.

859
00:54:40,196 --> 00:54:41,525
This is hot water.

860
00:54:41,526 --> 00:54:43,066
It'll help me relax.

861
00:54:43,836 --> 00:54:46,207
- I'll use this.
- The water is a bit hot.

862
00:54:46,466 --> 00:54:47,807
- Is there water inside?
- Yes.

863
00:54:53,176 --> 00:54:56,076
As for Yun Jeong...

864
00:54:56,077 --> 00:54:57,476
Although she entered late,

865
00:54:57,477 --> 00:54:59,986
she seemed to orchestrate the scene.

866
00:55:00,247 --> 00:55:02,917
Even at a glance, she was a charismatic woman.

867
00:55:04,816 --> 00:55:06,457
I could feel the Head of Stars Fate.

868
00:55:08,356 --> 00:55:09,855
Maybe.

869
00:55:09,856 --> 00:55:12,195
(Head of Stars Fate: A tendency of being clever, decisive,)

870
00:55:12,196 --> 00:55:15,597
(resolute, precise, and independent)

871
00:55:16,336 --> 00:55:18,136
No one had a meal, right?

872
00:55:18,137 --> 00:55:20,036
- I don't think so.
- Everyone skipped meals.

873
00:55:20,037 --> 00:55:21,105
(Byeong Yeol feels Yun Jeong's Head of Stars Fate.)

874
00:55:21,106 --> 00:55:24,106
Did everyone sleep well last night?

875
00:55:25,347 --> 00:55:27,707
Did everyone come from Seoul?

876
00:55:28,646 --> 00:55:32,746
I could feel that everyone was feeling awkward,

877
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:35,657
so I said hello cheerfully.

878
00:55:36,057 --> 00:55:40,586
I tried to blend in naturally.

879
00:55:42,157 --> 00:55:43,227
Occupations...

880
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:49,136
- Can you guess?
- I can't get a sense of anyone yet.

881
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,835
It's because you just got here.

882
00:55:51,836 --> 00:55:53,807
- That might be it.
- That might be it.

883
00:55:55,137 --> 00:55:57,375
I can feel something from you.

884
00:55:57,376 --> 00:55:59,106
It's just a guess, though.

885
00:56:04,046 --> 00:56:05,747
Can you guess my profession?

886
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:11,755
I think we can piece together information.

887
00:56:11,756 --> 00:56:13,856
(8 fortune tellers gathered around.)

888
00:56:14,657 --> 00:56:19,025
Overall, everyone seemed like a shaman.

889
00:56:19,026 --> 00:56:20,866
I thought,

890
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:23,597
"There are many shamans this season."

891
00:56:33,347 --> 00:56:34,675
(After moving into the house,)

892
00:56:34,676 --> 00:56:37,946
(they hear the first gong.)

893
00:56:39,417 --> 00:56:41,617
It's time for the first impression selection.

894
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:43,816
What?

895
00:56:45,657 --> 00:56:46,926
So it begins.

896
00:56:47,457 --> 00:56:48,727
I'm suddenly nervous.

897
00:56:50,926 --> 00:56:52,126
This is fun.

898
00:56:53,026 --> 00:56:56,267
Please hand over your name plaque to the one who draws you in.

899
00:57:00,037 --> 00:57:03,176
Are there no orders? Can they do it as they please?

900
00:57:04,637 --> 00:57:06,676
I think it's best to do it quickly.

901
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,945
- Is that so?
- Yes. They should go ahead...

902
00:57:08,946 --> 00:57:10,346
and do it quickly.

903
00:57:10,347 --> 00:57:11,645
(They must express their interest in front of everyone.)

904
00:57:11,646 --> 00:57:14,517
- Everyone is watching, so...
- I know.

905
00:57:16,417 --> 00:57:20,887
(The first connection will come with the name plaque.)

906
00:57:23,196 --> 00:57:24,957
(Nervous)

907
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:27,566
(Anxious)

908
00:57:30,336 --> 00:57:33,166
Are we doing it in the open?

909
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:35,736
Yes. I think we're doing it right now.

910
00:57:36,407 --> 00:57:39,176
It's pressuring to do it in the open.

911
00:57:42,716 --> 00:57:44,346
No one is stepping forward.

912
00:57:44,347 --> 00:57:46,617
(They end up reading the room.)

913
00:57:48,187 --> 00:57:49,557
Why don't we do this?

914
00:57:49,756 --> 00:57:54,657
When someone hands over the plaque, the recipient can go next.

915
00:57:55,457 --> 00:57:59,625
(They decided on the method of handing over the plaque.)

916
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:00,966
Hyeon U, please go first.

917
00:58:01,966 --> 00:58:03,436
- I shouldn't have sat here.
- Your seat...

918
00:58:03,437 --> 00:58:05,137
is the outermost one.

919
00:58:15,006 --> 00:58:19,486
(Who will receive Hyeon U's name plaque?)

920
00:58:24,917 --> 00:58:26,657
I want to keep my eyes closed.

921
00:58:27,486 --> 00:58:28,726
Thank you.

922
00:58:28,727 --> 00:58:33,526
(Jung Hyeon U chooses Kim Yun Jeong.)

923
00:58:40,937 --> 00:58:43,206
I just felt like...

924
00:58:43,207 --> 00:58:44,907
she captivated my eyes.

925
00:58:45,546 --> 00:58:48,815
When she entered the room, she looked...

926
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:49,977
so bright.

927
00:58:50,077 --> 00:58:52,946
It'll be nice to have a chance to converse with her...

928
00:58:53,787 --> 00:58:55,146
for an extended period of time.

929
00:58:55,816 --> 00:58:57,315
- It's my turn, right?
- Yes.

930
00:58:57,316 --> 00:58:58,756
(The recipient of a name plaque, Yun Jeong, will go next.)

931
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:01,426
He has a cute appearance.

932
00:59:02,126 --> 00:59:03,457
He looks pretty.

933
00:59:05,296 --> 00:59:07,396
I think he looks kind.

934
00:59:07,727 --> 00:59:10,296
He's kind and cute.

935
00:59:11,637 --> 00:59:12,736
He's pretty too.

936
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:17,807
(Who is the pretty man in Yun Jeong's heart?)

937
00:59:18,747 --> 00:59:20,347
What's going on?

938
00:59:21,646 --> 00:59:22,976
(My goodness)

939
00:59:23,001 --> 00:59:26,490
(Why is everyone surprised?)

940
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:35,100
(Kim Yun Jeong chooses Jung Hyeon U.)

941
00:59:35,967 --> 00:59:37,626
That's incredible.

942
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,189
They chose each other.

943
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,460
It might be early to say this, but I think they look good together.

944
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:45,770
Their hearts must be fluttering.

945
00:59:47,699 --> 00:59:50,399
I didn't notice him at first.

946
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,508
Then I got used to the atmosphere and looked around.

947
00:59:54,509 --> 00:59:56,340
"What? He's cute."

948
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,449
"He's cute!" I had that thought.

949
01:00:01,179 --> 01:00:06,049
(Hyeon U and Yun Jeong chose each other.)

950
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:10,060
(Since they chose each other, the order got messed up.)

951
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:12,459
Shall we go around like this?

952
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,290
(Awkward)

953
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:17,528
Let's go in a circle then.

954
01:00:17,529 --> 01:00:18,699
(Gang Won is next.)

955
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:21,599
Why do I feel like I've met her?

956
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,739
Why do I feel like I've known her for years?

957
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,809
Why do I feel like I know her well?

958
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:27,239
I want to get to know her.

959
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,540
(Gang Won makes a straightforward move.)

960
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,179
Here you go.

961
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:33,709
Thank you.

962
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:36,249
(Lee Gang Won chooses Lee Ra Yun.)

963
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,380
Are we exchanging the plaques?

964
01:00:45,259 --> 01:00:47,460
(Embarrassed)

965
01:00:48,259 --> 01:00:50,298
My heart reached out to her the most.

966
01:00:50,299 --> 01:00:53,999
She was funny. And most of all,

967
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,399
she was pretty.

968
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,739
I don't know. I felt like I'd known her for years.

969
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,009
It's so embarrassing.

970
01:01:03,639 --> 01:01:05,610
He suits me well.

971
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:08,110
We have similar vibes.

972
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:11,479
His likes and dislikes match mine...

973
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,820
when it comes to a relationship.

974
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:15,888
(Who did Ra Yun's instinct point to?)

975
01:01:15,889 --> 01:01:16,989
As for me...

976
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,859
Please take it.

977
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:21,489
(Startled)

978
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:27,900
Please take it.

979
01:01:28,099 --> 01:01:30,198
(Lee Ra Yun chooses Lee Gang Won.)

980
01:01:30,199 --> 01:01:32,409
You're an honest woman.

981
01:01:33,739 --> 01:01:35,508
- Who did you take me for?
- How cute.

982
01:01:35,509 --> 01:01:37,679
(Embarrassed)

983
01:01:38,739 --> 01:01:41,149
(They're the second pair to choose each other.)

984
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:42,548
What's going on?

985
01:01:42,549 --> 01:01:44,079
- Really?
- What?

986
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,820
You know, it's nice.

987
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,730
He has the looks I like.

988
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:59,529
I just think...

989
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:02,299
that he's like a tiger...

990
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:04,468
or a wolf.

991
01:02:04,469 --> 01:02:06,809
He reminds me of a beast.

992
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:08,770
(A beastly man)

993
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,348
- It's Ho Am's turn.
- Ho Am.

994
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:14,110
(It's Ho Am's turn.)

995
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:16,678
Those who most suited...

996
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:18,278
the impressions from the divine spirit...

997
01:02:18,279 --> 01:02:20,118
were Yu Gyeong and Yu Ra.

998
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:23,089
After meeting everyone, I personally felt...

999
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:25,360
the most drawn to them.

1000
01:02:25,889 --> 01:02:27,559
- It's Ho Am's turn.
- Ho Am.

1001
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,029
(Between Yu Gyeong and Yu Ra, who will Ho Am choose?)

1002
01:02:32,699 --> 01:02:34,070
Thank you.

1003
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:41,609
(Jang Ho Am chooses Hong Yu Ra.)

1004
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:42,610
Will it go smoothly...

1005
01:02:42,611 --> 01:02:44,579
- for the first time?
- No one chose the same person yet.

1006
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:47,150
I'm drawn to Yu Gyeong.

1007
01:02:47,279 --> 01:02:48,810
Despite that,

1008
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:51,618
I'm still more curious about Yu Ra.

1009
01:02:51,619 --> 01:02:54,489
We didn't have much time to talk.

1010
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:57,159
So I'll have to observe more...

1011
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,819
and take time...

1012
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,529
to make up my mind.

1013
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:04,929
(Ho Am is curious about Yu Ra at this moment.)

1014
01:03:09,239 --> 01:03:13,040
(Who is the one Yu Ra is drawn to?)

1015
01:03:16,179 --> 01:03:17,609
Here.

1016
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:18,880
Oh, my.

1017
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:22,879
(Hong Yu Ra chooses Jang Ho Am.)

1018
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,218
- It's going so smoothly.
- What's going on?

1019
01:03:24,219 --> 01:03:25,319
This is so...

1020
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,719
(Hong Yu Ra chooses Jang Ho Am.)

1021
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:29,619
- What?
- What's this?

1022
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:30,919
What's happening?

1023
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,959
- What's going on?
- Is this real?

1024
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,060
Do you think they're genuine?

1025
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:35,428
How can this happen?

1026
01:03:35,429 --> 01:03:36,500
(They chose each other 3 times in a row?)

1027
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:41,130
(Yu Ra is also drawn to Ho Am.)

1028
01:03:45,139 --> 01:03:49,340
I was contemplating between Gang Won and Ho Am.

1029
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:54,679
Ho Am had an extraordinary energy...

1030
01:03:54,849 --> 01:03:59,520
while Gang Won just looked playful.

1031
01:04:00,849 --> 01:04:04,489
I was thankful...

1032
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,130
that he gave me the name plaque.

1033
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,429
It must've taken great courage.

1034
01:04:11,929 --> 01:04:13,070
Next person?

1035
01:04:13,369 --> 01:04:16,969
(Byeong Yeol, the last man, will make a choice now.)

1036
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:21,868
She's beautiful. I feel like she has the Peace Blossom Fate.

1037
01:04:21,869 --> 01:04:23,009
That's how I feel.

1038
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:24,940
I'm curious. She catches my eye.

1039
01:04:25,239 --> 01:04:29,549
She must have something.

1040
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:34,020
(Who makes him curious?)

1041
01:04:34,389 --> 01:04:38,790
(Ha Byeong Yeol chooses Hong Yu Ra.)

1042
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,028
This is...

1043
01:04:40,029 --> 01:04:44,929
(The last name plaque goes to Yu Ra.)

1044
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:47,968
(Yu Ra was chosen by two people.)

1045
01:04:47,969 --> 01:04:49,739
- Yu Ra.
- Really?

1046
01:04:50,139 --> 01:04:51,139
Oh, my.

1047
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:52,840
It means no one chose Yu Gyeong.

1048
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:55,610
- Things will change later.
- Right.

1049
01:04:55,909 --> 01:04:57,540
- That's better.
- Yes.

1050
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,110
It's a shame.

1051
01:05:00,279 --> 01:05:02,619
It didn't go well from the beginning unlike what I had thought.

1052
01:05:04,949 --> 01:05:06,020
What do I do?

1053
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:12,690
(Next is Yu Gyeong, the only one who wasn't chosen by anyone.)

1054
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,460
I...

1055
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:16,959
Here.

1056
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,428
(Chae Yu Gyeong chooses Ha Byeong Yeol.)

1057
01:05:18,429 --> 01:05:19,499
Here.

1058
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,969
(Chae Yu Gyeong chooses Ha Byeong Yeol.)

1059
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:23,469
This is interesting.

1060
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:26,210
- This is interesting.
- They didn't choose each other.

1061
01:05:30,139 --> 01:05:32,139
I couldn't feel anything.

1062
01:05:32,279 --> 01:05:35,150
"What kind of energy does he have?"

1063
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:38,279
I chose him because I was curious.

1064
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:41,150
It was unexpected.

1065
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,860
We haven't talked much.

1066
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:49,229
But she gave the plaque to me. I don't know why.

1067
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:50,460
They didn't choose each other.

1068
01:05:52,529 --> 01:05:53,599
Now...

1069
01:05:56,570 --> 01:06:01,810
(The 8 fortune tellers made their choice.)

1070
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,609
Did they hear?

1071
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:09,079
- I'm sorry.
- My wish is granted.

1072
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:16,020
Hong Yu Ra, who was chosen by most people,

1073
01:06:17,389 --> 01:06:19,258
can choose a person and see what animal he is...

1074
01:06:19,259 --> 01:06:21,960
at the Hall of Sacred Spirits tonight.

1075
01:06:22,329 --> 01:06:23,759
(Surprised)

1076
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:26,098
(Yu Ra who is chosen by two people is given a privilege.)

1077
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:27,229
Oh, gosh.

1078
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:28,770
(Yu Ra who is chosen by two people is given a privilege.)

1079
01:06:31,299 --> 01:06:36,039
(She can see the identity of one person in advance?)

1080
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:38,410
That's nice.

1081
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:41,480
Really?

1082
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,480
- That's a special privilege.
- I know.

1083
01:06:44,749 --> 01:06:46,649
- Right?
- The sender's animal appears...

1084
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:47,650
instead of their name when they send...

1085
01:06:47,651 --> 01:06:48,689
- a message every night.
- Right.

1086
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:51,458
So she'll know if the text is sent by the person she likes...

1087
01:06:51,459 --> 01:06:52,989
- or not.
- Right.

1088
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:54,259
- That's true.
- Yes.

1089
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:59,129
- She has a special privilege.
- Fascinating.

1090
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:02,370
It's a very interesting privilege.

1091
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:05,469
(He still has a headache.)

1092
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,779
I gained a big advantage.

1093
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:10,980
It's so interesting.

1094
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:13,450
This is so fun.

1095
01:07:15,549 --> 01:07:18,549
(Tonight,)

1096
01:07:19,749 --> 01:07:22,588
(the identity of one person...)

1097
01:07:22,589 --> 01:07:25,388
(will be revealed at the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1098
01:07:25,389 --> 01:07:26,389
(Jang Ho Am, Ha Byeong Yeol, Lee Gang Won, Jung Hyeon U)

1099
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:28,529
Gosh.

1100
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:31,599
- Is it a women's room?
- It's so cute.

1101
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:35,270
- It's so pretty.
- It says "Feng Shui Interior."

1102
01:07:35,999 --> 01:07:37,639
There are all sorts of things.

1103
01:07:38,999 --> 01:07:40,070
(Looking around)

1104
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:44,179
(A 3-person women's room on the 2nd floor)

1105
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:46,249
There are three beds here.

1106
01:07:47,009 --> 01:07:48,949
- There are 3 beds.
- There must be 5 women then.

1107
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:50,980
- There must be 5 women.
- There must be 5 women.

1108
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,280
I guess so.

1109
01:07:52,889 --> 01:07:54,418
There must be five women.

1110
01:07:54,419 --> 01:07:55,690
I'm excited.

1111
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,419
This room is nice.

1112
01:07:59,089 --> 01:08:00,929
- This room is nice.
- This room is...

1113
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:02,330
- Gosh.
- This is it.

1114
01:08:03,459 --> 01:08:06,629
(A men's room and the terrace on the 2nd floor)

1115
01:08:06,929 --> 01:08:10,240
(A telescope to see the stars in the night sky)

1116
01:08:11,499 --> 01:08:13,669
How should we allocate the rooms on the 1st and 2nd floors?

1117
01:08:14,509 --> 01:08:15,838
The allocation?

1118
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:17,539
- I'll stay on the 1st floor.
- The 1st floor?

1119
01:08:18,539 --> 01:08:22,009
Actually, I want to stay on the second floor.

1120
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,079
- Come to the second floor.
- What?

1121
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,048
Ho Am, are you okay with sharing a room with me?

1122
01:08:26,049 --> 01:08:27,149
- The room? Sure.
- Yes.

1123
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:29,119
Are you okay with it? Then let's share the room.

1124
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,159
Okay.

1125
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,519
So you guys chose the second floor.

1126
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,730
Let's share the rooms like this then.

1127
01:08:34,089 --> 01:08:36,229
You can use the room with two beds.

1128
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:37,529
- Should we use the other room?
- Yes.

1129
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,599
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

1130
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:40,669
Let's do that.

1131
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:43,169
- I hope we have a good time.
- Me too.

1132
01:08:44,139 --> 01:08:46,239
- I want to go outside.
- Shall we?

1133
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,039
(The roommates are decided in the Possessed House.)

1134
01:08:49,879 --> 01:08:51,139
It's here.

1135
01:08:52,339 --> 01:08:55,449
- Oh, my.
- That's a lot of luggage.

1136
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:56,580
How should we move it?

1137
01:08:58,049 --> 01:09:00,490
- Is it this one?
- Yes.

1138
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:02,759
- It'll be very heavy.
- Okay.

1139
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,289
It'll be really heavy.

1140
01:09:05,959 --> 01:09:08,330
- It is heavy.
- It's heavy.

1141
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,900
Thank you.

1142
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:13,999
(Byeong Yeol moves Yu Gyeong's luggage.)

1143
01:09:15,129 --> 01:09:17,870
Oh, gosh. Thank you.

1144
01:09:20,639 --> 01:09:22,069
Let me move it for you. Is it this one?

1145
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:23,878
- Give it to me. I'll move it.
- It's heavy.

1146
01:09:23,879 --> 01:09:25,910
- It's all right.
- Thank you.

1147
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:30,379
(He moves Ra Yun's luggage as well.)

1148
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:34,320
Thank you.

1149
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:36,589
Thank you.

1150
01:09:37,789 --> 01:09:38,859
Oh, my.

1151
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:40,190
(He feels shy for no reason.)

1152
01:09:42,429 --> 01:09:44,098
(Checking for the last time)

1153
01:09:44,099 --> 01:09:45,259
Is there anything else?

1154
01:09:46,929 --> 01:09:48,570
- Thank you.
- No worries.

1155
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:49,900
Thank you.

1156
01:09:51,339 --> 01:09:52,770
Yes. I was thankful.

1157
01:09:52,969 --> 01:09:55,339
He used a lot of energy.

1158
01:09:55,709 --> 01:09:59,110
I liked his passion.

1159
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:00,950
It was very nice of him.

1160
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:06,048
I had a feeling that the more I got to know him,

1161
01:10:06,049 --> 01:10:07,749
the more interesting he'd be.

1162
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,218
(He comes back coolly after helping them.)

1163
01:10:09,219 --> 01:10:11,219
Oh, my gosh. Let's go.

1164
01:10:13,789 --> 01:10:15,830
Why are you hiding?

1165
01:10:16,499 --> 01:10:17,860
I guess you want to be alone.

1166
01:10:18,099 --> 01:10:20,270
- I was looking around the room.
- You were?

1167
01:10:21,099 --> 01:10:23,339
I don't mind either bed.

1168
01:10:24,799 --> 01:10:26,569
We'll be roommates for the next seven days.

1169
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:28,138
- Let's have a good time.
- Let's have a good time.

1170
01:10:28,139 --> 01:10:29,539
The last person to come...

1171
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:31,410
- will stay on the lower floor.
- Right.

1172
01:10:32,539 --> 01:10:33,949
Honestly, I don't remember...

1173
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:35,310
- everyone's name yet.
- Me neither.

1174
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:37,279
Let's share. Any names you remember?

1175
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,219
I only remember Hong Yu Ra.

1176
01:10:40,289 --> 01:10:41,389
Hong Yu Ra?

1177
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,559
- Chae...
- Yu Gyeong?

1178
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,918
- Chae Yu Gyeong?
- Chae Yu Gyeong.

1179
01:10:44,919 --> 01:10:46,229
The pink top.

1180
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:47,859
- Chae Yu Gyeong?
- Chae Yu Gyeong.

1181
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:49,089
Hong Yu Ra.

1182
01:10:50,429 --> 01:10:51,730
I only remember the two.

1183
01:10:52,459 --> 01:10:55,099
(During their first encounter)

1184
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,499
- Hello.
- Hello.

1185
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:03,310
(The atmosphere around them was subtle but interesting.)

1186
01:11:04,110 --> 01:11:08,179
(Later, based on the first impression,)

1187
01:11:10,049 --> 01:11:11,378
(both Ho Am and Byeong Yeol...)

1188
01:11:11,379 --> 01:11:14,349
(chose Yu Ra.)

1189
01:11:15,490 --> 01:11:18,660
(And now, they remember the same names.)

1190
01:11:19,219 --> 01:11:20,829
They're roommates...

1191
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:22,458
- and chose the same woman.
- Right.

1192
01:11:22,459 --> 01:11:23,959
- Oh, right.
- Right.

1193
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,869
I guess that's why Byeong Yeol asked him...

1194
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:28,098
if he was okay with rooming...

1195
01:11:28,099 --> 01:11:29,129
- with him.
- That might be why.

1196
01:11:29,469 --> 01:11:31,870
I feel like something will happen.

1197
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:40,280
I'd rather go out on a date quickly.

1198
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:42,150
- That's good too.
- Instead of gathering all together.

1199
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:44,320
- A 1-on-1 situation?
- I prefer it that way.

1200
01:11:44,419 --> 01:11:47,248
I also prefer and find it comfortable...

1201
01:11:47,249 --> 01:11:48,849
when I get to know someone privately.

1202
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:52,719
Chae Yu Gyeong. Hong Yu Ra.

1203
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:56,959
(What will happen to the roommates?)

1204
01:11:58,499 --> 01:11:59,529
- What?
- What?

1205
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:00,998
Were you having a serious conversation?

1206
01:12:00,999 --> 01:12:02,629
- We were trying to remember names.
- We were trying to remember names.

1207
01:12:03,539 --> 01:12:06,239
Rather than that, I'm more curious about their occupation.

1208
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,339
But...

1209
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:09,678
I think I'll get shocked when they reveal it.

1210
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:10,740
But...

1211
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:13,708
If it's completely different from what I thought...

1212
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:15,650
- Right.
- It'll be shocking.

1213
01:12:16,849 --> 01:12:19,149
I feel like...

1214
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:21,889
there would be...

1215
01:12:22,549 --> 01:12:25,088
at least four shamans here.

1216
01:12:25,089 --> 01:12:26,389
Do you think there will be that many shamans?

1217
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,258
Among us?

1218
01:12:29,259 --> 01:12:32,230
(The shaman is surprised.)

1219
01:12:33,799 --> 01:12:35,298
Did you see her acting?

1220
01:12:35,299 --> 01:12:36,798
She's a shaman too, but she was like, "Oh, my."

1221
01:12:36,799 --> 01:12:38,539
"Shamans? I'm scared."

1222
01:12:38,770 --> 01:12:39,969
(She has amazing acting skills.)

1223
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:42,440
It's so funny.

1224
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,980
Don't you think so?

1225
01:12:49,049 --> 01:12:52,179
(More than half of them are shamans?)

1226
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,620
Who did you choose again?

1227
01:12:58,419 --> 01:12:59,589
What are you talking about?

1228
01:13:01,289 --> 01:13:02,289
It's a secret.

1229
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:04,729
- A secret?
- We were talking...

1230
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:05,730
about what to eat.

1231
01:13:05,929 --> 01:13:07,169
I'll leave for you.

1232
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:09,900
Where is everyone?

1233
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:14,069
(Meanwhile, Gang Won and Ho Am are facing each other.)

1234
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:16,070
Can you guess their occupations?

1235
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,480
- Occupations?
- Yes.

1236
01:13:20,879 --> 01:13:23,549
Yes. I think I can.

1237
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:26,690
Can you?

1238
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:30,418
Yes, mostly. I already guessed the men's occupations too.

1239
01:13:30,419 --> 01:13:31,759
- The men's too?
- Yes.

1240
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:36,200
Both women's and men's.

1241
01:13:36,799 --> 01:13:37,830
Really?

1242
01:13:37,959 --> 01:13:39,428
I'm not so sure about the women's occupation.

1243
01:13:39,429 --> 01:13:40,700
(The shamans are trying to see how much they know.)

1244
01:13:42,999 --> 01:13:44,570
I'm not sure about one person.

1245
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:46,770
- Which one? One of the women?
- Well...

1246
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:50,310
Yu Ra.

1247
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,249
I'm not sure about her.

1248
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:58,280
She's the type that would sound professional after studying.

1249
01:13:58,849 --> 01:13:59,849
She must be a saju reader.

1250
01:14:01,589 --> 01:14:03,259
Do you think she's a saju reader?

1251
01:14:04,289 --> 01:14:05,289
Yes.

1252
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:06,860
(Nodding)

1253
01:14:07,490 --> 01:14:09,829
I'm not going to say the men's occupations yet...

1254
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:11,900
to keep it interesting. But that's what I think anyway.

1255
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:16,240
(The two shamans keep exploring each other.)

1256
01:14:17,139 --> 01:14:18,139
Is anyone hungry?

1257
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:20,409
- Me.
- Me.

1258
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:21,838
Do you want to cook together?

1259
01:14:21,839 --> 01:14:23,280
- Sounds good.
- Now?

1260
01:14:24,839 --> 01:14:26,178
What should we make?

1261
01:14:26,179 --> 01:14:27,848
- It's our first time.
- Yes.

1262
01:14:27,849 --> 01:14:29,280
Let's make something easy.

1263
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:32,048
How about something like Chapagetti?

1264
01:14:32,049 --> 01:14:33,748
- It sounds good.
- It'll be simple and quick.

1265
01:14:33,749 --> 01:14:35,649
Yes. It's our first meal.

1266
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:38,189
- Let's not make a difficult dish.
- Right.

1267
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:39,559
Are you going to cook for us?

1268
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:40,729
I don't mind.

1269
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:42,629
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1270
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:46,730
(He starts cooking.)

1271
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:50,070
It's important to get the right amount of water.

1272
01:14:56,339 --> 01:14:59,580
(Yu Ra is hovering around Byeong Yeol.)

1273
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:07,389
(She approaches him.)

1274
01:15:08,349 --> 01:15:10,659
Byeong Yeol. I don't know.

1275
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:14,030
I am curious, though.

1276
01:15:14,759 --> 01:15:16,458
He catches my eye.

1277
01:15:16,459 --> 01:15:17,660
I can't take my eyes off him.

1278
01:15:17,999 --> 01:15:21,799
He said he would cook Chapagetti,

1279
01:15:22,469 --> 01:15:23,599
so I wanted to help.

1280
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:31,740
(Looking intently)

1281
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:37,219
(Sneakily,)

1282
01:15:37,719 --> 01:15:41,689
(Ho Am joins them.)

1283
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:44,859
I plucked up my courage to talk to her.

1284
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:47,530
I wanted to make a move first.

1285
01:15:48,089 --> 01:15:49,998
- Can I put this in first?
- Yes.

1286
01:15:49,999 --> 01:15:50,999
Well...

1287
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:55,330
I feel like you'd be good at making something with your hands.

1288
01:15:56,339 --> 01:15:57,870
- My hands?
- Yes. Am I wrong?

1289
01:15:58,270 --> 01:15:59,369
You're right. How did you know?

1290
01:15:59,370 --> 01:16:01,169
- You are?
- Why did you think so?

1291
01:16:04,339 --> 01:16:05,940
I didn't have to guess it right,

1292
01:16:06,879 --> 01:16:11,080
but I just tried guessing based on what I saw.

1293
01:16:12,749 --> 01:16:16,190
(Ho Am is throwing in the powder without a word.)

1294
01:16:19,589 --> 01:16:21,230
He's just throwing in the powder without a word.

1295
01:16:23,259 --> 01:16:25,699
- He doesn't let Ho Am talk.
- I know.

1296
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:27,669
I would've stood between them and put in the powder.

1297
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:38,080
It was hard to talk to her first.

1298
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:41,610
I'm still careful. I want to take time.

1299
01:16:43,249 --> 01:16:46,820
(Ho Am goes to the 2nd floor in the middle of cooking.)

1300
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:16,879
(He takes Yu Ra's name plaque out of his pocket.)

1301
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:19,990
Yu Ra.

1302
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:28,860
What?

1303
01:17:31,259 --> 01:17:33,299
It seems he's going to work on something.

1304
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:51,820
(Will Ho Am get close to Yu Ra?)

1305
01:17:52,879 --> 01:17:54,119
They didn't put it in yet.

1306
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:55,490
I can smell the egg.

1307
01:17:55,589 --> 01:17:58,320
- It looks delicious.
- The eggs look...

1308
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,730
It takes a long time to cook on the induction cooktop.

1309
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,190
It does?

1310
01:18:03,459 --> 01:18:04,730
Just that one?

1311
01:18:05,429 --> 01:18:07,270
Just that...

1312
01:18:10,169 --> 01:18:11,200
Which room are you using?

1313
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:13,239
- It's on the 2nd floor.
- The 2nd floor?

1314
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,870
Near the glass on the second floor.

1315
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:18,940
Did you see the telescope there?

1316
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:20,809
- No. Is there a telescope?
- There's a telescope.

1317
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:22,910
- There is?
- You can see the stars at night.

1318
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:27,150
The stars at night? With who? That's romantic.

1319
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:33,190
You'd probably know how old the women are.

1320
01:18:33,589 --> 01:18:34,629
- How old the women are?
- Yes.

1321
01:18:35,759 --> 01:18:36,998
You saw the year they were born, didn't you?

1322
01:18:36,999 --> 01:18:37,999
- Did you see that?
- Yes.

1323
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:40,499
I think I know the women's age.

1324
01:18:42,330 --> 01:18:45,869
Honestly, I'm confused.

1325
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:47,338
- You are? About their age?
- Yes.

1326
01:18:47,339 --> 01:18:49,138
- Yes. Their age.
- Or their occupation?

1327
01:18:49,139 --> 01:18:50,780
- Their age?
- I can guess their occupations.

1328
01:18:51,179 --> 01:18:53,310
- You think you know?
- Can't you guess?

1329
01:18:54,549 --> 01:18:56,079
In the men's room,

1330
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,449
we tried to guess the occupations earlier.

1331
01:18:57,450 --> 01:18:59,480
Really? What did you guess about me?

1332
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:02,020
- It's still a secret.
- I'm curious.

1333
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:04,119
How do you do that?

1334
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:06,019
I have no idea.

1335
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:07,429
(Thinking)

1336
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,259
His strategy of talking to another person worked.

1337
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:14,498
I guess it keeps bothering her...

1338
01:19:14,499 --> 01:19:16,230
- This is fun.
- when they're talking in the back.

1339
01:19:16,539 --> 01:19:18,038
When he was doing his best, throwing in the powder next to her,

1340
01:19:18,039 --> 01:19:20,070
- I know. He worked so hard.
- she didn't bat an eye.

1341
01:19:22,969 --> 01:19:25,679
I wanted to know what they were talking about.

1342
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:29,810
It felt like the atmosphere would completely change.

1343
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:34,950
I can guess your occupation.

1344
01:19:35,049 --> 01:19:36,049
- My occupation?
- Yes.

1345
01:19:38,389 --> 01:19:39,389
I think I know.

1346
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:40,589
I want to hear it just a bit later.

1347
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:42,229
Later? Okay.

1348
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:43,799
Can you guess mine?

1349
01:19:44,730 --> 01:19:46,628
- Are you sure about my occupation?
- Yes.

1350
01:19:46,629 --> 01:19:47,629
- Are you certain?
- Yes.

1351
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,999
- Can you guess my occupation?
- I kind of can.

1352
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:55,240
We talked about many things.

1353
01:19:55,570 --> 01:19:56,610
I thought he was pure.

1354
01:19:56,810 --> 01:19:59,179
I thought it'd be very nice to stay with a person like him.

1355
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:03,179
I'm drawn to him in a way. That's what I think.

1356
01:20:05,049 --> 01:20:06,319
Do you perhaps...

1357
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:10,919
(Ho Am and Yu Gyeong start laughing more together.)

1358
01:20:11,289 --> 01:20:14,730
(Meanwhile, the three of them stay quiet in front of the pot.)

1359
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,699
- Are you a strong woman?
- Sorry?

1360
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,928
- Are you a strong woman?
- A strong woman?

1361
01:20:22,929 --> 01:20:24,598
What do you think?

1362
01:20:24,599 --> 01:20:26,098
- I...
- Do you think you are?

1363
01:20:26,099 --> 01:20:28,740
do want to lead sometimes.

1364
01:20:28,839 --> 01:20:31,280
Not always.

1365
01:20:31,639 --> 01:20:32,639
This year,

1366
01:20:33,379 --> 01:20:35,410
- This year?
- did many things happen?

1367
01:20:38,749 --> 01:20:40,620
(Laughing)

1368
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:42,749
How do you know?

1369
01:20:42,849 --> 01:20:45,458
What? It just seems like it. Seriously.

1370
01:20:45,459 --> 01:20:46,459
- Many things?
- Yes.

1371
01:20:47,889 --> 01:20:50,958
It feels like it must've been a tough year for you.

1372
01:20:50,959 --> 01:20:53,299
- Because...
- You're draining my energy.

1373
01:20:54,530 --> 01:20:55,769
Because you should act like you don't know?

1374
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:56,999
This doesn't feel like a vacation.

1375
01:20:57,839 --> 01:20:59,099
He saw through me.

1376
01:20:59,839 --> 01:21:02,570
I wished he hadn't read me.

1377
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:04,280
I was like, "What is this?"

1378
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:07,650
It felt like he was a saju reader.

1379
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:11,679
According to saju, I'm having a tough time.

1380
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:17,389
I think he made guesses or analyzed...

1381
01:21:18,411 --> 01:21:21,852
based on the day I was born.

1382
01:21:23,799 --> 01:21:26,869
I said I felt something from the beginning earlier.

1383
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:28,099
So...

1384
01:21:28,469 --> 01:21:30,469
That's what I felt.

1385
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:33,200
This person...

1386
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,009
can see what's beyond the sky.

1387
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:40,849
I see it very clearly.

1388
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:44,280
(During the preselection)

1389
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:51,089
(White Dog, November 4, 1997)

1390
01:21:52,190 --> 01:21:53,190
She was born on the Day of the White Dog.

1391
01:21:54,889 --> 01:21:57,730
I felt the energy of the White Dog.

1392
01:21:59,759 --> 01:22:01,570
Yun Jeong...

1393
01:22:02,530 --> 01:22:04,700
is the White Dog.

1394
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:08,270
I'm scared.

1395
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:12,410
I should ask him to read my saju.

1396
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,580
- Byeong Yeol is good.
- Yes.

1397
01:22:16,879 --> 01:22:18,379
Is Yun Jeong the White Dog?

1398
01:22:22,089 --> 01:22:24,218
What do you think? It's the ramyeon noodles.

1399
01:22:24,219 --> 01:22:25,820
(Is Yun Jeong the White Dog as Byeong Yeol guessed?)

1400
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:30,458
- I think it's...
- Hold on. This is a little...

1401
01:22:30,459 --> 01:22:33,969
(White Dog, November 4, 1997)

1402
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:38,269
This is for four people. I'll put it on the table.

1403
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:40,209
The ones who are hungry should start eating first.

1404
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:42,709
I'm so hungry.

1405
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,610
(Eating)

1406
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:52,120
- It's good.
- Right.

1407
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:57,888
(Hyeon U starts laughing all of a sudden.)

1408
01:22:57,889 --> 01:23:00,129
He's laughing so hard.

1409
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,360
(Laughing)

1410
01:23:08,929 --> 01:23:11,070
I kept looking at Hyeon U.

1411
01:23:11,469 --> 01:23:13,168
I'm not sure what point it is,

1412
01:23:13,169 --> 01:23:15,609
- but he keeps laughing...
- Right.

1413
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:17,209
- at his own certain point.
- Right.

1414
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:19,280
There were a lot of cute moments.

1415
01:23:19,339 --> 01:23:21,209
- About you?
- No.

1416
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:23,348
- No! That's not it.
- I see.

1417
01:23:23,349 --> 01:23:25,580
- "I'm cute." - From the people around me.

1418
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:29,449
(Hyeon U's confidence flowed out.)

1419
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:30,620
That's understandable.

1420
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,320
He's definitely cute.

1421
01:23:36,999 --> 01:23:38,030
Are you flirting with him?

1422
01:23:39,129 --> 01:23:42,330
(The men look at one person at that comment.)

1423
01:23:42,599 --> 01:23:44,968
- That was out of nowhere.
- Don't drive me into a corner.

1424
01:23:44,969 --> 01:23:45,998
I was just playing along with the joke.

1425
01:23:45,999 --> 01:23:47,168
You'll get in big trouble...

1426
01:23:47,169 --> 01:23:48,310
- if you say something wrong here.
- Right.

1427
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,839
It's so scary.

1428
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:55,549
(The first meal of the fortune tellers ends.)

1429
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,579
May I go inside?

1430
01:23:58,580 --> 01:23:59,719
- Yes.
- Right.

1431
01:24:01,219 --> 01:24:04,718
We're planning to have a drink together.

1432
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:06,560
- That sounds great!
- That sounds like fun!

1433
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,258
Shall we go to the living room?

1434
01:24:09,259 --> 01:24:10,359
- On the first floor?
- Yes.

1435
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,159
- Sounds good.
- We'll go down.

1436
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,160
Right.

1437
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:17,139
Are we having a drink together now?

1438
01:24:19,139 --> 01:24:21,269
- Drink snacks?
- Right.

1439
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:24,708
What do we have? We do have pasta.

1440
01:24:24,709 --> 01:24:25,910
Pasta sounds good too.

1441
01:24:26,039 --> 01:24:27,610
Who knows how to make it?

1442
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:29,449
- The noodles just can be boiled.
- We have shrimp too.

1443
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:31,280
- They're frozen.
- Can't we make aglio e olio?

1444
01:24:31,349 --> 01:24:32,349
Do you know how to make it?

1445
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:33,949
- Yes.
- Really?

1446
01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:36,990
Isn't making aglio e olio as easy as making ramyeon?

1447
01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:38,819
It's the most basic dish.

1448
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:39,959
Shall we make aglio e olio?

1449
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:43,259
Shall we both make aglio e olio then?

1450
01:24:44,599 --> 01:24:45,599
Sounds good.

1451
01:24:46,030 --> 01:24:49,529
We happened to vote for each other.

1452
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:52,239
I thought that it would be fun if we were to make it together...

1453
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,669
right at that moment.

1454
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,240
(Peeking)

1455
01:24:56,139 --> 01:24:59,809
(Ho Am heads to someone.)

1456
01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:01,748
- Should we make dessert?
- Sorry?

1457
01:25:01,749 --> 01:25:03,409
- Should we make dessert?
- Sure.

1458
01:25:03,410 --> 01:25:05,179
- How do we make it?
- Since I'm bad at cooking.

1459
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:06,580
Do you know how to make it?

1460
01:25:06,679 --> 01:25:08,049
Do you know how to make it?

1461
01:25:09,950 --> 01:25:11,459
We should just...

1462
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,520
(Ho Am and Yu Gyeong became the ones in charge of dessert.)

1463
01:25:12,521 --> 01:25:13,559
We should plate them?

1464
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:14,730
- Let's look for the plates.
- Okay.

1465
01:25:14,990 --> 01:25:16,560
- The pretty plates.
- The pretty plates?

1466
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:19,059
- We just need to plate them nicely.
- Okay.

1467
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:20,329
Are you confident with plating?

1468
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:22,230
- Yes. I am.
- That's great to hear.

1469
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,638
I don't know how to cook anything.

1470
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:26,798
It seemed like Yu Gyeong wasn't good at cooking,

1471
01:25:26,799 --> 01:25:28,469
so I asked her to work with me.

1472
01:25:28,910 --> 01:25:30,580
I think there are more over there. Should we take a look?

1473
01:25:33,379 --> 01:25:34,849
(Peeking)

1474
01:25:41,490 --> 01:25:42,950
- You're really skilled.
- Not at all.

1475
01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:45,219
The way you're using your wrist.

1476
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:49,530
It's been so long, so I don't know if it will turn out well.

1477
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:53,230
It feels like you've made some yesterday.

1478
01:25:55,469 --> 01:25:57,700
Hold on. Let's give it a taste first.

1479
01:25:58,799 --> 01:25:59,799
Give it a try.

1480
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:04,539
- We need a lot.
- We need a lot?

1481
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:07,280
- What? He just fed her?
- What?

1482
01:26:08,849 --> 01:26:09,980
That's quick.

1483
01:26:11,049 --> 01:26:12,748
- Straight from his hand?
- Gosh!

1484
01:26:12,749 --> 01:26:14,519
I thought he was putting in his finger too.

1485
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,160
Can this really happen?

1486
01:26:18,289 --> 01:26:20,830
It was like, "She did eat it, but what have I just done?"

1487
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:23,560
Right.

1488
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:25,900
Give it a try.

1489
01:26:29,370 --> 01:26:30,639
- We need a lot.
- We need a lot?

1490
01:26:31,870 --> 01:26:32,940
This much?

1491
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:42,249
(Smiling)

1492
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,749
- It isn't salty.
- It isn't salty?

1493
01:26:48,549 --> 01:26:49,549
That's good then.

1494
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:51,660
- But...
- It's weird?

1495
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:57,499
Give it a try. I'm not even sure what it tastes like.

1496
01:26:59,929 --> 01:27:01,200
What does it taste like?

1497
01:27:01,469 --> 01:27:02,700
Do you have the food delivery app?

1498
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:05,999
- We're in trouble.
- We don't have access to Internet.

1499
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:14,810
I think we had a lot of fun together.

1500
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,020
I feel a bit shy. I don't know what to say.

1501
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,758
(You two fed each other while cooking.)

1502
01:27:24,759 --> 01:27:29,490
To be honest, I'm not really good at doing those things.

1503
01:27:30,089 --> 01:27:31,160
Well,

1504
01:27:31,929 --> 01:27:35,128
I can do those things if I try, but I feel shy...

1505
01:27:35,129 --> 01:27:38,469
and can't do them with confidence.

1506
01:27:39,669 --> 01:27:41,038
- We can just do this.
- Will it work?

1507
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:43,439
(The two got a lot closer.)

1508
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:44,480
There we go.

1509
01:27:44,980 --> 01:27:47,679
Here. Things like butter cookies.

1510
01:27:48,110 --> 01:27:50,480
- This is tea.
- Oh, tea.

1511
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:52,579
Shall we get some jelly too?

1512
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:53,679
Sounds good.

1513
01:27:54,419 --> 01:27:56,190
There's nothing I can make.

1514
01:27:56,389 --> 01:27:58,258
We should just plate things nicely.

1515
01:27:58,259 --> 01:27:59,418
Right. There are more here.

1516
01:27:59,419 --> 01:28:01,530
Nice! There are a lot here.

1517
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:02,889
Do you eat dried strawberries?

1518
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,629
Do you eat them while drinking?

1519
01:28:06,230 --> 01:28:07,298
(The two of them can be heard from the living room.)

1520
01:28:07,299 --> 01:28:09,628
This doesn't need to be used for aglio e olio.

1521
01:28:09,629 --> 01:28:11,838
Instead of using that,

1522
01:28:11,839 --> 01:28:13,339
I use eggs.

1523
01:28:15,509 --> 01:28:16,509
(Yu Ra heads toward the two of them.)

1524
01:28:16,510 --> 01:28:18,480
I think that's it.

1525
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,879
What are you two up to?

1526
01:28:22,209 --> 01:28:24,120
Yu Ra went to check on them.

1527
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:27,449
Yu Ra feels bothered about the two of them being together.

1528
01:28:27,450 --> 01:28:30,249
"You said you liked me." This is what it feels like.

1529
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:33,490
It's just the first episode.

1530
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:36,928
Things will go wild in the upcoming episodes in my opinion.

1531
01:28:36,929 --> 01:28:37,999
Seriously.

1532
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:42,700
What are you two up to?

1533
01:28:46,139 --> 01:28:48,169
We're here to look for snacks.

1534
01:28:48,469 --> 01:28:49,708
- I saw this earlier.
- We wanted to plate them nicely.

1535
01:28:49,709 --> 01:28:52,079
Or we can get some of these. The dried mangoes.

1536
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:54,509
- I think dried mangoes will work.
- Dried mangoes? Okay.

1537
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:55,910
Let's take these.

1538
01:28:56,549 --> 01:28:57,580
Like this?

1539
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:00,990
What is this?

1540
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:02,649
I think these are made of figs.

1541
01:29:02,650 --> 01:29:03,888
That's what they smell like.

1542
01:29:03,889 --> 01:29:05,020
It's cut into pieces.

1543
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,490
Try smelling it.

1544
01:29:07,289 --> 01:29:08,759
- What were these again?
- Figs.

1545
01:29:09,030 --> 01:29:10,089
Oh, right.

1546
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:11,959
- Would you like to try some?
- Sure.

1547
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:14,200
Thank you.

1548
01:29:15,599 --> 01:29:20,200
(Others have already come to these two.)

1549
01:29:27,509 --> 01:29:28,650
Were you eating it?

1550
01:29:29,009 --> 01:29:30,980
- You should've been eating.
- Thank you.

1551
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:33,378
Take a seat. We were doing something fun.

1552
01:29:33,379 --> 01:29:34,449
What is that?

1553
01:29:34,450 --> 01:29:35,819
(Beer that will lift up the atmosphere)

1554
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:37,259
Right. We should bring the drinks too.

1555
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:41,788
For those who don't want to drink,

1556
01:29:41,789 --> 01:29:43,289
you can choose the alcohol-free version.

1557
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,429
- Shall we clink our glasses?
- Let's do it.

1558
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:47,700
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1559
01:29:47,999 --> 01:29:49,669
(A refreshing glass of beer)

1560
01:29:52,299 --> 01:29:53,440
It's lemon-flavored.

1561
01:29:54,310 --> 01:29:56,009
It really tastes like actual lemons were squeezed.

1562
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:58,678
The design looks really nice.

1563
01:29:58,679 --> 01:30:00,280
- Right.
- It looks nice.

1564
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:03,150
- It's perfect to drink at home.
- Right.

1565
01:30:03,749 --> 01:30:05,120
- What?
- It tastes good.

1566
01:30:05,219 --> 01:30:06,219
What are these?

1567
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:07,690
Have you played with these before?

1568
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:09,748
When will we use these? Let's play with these.

1569
01:30:09,749 --> 01:30:10,860
The master knows.

1570
01:30:11,419 --> 01:30:12,419
(Ra Yun became the MC of the OX Game.)

1571
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:14,230
All right. Excuse me?

1572
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,200
This one is too intense. I'll move onto the next one.

1573
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:19,859
- Just tell us what it was.
- Right.

1574
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:21,700
Or should we just read what it says on the card?

1575
01:30:22,270 --> 01:30:24,869
I'll read them. "I want to get underwear as a gift from my lover."

1576
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:27,209
"I can hug and kiss my lover on the street."

1577
01:30:27,639 --> 01:30:29,309
- Those are fine.
- They're fine?

1578
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:30,338
Really? Then I'll go with,

1579
01:30:30,339 --> 01:30:32,878
"I can hug and kiss my lover on the street."

1580
01:30:32,879 --> 01:30:34,280
- "O or X." - Kiss?

1581
01:30:34,849 --> 01:30:37,149
- It's not just a peck but a kiss?
- Right. A deep kiss...

1582
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:39,149
in the middle of the crosswalk.

1583
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:41,348
- The crosswalk of an intersection.
- It has to be...

1584
01:30:41,349 --> 01:30:42,649
- that intense?
- An intersection?

1585
01:30:42,650 --> 01:30:44,859
And the streetlights are shining on top of you.

1586
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:46,289
- There's even a spotlight?
- Right at that moment.

1587
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:48,030
You can't move away from that spot.

1588
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:50,428
But why is this wanted?

1589
01:30:50,429 --> 01:30:52,059
- It's asking if...
- Is it forced by someone?

1590
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:54,299
It's choosing O or X if you can do that.

1591
01:30:55,730 --> 01:30:57,569
- I...
- Can you do it or not?

1592
01:30:57,570 --> 01:31:00,099
- I don't think I can do that.
- Why not?

1593
01:31:02,169 --> 01:31:03,269
I don't think I can do that.

1594
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:05,139
(Gang Won feels intimidated by Ra Yun's energy.)

1595
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,639
- That was cute.
- Did my ears turn red?

1596
01:31:07,139 --> 01:31:08,709
I really can't do that.

1597
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:11,780
- I don't think I can do that too.
- Why not?

1598
01:31:12,679 --> 01:31:14,918
- It's in front of everyone?
- Right.

1599
01:31:14,919 --> 01:31:15,950
I can't do that.

1600
01:31:16,249 --> 01:31:17,320
For me,

1601
01:31:17,690 --> 01:31:20,319
I think I can do that if I'm in a foreign country.

1602
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,230
- But not in Korea?
- I can't do that in Korea.

1603
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:24,798
- I think I can do that.
- Really?

1604
01:31:24,799 --> 01:31:26,030
- Even in Korea?
- That was unexpected.

1605
01:31:26,799 --> 01:31:28,400
You're so romantic.

1606
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:32,598
Well, I think I can do it,

1607
01:31:32,599 --> 01:31:34,240
but I don't want to.

1608
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:37,008
- That was funny.
- He doesn't want to.

1609
01:31:37,009 --> 01:31:38,579
You think you can do it.

1610
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:40,009
- Right. I think I can, - Right.

1611
01:31:40,139 --> 01:31:41,249
but I'll go with X.

1612
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:43,248
I don't prefer doing those things.

1613
01:31:43,249 --> 01:31:45,179
- You don't like doing those things?
- Right.

1614
01:31:46,049 --> 01:31:48,419
I prefer physical affection to be done together...

1615
01:31:48,490 --> 01:31:50,860
with no one else around.

1616
01:31:54,289 --> 01:31:56,530
I don't want to do that as well.

1617
01:31:59,129 --> 01:32:00,628
- Hold on.
- No way.

1618
01:32:00,629 --> 01:32:02,129
That sounds like a lie right away.

1619
01:32:05,169 --> 01:32:06,299
The moon is up.

1620
01:32:07,169 --> 01:32:08,169
- Really?
- It looks pretty.

1621
01:32:08,169 --> 01:32:09,169
It's a crescent moon.

1622
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:10,439
- You're right.
- Where?

1623
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:11,538
- Do you see it over there?
- The crescent moon.

1624
01:32:11,539 --> 01:32:12,539
You're right.

1625
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:15,910
(The pretty crescent moon is up.)

1626
01:32:16,410 --> 01:32:17,980
The sky looks beautiful.

1627
01:32:18,749 --> 01:32:22,218
(A sudden ringing of the bell)

1628
01:32:22,219 --> 01:32:23,450
What was that?

1629
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:28,459
The Hall of Sacred Spirits is open.

1630
01:32:30,929 --> 01:32:32,258
Take the name plaque you received from...

1631
01:32:32,259 --> 01:32:33,628
the first impression selection...

1632
01:32:33,629 --> 01:32:34,730
and head toward the Hall of Sacred Spirits.

1633
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:37,499
The thing we did earlier?

1634
01:32:38,499 --> 01:32:40,638
(The time of selection at the Hall of Sacred Spirits...)

1635
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:42,740
(has finally come.)

1636
01:32:42,839 --> 01:32:47,479
(Lee Ra Yun, Hong Yu Ra, Chae Yu Gyeong, Kim Yun Jeong)

1637
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:51,319
(A destined partner is chosen every night...)

1638
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:55,848
(at the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1639
01:32:55,849 --> 01:32:58,889
(Jang Ho Am, Ha Byeong Yeol, Lee Gang Won, Jung Hyeon U)

1640
01:32:59,719 --> 01:33:01,089
Are they voting now?

1641
01:33:01,429 --> 01:33:02,859
How do you think they will vote?

1642
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:04,559
Don't you think things will change a bit?

1643
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,059
The first impression selection was done...

1644
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:07,599
after seeing each other for an hour or two.

1645
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:10,128
This selection is done...

1646
01:33:10,129 --> 01:33:12,269
after being with each other for quite some time.

1647
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:14,138
There can definitely be a change in heart.

1648
01:33:14,139 --> 01:33:15,209
Right.

1649
01:33:15,339 --> 01:33:17,440
I'm so curious about what will happen tonight.

1650
01:33:17,709 --> 01:33:19,039
This will reveal their true hearts.

1651
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:33,419
(Hyeon U leaves the Possessed House first.)

1652
01:33:46,169 --> 01:33:47,439
(Lee Ra Yun, Hong Yu Ra, Chae Yu Gyeong)

1653
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:50,440
(He has faced three name plaques.)

1654
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:59,080
(He takes out a name plaque from his coat.)

1655
01:34:07,190 --> 01:34:08,329
(Hyeon U selected Yun Jeong during the first impression selection.)

1656
01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:09,530
Thank you.

1657
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:12,758
(Yun Jeong also responded to Hyeon U's heart.)

1658
01:34:12,759 --> 01:34:13,829
What's going on?

1659
01:34:13,830 --> 01:34:15,070
(Yun Jeong also responded to Hyeon U's heart.)

1660
01:34:16,969 --> 01:34:19,138
(After spending time together during dinner,)

1661
01:34:19,139 --> 01:34:21,969
(the two got a lot closer.)

1662
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:24,508
To be honest,

1663
01:34:24,509 --> 01:34:27,339
I already had Yun Jeong in mind before I went in.

1664
01:34:27,709 --> 01:34:30,580
It wasn't really a hard decision to make.

1665
01:34:31,349 --> 01:34:33,520
I just wanted to talk with her a bit more.

1666
01:34:34,249 --> 01:34:37,860
(Kim Yun Jeong)

1667
01:34:40,219 --> 01:34:45,860
(Jung Hyeon U chooses Kim Yun Jeong.)

1668
01:34:48,999 --> 01:34:53,639
(Hyeon U's heart hasn't changed.)

1669
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:56,639
Right.

1670
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:00,479
(Jang Ho Am, Ha Byeong Yeol, Lee Gang Won)

1671
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:05,020
I thought about who I liked the most.

1672
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:07,620
With the time that's left,

1673
01:35:09,549 --> 01:35:10,860
I had my eyes on him.

1674
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:16,259
(Who will Yun Jeong's heart head toward tonight?)

1675
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:23,900
(What will Ra Yun's choice be?)

1676
01:35:24,099 --> 01:35:25,499
(Lee Gang Won)

1677
01:35:27,339 --> 01:35:31,678
(Lee Ra Yun chooses Lee Gang Won.)

1678
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:33,839
Right. I'm done.

1679
01:35:34,610 --> 01:35:35,950
Is it too clear?

1680
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:38,579
I'm already into one person.

1681
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:40,419
I can only do one thing at a time.

1682
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:43,249
For me...

1683
01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:45,288
Here you are.

1684
01:35:45,289 --> 01:35:47,588
(Ra Yun chose Gang Won during the first impression selection.)

1685
01:35:47,589 --> 01:35:49,889
You were an honest person.

1686
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:53,329
I will go. Here you are.

1687
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:55,468
(Gang Won also chose Ra Yun.)

1688
01:35:55,469 --> 01:35:56,668
Thank you.

1689
01:35:56,669 --> 01:35:58,239
(The two chose each other.)

1690
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:59,940
Is everyone going to trade it like this?

1691
01:36:00,799 --> 01:36:02,509
(It might pop over to you if you stay there.)

1692
01:36:03,169 --> 01:36:04,480
You should hurry.

1693
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:08,349
(Ra Yun never stopped laughing while being with Gang Won.)

1694
01:36:09,009 --> 01:36:10,109
- What should I do?
- Just a decent amount.

1695
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:12,650
- I'll do it like Choi Hyun Seok.
- There you go.

1696
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:16,950
Gang Won has a lot of the points that I like.

1697
01:36:17,719 --> 01:36:19,660
I won't feel bored when I'm with him.

1698
01:36:19,789 --> 01:36:22,459
Gang Won is my favorite so far.

1699
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:25,498
Am I being too straightforward?

1700
01:36:25,499 --> 01:36:26,900
Am I being too obvious?

1701
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:31,070
- You've already decided?
- We could already tell.

1702
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:32,298
They look great together.

1703
01:36:32,299 --> 01:36:33,900
- Don't they look good together?
- They do.

1704
01:36:34,099 --> 01:36:36,538
They share the same vibes too.

1705
01:36:36,539 --> 01:36:38,940
- Right. They're similar.
- Right.

1706
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:41,879
They're both shamans too.

1707
01:36:44,249 --> 01:36:47,048
I like Gang Won,

1708
01:36:47,049 --> 01:36:50,959
so I hope he is the White Monkey.

1709
01:36:52,959 --> 01:36:55,230
Right. Let's go.

1710
01:36:57,230 --> 01:36:58,299
But...

1711
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,900
I'm not sure if Gang Won will feel the same about me.

1712
01:37:03,270 --> 01:37:08,610
(Gang Won has come to the Hall of Sacred Spirits too.)

1713
01:37:14,139 --> 01:37:17,179
(Gang Won puts down Ra Yun's name plaque.)

1714
01:37:19,919 --> 01:37:21,190
I'm not sure.

1715
01:37:21,419 --> 01:37:22,990
I thought to myself, "Can I really meet this person?"

1716
01:37:24,759 --> 01:37:28,830
I wanted to talk with the others as well,

1717
01:37:29,259 --> 01:37:31,030
so I didn't want to focus just on one person.

1718
01:37:36,270 --> 01:37:37,330
(Lee Ra Yun)

1719
01:37:43,039 --> 01:37:46,940
(Who will Gang Won's heart head toward tonight?)

1720
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:58,389
(Has his heart changed?)

1721
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,330
(Thinking)

1722
01:38:05,259 --> 01:38:07,159
(Jang Ho Am, Ha Byeong Yeol, Lee Gang Won, Jung Hyeon U)

1723
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:10,469
I was with them for a whole day.

1724
01:38:10,799 --> 01:38:13,700
I thought about who I was curious about more...

1725
01:38:13,770 --> 01:38:15,668
and the person who got more of my attention.

1726
01:38:15,669 --> 01:38:16,740
(Ha Byeong Yeol)

1727
01:38:17,139 --> 01:38:18,280
I will choose...

1728
01:38:19,379 --> 01:38:20,739
- Here.
- Thank you.

1729
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:22,910
(Yu Gyeong gave her name plaque to Byeong Yeol.)

1730
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,580
It was the first time I felt this.

1731
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:26,849
I was curious about someone because I didn't feel anything.

1732
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:29,889
And...

1733
01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:33,620
(Jang Ho Am)

1734
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:37,360
(Shall we make dessert?)

1735
01:38:37,959 --> 01:38:44,370
(Yu Gyeong got closer with Ho Am during dinner.)

1736
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:47,169
It felt like we were going to click.

1737
01:38:48,910 --> 01:38:50,410
What is he hiding?

1738
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:55,810
(Sighing)

1739
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:03,190
(Who did Yu Gyeong choose between Byeong Yeol and Ho Am?)

1740
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:11,928
Doesn't it seem like she has changed her mind?

1741
01:39:11,929 --> 01:39:13,258
- Right.
- There could be a chance.

1742
01:39:13,259 --> 01:39:14,799
- I think she'll choose Ho Am.
- Right.

1743
01:39:15,099 --> 01:39:17,169
She talked with Ho Am a lot.

1744
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,199
- I think they will click.
- Right.

1745
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,169
- They seem like a good match.
- Right.

1746
01:39:24,139 --> 01:39:27,679
(Byeong Yeol has arrived at the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1747
01:39:30,009 --> 01:39:33,120
(Yu Gyeong's name plaque is in his hand.)

1748
01:39:33,919 --> 01:39:36,950
(However, Byeong Yeol's eyes face toward another name.)

1749
01:39:37,089 --> 01:39:40,490
(Hong Yu Ra)

1750
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:46,830
(Byeong Yeol chose Yu Ra during the first impression selection.)

1751
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:50,999
(There was someone else that chose Yu Ra.)

1752
01:39:54,639 --> 01:40:00,179
(Ho Am also stands before the name plaques.)

1753
01:40:02,209 --> 01:40:06,719
(Hong Yu Ra)

1754
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:12,820
(Is there someone you're into?)

1755
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:14,389
(Someone I'm into?)

1756
01:40:14,459 --> 01:40:17,389
(Out of these two?)

1757
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:19,129
(Nodding)

1758
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:25,200
(Yu Ra replies with laughter at Yu Gyeong's question.)

1759
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:29,669
I was torn between Yu Ra and Yu Gyeong.

1760
01:40:30,039 --> 01:40:31,678
(Hong Yu Ra)

1761
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:33,240
It's Yu Ra right now.

1762
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:36,910
But...

1763
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,419
Yu Gyeong's name...

1764
01:40:39,549 --> 01:40:42,289
and her face keep getting into my head.

1765
01:40:43,219 --> 01:40:44,559
That was what made me feel torn.

1766
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:46,990
I'm still confused because of that.

1767
01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:50,830
I believe the fate plaque selection...

1768
01:40:50,990 --> 01:40:53,458
is the most important part to me.

1769
01:40:53,459 --> 01:40:56,269
It was the fate plaque I chose, so I got curious about it.

1770
01:40:56,270 --> 01:40:58,570
(Byeong Yeol chose the Red Rabbit during the preselection.)

1771
01:40:58,599 --> 01:41:01,740
(Red Rabbit, December 2, 1995)

1772
01:41:03,310 --> 01:41:05,609
When I talked with her,

1773
01:41:05,610 --> 01:41:07,539
there was a certain feeling.

1774
01:41:10,110 --> 01:41:12,849
I thought that I was able to notice who it was.

1775
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:23,529
(Who is the Red Rabbit that Byeong Yeol is looking for?)

1776
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:24,799
(Chae Yu Gyeong)

1777
01:41:34,299 --> 01:41:37,539
(Hong Yu Ra)

1778
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:43,249
(Ho Am is done with his selection as well.)

1779
01:41:44,450 --> 01:41:49,190
(Who have their hearts headed toward?)

1780
01:41:55,789 --> 01:41:59,299
(Ha Byeong Yeol, Jang Ho Am)

1781
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:03,330
Who is the destined partner you have chosen?

1782
01:42:04,799 --> 01:42:08,410
You can find out about that person's animal today.

1783
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:16,441
When I study the saju...

1784
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:21,911
Judging by Byeong Yeol's appearance,

1785
01:42:22,411 --> 01:42:24,680
his eyes are...

1786
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:28,521
full of sadness.

1787
01:42:29,321 --> 01:42:30,991
So he might be the Black Cow.

1788
01:42:31,861 --> 01:42:33,061
As for Ho Am,

1789
01:42:34,220 --> 01:42:35,561
his vibe matches.

1790
01:42:35,890 --> 01:42:40,300
The Day of the White Chicken is well-known for a pale face.

1791
01:42:40,831 --> 01:42:44,170
That's why I think he's the White Chicken.

1792
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:49,911
And since I had a good sense of everyone,

1793
01:42:50,210 --> 01:42:54,380
two people who piqued my interest the most remained.

1794
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:58,521
After much consideration,

1795
01:42:59,050 --> 01:43:00,050
I made my decision...

1796
01:43:01,121 --> 01:43:05,191
because I was confused about which animal Gang Won was.

1797
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,831
I focused on my curiosity...

1798
01:43:09,561 --> 01:43:13,000
and submitted the name plaque of the person I was curious about.

1799
01:43:13,130 --> 01:43:17,000
(Hong Yu Ra chose Lee Gang Won.)

1800
01:43:17,670 --> 01:43:19,599
She decided to figure out who Gang Won is.

1801
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:21,539
That's one way to go about it.

1802
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:22,969
Someone completely different.

1803
01:43:22,970 --> 01:43:25,340
She knows about other people.

1804
01:43:26,210 --> 01:43:27,811
- She can guess.
- Yes.

1805
01:43:27,981 --> 01:43:29,550
She wants to know about everyone.

1806
01:43:35,790 --> 01:43:37,520
I was both excited...

1807
01:43:37,521 --> 01:43:39,161
and very nervous.

1808
01:43:40,661 --> 01:43:45,960
(She submitted Gang Won's name plaque.)

1809
01:43:49,031 --> 01:43:50,599
(What's the identity...)

1810
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:55,071
(of the man who piqued Yu Ra's curiosity, Gang Won?)

1811
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:15,661
(Lee Gang Won)

1812
01:44:19,901 --> 01:44:20,999
(Lee Gang Won)

1813
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,139
(White Monkey, July 7, 1999)

1814
01:44:25,140 --> 01:44:26,270
(Gang Won's identity was...)

1815
01:44:26,271 --> 01:44:31,371
(White Monkey.)

1816
01:44:32,081 --> 01:44:33,540
White Monkey.

1817
01:44:35,380 --> 01:44:37,110
Then White Monkey was the one to pick.

1818
01:44:37,111 --> 01:44:39,321
Ra Yun kept talking about White Monkey.

1819
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,620
That's insane.

1820
01:44:41,621 --> 01:44:42,650
- My goodness.
- Seriously.

1821
01:44:42,651 --> 01:44:44,120
- I got goosebumps.
- Ra Yun went,

1822
01:44:44,121 --> 01:44:46,821
"White Monkey? I wasn't going to pick that."

1823
01:44:47,021 --> 01:44:48,460
That's right.

1824
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,960
- Ra Yun is talented.
- She said she never dated a monkey.

1825
01:44:51,290 --> 01:44:53,630
The divine spirit was telling her to pick Gang Won.

1826
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:01,140
(White Monkey, July 7, 1999)

1827
01:45:01,371 --> 01:45:04,170
(During the preselection)

1828
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:08,549
The spirit told me to pick the monkey.

1829
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:12,420
I was like, "What? Why? Really? Why is that?"

1830
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:20,560
(There must be a reason.)

1831
01:45:20,561 --> 01:45:21,890
(I'm sure there's a reason.)

1832
01:45:22,331 --> 01:45:25,160
There must be a reason...

1833
01:45:25,161 --> 01:45:28,100
the divine spirit tells the disciple to do something.

1834
01:45:28,901 --> 01:45:32,701
(A few days later)

1835
01:45:36,071 --> 01:45:38,640
(Just be honest.)

1836
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:43,650
(Yu Ra, do what you want so that you won't have regrets.)

1837
01:45:43,651 --> 01:45:47,420
(That's my style anyway.)

1838
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:50,919
(I do things when I want.)

1839
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:56,090
(Ra Yun, I want to know what you're thinking.)

1840
01:45:57,691 --> 01:45:59,660
(I won't take this path...)

1841
01:45:59,661 --> 01:46:01,360
(since I'm scared and worried and the end is obvious.)

1842
01:46:01,361 --> 01:46:02,831
(So I won't begin it.)

1843
01:46:05,241 --> 01:46:09,170
(There's tension between them.)

1844
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:15,610
(What will be the swirl of emotions regarding one man?)

1845
01:46:15,611 --> 01:46:19,180
(What will be the swirl of emotions regarding one man?)

1846
01:46:22,521 --> 01:46:24,191
What did we watch just now?

1847
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:29,531
Isn't that a love rectangle then?

1848
01:46:30,361 --> 01:46:31,730
- That's right.
- Is that it?

1849
01:46:31,731 --> 01:46:33,429
Gosh, that was...

1850
01:46:33,430 --> 01:46:34,830
We don't know what will happen.

1851
01:46:34,831 --> 01:46:36,071
That's right.

1852
01:46:36,470 --> 01:46:38,300
Why is Hyeon U in that group?

1853
01:46:39,170 --> 01:46:41,170
- Hyeon U looks so haggard.
- Seriously.

1854
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:42,710
Why...

1855
01:46:45,741 --> 01:46:48,110

I think this is the bagel.

1860
01:47:18,010 --> 01:47:19,010
Isn't it this one?

1861
01:47:19,781 --> 01:47:21,280
- Is it this one?
- It's what we made yesterday.

1862
01:47:21,281 --> 01:47:22,650
Really?

1863
01:47:22,651 --> 01:47:24,180
- You have something on your face.
- Where?

1864
01:47:24,581 --> 01:47:25,920
- Help.
- You should see a mirror.

1865
01:47:26,021 --> 01:47:27,821
- It's a blob of chocolate.
- Really?

1866
01:47:28,151 --> 01:47:29,151
I'll be back.

1867
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:32,720
Please wipe it off.

1868

1870
01:47:41,930 --> 01:47:43,031
It looks like a mole.

1871
01:47:43,331 --> 01:47:44,871
I thought it was a mole.

1872
01:47:45,170 --> 01:47:46,470
Of course, it isn't a mole.

1873
01:47:48,571 --> 01:47:49,670
Is that all?

1874
01:47:49,771 --> 01:47:51,781
- Yes.
- That isn't what I'm talking about.

1875
01:47:53,311 --> 01:47:54,311
- All good?
- Yes.
