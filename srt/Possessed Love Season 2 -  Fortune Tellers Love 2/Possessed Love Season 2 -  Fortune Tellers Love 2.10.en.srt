1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,270
(All statements related
to shamanism and fortune-telling...)

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,340
(made by the cast
in this program...)

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,380
(are purely personal opinions.)

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,190
Gosh. It's so exhausting.

5
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,380
(Fortune Tellers' Love 2)

6
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,290
(Comedian Shin Dong Yeob)

7
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,450
(Actress Yoo In Na)

8
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,920
That was a short clip, but there were
so many unpredictable moments.

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,730
Byeong Yeol was waiting
for Yu Gyeong,

10
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,130
and she was taking too long,

11
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,530
so he got worried.

12
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,400
And Kyung Eon.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,140
And Ho Am who's watching her
with a worried heart...

14
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,470
Yes. That's right.

15
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,510
And there's Yun Jeong
who's watching them.

16
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,670
That's right.

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,380
- Goodness.
- This is a mess.

18
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,880
This is the final episode
of Fortune Tellers' Love 2.

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,550
The participants have
only the final selection left.

20
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,860
Fate or heart? We're wondering...

21
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,520
which they will choose.

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,160
- I can't wait to find out.
- This is the last episode.

23
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,330
Oh, my.

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,900
(Yu Gyeong and Sang Hyeok
are returning after the date.)

25
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,030
They must be home by now.

26
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,400
Do you think so?

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,570
Won't they stay out
for a long time today?

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,340
- But I had two dates today,
- Yes.

29
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,640
so there must have been
someone who never got a date.

30
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,180
Right.

31
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,610
(Staring)

32
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,650
What?

33
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,290
When I saw you nod from the side,

34
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,490
it seemed like the nod of a winner.

35
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,060
That's not what I mean.

36
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,090
That wasn't it.

37
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,030
I'm not that mean.

38
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,360
That's not being mean.

39
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,630
You were just thinking,
"I must be pretty good."

40
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,470
- "Maybe I'm a great guy."
- No.

41
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,410
(The two seem much closer
after the first date.)

42
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,850
It was so much fun, though.

43
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,120
I also had a lot of fun.

44
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,720
Today? Or with me?

45
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,750
With you.

46
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,620
- It was fun.
- I got to talk to you...

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,930
- for a long time today.
- Yes.

48
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,830
So, it was fun. It was nice.

49
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,870
Same. I had a lot of fun.

50
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,570
- I have a question.
- Yes.

51
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,640
- If you could turn back time...
- Yes?

52
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,610
to the first day, what would you do?

53
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,310
Do you have something?

54
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,420
I would...

55
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,220
talk to you more.

56
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,290
- You and me in the past?
- Yes.

57
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,590
It's so much fun,
now that I'm talking to you.

58
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,890
- So...
- That's true. If we had talked,

59
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,900
we would have had more fun
in the house.

60
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,400
- Yes, that's what I'm wondering.
- Right.

61
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,170
That's why you need good chemistry.

62
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,070
- I think we have good chemistry.
- Exactly.

63
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,540
It's rare to find someone like that.

64
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,640
I know.

65
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,380
(At that time)

66
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,850
We should start eating.

67
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,280
It'll get cold.

68
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,660
(Their last dinner is...)

69
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,530
(nicely cooked meat and cold beer.)

70
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,360
Let's have a beer each.
What would you like?

71
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,800
I'll take the non-alcoholic one.

72
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,130
Me too.

73
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,840
I'll have the same one.

74
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,540
(They all have non-alcoholic beers
before the final selection.)

75
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,040
Yes, it's a beer party!

76
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,350
- Thanks for the past week.
- Cheers.

77
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,080
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

78
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,820
(Gulping)

79
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,320
(Exclaiming)

80
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,460
It's certainly less pressure
because it's non-alcoholic.

81
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,460
I know. It's so refreshing.

82
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,730
(Gulping)

83
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,630
It's refreshing.

84
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,030
It certainly is.

85
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,700
(It even makes
the food taste better.)

86
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,010
You cooked the ribs well.

87
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,410
(Peeking)

88
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,480
(Reading the room)

89
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,590
(He seems anxious for some reason.)

90
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,050
(Glancing)

91
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,290
I thought it'd be
a loud barbecue party.

92
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,990
It's gotten so quiet.

93
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,370
(They're worried that two people
haven't returned yet.)

94
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,800
Gosh, it's cold.

95
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,040
(The two finally returned.)

96
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,570
You should wear your coat.

97
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,770
Hold this for me.

98
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,510
(Taking it)

99
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,910
- And this.
- Let's go. Okay.

100
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,340
- Come.
- Thanks.

101
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,150
This place looks
prettier than usual.

102
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,250
It does.
Do you want to go there later?

103
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,650
I'd like that. It's so beautiful.

104
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,760
- Head inside.
- Thank you.

105
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,230
(The two break the silence.)

106
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,200
- They're coming.
- They're here.

107
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,200
They must have had so much fun.

108
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,600
(Turning)

109
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,670
What time is it?

110
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,370
(Everyone looks at the entrance.)

111
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,780
Okay. Do you want your phone back?

112
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,250
- Just hold your phone.
- Thank you.

113
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,450
(Surprised)

114
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,720
Oh, my gosh!

115
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,350
- They're subtly telling everyone...
- Yes.

116
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,460
- how the date went.
- "This is a thing now."

117
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,660
- Exactly.
- Maybe one of them is...

118
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,790
doing that on purpose to tell them.

119
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,600
If he carries her purse
all the way to her room,

120
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,200
- That's a sign.
- it may get a bit embarrassing.

121
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,100
- That's what only couples do.
- It is.

122
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,700
Will they go upstairs like that?

123
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,080
Who do you think went on dates
together?

124
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,110
What?

125
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,410
Hi.

126
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,020
- Hi.
- Hello.

127
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,450
Long time no see.

128
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,090
Hi.

129
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,860
(Glancing)

130
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,190
My preferred animal?

131
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,190
(Byeong Yeol tries to ignore them.)

132
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,130
It has to be a mouse.

133
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,930
- I'll put this here.
- Okay.

134
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,480
Where should we sit?

135
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,880
(There's a subtle change in the air
as they enter.)

136
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,650
I'm so full.

137
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,920
- You must have had delicious food.
- What?

138
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,060
You must have had delicious food.

139
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,260
- Yes.
- What did you have?

140
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,190
What was it?

141
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,760
Japanese omakase?

142
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,300
Really? That's awesome.

143
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,370
- I bet it was good.
- We had delicious food.

144
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,040
(Sighing)

145
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,980
To be honest, I wasn't so glad...

146
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,110
that they came back late.

147
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,650
I was a bit jealous, thinking,

148
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,920
"They must have had a good time."

149
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,590
I tried not to look. If I did,

150
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,460
I thought I'd feel bothered.

151
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,430
But I'm not sure now.

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,630
Let's play a Game of Truth.

153
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,200
- Sure.
- Game of Truth.

154
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,410
But I don't think any of us
is good at lying.

155
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,980
I know, right?
I don't see any good liars here.

156
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,040
I'm nervous.

157
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,050
(The Game of Truth will tell them
their true feelings.)

158
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,020
Why isn't anyone asking?

159
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,750
I feel too comfortable.

160
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,690
(The fortune tellers can't
seem to start asking.)

161
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,700
May I go first?

162
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,870
(Ho Am volunteered to go first.)

163
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,300
(Surprised)

164
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,510
Awesome.

165
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,710
I have a question for Sang Hyeok.

166
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,080
Between yesterday's date
and today's date,

167
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,880
which did you like more?

168
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,720
Can you answer me?

169
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,620
(Ho Am asked a sharp question
out of nowhere.)

170
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,290
(Startled)

171
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,590
- He's going to make him say that?
- "Say it to everyone."

172
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,790
Oh, my gosh.

173
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,960
Yesterday was Kyung Eon.

174
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,760
- Today...
- It was Yun Jeong and Yu Gyeong.

175
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,800
- Oh, no.
- What should he do?

176
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,000
What should he do?

177
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,700
I can't watch this game.

178
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,300
This is so wild.

179
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,670
(Entertained)

180
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,870
(Without a word,)

181
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,910
(two women wait for his answer.)

182
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,980
(Sighing)

183
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,250
(Nervous)

184
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,990
That's a bit...

185
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,860
Well...

186
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,640
(He hesitates.)

187
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,710
(Glancing)

188
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,340
No way.

189
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,150
Do I have to pick one?

190
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,650
- Of course.
- Just one.

191
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,880
- You're supposed to pick one.
- He's scary.

192
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,020
(Sang Hyeok is torn,)

193
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,790
(and Kyung Eon watches him.)

194
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,990
We need your answer.

195
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,360
This doesn't seem fair.

196
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,520
I don't think I should answer.

197
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,060
You can also say,
"I can't pick one."

198
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,530
- Really?
- Yes.

199
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:02,070
(What's Sang Hyeok's decision
after a long deliberation?)

200
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,210
I'll pick one.

201
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,450
- I can pick one.
- Really?

202
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,080
- Although I can,
- Yes.

203
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,520
I don't want to say it.

204
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,830
(Sang Hyeok evaded the answer.)

205
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,360
Then, that's not the Game of Truth!

206
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,460
You said you wanted to play
the Game of Truth.

207
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,400
- What is this?
- Hang on.

208
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,300
- What's going on?
- But...

209
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,470
- Kyung Eon is startled.
- She is.

210
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,670
The fact that he can't decide...

211
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,210
- makes her so flustered.
- Right.

212
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,040
Nothing happened
between him and her...

213
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,750
- after Kyung Eon's date today.
- Yes.

214
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,350
She wasn't certain...

215
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,750
that he'd definitely pick her,
but...

216
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,020
- Oh, she wasn't.
- They were on the same boat.

217
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,390
Yes, that's what it felt like
for her,

218
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,720
but now she's thinking,
"He's that certain he can pick one?"

219
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,490
"Maybe it's not me."
Won't she think that?

220
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,730
Look at her face.

221
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,900
I don't want to say it.

222
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,800
(Who is Sang Hyeok certain about?)

223
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,640
(Shocked)

224
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,540
(Exclaiming)

225
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,480
That's all from me.

226
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,050
(Sang Hyeok finished
his ambiguous answer.)

227
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,350
(Staring)

228
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,060
- I'll ask Sang Hyeok once more.
- Again?

229
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,830
- I'll ask Sang Hyeok once more.
- Again?

230
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,730
Why do you do this to me?

231
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,900
What's your deal with him?

232
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,900
- You're giving me a hard time.
- Clear eyes are the scariest.

233
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,130
You're putting me on the spot.

234
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,470
(Glaring)

235
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,740
Sang Hyeok, I was wondering...

236
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,340
which woman you would pick.

237
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,280
Have you found one now?

238
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,210
The one to pick
in the final selection.

239
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:56,290
(Ho Am's question has become
even sharper.)

240
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,460
(Will he give an answer this time?)

241
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,430
Yes.

242
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,540
Her complexion changed.

243
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,180
- No way.
- This is amazing.

244
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,580
She looks incredibly sad.

245
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,950
- I would have been so offended.
- Of course.

246
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,150
They had so much fun yesterday.

247
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,490
I feel so bad right now.

248
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,890
Is that the same person
from the previous question?

249
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,800
It's not your turn,

250
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,200
- so I won't answer.
- Okay.

251
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,170
When it's my turn...

252
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,140
Please stop asking me.

253
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,940
It'll be boring tomorrow
if you find out too much.

254
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,440
It should be entertaining tomorrow.

255
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:57,650
(Who is he certain about?)

256
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,590
(It gets awkward in the room.)

257
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,030
I have a question, Byeong Yeol.

258
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,800
Her eyes scare me.

259
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,430
Why?

260
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,400
Are you...

261
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,740
determined...

262
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,440
to keep dating the person
when the show ends?

263
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,510
Yes.

264
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,980
Yes.

265
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,750
Amazing.

266
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,880
- That was quick.
- That's so cool.

267
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,780
(Byeong Yeol answered
without hesitation.)

268
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,350
Are you willing to accept
what she does for a living?

269
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,520
Whether it's tarot reading,
consulting, or shamanism?

270
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,360
I'll just have to try.

271
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,360
That's admirable.

272
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,170
Once I make up my mind,

273
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,200
I'll have to keep trying
to make it work.

274
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,540
That's what I believe.

275
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,040
That was a clear answer, though.

276
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,780
(Reading her face)

277
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,050
That was the clearest answer.

278
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,090
(Yu Gyeong is unreadable
at the moment.)

279
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,620
Yu Gyeong.

280
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,690
- Me?
- Yes.

281
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,590
(Byeong Yeol picked Yu Gyeong.)

282
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,800
Oh, gosh.

283
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,200
(Byeong Yeol picked Yu Gyeong.)

284
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,070
I wonder
if you've made up your mind.

285
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:37,680
(Byeong Yeol asked
if she was certain now.)

286
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,250
(Nervous)

287
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:45,560
(What's her answer?)

288
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,360
My mind?

289
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,630
I'm about 1,000 percent sure.

290
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,530
(Surprised)

291
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,770
This is confusing.

292
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,240
Byeong Yeol may think,
"Is it me, or someone else?"

293
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,410
But I don't think it was
enough chemistry with Sang Hyeok...

294
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,710
to call it 1,000 percent.

295
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,010
- I think she means Sang Hyeok.
- Right?

296
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,210
- Really?
- The atmosphere in the car was...

297
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,710
- enough to be 1,000 percent.
- But 1,000 percent?

298
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,450
- But it was such a short time.
- Exactly. I'm not so sure.

299
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,120
- I don't think...
- Isn't it him?

300
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,720
we can be sure that it's Sang Hyeok.

301
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,390
- Something's stopping me.
- I'm the same.

302
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,500
If it's 1,000 percent,
is it Byeong Yeol?

303
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,830
I have no idea.
Let's just keep watching.

304
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,160
- We'll keep watching.
- Yes.

305
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,400
I'm done asking questions.

306
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:37,540
(They can't figure out
who she's choosing from her answer.)

307
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,550
I want to ask Sang Hyeok.

308
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,480
- Me?
- Yes.

309
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,890
- He's popular.
- He's popular.

310
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,990
Who are you most attracted to?

311
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,060
Isn't that too tricky?

312
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,700
Why are you doing this to me?

313
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,200
(Will they get
a clear answer this time?)

314
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,110
This is truly
about the innermost feelings.

315
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,540
(Sighing)

316
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,950
It's wicked,
but we're allowed to ask that.

317
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,520
This is getting interesting.

318
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,950
You keep getting more beers.

319
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,190
(Sang Hyeok is torn
while everyone else pays attention.)

320
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,420
- You've become an observer.
- He's practically watching TV.

321
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,660
I'm an observer now.

322
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,690
(Sang Hyeok is torn
while everyone else pays attention.)

323
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,670
(Glancing)

324
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,840
He's having a mental breakdown.

325
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,010
It's not that serious!

326
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,650
I can't do this right now.

327
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,250
(He gave up on answering.)

328
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,920
He's a nice guy.

329
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,660
(Having mixed feelings)

330
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:09,770
(The waves of fate hit
the Possessed House.)

331
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:18,640
(Their emotions are in turmoil
on the last night.)

332
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:30,520
(The uncomfortable Game of Truth
led to a fateful tug-of-war.)

333
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,390
(Kyung Eon storms out of the room.)

334
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,260
(Looking)

335
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,660
I don't think so.

336
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,430
There are cheaper ones.

337
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,440
(She came into the room
all by herself.)

338
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,650
(Sighing)

339
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,860
The disappointment I felt
during the Game of Truth?

340
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,430
I guess I wanted to confirm that.

341
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:13,200
I wanted to quietly ask him
about the question...

342
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,800
that he couldn't answer
in front of everyone.

343
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,070
- When are you going to bed?
- I will now.

344
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,470
- Now?
- Yes.

345
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,570
(She quietly sat
next to Sang Hyeok.)

346
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,310
(Whispering)

347
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,210
(While things were noisy,)

348
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,250
(she asked to talk to him.)

349
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,520
Are you serious?

350
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,650
That's a relief.
I thought she was punching him.

351
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,650
(Bursting into laughter)

352
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,360
- She said she liked to work out.
- Yes.

353
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,020
- And kick him.
- "Stand straight."

354
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,530
- "Come here."
- She said she worked out.

355
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,960
- She did.
- Yes.

356
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,030
Well...

357
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,000
You know, I just...

358
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,740
(Hesitating)

359
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,740
I just...

360
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,110
I guess I was hoping...

361
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,950
that you'd say
the date with me was more fun.

362
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,990
But your answer sounded...

363
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,620
a bit too ambiguous.

364
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,890
- Oh, up there?
- Yes.

365
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,060
But I...

366
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,630
tried not to show it.

367
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,070
Did you want me to pay attention?

368
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,200
(Scoffing)

369
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,370
(She wants to hear
a definitive answer.)

370
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,110
(What are his true feelings
toward Kyung Eon?)

371
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,410
(And these two are sitting
in the living room.)

372
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,780
- When did you come back?
- What?

373
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,780
When did you come back?

374
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,950
I was the first one.

375
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,190
I think it was around 6:30 or 6 p.m.

376
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,760
How was it?
Did you know who I was going with?

377
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,660
- You didn't, right? At first.
- I had no clue.

378
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,730
I was hoping
it wouldn't be Sang Hyeok.

379
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,430
He's handsome.

380
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,500
He was a good guy.

381
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,800
- Sang Hyeok? He's a good guy.
- Yes.

382
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,240
(Sighing)

383
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,950
What is it?

384
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,790
(He keeps drinking his beer
without talking.)

385
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,030
(Exhaling)

386
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:29,170
(There's tension between them.)

387
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,440
(Glaring)

388
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,240
What are you thinking about?

389
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,240
- Nothing.
- Is that right?

390
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,680
(Pondering)

391
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,180
(He wants to know
what's on her mind.)

392
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,620
If you could turn back time...

393
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,190
- during your time here,
- Yes?

394
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,090
is there a moment
you want to go back to?

395
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,330
- No.
- No?

396
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,390
No. I regret nothing.

397
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,370
You know,
talking to you and everything.

398
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:05,200
(She asked the same question
she asked Sang Hyeok.)

399
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,740
(Sang Hyeok comes upstairs
at that moment.)

400
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,710
(Glancing)

401
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,110
I should go back to bed early.

402
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,220
I have to.

403
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,920
The three are in the same room?

404
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,650
Just watching them
makes me uncomfortable.

405
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,920
He must have found it
incredibly awkward.

406
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,160
It makes me so uncomfortable.

407
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,890
(Even the master saju reader
can't handle this discomfort.)

408
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,070
He just reacted
as a viewer watching from home.

409
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,130
"This is so uncomfortable."

410
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,440
(Embarrassed)

411
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,640
- He just blurted it out.
- Right.

412
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,610
- It makes me very uncomfortable.
- That's true.

413
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,770
It is uncomfortable.

414
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,740
- That was so funny.
- I wonder...

415
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,580
how he finished the chat...

416
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,880
- with Kyung Eon.
- Right.

417
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,410
Anyway, he's here.

418
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,180
- That was hilarious.
- This is tough.

419
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,950
You two must be exhausted
because you both...

420
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,950
had two dates.

421
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,990
I'm fine, but he must be tired.

422
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,860
You both had two dates,
and you had to drive around.

423
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,560
I don't know
if you made up your mind or not,

424
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,530
but I'm sure you have...

425
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,670
some worries about tomorrow.

426
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,110
- I think it's natural.
- Yes, I agree.

427
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,410
It was such a short time, after all.

428
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,680
I believe it's fair to pick...

429
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,580
the person that occurs to me...

430
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,620
at that moment.

431
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,150
- Also, I'm...
- Yes?

432
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,560
cautious about it.

433
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,160
- Right.
- Toward other women?

434
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,330
Well, not just women.

435
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,700
Everyone's feeling anxious
about tomorrow.

436
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,370
- There's still uncertainty.
- Right.

437
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,300
- They must have picked someone.
- Right.

438
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,570
We'll all feel hurt
if it doesn't work out.

439
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,580
Do you think you'll feel hurt?

440
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,910
I wouldn't...
Well, it would make me feel sad.

441
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,480
Although it'll make me sad,

442
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,120
- I don't think I'll regret it.
- Right.

443
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,690
- Just the fact that I got to...
- Right.

444
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,890
- express my feelings for her.
- That's true.

445
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,660
Also, it doesn't mean that
I'm done with her...

446
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,400
just because the show ends.

447
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,700
- You're right.
- Even when it ends,

448
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,440
if I'm sure that she's my destiny...

449
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,200
and that my feelings for her
are genuine,

450
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,470
I can keep trying.

451
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,470
That's admirable.

452
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,410
I only do the talking.

453
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,750
I feel like you'll actually do it.
It's admirable.

454
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,080
(Byeong Yeol is lost in thought
as the other two talk.)

455
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,180
I can't organize my thoughts.

456
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,090
(Meanwhile, Yun Jeong
paces around the staircase.)

457
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,560
Why am I so afraid?

458
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,860
Oh, please.
I hope I make up my mind.

459
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,370
Oh, no!

460
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,570
(She keeps wanting to hide.)

461
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,570
Come on.

462
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,510
(Ho Am is near her.)

463
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,580
I don't think I can do this.

464
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,480
No.

465
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,660
I've never really expressed...

466
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,520
my feelings.

467
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,690
It's the last day,

468
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,360
and some may think it's too late.

469
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,170
But now that I've come this far,
I decided to do it.

470
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,780
(She heard Ho Am's footsteps.)

471
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,040
Here.

472
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,480
No!

473
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,050
- I was here.
- I see.

474
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,250
(She asked to talk to him
after deliberation.)

475
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,160
(Restless)

476
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,930
(Thinking)

477
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Actually,

478
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,600
the blessing fee...

479
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,410
was a lie.

480
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,380
- Which one? The fee itself?
- What?

481
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,880
- Yes.
- What do you mean?

482
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,050
When I asked you to take me out.

483
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,790
The fee was an excuse.

484
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,960
I used that as an excuse...

485
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,260
to talk to you outside.

486
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,200
I wanted some time for ourselves.

487
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,970
So, that's what I did.

488
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,740
I wish I could speak better!

489
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,980
Why can't I say it out loud?
It's so frustrating.

490
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,850
There are no good or bad ways
of speaking.

491
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,510
You just speak how you want.

492
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,050
Exactly.

493
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,890
No!

494
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,020
It's so...

495
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,890
(What she wanted to tell him)

496
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,860
In this house,

497
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,460
I used to beat around the bush
to tell you...

498
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,330
that I liked you.

499
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,970
But it wasn't that obvious
as there were others around.

500
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:14,610
So, it was tough for me
to express myself.

501
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,080
I think I did try to avoid...

502
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,520
Yes, I avoided it.

503
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,520
I couldn't find the right moment,

504
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:28,090
and I wasn't sure if it was okay...

505
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,130
to express them.

506
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,830
But...

507
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,230
now that I'm here,

508
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,870
at least now,

509
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,300
I'll regret it if I don't.

510
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,040
I'll regret it.

511
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,510
And...

512
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:53,220
since the first date we went on,

513
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,990
I've gradually liked you more.

514
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,390
(I liked you, Ho Am.)

515
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,790
I liked you.

516
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,930
(I liked you, Ho Am.)

517
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,260
(Yun Jeong musters up her courage
and expresses her feelings.)

518
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,030
(Touched)

519
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,870
(Amazed)

520
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,940
It's like we're watching...

521
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,610
a caterpillar transforming
into a butterfly, right?

522
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,170
(Like the transformation,
Yun Jeong has grown.)

523
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:20,540
Yun Jeong rarely expresses herself,
but considering what she just said,

524
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,010
- she's given him everything.
- That's right.

525
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,150
We must weigh more importance
on her action given her personality.

526
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,150
- That's right.
- It's the degree of importance.

527
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,120
You could say that she shared
her innermost feelings with him.

528
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,520
- Right.
- So he must feel something for her.

529
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,020
- Great job.
- Yes.

530
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,860
- Yes.
- Gosh, that hit the spot.

531
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,160
Gosh, you're telling me this
the day before the final selection.

532
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,570
Right. I know it's pretty late,

533
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,830
but I'm still telling you
how I feel.

534
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,870
Yes.

535
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,940
- Anyway, I wanted to tell you that.
- First of all...

536
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,550
First of all, thank you for
telling me how you feel.

537
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,790
If you hadn't mustered up your courage
and told me how you felt,

538
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,950
I would have never found out
about these precious feelings...

539
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,220
- you had, you know?
- Right.

540
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,430
So I'm grateful that
you're telling me how you feel.

541
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,270
Hey, telling you about my feelings
feels great.

542
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,070
- But I didn't sound cool.
- No, you sounded very cool.

543
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,070
(What kind of change
will her confession bring...)

544
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,070
(to his final selection?)

545
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,170
You were cool.

546
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:30,350
(The last day in the Possessed House
has dawned.)

547
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,790
What a pleasant morning.

548
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,930
But we'll be sad soon enough, right?

549
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:51,770
(Unlike other days,
they spend a quiet morning.)

550
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:00,940
(The gong suddenly
breaks the silence.)

551
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,210
I'm getting nervous again.

552
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,690
Today is the day
of your final selection.

553
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,520
Before your final selection,
you're allowed to perform...

554
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,390
one last reading on the heart
of a resident of your choice.

555
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,900
(It's their last chance to find out
about each other's feelings...)

556
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,140
(before the final selection.)

557
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:35,750
(How will their last conversation
affect the results?)

558
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,110
Gosh, this is their last talk.

559
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,720
My gosh, my heart is pounding.

560
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:40,920
Same here.

561
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,090
They must be sad to think
that this is the last conversation.

562
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,820
- That must be a natural feeling.
- Right. All of them...

563
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,690
- It's like the last day of a trip.
- Right.

564
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,730
(What will they discuss
before the final selection?)

565
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,730
Oh, no.

566
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,560
(Glancing)

567
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,300
(Pondering)

568
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,870
(No one seems to be able to step up
for the last conversation.)

569
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,780
(Who will make the first move?)

570
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,650
- But where are the others?
- Until what time?

571
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,320
- Why are the other guys not here?
- He's running away.

572
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,390
Are they already outside?

573
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,620
- There you are.
- Hi.

574
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,720
- Good morning.
- Hi.

575
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,430
- He sounds so carefree.
- Hello.

576
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,060
(Byeong Yeol quickly goes upstairs.)

577
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,570
(Rummaging)

578
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,270
Oh, right.

579
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,340
(He grabs his saju notebook.)

580
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,850
Okay. Here I go.

581
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,180
(Meanwhile, Yun Jeong
hangs around the 2nd floor.)

582
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,590
(Stopping)

583
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,590
My gosh. I should do this.

584
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,420
I must do this.

585
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,460
(She has Ho Am's medal in her hand
as if it's a talisman.)

586
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,530
No.

587
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,060
Get a grip. Hold on.

588
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,000
No, Yun Jeong. Don't be weak.

589
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,270
(Don't be weak)

590
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:08,100
(Don't be weak)

591
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:13,910
(She chants a spell
to herself in the mirror.)

592
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,680
(She leaves the room again
after bracing herself.)

593
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,890
(Yun Jeong ends up
sitting down in the living room.)

594
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:36,200
(What is she hesitating to do?)

595
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,410
How was it? I had to keep staying
in this posture.

596
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,740
I had to keep looking up.

597
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,410
- Because you were nervous?
- I'm hungry.

598
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,210
What will you eat that with?

599
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,210
(Byeong Yeol keeps hovering
around Yu Gyeong.)

600
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,050
(Tapping)

601
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:02,430
(He quietly gets
Yu Gyeong's attention.)

602
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,830
(Can I have a moment with you?)

603
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,470
(Yu Gyeong leaves after Byeong Yeol
with a mysterious expression.)

604
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,840
- Are you curious?
- What?

605
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,570
Curious? Do you want to know?

606
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:17,640
Yes. Let's go.

607
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,540
- Gosh, I'm scared.
- Go somewhere else.

608
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,840
- We're here because...
- I'm scared.

609
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,010
- our legs hurt. What is it?
- Come and sit down.

610
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,280
We're having a serious talk.

611
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,720
(He waits for Yu Gyeong's answer.)

612
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,760
(At that time, Ho Am shows up.)

613
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,760
(Glancing)

614
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,340
(Stopping)

615
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,040
(The two guys gather
by Yu Gyeong's side.)

616
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,310
(Ho Am sits next to Yu Gyeong.)

617
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,350
(Anxious and nervous)

618
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,050
Yu Gyeong, come here. Over there.

619
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,730
(Byeong Yeol quickly
pulls Yu Gyeong aside.)

620
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,100
Gosh, seriously.

621
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,870
You're scaring me.
Why do you look so serious?

622
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,530
What is it?

623
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,870
Let's go and talk.

624
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:23,870
(Let's talk one last time.)

625
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,210
- What do you want to ask me?
- So...

626
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,010
We'll talk about it there.

627
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:29,810
What?

628
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,050
I'm nervous.

629
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,380
I'm nervous.
What are you going to ask me?

630
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,960
I felt that we didn't have
enough time to talk in private.

631
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,020
I wanted to express how I felt too.

632
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,560
And I also wanted to hear
where she stood.

633
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,870
That's why I decided to ask her
to have one last talk.

634
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,540
Let's go.

635
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,040
- Have a nice talk. See you later.
- Okay.

636
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:03,550
(Ho Am missed his chance
when she was right in front of him.)

637
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,080
Is there someone
you want to talk to?

638
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,420
I'm thinking.

639
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,620
(Surprised)

640
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,920
- So it's not over until it is?
- What?

641
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,360
It's not over until it is.

642
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,690
It's probably the person
you're thinking of.

643
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,560
It's the person we're thinking of?

644
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,240
When I asked him,

645
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,640
he gave me a loaded smile.

646
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,110
Could it be her?

647
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:39,720
(Whom could Ho Am be thinking of?)

648
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:48,020
(Meanwhile, Yun Jeong has been
thinking for quite some time.)

649
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,430
I've decided.

650
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:56,430
There are other people too.
So I must stay focused.

651
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,300
I won't sound smooth
if I'm too caught up in my head.

652
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,140
(Glancing)

653
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,780
(Plopping down)

654
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,750
(Yun Jeong drops down again.)

655
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,250
(To reach Ho Am,)

656
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,860
(she only has to take
a few more steps.)

657
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:30,600
(Will she be able to muster up
her courage again?)

658
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,970
(Amazed)

659
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,240
Have some apples.

660
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,410
An apple in the morning
keeps the doctor away.

661
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,610
Should I bring some forks?

662
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,840
No, it's fine.

663
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,150
- This is amazing.
- Thank you.

664
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,210
Sure.

665
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:52,760
(Sang Hyeok looks around
the Pavilion of Connections.)

666
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,990
(Turning around)

667
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,600
Kyung Eon, you're not going
to the Pavilion of Connections?

668
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,430
(Nodding)

669
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,100
I'll just follow my heart
for the final selection.

670
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,470
(Impressed)

671
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,080
Kyung Eon is gutsier than you think.

672
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,280
She's gutsier than you think.

673
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,350
(Staring)

674
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,450
(Meanwhile, Yun Jeong is thinking
on the staircase.)

675
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,490
Okay.

676
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,190
Here I go.

677
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,000
(Taking a deep breath)

678
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,640
(Stopping)

679
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:47,580
(She finally sets out.)

680
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,050
(Smiling)

681
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,210
- I want to sit here.
- Sure.

682
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,820
Did you have the talk?

683
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,520
No, not yet.

684
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,960
Are you eating fruit?

685
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,530
Try the apples. They're good.

686
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,230
(Glancing)

687
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,400
Let's go to
the Pavilion of Connections later.

688
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,840
(Let's go to
the Pavilion of Connections later.)

689
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,880
Sure.

690
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:28,450
(They suddenly
start clapping for her.)

691
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,190
- Seon Ho's wish finally came true.
- Yes.

692
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,920
- It finally came true.
- "Let's talk at the pavilion."

693
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,860
That was neat.

694
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,390
- It doesn't look like a big deal.
- Right.

695
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,430
But once you're in that situation,
it's not easy.

696
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,530
Okay. Let's go.

697
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,430
Okay. You can do this.

698
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,500
Sure.

699
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,540
(She gathered her courage
to ask him.)

700
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,770
(Finding her cute)

701
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,180
(Feeling proud)

702
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,720
This time around, I decided...

703
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,490
to put more weight on my feelings...

704
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,190
without hesitation.

705
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,090
I'll be back.

706
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:15,730
Yun Jeong.
Make sure to put on a jacket.

707
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:16,830
- Should I?
- Yes.

708
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:18,830
A jacket?

709
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,740
(Ho Am comes in to grab a jacket.)

710
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:31,050
(Then he spots something.)

711
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,520
(Staring)

712
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:48,830
(Yu Gyeong's shadow is reflected
on the window.)

713
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:56,740
(Yu Gyeong and Byeong Yeol
are talking on the balcony.)

714
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,480
I can tell you have something
to tell me, but you're struggling.

715
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,610
I can see that.

716
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,380
(Glancing)

717
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,320
(As Ho Am leaves the room,)

718
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,460
(he can't stop looking
at Yu Gyeong.)

719
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:21,260
(What kind of conversation
are they having one last time?)

720
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,030
Let's go.

721
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:28,040
(Yun Jeong and Ho Am head over
to the Pavilion of Connections.)

722
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,080
(Nervous)

723
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,430
(The two of them are sitting across
from each other...)

724
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,630
(after her confession
from the night before.)

725
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,730
(The last thing Yun Jeong wants...)

726
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:59,340
(to tell Ho Am)

727
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,070
(Smiling brightly)

728
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,320
(Hesitant)

729
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,420
You... How should I put it?

730
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,530
You shone like a gem.

731
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:30,000
(You shone like a gem.)

732
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,630
- A gem?
- Yes.

733
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,400
How should I put it?

734
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,140
When I was with you...

735
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,340
and we spent time together,

736
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,480
it was the way I felt.

737
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,020
I was fascinated by
my behavior around you.

738
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,790
So you were the only one...

739
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,590
I...

740
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,630
considered dating in real life.

741
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,360
But you were...

742
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:03,870
like this precious gem to me.

743
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,200
So this precious gem...

744
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,610
(So this precious gem...)

745
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,310
I thought,
"I can't afford to lose such a gem."

746
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:16,610
(I can't afford to lose such a gem.)

747
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,680
That crossed my mind.

748
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,050
I thought you were really cool.

749
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,620
(After a long battle
with her hesitation,)

750
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,890
(she shares her feelings
from the bottom of her heart.)

751
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:33,160
(Getting emotional)

752
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,930
- Her confession is precious...
- Seriously. Yes.

753
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:36,230
like a gem.

754
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,170
- Totally.
- What a precious confession.

755
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,440
(Her sincere confession is
precious like a gem.)

756
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,870
Her journey to reach this point
was difficult.

757
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,910
But once she made up her mind,
she went for it. And seeing that...

758
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,040
- makes me admire her.
- Yes.

759
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,580
Yun Jeong told him that
he shone like a gem.

760
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,920
- It was the sincerest version...
- Right.

761
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,420
- of "I like you."
- Yes.

762
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,650
It's the most emotional confession.

763
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,820
That was a courageous move
from Yun Jeong.

764
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,360
I did a reading on you before.
That's why...

765
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,330
I know exactly how much courage
you had to gather...

766
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,030
- to tell me these things.
- I see.

767
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,470
Since I know that,
I'm more grateful.

768
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,910
It must've been a challenge
to be this courageous.

769
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,610
You know...

770
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,520
I thought that was my only option.

771
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,120
(I thought that was my only option.)

772
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:37,330
(Yun Jeong's sincere feelings
reach Ho Am's heart.)

773
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,600
I couldn't afford not to.

774
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,600
I kept telling myself that
when I asked you to come here.

775
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,640
(Between the path
led by the heart...)

776
00:42:54,180 --> 00:43:01,150
(and the path led by fate,)

777
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:11,160
(what kind of decision
will the fortune tellers make?)

778
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,800
(Excited)

779
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,630
(Nervous)

780
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,300
They will soon make
their final selection.

781
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,840
Which couple are you rooting for
the most? Pick just one.

782
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,540
Regardless of the potential...

783
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,040
- that they're dating.
- In real life?

784
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,240
- Regardless of that?
- Right.

785
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,110
- Then I'd say Ho Am and Yun Jeong.
- Ho Am and Yun Jeong?

786
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,610
I've been shipping them...

787
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,410
- since Episode One.
- Right.

788
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,980
But I'm rooting for
Sang Hyeok and Kyung Eon.

789
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,590
It might turn out that...

790
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,150
he was certain that he'd pick her.

791
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,190
- So it had been her all along?
- Yes.

792
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:41,860
Then let me continue with that.
I'll ship Yu Gyeong and Byeong Yeol.

793
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,130
It would be great if we ended up...

794
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,830
- with those three couples.
- Yes. That would be the best.

795
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,230
It'd be great if Hyeon U and Ra Yun
also ended up together.

796
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:48,660
- Hyeon U and Ra Yun.
- Yes.

797
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:52,300
(They start getting their hopes up.)

798
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,240
My gosh. This is the moment.
It's starting.

799
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,980
(The final selection)

800
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,980
(The final selection
of the fortune tellers...)

801
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,190
(torn between their fate and heart)

802
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,500
It's time for the final selection.

803
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,510
(It's time for the final selection.)

804
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,960
(Jung Hyeon U's final selection)

805
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:32,770
Jung Hyeon U's
destined partner is...

806
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,570
Hong Yu Ra.

807
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,570
Hyeon U, will you choose Yu Ra...

808
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,840
for your final selection?

809
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,580
No.

810
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:58,590
(Hyeon U holds the fate plaque
in his hand.)

811
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,930
(He throws the fate plaque.)

812
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,510
(Passing by Ra Yun,)

813
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:18,310
(where will his heart go?)

814
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,650
(He stands in front of Yun Jeong.)

815
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,390
Yun Jeong?

816
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,190
- Yes.
- Oh, my gosh.

817
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,860
- I thought he'd go to Ra Yun.
- Yes.

818
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,100
They chose each other
based on the first impression.

819
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,470
- Right.
- Yes.

820
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,770
(Hyeon U's choice hasn't changed.)

821
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,980
(Impressed)

822
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:59,450
I was so comfortable
and had fun on our date.

823
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,390
So I think we'll have...

824
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,630
even more fun outside.

825
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,430
That's why I came.

826
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,840
I decided to express my feelings
honestly.

827
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:21,710
I was thankful for the memory.

828
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,250
(1st impression selection on Day 1)

829
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:28,280
On one hand, when I saw Yun Jeong
for the first time,

830
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,690
she caught my attention at once.

831
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,190
On the other hand,

832
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:37,760
I was like,
"What kind of feeling is this?"

833
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,190
I contemplated a little.

834
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:44,900
(Within the time
they carefully built together,)

835
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,910
(the memories with her
remained like a gift.)

836
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,940
- Be careful.
- I'm so scared.

837
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,710
Those times were precious.

838
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,680
So I think it's right to let her
make the final choice.

839
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,020
Knowing that she won't choose me...

840
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,880
doesn't change the memories.

841
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,090
(Last night)

842
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,190
I...

843
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,730
I think it'd be better
to say everything now.

844
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,200
Because this is the last day.

845
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,570
- On the first day, Ho Am came out.
- Yes.

846
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:19,430
I went out with him.

847
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,970
- Yes.
- As I went out with him,

848
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,970
I was a little disappointed
at first.

849
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:28,940
But he had an unexpected charm,

850
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,580
which I liked.

851
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:34,180
You know his charm.

852
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:38,690
It had an impact on me. I liked it.

853
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,820
Then I went out with you twice.

854
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:46,660
But I think he has been...

855
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,330
in the corner of my heart.

856
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:49,900
But I kept the door closed.

857
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,070
- I see.
- Because we were living together.

858
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,670
I didn't know what it was exactly.

859
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:00,540
I didn't know how I truly felt.

860
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,550
I ate with him today.

861
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:09,480
I wanted to talk with him privately
one more time.

862
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,650
It wasn't a date.

863
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:16,430
- I just...
- I think...

864
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:17,460
Do you think it'd be better
not to talk about it yet?

865
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,690
That'd be better.

866
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:24,730
No matter what happens, I'm fine.

867
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,400
I just wanted to say
I was thankful...

868
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,570
and you were amazing.

869
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:31,340
Right.

870
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:34,340
Yes. And I also wanted to apologize.

871
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,880
I won't say anything else.

872
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,220
Our conversation went on longer
than I expected.

873
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,420
Way longer than I expected.

874
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,150
(Yun Jeong's careful confession)

875
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,190
Anyway...

876
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:50,260
That's how it is.
There's nothing we can do about it.

877
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,500
(Hyeon U knew
she had feelings for Ho Am.)

878
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,830
- They talked too.
- They talked.

879
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:59,430
- Hyeon U...
- He's nice.

880
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,400
- is amazing too.
- He's truly amazing.

881
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,500
- He's great.
- He really is.

882
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,740
"You don't have to say more."

883
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:04,940
"No matter what you choose,
I'm fine."

884
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,410
- That was so cool.
- That was cool.

885
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,040
- He seems like an honest person.
- Yes.

886
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:13,780
I felt it during
the last conversation with her.

887
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:15,680
That she had a kind heart.

888
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,920
She's very kind.

889
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,060
That's what I felt.

890
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:24,790
In that sense, I have no regrets.

891
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:26,460
And I want nothing more.

892
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:31,100
(Hyeon U followed his heart
and confessed his feelings.)

893
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:32,930
You're amazing.

894
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:45,580
(Jung Hyeon U's final choice
is Kim Yun Jeong.)

895
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:59,460
(Hong Yu Ra's final selection)

896
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,770
Hong Yu Ra's destined partner is...

897
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:11,910
Ha Byeong Yeol.

898
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,680
Yu Ra,
will you choose Byeong Yeol...

899
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,480
for your final selection?

900
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:23,820
No.

901
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:37,770
(Yu Ra who threw the fate plaque
heads to...)

902
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:48,610
(Yu Ra stops in front of Ho Am.)

903
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,950
Really?

904
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:51,280
They had great conversations.

905
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,280
When everyone went out.

906
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,820
- They were at home all day.
- Right.

907
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,380
- Oh, right.
- They comforted each other.

908
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,150
Right. It was very comforting.

909
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,030
In the house,
whenever I had a hard time,

910
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,970
you made me laugh.
I thank you for that.

911
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,810
When I'm with him,

912
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:20,580
I feel assured.

913
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:26,580
He makes me laugh even when I'm sad.

914
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:33,390
(Why are you crying again?)

915
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:37,130
(Whenever Yu Ra had a hard time)

916
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,330
(Do you think...)

917
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:40,330
(I'll be able to hold out?)

918
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,400
(Of course, you can do that.)

919
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:50,610
(Ho Am stayed by her side.)

920
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:53,780
(Yu Ra, are you in here?)

921
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:55,340
(Can I go in?)

922
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,450
(Why are you crying?)

923
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:05,350
(I keep failing
at what I try to do.)

924
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:08,160
(Take it easy.)

925
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,390
(You need to find yourself
at a time like this.)

926
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:17,370
(He comforted her.)

927
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:21,170
Whenever I told him
about my worries,

928
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:25,210
he comforted me with a kind smile.

929
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,880
He made my concerns...

930
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,180
seem trivial.

931
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,150
It was very comforting.

932
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:50,400
(She remembers
the moments with him.)

933
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,700
It's so moving to see it this way.

934
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,700
- I know.
- Yes.

935
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,970
- Regardless of gender,
- Right.

936
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,410
- having someone like him is...
- Yes.

937
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,480
Such connections
are actually harder to find.

938
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,480
That's true.

939
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:05,810
That's so true.

940
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:20,200
(Hong Yu Ra's final choice
is Jang Ho Am.)

941
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:34,040
(Lee Ra Yun's final selection)

942
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:40,380
(Where is she heading to?)

943
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:51,890
(Ra Yun chose Hyeon U.)

944
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,810
I still don't regret it.

945
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:08,040
He always stayed with me...

946
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,810
and took care of me.

947
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,310
He was like that.

948
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:22,220
(She secretly had a hard time.)

949
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:28,530
(He came to her quietly.)

950
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:30,470
- I'm going to take a walk.
- Sorry?

951
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:31,670
I'm going to take a walk
or something.

952
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,570
Staying at home all the time
would be suffocating.

953
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:39,740
I want to pray.

954
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,740
Yes. Me too.

955
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,340
(He stayed with her.)

956
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,210
Let's hang out.

957
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:49,620
Right.

958
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:52,820
- She must've been stressed out.
- Yes.

959
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,490
- Hyeon U...
- Yes.

960
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,360
- Yes.
- is amazing.

961
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:01,330
Getting to know his character
and true feelings...

962
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:03,800
- makes him even more admirable.
- I know.

963
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:06,330
I'm sure the bond between them
got stronger...

964
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,340
over the week.

965
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,140
I was so thankful...

966
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,340
to him.

967
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,640
I felt so grateful.

968
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,540
He was such a reliable guy.

969
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,980
(Ra Yun thanks him
for the last time.)

970
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:24,650
Thank you.

971
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:38,170
(Lee Ra Yun's final choice
is Jung Hyeon U.)

972
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:47,640
Lee Kyung Eon
will make her final choice.

973
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,190
Lee Kyung Eon's
destined partner is...

974
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,460
Jung Hyeon U.

975
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:08,500
Kyung Eon,
will you choose Hyeon U...

976
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,900
for your final selection?

977
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,140
No.

978
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:34,990
(Kyung Eon stands in front of
Sang Hyeok without hesitation.)

979
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:44,270
You know what?

980
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,880
Since the first day,

981
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:56,610
my feelings haven't changed.

982
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:03,520
Since I saw him for the first time,

983
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:08,190
my feelings haven't changed,
which was interesting.

984
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,520
That's why I chose him.

985
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,760
(The first encounter with Sang Hyeok
she remembers)

986
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,500
First,
when he was walking toward me,

987
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,300
his face...

988
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:21,970
- was radiant, and he seemed lively.
- Hello. Thank you.

989
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:26,980
It felt like I'd been struck by it.

990
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:33,280
(She fell for him at first sight.)

991
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:35,180
These are prayer beads.

992
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,890
The person
I had feelings for the most...

993
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,660
wanted to get to know me,

994
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:46,260
which made me happy.

995
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:50,300
It was fascinating.
That's when my heart fluttered.

996
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,370
When we went on a drive,
heading to the campsite,

997
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:00,540
we saw the sunset.
It was my favorite moment.

998
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,210
(On their second date)

999
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:06,550
Between the forest and the sea,
which one do you like more?

1000
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,380
(Smiling)

1001
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,820
- Why did you say that...
- What?

1002
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,020
- with such a sweet voice?
- Did I?

1003
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:16,120
- My voice?
- Yes. Just now.

1004
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,190
It sounded very sweet.

1005
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:21,060
- It did?
- Yes.

1006
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,330
It tingled.

1007
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,970
- It did?
- I liked it.

1008
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:27,570
Oh, gosh.

1009
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:30,840
(He made her laugh
when they were together.)

1010
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:34,440
I've been binge-watching a drama
these days.

1011
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,510
What is it?

1012
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:38,550
It's called "Mr. Sunshine."

1013
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:41,120
You're just like Mr. Sunshine.

1014
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:44,190
Thank you.

1015
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,720
- Thank you for saying that.
- We keep thanking each other.

1016
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:49,160
I was drawn to him.

1017
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,630
In a way,

1018
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,230
I've never felt this way...

1019
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,800
in any of my past relationships.

1020
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,500
Oh, my gosh.

1021
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:05,740
She must've been so upset
when they played Game of Truth.

1022
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,080
- I know.
- That's why she struggled a lot.

1023
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,110
- Right.
- She must've been so upset.

1024
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:11,680
- Mr. Sunshine disappointed her.
- Mr. Sunshine disappointed her.

1025
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,410
Right.

1026
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,650
(Did her sincerity...)

1027
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:20,860
(get through to him?)

1028
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:31,000
(Lee Kyung Eon's final choice
is Yun Sang Hyeok.)

1029
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:42,740
(Kim Yun Jeong's final selection)

1030
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,480
Kim Yun Jeong's
destined partner is...

1031
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:51,450
Yun Sang Hyeok.

1032
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,260
Yun Jeong,
will you choose Sang Hyeok...

1033
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,690
for your final selection?

1034
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,800
No.

1035
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,910
(She puts down the fate plaque...)

1036
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:17,680
(she had once
desperately searched for.)

1037
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:41,340
(Yun Jeong stands
in front of Ho Am.)

1038
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:00,990
Let's complete
the first drawing together.

1039
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:12,300
- I like that.
- Seriously.

1040
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,870
It's different
from what she's said before.

1041
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:16,900
It was, "I know you like Yu Gyeong,
but I still like you."

1042
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,340
But now, it's,
"Let's do it together."

1043
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:19,840
- Right.
- "Do it with me."

1044
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,910
That's nice.

1045
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,110
(Let's...)

1046
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:26,580
(complete the first drawing
together.)

1047
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,590
(What she wants to complete...)

1048
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:37,330
(is the first date with him.)

1049
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,960
Thinking about my feelings for him,

1050
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,030
I wasn't cool.

1051
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,700
I was cowardly.

1052
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:51,310
I wasn't honest about my feelings.

1053
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:54,910
I knew Ho Am had strong feelings...

1054
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:58,050
for Yu Gyeong. It was so obvious.

1055
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,480
I knew it wouldn't work out.

1056
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:11,830
(That's why Yun Jeong
kept hiding her feelings.)

1057
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:14,300
(When she chose her date)

1058
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,330
I...

1059
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:19,200
- Hyeon U.
- Hyeon U?

1060
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,140
(She ignored her feelings
for Ho Am.)

1061
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:25,410
Last night, I decided to stay true
to my feelings.

1062
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:27,640
Once I realized my feelings,

1063
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,340
I focused
solely on expressing them...

1064
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,850
and talking with him.

1065
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:34,350
I had to pluck up my courage.

1066
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:37,220
Because I had to tell him
even though I knew it wouldn't work out.

1067
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:38,990
I had to express my feelings,
which I was bad at.

1068
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:43,060
(She decided to face her feelings
no matter how late it was.)

1069
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:49,360
(You were like a gem.)

1070
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:55,370
(The moment she mustered up
her courage to express her feelings)

1071
01:03:57,210 --> 01:04:01,780
(I shouldn't miss it.)

1072
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:07,480
I summoned up my courage and
did my best to confess my feelings.

1073
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:09,620
I really meant it.

1074
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:15,290
Thanks to that,
I was unbelievably happy.

1075
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:24,770
I'm not so sad.

1076
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,530
Hold on.

1077
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,740
I guess I liked it.

1078
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:33,770
(I guess I liked it.)

1079
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:40,580
I feel like crying.

1080
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:44,690
I really hope it works out.

1081
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,090
My gosh. Please.

1082
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:50,590
- They look good together.
- Right.

1083
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:59,970
(Yun Jeong finally confesses
her feelings to Ho Am.)

1084
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:10,510
(Kim Yun Jeong's final choice
is Jang Ho Am.)

1085
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:31,600
(Jang Ho Am's final selection)

1086
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,120
Jang Ho Am's destined partner is...

1087
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,090
Chae Yu Gyeong.

1088
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,000
Jang Ho Am,

1089
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:07,600
will you choose Chae Yu Gyeong
for your final selection?

1090
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:21,050
It's either a yes or no.

1091
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:23,780
If he says yes, it's over.

1092
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:26,290
- Please.
- My goodness.

1093
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,990
- Ho Am!
- Jang Ho Am!

1094
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:29,190
- So it begins.
- Ho Am!

1095
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:30,420
- Jang Ho Am!
- So it begins.

1096
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,430
(Very nervous)

1097
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:33,460
- Seriously.
- Ho Am!

1098
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,200
Just once.

1099
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:37,930
I'm exhausted.

1100
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:39,530
Don't stop it.

1101
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:41,700
(She feels dizzy.)

1102
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:46,740
Will you choose Chae Yu Gyeong
for your final selection?

1103
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:49,010
(Will you choose Chae Yu Gyeong
for your final selection?)

1104
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:53,510
Yes.

1105
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:56,820
- He said yes.
- My goodness.

1106
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:58,220
He said yes.

1107
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,460
Gosh, Ho Am.

1108
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:07,830
- All right. It was only my desire.
- That's right. All along, Ho Am...

1109
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,600
This is right, to be honest.

1110
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,500
It was only my greed.

1111
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,700
Yes.

1112
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:22,640
(Ho Am chose Yu Gyeong
until the end.)

1113
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:37,430
(Ho Am steps toward his destiny.)

1114
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:44,730
(Holding the fate plaque,)

1115
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:48,740
(Ho Am walks past Yun Jeong.)

1116
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:59,150
(Ho Am's destiny and heart...)

1117
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:03,980
(point to Yu Gyeong.)

1118
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:09,920
Yu Gyeong, you were the beginning
of my fate plaque.

1119
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,260
Naturally, you're the end as well.

1120
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,000
"You were the beginning..."

1121
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:21,940
"and the end."

1122
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,840
I wanted to tell her that.

1123
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:28,080
(Preselection)

1124
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:35,320
(Black Monkey, November 16, 1999)

1125
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,120
(Ho Am felt a strong pull...)

1126
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,720
(toward Yu Gyeong's fate plaque.)

1127
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:48,600
Yu Gyeong.

1128
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,630
(May I ask you out on a date?)

1129
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:59,370
(I wanted to show you
these two flags,)

1130
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:01,380
(so I asked you
to pick one with me.)

1131
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:03,540
The divine spirit told me...

1132
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,280
which one I'd be drawn to.

1133
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:08,180
But although it began
with the divine spirit's guidance,

1134
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:11,350
I felt the human attraction as well.

1135
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:14,890
So I could have certainty
more easily...

1136
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,860
without any worries.

1137
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,090
(With the divine spirit's guidance,)

1138
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:23,800
(Ho Am's human feelings grew.)

1139
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,270
(Everything was nice about today.)

1140
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:28,170
(Because you were with me?)

1141
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,380
(At the end of Ho Am's gaze...)

1142
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:38,350
(was always Yu Gyeong.)

1143
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,550
(Yu Gyeong, I want to
hang out with you once more.)

1144
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:43,680
(Really? Can I open it?)

1145
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,690
(Shall I open it
when you aren't around?)

1146
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:49,520
(Ho Am's heart didn't waver once.)

1147
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:55,700
(Yu Gyeong, I liked you
from the very beginning.)

1148
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,600
For the divine spirit,

1149
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,670
whether it works out or not
isn't important.

1150
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:06,340
But for me, a mere human,

1151
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,180
it was my desperate wish
to make it work.

1152
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:12,310
When I leave the show,

1153
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:15,050
will I be able to meet
someone like Yu Gyeong?

1154
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:21,860
Looking at Yu Gyeong,
I could feel...

1155
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,960
the flutter of my heart.

1156
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:26,790
And...

1157
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:29,860
"This is how I love."

1158
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:34,200
Yu Gyeong let me know that,

1159
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,040
so it was very nice.

1160
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:42,040
It was just nice.

1161
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,310
My goodness.

1162
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:47,310
(Moved)

1163
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:51,320
Gosh, Ho Am.

1164
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,420
Yu Gyeong,
would you please pick Ho Am?

1165
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:56,860
Suddenly...

1166
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,830
(Please.)

1167
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:01,260
Yu Gyeong, just pick Ho Am.

1168
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:05,230
While I was with you,

1169
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:07,200
I felt excited and happy.

1170
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:14,680
I'm certain about my feelings.

1171
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:17,950
The divine spirit's selection
was correct, in my opinion.

1172
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:34,960
(Jang Ho Am chooses Chae Yu Gyeong.)

1173
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:58,520
(Ha Byeong Yeol's final selection)

1174
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,230
Ha Byeong Yeol's
destined partner is...

1175
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,640
Lee Kyung Eon.

1176
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:22,510
Byeong Yeol, will you choose
Kyung Eon for your final selection?

1177
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,210
No.

1178
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:37,160
(He puts down his fate plaque.)

1179
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:42,160
(His steps take him
to a different person.)

1180
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:55,380
(Byeong Yeol stands
before Yu Gyeong.)

1181
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:01,350
He's shaking.

1182
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:03,280
- He's shaking.
- Look at the way he's shaking.

1183
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:04,850
Is he shaking?

1184
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:07,290
I understand
each and every person's feelings.

1185
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:08,360
- Yes.
- Seriously.

1186
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,920
I'm absorbed in everyone's story.

1187
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:12,160
- What are they going to do?
- This is incredible.

1188
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,330
In the beginning,

1189
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,840
being here was difficult.

1190
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:26,570
I couldn't wait to get out.

1191
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,540
But now that it's time
for the final selection,

1192
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:33,010
I'm disappointed.

1193
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,880
I wish that this isn't
the final selection...

1194
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,480
so that we can continue...

1195
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:40,450
spending time in the future.

1196
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:47,260
Inside of me were...

1197
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:50,500
a wall and hesitation.

1198
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,330
They were there.

1199
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:56,740
Thanks to Yu Gyeong,

1200
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:59,010
I could overcome them...

1201
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:00,310
on many occasions.

1202
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:01,940
In that sense,

1203
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,650
I think that I was lucky...

1204
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:08,320
to meet someone precious
like Yu Gyeong.

1205
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,290
(Byeong Yeol's heart
was closed off.)

1206
01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:15,590
(Yu Gyeong knocked on it first.)

1207
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:18,190
(Honestly speaking,)

1208
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:22,230
(I'm curious about you.)

1209
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:26,030
(I followed you into the room
with that thought.)

1210
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:29,440
(Thank you for saying that first.)

1211
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,910
With her tendencies,

1212
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,680
she melted away...

1213
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,580
the prejudices I had.

1214
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:46,590
(Does your work follow
a routine every day?)

1215
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:47,960
(It's irregular.)

1216
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:50,820
(Depending on the ritual,
the time will be different.)

1217
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,230
(I'm curious.)

1218
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:54,290
(I want to visit.)

1219
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:55,400
(Are you curious?)

1220
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:57,360
(You'll get to know.)

1221
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:02,040
(Byeong Yeol wanted to get to know
Yu Gyeong.)

1222
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,170
By spending time with her,

1223
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:05,940
I realized...

1224
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:08,110
she was someone
who had the qualities I lacked.

1225
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:10,710
I had the desire to know
Chae Yu Gyeong...

1226
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:12,280
as a person,

1227
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:14,850
so the prejudices I had...

1228
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:16,750
crumbled down.

1229
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,220
(How do you think
you'll see me as a shaman?)

1230
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:23,490
(I can't see that any differently.)

1231
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:26,690
(After all, that side is also you.)

1232
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:28,300
(Because of that,)

1233
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,830
(I don't want such a thing
to make me lose you.)

1234
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:35,740
(Also,
I want to focus on the present.)

1235
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,510
On you.

1236
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:43,740
(Byeong Yeol didn't hesitate
after checking his feelings.)

1237
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:48,880
We were supposed to have two each,

1238
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:50,920
but I didn't give them to you.

1239
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:03,200
(The four-cut photos
contain their good memories.)

1240
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,910
I hope you'll take them
as you promised.

1241
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:24,950
(Ha Byeong Yeol's final choice
is Chae Yu Gyeong.)

1242
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:30,060
Hoping to deliver my sincerity,

1243
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:34,700
I wrote a short letter
behind the photos.

1244
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:38,270
I wrote that
I had a happy and nice time.

1245
01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:39,500
(If you're okay with it,
I want to continue seeing you.)

1246
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,630
(If you have any worries,
I'll work hard to overcome them.)

1247
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:41,800
(I want to spend this Christmas
with you if you'll accept me.)

1248
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,800
"If our paths cross again,"

1249
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:49,140
"please give me
a prayer of blessing." I wrote that.

1250
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:59,320
(Will Byeong Yeol's wish come true?)

1251
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:04,090
(Excited)

1252
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:06,860
Byeong Yeol is very memorable.

1253
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:09,860
At first, he kept lying down
because being with the shamans...

1254
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:11,800
- drained his energy.
- That's right.

1255
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:15,140
But with his desire alone
to get to know Yu Gyeong...

1256
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:17,500
- as a person, he reached the end.
- That's right.

1257
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,140
- I think he did well.
- Yes.

1258
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:20,370
Byeong Yeol also demonstrated
a human victory.

1259
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:21,540
- Yes.
- Thanks to Yu Gyeong,

1260
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:24,110
- Seriously. He got up.
- he could get out of bed.

1261
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:26,080
- He overcame the prejudices...
- Right.

1262
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,320
- he had about shamans.
- That's right.

1263
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:30,080
- That's right.
- It was cool to see him...

1264
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,890
- go straight until the end.
- That's right.

1265
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:42,060
(Yun Sang Hyeok's final selection)

1266
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:44,330
- Really?
- My goodness.

1267
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:45,670
There he goes.

1268
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:47,430
- Gosh.
- Here comes Sang Hyeok. Let's go.

1269
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,340
The missile remains.

1270
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,310
(Sang Hyeok's decision
will change the situation.)

1271
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:06,820
Yun Sang Hyeok's
destined partner is...

1272
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:08,760
Lee Kyung Eon.

1273
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:17,330
Sang Hyeok, will you choose
Kyung Eon for your final selection?

1274
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Hold on.

1275
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:21,800
Yes and no.

1276
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:23,270
Yes and no.

1277
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:24,500
(Extremely nervous)

1278
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:27,040
(This is driving me crazy.)

1279
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,810
It'll end with that answer.

1280
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:29,840
Seriously.

1281
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,410
What do you think he'll say?

1282
01:18:31,650 --> 01:18:33,580
"Yes" will be unexpected.

1283
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:35,350
- "Yes" will be unexpected.
- That's right. It'll be a twist.

1284
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:36,350
- Totally.
- Yes.
I think he'll say yes.

1285
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,650
- Do you want him to say yes?
- Yes!

1286
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:41,590
I also hope he'll choose Kyung Eon.

1287
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:44,260
Gosh, I really can't watch this.

1288
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:51,600
Sang Hyeok, will you choose
Kyung Eon for your final selection?

1289
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:57,570
Yes.

1290
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:02,680
(He did it.)

1291
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:08,820
- No way!
- I can't believe it.

1292
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:11,250
(Sang Hyeok chose Kyung Eon
for the final selection.)

1293
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,250
How did I do that?

1294
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,920
- In Na.
- It must be the divine spirit.

1295
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,190
You were right.

1296
01:19:15,490 --> 01:19:16,690
- Gosh.
- Seriously.

1297
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:18,590
(It's as if the Korean national team
reached the quarter-finals.)

1298
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:20,760
- Hold on.
- I was so startled.

1299
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,500
- No way.
- You should be a shaman.

1300
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,860
- Seriously.
- I think I should be a shaman.

1301
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:25,500
- Seriously. What was that?
- In Na, what was that?

1302
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,870
- Seriously, I can't believe it.
- My goodness.

1303
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,940
I'm so happy right now.

1304
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,240
(My goodness)

1305
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,270
Oh, my gosh!

1306
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:35,710
We didn't misunderstand, right?
He said that, right?

1307
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:37,180
(The electrifying taste of a twist)

1308
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,020
Yes.

1309
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:48,790
(His destiny and heart
pointed to one person.)

1310
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:58,600
(Sang Hyeok walks over to Kyung Eon
with his fate plaque.)

1311
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,560
Thanks to you,

1312
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:32,330
I could feel excitement.

1313
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,240
Thank you so much.

1314
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:44,380
(He suppresses his emotions
and delivers his sincerity shyly.)

1315
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:48,050
After meeting Kyung Eon,
the one whose fate plaque...

1316
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,350
I had chosen,

1317
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:53,850
my heart fluttered for real.

1318
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:55,690
I was like, "So this is possible."

1319
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:58,690
I could really feel...

1320
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:05,670
that Kyung Eon was a lovely woman.

1321
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:09,770
She gave me a special present...

1322
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,140
that was excitement.

1323
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:15,710
(Last night)

1324
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:19,910
(Kyung Eon and Sang Hyeok
had a private conversation...)

1325
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:21,410
(after the Game of Truth.)

1326
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:23,220
(Tapping)

1327
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:27,050
I'm truly sorry
that I made you feel...

1328
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:29,560
- that way.
- It's okay.

1329
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:32,490
In any case, my feelings...

1330
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:35,760
are crystal clear.

1331
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:37,900
They're crystal clear.

1332
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:41,970
After the second date with you,

1333
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,570
my feelings grew as well.

1334
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,480
I want to be close to you.

1335
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:50,710
- Really?
- I didn't know...

1336
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:52,210
that I was in so deep.

1337
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:58,080
You might try to close
your heart momentarily.

1338
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:00,750
However,

1339
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,690
I'll open it back up carefully.

1340
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:06,830
I'll open it back up carefully.

1341
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:09,760
(Sang Hyeok delivered
his sincerity to Kyung Eon.)

1342
01:22:12,730 --> 01:22:14,700
(It's so exciting.)

1343
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,300
- Seriously.
- I'm so happy.

1344
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:17,570
I'm sure they were happy.

1345
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:18,770
He's cool.

1346
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:21,610
- Sang Hyeok is so cool.
- He's so cool.

1347
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:23,880
Sang Hyeok, you're cool.

1348
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:27,350
- Get married!
- Get married!

1349
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,480
- Get married right now!
- Get married!

1350
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:31,990
- Right now.
- Kiss!

1351
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:37,320
At first,
we only saw the fate plaques.

1352
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:39,990
You didn't pick me.

1353
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:44,800
Sang Hyeok, whom did you pick?

1354
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:46,270
It's a secret.

1355
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:48,170
You'll find out tomorrow.

1356
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,910
(Red Rabbit of destiny...)

1357
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:54,840
(who made
Sang Hyeok's heart flutter)

1358
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:59,080
- Good things will come to us.
- What?

1359
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:06,520
Kyung Eon told me
about the things...

1360
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:10,160
that weighed on her mind.

1361
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,030
So we could work things out well.

1362
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:17,260
I was very thankful for that.

1363
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:20,070
And...

1364
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,640
a week before coming here,

1365
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:29,680
I thought that I wanted to give
my prayer beads to someone...

1366
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:33,650
who would make me
feel such emotions.

1367
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,560
Please take...

1368
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:46,190
these prayer beads.

1369
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:52,070
Okay. Thank you.

1370
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:56,970
(He hands over the prayer beads
that are dear to him.)

1371
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:15,290
Thank you.

1372
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:22,700
It was a moment of happiness.

1373
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,300
That moment...

1374
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,470
will remain in my memories.

1375
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:33,740
Both of us can read the future.

1376
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:37,010
We work in that field.

1377
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:40,050
But without looking too far
into the future,

1378
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:44,220
we want to focus on
the present moment...

1379
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:48,690
and walk forward.

1380
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:57,230
(Yun Sang Hyeok's final choice
is Lee Kyung Eon.)

1381
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:05,470
(The two have checked
each other's hearts.)

1382
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:36,740
(Chae Yu Gyeong's final selection)

1383
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:57,560
(The fate plaque of the Gold Dragon
is placed in front of Yu Gyeong.)

1384
01:25:58,790 --> 01:26:00,830
(In between fate and heart,)

1385
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:05,870
(there were moments
when she wavered.)

1386
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:13,170
(The moment of selection
has finally come upon her.)

1387
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:15,640
(Everyone gets curious
about Yu Gyeong's selection.)

1388
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:19,510
Then who will Yu Gyeong select?

1389
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:24,020
The divine spirit chose Sang Hyeok.

1390
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:26,250
But her divine spirit is compatible
with Ho Am's divine spirit.

1391
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,620
Yu Gyeong was very interested
in Byeong Yeol,

1392
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:31,420
but her divine spirit wanted her
to choose the Gold Dragon.

1393
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:33,890
Right.
She still might choose Sang Hyeok.

1394
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:35,190
- Right.
- Right.

1395
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,130
I'm really curious.
I can't read her heart.

1396
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:41,770
Chae Yu Gyeong's
destined partner is...

1397
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,300
Yun Sang Hyeok.

1398
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:49,540
Yu Gyeong,
will you choose Sang Hyeok...

1399
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:51,910
for your final selection?

1400
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:02,260
(Yu Gyeong stands in front
of her fate.)

1401
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:07,060
(What kind of selection
will she make?)

1402
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,000
No.

1403
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:19,810
(Yu Gyeong has finally...)

1404
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:24,680
(put down the weight of fate.)

1405
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:32,720
(Yu Gyeong throws the fate plaque
chosen by the divine spirit.)

1406
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:37,590
(She goes past her destined partner,
Gold Dragon Sang Hyeok,)

1407
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,590
(and Ho Am, whom she was
spiritually attracted to.)

1408
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:49,000
(She stopped in front of Byeong Yeol
whom her heart reacted to.)

1409
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:54,070
- His lips are curling up.
- Hey!

1410
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:55,580
He looks delighted.

1411
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:58,380
(Yu Gyeong's brave selection
that goes against her fate.)

1412
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:00,380
That's great!

1413
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:02,150
I love it.

1414
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:05,180
(Feeling shy)

1415
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:07,250
I'm...

1416
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:11,820
still 1,000 percent certain.

1417
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:19,000
In our previous conversation,

1418
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,030
we talked about how certain we were
about our relationship...

1419
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:22,870
and the final selection.

1420
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:25,240
There was a time
when we talked about these things.

1421
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:28,840
I said that
I was 1,000 percent certain.

1422
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:31,080
Byeong Yeol said 100,
and I said 1,000.

1423
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:33,250
(A few days ago)

1424
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:35,780
Do you feel certain now?

1425
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,150
I want to hear from you.

1426
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:40,250
I'm certain.

1427
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:44,890
What about you?

1428
01:28:45,630 --> 01:28:46,660
I'm...

1429
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:50,130
(Feeling nervous)

1430
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,500
around 1,000 percent certain.

1431
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,670
(Surprised)

1432
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:01,710
I didn't think about anything else.

1433
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:04,510
I just really liked Byeong Yeol.

1434
01:29:04,510 --> 01:29:08,010
I never went against Grandpa before.

1435
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:11,480
No matter how tough and sad
the situation,

1436
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:14,790
I never went against Grandpa.

1437
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:20,590
(Tonight, the Black Cow chose you.)

1438
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:23,230
(This can't be.)

1439
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:30,170
(The first time Yu Gyeong
collided with the divine spirit)

1440
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:33,210
(Save me.)

1441
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:36,610
(What must I do, Grandpa?)

1442
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:39,610
I couldn't believe
I went against Grandpa...

1443
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:42,750
just because of love.

1444
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:45,520
It did feel quite confusing.

1445
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,350
Actually,

1446
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:51,160
Byeong Yeol talked about
being in a serious relationship.

1447
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,960
(This morning)

1448
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:57,630
That's not it.

1449
01:29:57,630 --> 01:30:02,770
(Byeong Yeol called out Yu Gyeong
before the final selection.)

1450
01:30:04,170 --> 01:30:06,510
(Looking closely)

1451
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:11,340
(You look like you have
a lot to say,)

1452
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:13,180
(but it's hard for you to speak.)

1453
01:30:13,810 --> 01:30:18,650
(Yu Gyeong felt confused
by the weight of fate.)

1454
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:24,020
The way I can express my heart...

1455
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:25,490
is limited here.

1456
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:28,330
- So...
- What if it isn't limited?

1457
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,830
- What?
- What would you like to say then?

1458
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,430
If it isn't limited?

1459
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:34,500
If it isn't limited,

1460
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:38,240
I would tell you that
I am willing to do my best...

1461
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:39,440
if you feel lost.

1462
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:43,580
I have the heart
to understand you...

1463
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:46,550
and to be with you.

1464
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:48,980
My heart is determined
to be prepared for that.

1465
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:53,120
I just expressed myself
the best I could.

1466
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:57,860
(Byeong Yeol shared his heart
to Yu Gyeong who felt confused.)

1467
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:02,530
When we focus a lot
on the person we talk to,

1468
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:07,930
we can feel that person's vibes
and emotions.

1469
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:09,100
- Really?
- Yes.

1470
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:10,770
You must know what I'm feeling then.

1471
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:12,570
It must be obvious for me,
to be honest.

1472
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:15,710
- It's obvious.
- Right.

1473
01:31:17,610 --> 01:31:21,010
But I like that the emotion
that I'm feeling...

1474
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:22,480
is truthful.

1475
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:29,260
I feel grateful that
you can feel what I'm feeling.

1476
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:31,790
I feel grateful to you
for expressing yourself.

1477
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:40,330
(Byeong Yeol's heart was clearly
revealed in front of Yu Gyeong.)

1478
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:45,070
- You wore a rider jacket.
- Right.

1479
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:48,840
- You like them.
- It looks good on you.

1480
01:31:54,150 --> 01:31:55,980
I felt grateful.

1481
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:59,420
I realized how serious he was
about our relationship.

1482
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:02,660
I was touched.

1483
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,190
I tried my best to live my life
as a human being.

1484
01:32:06,190 --> 01:32:10,330
During the moments I expressed
myself in front of Byeong Yeol,

1485
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:14,670
I believe that it was just
26-year-old Chae Yu Gyeong.

1486
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:16,740
I think I should go back...

1487
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:19,340
and beg on my knees
in front of Grandpa.

1488
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:22,580
"Please let us become
each other's fate."

1489
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:24,440
I think I should beg for that.

1490
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,210
(The confession by
26-year-old Chae Yu Gyeong,)

1491
01:32:27,210 --> 01:32:29,050
(instead of Shaman Chae Yu Gyeong)

1492
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,020
Today is the most delightful day
this month.

1493
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:33,390
- Seriously.
- You mustn't have had...

1494
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:34,390
a lot to be happy about.

1495
01:32:34,650 --> 01:32:35,920
I didn't have a lot
to be happy about.

1496
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:37,020
(Feeling dizzy
from the series of happy endings)

1497
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,660
- Gosh.
- It really is delightful.

1498
01:32:40,230 --> 01:32:41,690
What a beautiful moment.

1499
01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:43,530
- It feels delightful, doesn't it?
- Right.

1500
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:45,400
- I feel really happy right now.
- It does feel delightful.

1501
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:54,210
(The two face each other
after a lot of detour.)

1502
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:07,320
(Chae Yu Gyeong's final choice
is Ha Byeong Yeol.)

1503
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:26,170
Yun Sang Hyeok and Lee Kyung Eon
have become a couple.

1504
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:29,810
Please leave this place
and maintain your connection.

1505
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:37,950
I must go to you.

1506
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:49,560
Gosh, so this is how things
have ended up.

1507
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:53,000
(Feeling happy for them)

1508
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:58,670
The rabbit looks cute.

1509
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:01,270
I can't see mine.

1510
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:05,440
You didn't know
I had your fate plaque, didn't you?

1511
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:06,880
I didn't know.

1512
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,220
It was totally unexpected.

1513
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:13,350
I think...

1514
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:16,360
the heart that we continued
to have for each other...

1515
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:19,090
was our fate.

1516
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:21,490
I wish for him
to be my destined partner.

1517
01:34:22,530 --> 01:34:24,730
That is my honest heart.

1518
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:28,330
I wasn't sure...

1519
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,870
if there was such a thing
as a destined partner.

1520
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:34,670
I'm now leaning toward...

1521
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:37,140
the thought that
there is a destined partner...

1522
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:38,740
through this experience.

1523
01:34:38,910 --> 01:34:40,410
I think I have found...

1524
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:42,680
my destined partner.

1525
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:54,690
(The two will become
each other's destined partners.)

1526
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:04,640
Ha Byeong Yeol and Chae Yu Gyeong
have become a couple.

1527
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:05,740
(Ha Byeong Yeol and Chae Yu Gyeong)

1528
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:08,470
Please leave this place
and maintain your connection.

1529
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:13,510
Let's go.

1530
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:14,510
(Grabbing)

1531
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:15,550
Let's go.

1532
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:19,150
This feels embarrassing.

1533
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:22,720
Us holding hands?

1534
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:26,490
- Let's go slowly. We might trip.
- Okay.

1535
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:28,960
- Why aren't you taking this?
- What?

1536
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,060
Why aren't you taking this?

1537
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:31,360
I'm going to take it.

1538
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,230
- I'm going to take it outside.
- I see.

1539
01:35:35,470 --> 01:35:39,170
The fate plaque selection
is very important to a shaman.

1540
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:41,040
She made the decision
to go against the divine spirit,

1541
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:42,270
and...

1542
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,480
I didn't know about that.

1543
01:35:46,110 --> 01:35:48,910
After realizing that it was
a profound decision to make,

1544
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:52,650
it felt touching.

1545
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:55,290
If there is anything
I can do to help,

1546
01:35:55,290 --> 01:35:56,520
I am willing to do anything.

1547
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:59,490
I have the heart to develop...

1548
01:35:59,730 --> 01:36:02,430
and establish
this relationship well.

1549
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:04,060
With that in mind,

1550
01:36:05,230 --> 01:36:07,770
I believe that I have found
my destined partner,

1551
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:10,370
and I wish for her to continue
to be my destined partner.

1552
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,510
My desires as a human being
feel very strong.

1553
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:17,080
I miss him
when we're away from each other.

1554
01:36:18,610 --> 01:36:20,050
I feel happy when I'm with him.

1555
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:23,550
I wish for him to be
my precious connection.

1556
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:25,990
My one-and-only connection.

1557
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:27,790
Did you not feel nervous?

1558
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:29,120
I did feel nervous.

1559
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:30,260
I'm feeling better now though.

1560
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:32,060
- Really?
- Yes.

1561
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:35,790
My heart is still pounding.

1562
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:38,400
I put on all my rings
for good energy.

1563
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:40,600
- You put on your cool rings.
- Right.

1564
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:45,670
Your hand is warm.

1565
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:50,640
(Gold Dragon)

1566
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:52,980
(The connection that came to be...)

1567
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:57,780
(after going against fate...)

1568
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:02,090
(has reached them...)

1569
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:10,160
(as a new fate.)

1570
01:37:14,130 --> 01:37:15,300
Did you read the letter?

1571
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:16,540
I read all of it.

1572
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:18,640
When? You must have been
short on time to read it.

1573
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:20,040
- I read it right away.
- Really?

1574
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:21,070
- Yes.
- I see.

1575
01:37:21,070 --> 01:37:22,110
I was touched.

1576
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:27,550
(She reads the letter
from Byeong Yeol again.)

1577
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:31,650
Can I hold your hand?

1578
01:37:32,820 --> 01:37:34,550
(Grabbing gently)

1579
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:37,460
(Feeling shy)

1580
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:39,760
Why did you choose this?

1581
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:42,090
- Well...
- What was the final question?

1582
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:43,460
For the two of us,

1583
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:45,830
the Clinging Fire card appeared.

1584
01:37:45,930 --> 01:37:47,370
That represents...

1585
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:51,700
great passion and energy.

1586
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:54,510
The Clinging Fire...

1587
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,440
was what my heart went for.

1588
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:57,510
Really?

1589
01:37:59,210 --> 01:38:03,150
The place where you live...

1590
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:07,490
has been turned into a shrine,
right?

1591
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:10,320
It's the place
where the divine spirit stays.

1592
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,790
The Chinese characters for "spirit"
and "house" are used.

1593
01:38:13,030 --> 01:38:14,860
"Spirit's House."

1594
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:18,130
Is the divine spirit
waiting for you at home?

1595
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:19,930
We are always together.

1596
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:23,240
The divine spirit is with you now,
and not waiting for you at home?

1597
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,170
We are always together.

1598
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:27,270
- Really?
- Yes.

1599
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:29,380
- You two are together right now?
- Of course.

1600
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:35,150
It's fascinating.

1601
01:38:35,550 --> 01:38:37,520
- You two are always together.
- Yes.

1602
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,620
I think a lot of good things...

1603
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:42,760
will happen this year.

1604
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:47,260
Really?
I recently went to Seunggasa.

1605
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:49,190
- It's a place called Seunggasa.
- Isn't that a temple?

1606
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:50,360
- Yes.
- Right.

1607
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:53,800
I think good things have been happening
after visiting that place.

1608
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:55,800
That is why
I'm planning to go there again.

1609
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,070
Let's go together.

1610
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:01,010
(Laughing)

1611
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:02,110
Your hand is warm.

1612
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:03,980
Do you usually have warm
hands and feet?

1613
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:05,010
No. They are usually cold.

1614
01:39:05,010 --> 01:39:06,080
- They are usually cold?
- Yes.

1615
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,510
I want some malatang.

1616
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,320
Let's go and have some.

1617
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:11,680
- Do you like malatang?
- No.

1618
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:13,650
I'll try to have it.

1619
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:15,320
Do you eat mala xiang guo too?

1620
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:17,760
- You never tried it?
- I never tried it.

1621
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:18,820
- Really?
- Yes.

1622
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:20,090
Will you be able to eat it?

1623
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:23,000
I'm curious about this as well.
Do you like mint chocolate?

1624
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:24,400
Yes.

1625
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:26,700
I really like it. Do you hate it?

1626
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:27,770
I hate it.

1627
01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:30,070
We're complete opposites.

1628
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:33,610
It's fun that we're opposites.

1629
01:39:35,570 --> 01:39:39,450
(Fortune Tellers' Love 2)

1630
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:27,130
(Thank you for watching
