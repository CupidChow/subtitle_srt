1
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:28,120
(All statements related to shamanism and fortune-telling...)

2
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:29,130
(made by the cast in this program...)

3
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:30,371
(are purely personal opinions.)

4
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:36,781
I'll finish it quickly and come back.

5
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:38,901
- Good luck. - Thanks.

6
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:09,701
(Possessed Love S2)

7
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:14,500
(A new resident, Kyung Eon, is here.)

8
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:17,570
From my perspective, she's the woman who took my date away.

9
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:20,610
To be honest, I am worried about her.

10
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:22,781
(There's a subtle tension in the house.)

11
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:27,521
(They felt good about each other on the first date, )

12
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,420
(and their feelings grew.)

13
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:32,761
I think you're the Gold Dragon.

14
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:35,930
(I'm 100 percent sure.)

15
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:38,191
I thought she was cute and lovely.

16
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:42,670
(Tonight, the White Chicken chose you.)

17
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:47,470
(Tonight, the Black Cow chose you.)

18
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:48,971
He's the Black Cow?

19
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:51,471
That wasn't the animal that I had in mind.

20
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:54,311
I was disappointed.

21
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:59,551
(The fates were not aligned. What choice will Yu Gyeong make?)

22
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:07,921
(Morning is back after a chaotic night.)

23
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:13,400
We got the animals all wrong.

24
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:14,731
- Seriously? - Yes.

25
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:16,641
I realized after I got the messages last night.

26
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:20,271
(What Yu Gyeong found out last night)

27
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,071
The Black Cow.

28
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,341
It's Byeong Yeol.

29
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:27,181
How do you know that?

30
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,511
Oh, you went on a date.

31
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:30,781
That means...

32
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:33,621
The Gold Dragon...

33
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:37,591
Is he the new guy?

34
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:39,691
Sang Hyeok?

35
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:42,761
I guess so.

36
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,131
What's going on?

37
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,631
This is so tricky.

38
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:51,871
When I first picked a fate plaque,

39
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:55,500
I was most drawn to the Gold Dragon,

40
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:58,911
and I was certain that we were destined by the spirit.

41
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:05,351
So, I'm deeply disappointed.

42
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:10,751
(The fortune tellers are in the kitchen.)

43
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:15,361
(Eating)

44
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:19,431
(Yun Jeong eats bread for breakfast.)

45
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:22,501
(Approaching him)

46
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:25,870
- Do you want one? - Bread? Can I get some?

47
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:27,751
It's the end piece, and these are the good ones.

48
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:28,941
(She offers Ho Am a piece of bread.)

49
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,141
That looks crispy.

50
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,981
How did you get hurt?

51
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:37,651
I scraped it in the shower.

52
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,550
(She's worried about Ho Am's injured finger.)

53
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:43,021
- I think it's Byeong Yeol. - There were bandages in my room.

54
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:45,681
- I'll bring one to you later. - Later.

55
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,690
I always wear high heels, so my heels are chafed.

56
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:51,091
- Right. You wear such high heels. - You know, right?

57
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,461
They're like murder weapons.

58
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:56,471
Her heels were so high on our first date.

59
00:03:57,031 --> 00:03:58,931
I was worried that I might look shorter.

60
00:04:02,571 --> 00:04:05,911
I also have ointment.

61
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:08,281
(He spots the medal.)

62
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,210
Thank you.

63
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:11,350
When should I give it back?

64
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,681
I'll hold on to it for now.

65
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:17,221
(I'll hold on to it for now.)

66
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,931
It looks like she decided to be enthusiastic today.

67
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:26,861
She said that she'd hold on to the medal for now.

68
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:29,571
She could have given it back now, but...

69
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:31,200
- Good for her. - Yes.

70
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:32,501
She's so cute.

71
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:44,611
We ask the men to gather by the fire pit now.

72
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:46,051
- Women? Men? - Women?

73
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:49,081
The men must be picking their dates.

74
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:51,221
I hate this!

75
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,421
(Nervous)

76
00:04:53,991 --> 00:04:56,491
(The men will pick...)

77
00:04:57,191 --> 00:05:01,401
(their dates today.)

78
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:05,771
(Fire pit)

79
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:13,641
(The men gather one by one.)

80
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:15,881
- What's this? - I wonder what it is.

81
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:20,021
(Surprised)

82
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:22,121
- I think we should read these. - Okay.

83
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:25,250
(The love talismans are on the table.)

84
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:27,591
- "Love talisman." - "Love talisman?"

85
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:33,261
"Write your name on the love talisman..."

86
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:36,330
"and ask a woman out without letting anyone know."

87
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:37,731
(They must hand it over in secret.)

88
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:42,170
- Oh, it's this. It's so fun. - That's pretty fun.

89
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:43,310
They played hide-and-seek...

90
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:44,471
- in the first season. - Yes.

91
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:47,480
- They can't let anyone know. - That's tough.

92
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,810
- I wonder who Ho Am will pick. - It's pretty difficult.

93
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:51,981
Does she go on two dates if they pick one girl?

94
00:05:52,951 --> 00:05:56,090
- One might have to stay at home. - Oh, no! Please don't.

95
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:57,951
Please let Yu Ra go outside.

96
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:03,181
We're supposed to write our names on them and ask them out?

97
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:05,161
Without letting anyone know?

98
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:07,631
We need to deliver this?

99
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:09,800
- A message. - And our names.

100
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:12,540
We just need to write what we want to say to them.

101
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,371
A message. Yes, what we want to say.

102
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:16,981
- It has to be in secret, right? - Yes, that's the tough part.

103
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,211
Since we're always gathered in one room.

104
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:22,851
Today, divided we stand, united we fall.

105
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:25,511
A message and my name.

106
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:27,881
I was nervous.

107
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,991
They told us to write our names on the talisman and deliver it,

108
00:06:31,051 --> 00:06:32,721
and I didn't know how to bring it to her.

109
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:37,230
I thought, "I got a chance to go on a date..."

110
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,131
"with the person of my choice."

111
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,977
We shouldn't let them see this either. I'll hide it.

112
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:44,030
(Putting it in)

113
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:46,470
- You're right. I should put it in. - Shall we head back in?

114
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:47,541
Let's go.

115
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:49,101
We're asking them out, right?

116
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:50,771
Deliver it?

117
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:52,341
Whatever.

118
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:54,210
Let's go.

119
00:06:54,211 --> 00:06:56,051
- Oh, gosh. - Man.

120
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:57,981
This is getting interesting. I like it.

121
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:02,921
I wonder what we're doing.

122
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:05,191
- Should we go take a look? - No.

123
00:07:05,921 --> 00:07:07,161
I'm nervous.

124
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:12,391
(Peeping)

125
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:16,331
(They enter while checking the women.)

126
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:21,271
(Walking past the women who are talking without a clue, )

127
00:07:22,171 --> 00:07:28,211
(they write their messages on the talismans in private.)

128
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:37,051
(What will they write on the talismans?)

129
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:46,230
(Will you go on a date with me? Jung Hyeon U.)

130
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:47,931
"Should I give it to Ra Yun,"

131
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,231
"who I first had in mind?"

132
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:52,741
"Or should I try talking to Yun Jeong again?"

133
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:56,341
I was torn between the two.

134
00:07:58,241 --> 00:08:01,541
(A shaman is here to deliver his talisman.)

135
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:03,311
(Checking his talisman)

136
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:10,651
(He naturally took a seat.)

137
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,221
(Appearing)

138
00:08:13,621 --> 00:08:14,760
(Staring)

139
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,861
Have a seat.

140
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:19,501
(Grasping the situation)

141
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:21,600
I was trying to figure out what the subject was.

142
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,001
We were talking about how we got into this profession.

143
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:26,001
She was curious.

144
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:31,471
(Byeong Yeol also wanders in.)

145
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:34,081
Byeong Yeol is totally giving it away.

146
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:36,950
- He's walking like this. - He might as well whistle.

147
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:38,157
(He's obviously suspicious as he enters.)

148
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:39,351
Byeong Yeol.

149
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:42,991
They're all anxious as they have missions to accomplish.

150
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:48,191
(Roaming around for no reason)

151
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:53,561
(Turning)

152
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:58,001
(Ho Am enters, so he quickly sits next to Yu Gyeong.)

153
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,301
(He acts awkwardly as soon as he sits down.)

154
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:04,571
(Restless)

155
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,911
(Gang Won ends up leaving.)

156
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:09,681
(Anxious)

157
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:14,121
(He doesn't know when to cut in.)

158
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:16,291
(Getting up)

159
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:19,120
- How should I break them up? - What?

160
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:20,861
How should I break them up?

161
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,161
They're talking too seriously.

162
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,630
We were to deliver our love talismans,

163
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:29,770
but they were having...

164
00:09:29,771 --> 00:09:31,077
such a serious chat in the living room.

165
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:32,840
It felt like it would take too long,

166
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:34,100
and my heart was beating too hard.

167
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:36,781
I realized that I had to do it, even if it meant interrupting them.

168
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:38,911
How should we do it?

169
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,080
- We need to break them up first. - Yes.

170
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,980
But they're on such a serious subject,

171
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:45,711
so I can't exactly stop them.

172
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:47,081
I don't think I can.

173
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,050
Or we could tell them...

174
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:51,591
that we should get ready to go outside.

175
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:53,091
- That's not bad. - Right.

176
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,230
Like, "They told us to start getting ready now."

177
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:59,060
- When she's done talking, I'll go, - Okay.

178
00:09:59,061 --> 00:10:00,900
- "Should we get ready now?" - Okay. Good.

179
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,071
- I'll say it first. - Good.

180
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:07,070
- Can I go to the bathroom? - Of course.

181
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:10,141
(While Yu Ra is gone...)

182
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,811
You know...

183
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:15,541
What is it?

184
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:18,180
I'm sorry, but it's time...

185
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:20,580
- that we get ready individually. - Really?

186
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:22,821
- I'm so sorry for interrupting. - It's fine.

187
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:26,591
I think we can take some time to get rest.

188
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:28,861
- Should we go now? - Thanks.

189
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,761
(They go separate ways, thanks to Gang Won.)

190
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:36,471
Let's leave them here and clean them up later.

191
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,071
- It's all right. - Is this mine?

192
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,700
What?

193
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:41,940
(Yun Jeong heads to the kitchen.)

194
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,970
No, we have to get ready first.

195
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:47,511
They were the most distracted when they separated,

196
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,081
so I took the opportunity.

197
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:54,481
(Getting his things)

198
00:10:58,751 --> 00:11:01,361
(He puts the talisman in a book.)

199
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:07,131
(He walks past Ra Yun...)

200
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:11,501
(and heads to the kitchen.)

201
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:14,201
(Sneakily)

202
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,240
What is it? Did you buy it?

203
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:20,787
The book you said you wanted to read last time.

204
00:11:20,811 --> 00:11:22,081
(Glancing)

205
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:23,511
There are too many people!

206
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:26,051
Oh, no. That was too obvious.

207
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:28,451
- Didn't everyone see it? - They did.

208
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:30,221
It looks like they did.

209
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:31,990
I wish I could get something like that too.

210
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,720
You got a talisman, and it said, "How about a dance-off, Gabee?"

211
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:35,790
(She gets dance-off requests instead of date requests.)

212
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:36,991
No!

213
00:11:37,091 --> 00:11:38,530
"You and me. Dance-off."

214
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,761
(Hating it)

215
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:41,760
- That's right. - You got it?

216
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:43,130
- Yes, I did. - You got it back. Really?

217
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:44,411
They never gave mine back. What?

218
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:46,841
They never gave mine back. What?

219
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:53,110
(She found the talisman.)

220
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:54,181
Bye.

221
00:11:55,111 --> 00:11:57,780
He put it in the book "My Sweet Orange Tree..."

222
00:11:57,781 --> 00:12:00,381
that he said he often read...

223
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,950
and gave me the talisman.

224
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:06,020
It read, "Will you go on a date with me?"

225
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:07,520
He handed it to me.

226
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:10,041
(He honestly expressed his feelings without too much pressure.)

227
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:11,730
Where should I put this?

228
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,061
Why is it so cold today?

229
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:14,431
Here.

230
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:16,901
(Staring)

231
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:21,641
I had already made up my mind...

232
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:24,011
about who I was going to ask out.

233
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:25,871
So, there wasn't much debate there.

234
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:27,811
I wanted to give it to Kyung Eon.

235
00:12:29,211 --> 00:12:31,681
(Everyone leaves at the right time.)

236
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:33,551
(Turning)

237
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:36,491
(They're left alone in the kitchen.)

238
00:12:38,221 --> 00:12:39,291
The knife...

239
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:44,831
(He suddenly malfunctions.)

240
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,531
(Awkward)

241
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:48,801
Pardon?

242
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:51,731
Pardon?

243
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:53,540
Did you bring any books to read while you were here?

244
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,071
- Books to read? No. - Yes.

245
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,171
- Have you read this one? - No.

246
00:12:57,271 --> 00:12:59,171
- I have it at home, but not yet. - Is that so?

247
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,281
- It's one of my favourites. - Is it?

248
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,351
Do you want me to read it?

249
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:05,981
- Okay. Thanks. - Take it.

250
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:10,251
I wanted to set the right mood and give it to her,

251
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:11,691
but I was...

252
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:15,761
too awkward when I handed it over.

253
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:20,761
(People swarm back in.)

254
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:22,800
(His perfect moment is going away.)

255
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:23,971
I'll try reading it.

256
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:26,171
- Sorry? - Nothing.

257
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,440
Take it to the bathroom and open it.

258
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,540
What?

259
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,511
- Open it in the bathroom. - The bathroom?

260
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:33,840
Don't open it yet.

261
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:35,711
- Open it in the bathroom. - The bathroom?

262
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,010
Don't open it yet.

263
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:39,781
(He mustered up his courage and whispered into her ears.)

264
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:41,321
Okay.

265
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,551
Don't you think you made it too obvious?

266
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:45,821
(Shy)

267
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,591
- Oh, my gosh! - Look at them.

268
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:50,531
The men try to ignore it.

269
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,830
Did you see him acting like Sang Hyeok was invisible?

270
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:55,230
(The men are being loyal.)

271
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:56,670
- Ho Am is too nice. - They're trying to ignore.

272
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:57,777
He acted like he was invisible.

273
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:59,131
But it's so obvious.

274
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:01,570
It's so obvious they're deliberately ignoring it.

275
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:03,070
(Getting interesting)

276
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:04,210
Seriously.

277
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,040
Don't you think you made it too obvious?

278
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,041
(Shy)

279
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,881
(Covering his face)

280
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:14,721
(She checks the talisman in private as Sang Hyeok asked.)

281
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:18,151
(Laughing)

282
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:21,860
"I want to get to know you better."

283
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,930
That's what it said.

284
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:25,530
(Yun Sang Hyeok)

285
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,730
I spent a day with him together,

286
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:30,971
and I wasn't the only one who thought it meant a lot.

287
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,571
It felt good as that sounded like a reply to that.

288
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:36,741
Did we have lemons all this time?

289
00:14:36,871 --> 00:14:38,211
Sang Hyeok brought them.

290
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:40,940
(Gang Won follows Ra Yun right away.)

291
00:14:40,941 --> 00:14:42,011
Rara.

292
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:43,711
Rara.

293
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:46,381
Rara.

294
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:50,391
Go upstairs.

295
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:52,231
- What? - Come upstairs with me.

296
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:54,621
Why?

297
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,891
What?

298
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,190
Why?

299
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:00,201
(Grabbing her hand)

300
00:15:00,431 --> 00:15:01,801
What?

301
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:05,801
Why do they give off such a "Love on a Jujube Tree" vibe?

302
00:15:07,271 --> 00:15:09,171
It looks like old-fashioned dating.

303
00:15:09,301 --> 00:15:11,040
I don't understand why I'm feeling this way.

304
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,640
(How dating went in the 1980s)

305
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:16,281
Whatever tree it is, all you need is love.

306
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:18,081
They're so cute, though.

307
00:15:18,311 --> 00:15:19,711
That's hilarious.

308
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:23,291
I called Ra Yun as she was walking upstairs,

309
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:26,421
held her hand, opened it, gave it to her,

310
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:27,861
and sent her away.

311
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,060
What?

312
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:32,731
(He pushed her away.)

313
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:34,561
What is this?

314
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:37,571
What just happened?

315
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:41,471
(He left in an instant.)

316
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:46,271
I saw it and thought that he gave me trash at first.

317
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:50,111
At first, I thought, "Why did he give me trash?"

318
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:52,481
What is this?

319
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:56,650
(I couldn't stop thinking about you from the day we met.)

320
00:15:56,651 --> 00:15:59,791
He wrote, "You're the only one that I want to go on a date with."

321
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:01,560
"Go on a date with me."

322
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,291
(Will you go on a date with me? Gang Won.)

323
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:05,631
I saw it and thought, "That's cute."

324
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:09,661
"Is this what it's like dating a younger guy?"

325
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:11,701
(Glancing)

326
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:17,441
(Byeong Yeol starts moving.)

327
00:16:18,841 --> 00:16:20,281
(Sighing)

328
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,251
- Are you going upstairs? - What?

329
00:16:23,951 --> 00:16:25,350
- Why are you sighing? - What?

330
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,981
(Flustered)

331
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:32,921
Hide it.

332
00:16:34,021 --> 00:16:36,090
On the staircase going up,

333
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:38,561
I quickly gave it to her in secret.

334
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:41,261
(Feeling proud)

335
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:45,471
Hide it. Please.

336
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,371
Please.

337
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:49,441
(Exclaiming)

338
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:53,140
(He got weak in the knees.)

339
00:16:53,141 --> 00:16:55,680
I want to go on more dates with you and ask you more questions.

340
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,710
Really?

341
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:59,611
When we're upstairs... This is supposed to be a secret,

342
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:01,881
so I can't talk to you for that long.

343
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,521
Anyway...

344
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:05,151
(You get what I mean, right?)

345
00:17:05,152 --> 00:17:10,091
I got a chance to ask someone out on a date today,

346
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:13,760
so I wanted to go with you if you wanted.

347
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:14,831
- Of course! - Really?

348
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,100
You can tell from her eyes that she's in love.

349
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:21,501
- Yu Gyeong is... - She looks at him like this.

350
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,911
But we can't be sure yet because of the Gold Dragon.

351
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:28,281
(Worried)

352
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:34,281
(Byeong Yeol returned to his room after accomplishing his mission.)

353
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:40,491
(Plopping down)

354
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,731
(Exclaiming)

355
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:51,471
(He's drained yet again.)

356
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:55,770
(Sighing)

357
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:58,170
I had feelings for her,

358
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:00,681
but I wasn't sure if I could...

359
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:03,911
express them,

360
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:05,911
so I asked her out.

361
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:09,450
(Yu Gyeong, I enjoyed the date yesterday, but...)

362
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:12,290
The last line said, "But I want to be eager for you."

363
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,891
(But I want to be eager for you.)

364
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:17,791
I believe it was the best way he could express his feelings.

365
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:21,301
I was glad that I'd be going on a date with him,

366
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:24,771
but I picked the Gold Dragon's fate plaque,

367
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:27,871
so that was...

368
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:29,801
a bit of a shame.

369
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:36,081
The date today will be crucial...

370
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,981
as she'll make up her mind on the Gold Dragon today.

371
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:40,780
- Whether she'll stop... - Exactly...

372
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:43,521
- or keep going after him. - That's right.

373
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:45,891
We've watched the whole thing from the get-go,

374
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:48,191
so we can't help but think,

375
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:51,031
"What a quirk of fate."

376
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:53,261
- "How come it got so complicated?" - Yes.

377
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:59,771
(Will Yu Gyeong be able to go against her fate?)

378
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:05,031
Sang Hyeok, did you give your talisman?

379
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:06,411
(Nodding)

380
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:08,051
When did you all have the time to...

381
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:11,011
How are you guys so fast?

382
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:15,521
(Byeong Yeol also delivered his talisman.)

383
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:17,990
Did you do it?

384
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:18,991
(Nodding)

385
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:25,531
- Yu Gyeong. - Yes?

386
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,700
Are you there?

387
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:28,061
Yes, give me a second.

388
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:32,571
Yu Gyeong. Are you there?

389
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:36,641
(Peeking)

390
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:41,211
(She heard Ho Am looking for Yu Gyeong.)

391
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,751
- Oh, boy. - Oh, no.

392
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,380
She must have heard it.

393
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:47,521
Why are they together?

394
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:49,920
- I know. - This breaks my heart.

395
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:51,021
Oh, no.

396
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,421
(Depressed)

397
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:57,360
I was doing my hair.

398
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:58,660
Were you?

399
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:00,837
- You can finish it. - No, it takes a while. What is it?

400
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:02,061
- Can we talk? - Okay.

401
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:07,801
(He called her outside.)

402
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:13,170
What is it? You're scaring me!

403
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,240
What's so scary?

404
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:15,940
Are you going to take out your equipment again?

405
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:16,951
No.

406
00:20:17,411 --> 00:20:18,411
Oh, it's equipment.

407
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:24,991
- What? - I want another date with you.

408
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:29,067
Really? Can I open it now? Should I open it when I'm alone?

409
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:31,091
- You can open it now or later. - Really?

410
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:35,631
(Giggling)

411
00:20:35,931 --> 00:20:37,831
Okay. Thanks.

412
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:43,671
(Ho Am wrote every letter with sincerity.)

413
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:45,410
(You're mean. Jang Ho Am.)

414
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,611
I wrote, "You're mean," on the talisman.

415
00:20:49,911 --> 00:20:53,351
It looked like she was wavering,

416
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:54,981
so I thought it was mean.

417
00:20:55,351 --> 00:20:58,391
I was slightly jealous.

418
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,291
I was jealous.

419
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:04,230
He wanted to say, "I'm jealous."

420
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:05,231
Hang on.

421
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:07,431
It's a slight difference in the nuance,

422
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:12,601
but between saying, "I'm struggling because I'm jealous,"

423
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,470
and saying, "You're mean..."

424
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:16,340
He put a lot of thought into it...

425
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,770
and didn't want to make it too serious...

426
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:20,380
by saying, "I'm waiting for you."

427
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:21,910
- Right. - He must have wanted to...

428
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:22,911
lessen the burden.

429
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:24,810
- So that she won't be mistaken. - He also wanted to say that.

430
00:21:24,811 --> 00:21:26,280
He couldn't write, "How dare you!"

431
00:21:26,281 --> 00:21:29,381
Right. So, I think that's what he was going for.

432
00:21:29,481 --> 00:21:31,721
- This is tricky. - Seriously.

433
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:38,331
(Two men gave Yu Gyeong their talismans.)

434
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:46,971
(There's tension in the room.)

435
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:56,541
(Ho Am looks at the photo he took with Yu Gyeong.)

436
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:04,251
(Byeong Yeol goes on a date first.)

437
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:09,420
(Sighing)

438
00:22:09,421 --> 00:22:10,460
Let's go.

439
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:13,390
(The women are busy preparing for their dates.)

440
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:14,401
Bye.

441
00:22:15,931 --> 00:22:19,771
(Yu Ra isn't aware of this situation yet.)

442
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:20,971
(Glancing)

443
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,271
(She goes to the bathroom.)

444
00:22:25,771 --> 00:22:27,081
(Knocking)

445
00:22:27,481 --> 00:22:29,311
- Can I come in? - Yes.

446
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,981
Someone asked you out on a date, right?

447
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:33,981
- I don't know. - Not yet?

448
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:35,081
Did you get anything?

449
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:37,191
He gave me one.

450
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,921
- Already? I didn't get one yet. - I already did.

451
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:42,191
- Right. - I don't have any.

452
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,281
Maybe you didn't get one because you were in the bathroom.

453
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:47,061
- Maybe they couldn't find you. - No way.

454
00:22:48,231 --> 00:22:50,631
What if I don't get any and have to stay here again?

455
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:52,571
What do I do, then?

456
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:55,701
I wasn't even aware...

457
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,341
that it had already begun.

458
00:22:58,871 --> 00:23:02,011
I heard about it while I was in the bathroom.

459
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,881
So, I just...

460
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:09,721
When are you leaving?

461
00:23:10,251 --> 00:23:11,620
- Now? - I think we're leaving...

462
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:12,691
as soon as we get ready.

463
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,391
No one asked me out, though.

464
00:23:18,591 --> 00:23:23,001
(She bursts into tears as she's upset.)

465
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:25,801
- Oh, no. - I can't stop crying.

466
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,841
Come here.

467
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,440
I didn't know you were so upset.

468
00:23:31,441 --> 00:23:33,011
(Yun Jeong consoles Yu Ra.)

469
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:38,650
The same thing happened on the next day,

470
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:41,821
so it felt like my luck...

471
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:43,691
had disappeared.

472
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:49,461
I got so emotional...

473
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:51,861
that I burst into tears.

474
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:55,001
It's fine.

475
00:23:57,931 --> 00:24:03,171
(She quietly braces herself alone.)

476
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:05,641
- Shall we go? - Sure.

477
00:24:08,311 --> 00:24:09,781
- The weather's nice. - Right?

478
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:10,881
Yes.

479
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:14,250
- Great weather. - It's not so cold in the afternoon.

480
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:15,427
(Talisman Date: Yun Sang Hyeok and Lee Kyung Eon)

481
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:16,880
You can't take your coat off if it bothers you.

482
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:18,151
- Okay. - Do you want to?

483
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:20,390
- Do you? - I'll take it off.

484
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:21,621
The weather is...

485
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:26,230
(He takes her coat.)

486
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,531
Thank you.

487
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,081
- Sit in the front. - Okay.

488
00:24:37,171 --> 00:24:39,240
(She spots something.)

489
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:40,911
I happened to see our destination.

490
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:43,651
- Was it on the GPS? - Yes.

491
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:46,681
An equestrian center? I saw it.

492
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:52,621
How long have you been riding horses?

493
00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:55,721
I've been taking a break for about a year.

494
00:24:55,821 --> 00:24:57,931
- It's been a long time for you? - It has.

495
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,531
It's been a while. A year.

496
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:02,101
Has it been over a year?

497
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:03,461
(Interested)

498
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:05,571
Do you think it'll be scary?

499
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:07,871
What? Wait, am I riding one?

500
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:09,670
You probably are.

501
00:25:09,671 --> 00:25:10,771
(Surprised)

502
00:25:11,471 --> 00:25:12,471
It'll be fun.

503
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:14,641
I'm excited.

504
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:20,251
(Sang Hyeok prepared a horseback riding date.)

505
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:24,151
- Hello. - Hello.

506
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:27,290
I'm your coach who will help you ride them.

507
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:28,890
- Okay. - And these are your horses.

508
00:25:28,891 --> 00:25:31,131
- Okay. Thank you. - Shantry and Cheyenne.

509
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:34,131
- Shantry and... - Shantry and Cheyenne.

510
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:35,860
- Cheyenne. - They're docile,

511
00:25:35,861 --> 00:25:37,630
so they'll be perfect for your experience.

512
00:25:37,631 --> 00:25:39,571
Okay. Shantry.

513
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:44,211
It's very tame. Touch it.

514
00:25:44,641 --> 00:25:45,641
I'll help you.

515
00:25:46,141 --> 00:25:47,141
Go on.

516
00:25:47,142 --> 00:25:48,781
(Nervous)

517
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:53,051
(Kyung Eon cautiously pats the horse.)

518
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:58,321
(Patting)

519
00:25:58,421 --> 00:25:59,721
- It's closing its eyes. - Yes.

520
00:26:01,421 --> 00:26:05,691
(They smoothly say hi to the horses.)

521
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:09,081
- It's your first time, right? - Yes.

522
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:12,471
That's gorgeous.

523
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,000
You'll try feeding this horse.

524
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:15,841
The difference from the other two horses is...

525
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,421
that this one has an owner.

526
00:26:18,341 --> 00:26:20,210
It also likes to be cute.

527
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,911
It keeps asking for a carrot when I'm holding one.

528
00:26:23,411 --> 00:26:24,711
Then, you feed it.

529
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:27,821
(Snapping)

530
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,081
(Surprised)

531
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,690
The most important part is when you have this much left.

532
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,391
Open your hand...

533
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:37,630
and put it in its mouth.

534
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:40,311
(She's scared as she has to get closer to the horse than expected.)

535
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:42,131
(Looking)

536
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:45,800
- Have you fed a horse before? - No.

537
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:47,000
- Right? - Yes.

538
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:48,070
- Then, - Yes.

539
00:26:48,071 --> 00:26:49,571
Hold my hand and give it a go.

540
00:26:49,671 --> 00:26:50,840
- Can I? - Hold this.

541
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:52,940
- And I'll hold your hand. - Oh, no!

542
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:54,141
- Is this all right? - Yes.

543
00:26:54,341 --> 00:26:55,341
Let's go.

544
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:57,591
(They're naturally holding each other's hands.)

545
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:00,451
(Surprised)

546
00:27:00,781 --> 00:27:02,121
Am I a hopeless romantic?

547
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:05,820
It looks like you are.

548
00:27:05,821 --> 00:27:07,120
- Right? I'm... - A little bit.

549
00:27:07,121 --> 00:27:10,220
- You're falling for Sang Hyeok? - If a man were to...

550
00:27:10,221 --> 00:27:11,901
- cover my hands to protect me... - Right.

551
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,531
It would make your heart flutter.

552
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,631
To us, it just looks like he's making a lame move.

553
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,500
(To a middle-aged man, it's a lame move.)

554
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:19,931
He's feeding it, after all.

555
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:22,701
But you can tell...

556
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,670
- that Sang Hyeok is considerate... - Right.

557
00:27:24,671 --> 00:27:26,570
And warm-hearted.

558
00:27:26,571 --> 00:27:27,840
- Yes, he's considerate. - Yes.

559
00:27:27,841 --> 00:27:29,541
- Right? - He's warm-hearted.

560
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:31,511
- Are you in love? - Yes.

561
00:27:33,311 --> 00:27:34,580
- Oh, my gosh! - I'll hold it like this.

562
00:27:34,581 --> 00:27:35,951
- Is this all right? - Yes.

563
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:37,991
- Let's go. Are you sure? - Yes.

564
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:43,721
Okay.

565
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:45,361
- Should I do the next part? - Yes.

566
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:48,961
(Shy)

567
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:51,471
It checks the carrot with its mouth.

568
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:58,770
(He skilfully leads her.)

569
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:00,841
It was new.

570
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:03,281
Although I like animals,

571
00:28:03,341 --> 00:28:05,080
I'm quite afraid of them.

572
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:09,051
It was difficult yet fun.

573
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:13,651
He helped and guided me,

574
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:16,760
so I relied on him...

575
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:17,861
a lot.

576
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,701
He looked great when he did that.

577
00:28:23,061 --> 00:28:24,271
- I'll feed it again. - Sure.

578
00:28:27,441 --> 00:28:29,470
When she was scared,

579
00:28:29,471 --> 00:28:31,111
she looked cute.

580
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:34,140
I think it was a chance for her to feel comfortable around me.

581
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:35,141
Today's date, I mean.

582
00:28:38,311 --> 00:28:40,620
Why don't we go and ride horses now?

583
00:28:40,621 --> 00:28:43,720
- Sure. - Let's ride a horse.

584
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:44,721
Yes.

585
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:46,650
(She wears a helmet to ride a horse.)

586
00:28:46,651 --> 00:28:50,161
- This is... - My hair is...

587
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,060
Does my hair look okay?

588
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:54,131
Hold on. I'll get it. Stay still.

589
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:56,131
Can you look up a bit?

590
00:28:58,371 --> 00:28:59,401
Okay.

591
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:04,171
(Focused)

592
00:29:04,971 --> 00:29:08,610
- How thoughtful! - What?

593
00:29:08,611 --> 00:29:09,640
(Her heart flutters.)

594
00:29:09,641 --> 00:29:11,180
It looks like a prince...

595
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:12,780
- Right. He's like a prince. - looking after a princess.

596
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:13,921
"Will you look up a bit?"

597
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:16,821
- Oh, my gosh! - Right?

598
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:20,191
- Hang on. - I can't do it.

599
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:22,760
- Is there a mirror? - But it's windy, so...

600
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,861
Is that right?

601
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:26,091
It's my first time. Hold on.

602
00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:29,700
Hold this. The saddle... No, hold on to this instead.

603
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:30,931
- Here? - Grab the saddle.

604
00:29:31,031 --> 00:29:32,031
Put your foot in.

605
00:29:32,701 --> 00:29:34,840
Good. In 1, 2, 3. Slowly.

606
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:37,000
- But... - It's all right. Take your time.

607
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:39,011
Trust me, and go. Okay.

608
00:29:40,271 --> 00:29:41,980
Well done. That was good.

609
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:43,717
(She got on the horse, thanks to Sang Hyeok's help.)

610
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:46,551
Before you start riding, pat it, and say, "It's nice to meet you."

611
00:29:47,181 --> 00:29:48,720
It's nice to meet you.

612
00:29:48,721 --> 00:29:50,021
It's nice to meet you. Good.

613
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:52,421
- Grab this? - Yes, grab it.

614
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:53,897
- Should we try walking first? - Yes.

615
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:54,921
(Smiling)

616
00:29:56,891 --> 00:29:57,960
- Will you be all right? - Yes.

617
00:29:57,961 --> 00:29:58,961
Okay.

618
00:29:59,491 --> 00:30:00,491
Let's go.

619
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:02,901
Good. It's all good.

620
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,870
Look at me. Don't be too nervous.

621
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:06,300
Straighten up and look far ahead.

622
00:30:06,301 --> 00:30:07,771
- Far ahead. - Yes, look far ahead.

623
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:10,341
Feel how the horse moves with your hips.

624
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:11,941
- With my hips? - Try to feel it.

625
00:30:13,241 --> 00:30:14,341
Slowly.

626
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:15,611
It's okay. Look ahead.

627
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:20,551
You don't have to be nervous.

628
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,301
You're doing good. Try touching the horse.

629
00:30:26,251 --> 00:30:27,521
(Patting)

630
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:31,061
- Is it okay? - Yes. It's so warm.

631
00:30:31,231 --> 00:30:32,830
You look good riding a horse.

632
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,551
- Do I? - Yes. You look good in the outfit.

633
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:38,700
(Sang Hyeok slowly leads the horse she's riding.)

634
00:30:38,701 --> 00:30:41,171
- You're not scared anymore, right? - No, I'm not scared.

635
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:44,070
- Put your right hand like this. - Feeding the horse...

636
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:45,170
was the scariest.

637
00:30:45,171 --> 00:30:46,471
- Was it the scariest? - Yes.

638
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,411
It was so nice.

639
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:55,750
"I won't be able to enjoy it if this moment passes."

640
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:57,591
There were moments when I thought like that.

641
00:30:57,851 --> 00:31:00,320
It felt so good.

642
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:03,121
I think I'll remember those moments.

643
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:05,891
He was cool.

644
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:11,771
She trusted me and followed my lead.

645
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:13,131
It made me happy.

646
00:31:13,401 --> 00:31:14,871
It made me like her more.

647
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:18,071
It helped us get closer.

648
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:23,081
(They take a picture of the special memory.)

649
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,111
(Sticking together)

650
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:27,651
(Smiling)

651
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:31,191
(They became closer than they were yesterday.)

652
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:37,891
(They made another memory together.)

653
00:31:39,591 --> 00:31:41,161
(Happy)

654
00:31:41,661 --> 00:31:43,300
Compared to other couples,

655
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,930
- it went smoothly... - Yes.

656
00:31:44,931 --> 00:31:46,700
- without any obstacles. - Right.

657
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:49,370
There are two things on my bucket list.

658
00:31:49,371 --> 00:31:51,441
- You have two things now? - Going to a sheep farm.

659
00:31:52,671 --> 00:31:55,981
- The one we saw last time? - And horse riding.

660
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:58,080
It seems like a nice activity to do on a date.

661
00:31:58,081 --> 00:31:59,561
(Their dates are on her bucket list.)

662
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:02,580
Where are our seats?

663
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:04,691
It's number 11.

664
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,991
Lucky 11.

665
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:10,121
- What is this? - What?

666
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,530
- This? - Yes.

667
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:13,171
(The second location on their lucky date)

668
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:18,271
(A romantic outdoor campsite)

669
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:21,501
(Sizzling)

670
00:32:23,601 --> 00:32:24,641
This is amazing.

671
00:32:26,641 --> 00:32:28,411
You're drooling while cutting it.

672
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:31,910
(Sang Hyeok takes care of Kyung Eon first.)

673
00:32:31,911 --> 00:32:34,011
Thank you. Let's eat together.

674
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:36,521
- You try it first. - Me first?

675
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:38,990
(Blowing)

676
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:40,150
(Eating)

677
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:41,361
I wonder how it tastes.

678
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:43,261
- It's so good. - Is it good?

679
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:47,131
(He has a piece of meat after her.)

680
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:52,630
Do you laugh a lot?

681
00:32:52,631 --> 00:32:53,731
Yes.

682
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:54,941
That's nice.

683
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:56,941
Of course.

684
00:32:57,371 --> 00:32:59,771
(They're having fun.)

685
00:33:00,371 --> 00:33:03,281
By the way, did you say you like hip-hop?

686
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:10,521
You said something about hip-hop.

687
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:12,351
In the 15-minute session?

688
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:14,661
Yes. It was you, right?

689
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:16,991
It wasn't me.

690
00:33:18,761 --> 00:33:20,931
(Flustered)

691
00:33:23,731 --> 00:33:26,071
(Yesterday morning in the Pavilion of Connections)

692
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:29,241
- I like hip-hop. - I see.

693
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,601
Hip-hop?

694
00:33:31,711 --> 00:33:32,870
(Sad)

695
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:36,610
It was so hectic that day.

696
00:33:36,611 --> 00:33:38,211
(She's talking gibberish for no reason.)

697
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:40,381
I guess it was quite impressive.

698
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:43,881
No. It wasn't.

699
00:33:44,591 --> 00:33:46,451
- Oh, gosh. - Don't be flustered.

700
00:33:47,351 --> 00:33:50,060
(It's time to make up for it.)

701
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,790
- What? Why? - Hold on.

702
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:52,991
Are you going to eat the meat?

703
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,561
Try it with this.

704
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:56,661
- Is it good? - Yes. Try this.

705
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:01,700
(Satisfied)

706
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:03,941
(Relieved)

707
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:08,041
- Okay. It's burning well. - Is it?

708
00:34:09,611 --> 00:34:12,550
(Sang Hyeok is preparing to stare at the fire with her.)

709
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,881
- I'm sorry. - No, it's fine.

710
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:17,421
I feel like the fire will get too big.

711
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:19,521
I've done this many times.

712
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:20,890
You have?

713
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:23,260
(Sang Hyeok has his pride.)

714
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:24,290
Do you think it should be big to look pretty?

715
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:26,230
- It should be big. - Is that so?

716
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,261
Okay.

717
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:29,861
(1 piece of firewood)

718
00:34:31,171 --> 00:34:32,401
(2 pieces of firewood)

719
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:34,301
(3 pieces of firewood)

720
00:34:34,941 --> 00:34:37,811
(He keeps adding firewood.)

721
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:41,141
(Perplexed)

722
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:43,410
(Burning)

723
00:34:43,411 --> 00:34:45,081
This is not peaceful at all.

724
00:34:46,411 --> 00:34:48,150
It'll be fine after everything burns.

725
00:34:48,151 --> 00:34:49,311
(It's more like a fire show.)

726
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,421
Oh, no. We might wet our beds tonight.

727
00:34:53,021 --> 00:34:54,190
They say you wet your bed if you play with fire.

728
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:55,191
No.

729
00:34:55,192 --> 00:34:56,560
Don't worry.

730
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,731
- Get some salt. - No. Don't worry.

731
00:34:59,861 --> 00:35:01,400
- Come closer to the fire. - What?

732
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:03,400
- Take a seat here. - Come closer to the fire?

733
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,000
- I mean... - It's too dangerous.

734
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:06,800
It's not dangerous. It really isn't.

735
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:07,941
Really?

736
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:09,401
(Glancing)

737
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:12,771
For sure, the fire was too big.

738
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,641
- Was it too much? - The fire was too big.

739
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:18,751
It's warm, though.

740
00:35:19,011 --> 00:35:20,581
- Shall we eat this? - It's warm.

741
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:23,751
- Let me skewer it for you. - Okay.

742
00:35:24,491 --> 00:35:26,250
- How many do you want? - One.

743
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:27,551
(One?)

744
00:35:28,861 --> 00:35:30,791
(Bursting into laughter)

745
00:35:31,861 --> 00:35:32,961
How many...

746
00:35:33,561 --> 00:35:35,100
How many do you want?

747
00:35:35,101 --> 00:35:37,161
- You should have at least three. - Three?

748
00:35:38,331 --> 00:35:41,501
(Nothing is working out.)

749
00:35:43,701 --> 00:35:45,711
- Let's toast it here. - Sure.

750
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,741
Why do I keep speaking informally?

751
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:50,880
You can speak informally.

752
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:51,881
(Laughing)

753
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:53,511
- What? - You really got three.

754
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:56,271
(Sang Hyeok skewers more marshmallows than she asked for.)

755
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:57,621
I think I'll want more.

756
00:35:58,651 --> 00:36:00,591
(He's cute.)

757
00:36:02,021 --> 00:36:05,261
At first, I liked him because he seemed like a nice person.

758
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:06,531
Now,

759
00:36:08,361 --> 00:36:11,331
he tries to do something perfectly,

760
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:14,500
but it doesn't look perfect to me,

761
00:36:14,501 --> 00:36:15,571
which is funny.

762
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,101
He's...

763
00:36:18,071 --> 00:36:20,071
kind of cute.

764
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,611
I think he's cute.

765
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,681
From cool to cute.

766
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:27,380
She's in that phase.

767
00:36:27,381 --> 00:36:28,550
It's over when you find someone cute.

768
00:36:28,551 --> 00:36:30,250
The atmosphere has been nice for two days in a row.

769
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:31,251
I know.

770
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:34,521
Speaking casually is not a big deal,

771
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:36,490
but it makes you feel very comfortable, doesn't it?

772
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:37,660
- You get closer. - Like how you address them.

773
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:38,890
- It changes the atmosphere. - Yes.

774
00:36:38,891 --> 00:36:40,267
You call them with honorifics at first.

775
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:41,830
Then when you drop the honorifics,

776
00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:43,400
- it changes the mood completely. - Right.

777
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,031
- It's completely different. - Yes.

778
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,500
- The fire will go out soon. - Yes.

779
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:50,501
(Dropping the honorifics, they got closer.)

780
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:55,911
(It's naturally getting sweeter.)

781
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:02,251
(Staring at the fire)

782
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:05,551
How was today's date?

783
00:37:06,951 --> 00:37:08,761
Do you think I followed your lead well?

784
00:37:09,091 --> 00:37:10,591
This is what I think.

785
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:14,331
- You don't know what I'm like. - Right.

786
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:17,161
For example, at the stable,

787
00:37:17,931 --> 00:37:21,141
there might have been a lack of trust in me based on my actions.

788
00:37:21,501 --> 00:37:22,541
However,

789
00:37:23,271 --> 00:37:25,591
rather than starting with trust that can easily be broken,

790
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:27,211
it's more important...

791
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:29,411
to build a strong trust...

792
00:37:29,911 --> 00:37:32,951
by getting to know...

793
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,281
each other.

794
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:36,721
You're right.

795
00:37:36,851 --> 00:37:38,851
I also think that's more important.

796
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:42,191
But I really trusted you when I was riding the horse.

797
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:46,590
(He can't hide his smile hearing her words.)

798
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:49,060
But as for this fire...

799
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:50,361
(Joking)

800
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,971
I was like, "The fire is getting bigger."

801
00:37:57,471 --> 00:37:59,571
I like...

802
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:03,381
- joking around like this. - Yes.

803
00:38:04,611 --> 00:38:07,551
I hope you don't take it...

804
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:08,820
too seriously.

805
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:10,220
- Of course, I don't. - Right?

806
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,551
Of course.

807
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:16,891
(They comfortably joke around while expressing their sincerity.)

808
00:38:17,721 --> 00:38:20,560
Today, we were outside the whole time during our date.

809
00:38:20,561 --> 00:38:21,601
I know.

810
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:24,570
I think it suits me.

811
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:25,901
Me too.

812
00:38:27,401 --> 00:38:31,071
When we talked yesterday,

813
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:35,041
you said you like activities.

814
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:37,311
So I thought it'd be fine.

815
00:38:40,781 --> 00:38:41,881
I liked it.

816
00:38:42,451 --> 00:38:43,651
I liked it so much.

817
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:45,420
(Shy)

818
00:38:45,421 --> 00:38:46,651
I made...

819
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:48,621
a new memory with a new person.

820
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:54,231
I'll really think about it.

821
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:58,921
I have butterflies in my stomach.

822
00:39:01,741 --> 00:39:03,201
Kyung Eon...

823
00:39:03,571 --> 00:39:06,071
is cute in many ways.

824
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,980
She made me feel something...

825
00:39:08,981 --> 00:39:12,681
I hadn't felt in a long time,

826
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:15,521
so I had a great time.

827
00:39:16,081 --> 00:39:17,221
On the first day,

828
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:23,121
I was trying to see...

829
00:39:23,221 --> 00:39:25,361
if I was really interested in him.

830
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:26,731
Today,

831
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:30,601
I felt it for sure.

832
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:33,801
If I don't go out with him tomorrow,

833
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:35,671
I'll be disappointed.

834
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:39,841
(Possessed House in the meantime)

835
00:39:42,141 --> 00:39:43,611
Yu Ra, are you in there?

836
00:39:44,851 --> 00:39:45,980
(To be continued)

837
00:39:45,981 --> 00:39:47,181
Can I go in?

838
00:39:50,215 --> 00:39:51,345
Why are you crying?

839
00:39:54,115 --> 00:39:58,225
(Ho Am comes to Yu Ra who's crying alone in the room.)

840
00:39:58,485 --> 00:40:00,584
(Worried)

841
00:40:00,585 --> 00:40:01,695
What is it?

842
00:40:05,225 --> 00:40:08,364
There were things I wanted to do, but nothing is going my way.

843
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:11,035
- What? - I can't seem to do what I want.

844
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,535
All of a sudden, I got so emotional.

845
00:40:17,205 --> 00:40:18,275
Are you frustrated?

846
00:40:22,315 --> 00:40:25,415
I just keep questioning myself why this is happening.

847
00:40:28,015 --> 00:40:30,214
Before our day began, I wanted to do my best today.

848
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:32,255
That's what I was thinking about.

849
00:40:34,155 --> 00:40:36,395
It feels like we don't have much time left.

850
00:40:37,025 --> 00:40:38,125
But...

851
00:40:38,965 --> 00:40:41,665
Seriously. I wasn't struggling like this before.

852
00:40:43,035 --> 00:40:45,134
Now, I'm having all kinds of thoughts.

853
00:40:45,135 --> 00:40:46,405
I'm worried too.

854
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:49,834
- Don't burden yourself. Right. - Don't burden myself?

855
00:40:49,835 --> 00:40:51,304
At times like this,

856
00:40:51,305 --> 00:40:52,945
- you need to find yourself again. - I...

857
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:57,415
Things might not work out while staying in the house.

858
00:40:58,285 --> 00:41:01,045
But only focus on your emotions.

859
00:41:01,315 --> 00:41:04,055
But distance yourself from feeling sad for yourself.

860
00:41:05,155 --> 00:41:06,885
You can find your composure again.

861
00:41:07,325 --> 00:41:10,455
Try to distinguish the feelings you're having now.

862
00:41:12,525 --> 00:41:15,135
- My gosh. She's been crying. - Oh, no.

863
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:16,735
Poor thing.

864
00:41:16,895 --> 00:41:19,505
My gosh, yes. She must be heartbroken.

865
00:41:19,705 --> 00:41:21,404
Ho Am must feel so awful for her.

866
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:23,175
They stayed in the house together yesterday.

867
00:41:23,335 --> 00:41:25,804
Gosh, I'm glad Ho Am is there for her.

868
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:27,075
- Yesterday too. - Yes.

869
00:41:27,205 --> 00:41:29,244
When you meet people...

870
00:41:29,245 --> 00:41:31,274
whose job is to understand other people's pain,

871
00:41:31,275 --> 00:41:34,414
it feels like they understand you better than you understand yourself.

872
00:41:34,415 --> 00:41:35,514
That must give a sense of relief...

873
00:41:35,515 --> 00:41:36,584
- and comfort. - Right.

874
00:41:36,585 --> 00:41:37,884
- I'm sure of it. - Yes.

875
00:41:37,885 --> 00:41:41,384
Ho Am keeps comforting her and helping her stay strong.

876
00:41:41,385 --> 00:41:44,595
Wouldn't she develop affection for Ho Am?

877
00:41:44,895 --> 00:41:46,094
- That's possible. - Wouldn't that be possible?

878
00:41:46,095 --> 00:41:48,764
But Yu Ra knows that he has feelings...

879
00:41:48,765 --> 00:41:50,694
for Yu Gyeong.

880
00:41:50,695 --> 00:41:53,634
- Right. Yes. - That's why it's harder for her.

881
00:41:53,635 --> 00:41:55,805
- Right. My gosh. - That's true.

882
00:41:58,775 --> 00:42:01,914
Having Ho Am in the house made things easier for me.

883
00:42:01,915 --> 00:42:05,044
After talking to Ho Am,

884
00:42:05,045 --> 00:42:06,685
I felt lighter.

885
00:42:07,045 --> 00:42:09,555
This was the day I was going to be more proactive...

886
00:42:09,815 --> 00:42:13,854
whether it meant I would ask out the guy I was interested in...

887
00:42:13,855 --> 00:42:16,454
or simply initiating a conversation.

888
00:42:16,455 --> 00:42:18,795
That was my plan for today.

889
00:42:19,165 --> 00:42:22,065
We don't have a lot of time left. So until then,

890
00:42:22,365 --> 00:42:25,405
I'll try my best. That's my mindset right now.

891
00:42:28,065 --> 00:42:34,205
(Time is running out. Will Yu Ra be able to change?)

892
00:42:37,275 --> 00:42:38,345
I guess we've arrived.

893
00:42:39,245 --> 00:42:40,384
- Thanks. - Sure.

894
00:42:40,385 --> 00:42:41,444
(Talisman Date: Ha Byeong Yeol and Chae Yu Gyeong)

895
00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:42,585
Where...

896
00:42:43,885 --> 00:42:45,025
This must be the place.

897
00:42:46,785 --> 00:42:48,825
- Gosh, this place is beautiful. - Right.

898
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:52,725
(It's filled with cute props.)

899
00:42:52,825 --> 00:42:55,665
(It's an Asian-style tea cafe.)

900
00:42:55,965 --> 00:42:57,064
- Yes. - The exterior is beautiful too.

901
00:42:57,065 --> 00:42:58,135
There are flowers.

902
00:42:58,205 --> 00:42:59,634
The atmosphere of the cafe is so cool.

903
00:42:59,635 --> 00:43:00,765
Right.

904
00:43:02,075 --> 00:43:03,305
(Staring)

905
00:43:03,605 --> 00:43:04,735
You have cute dimples.

906
00:43:05,645 --> 00:43:07,105
(Shy)

907
00:43:07,775 --> 00:43:08,875
- Thanks. - Okay.

908
00:43:10,715 --> 00:43:12,515
(Surprised)

909
00:43:13,185 --> 00:43:14,314
"You have cute dimples."

910
00:43:14,315 --> 00:43:15,315
(Byeong Yeol flirts with her out of the blue.)

911
00:43:15,316 --> 00:43:17,884
- Gosh, he's being expressive. - Hey, what was that just now?

912
00:43:17,885 --> 00:43:19,325
Byeong Yeol is being expressive.

913
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,225
(Overly invested in it)

914
00:43:21,285 --> 00:43:23,825
(Getting the butterflies)

915
00:43:24,395 --> 00:43:26,795
- You seem different from yesterday. - Yesterday?

916
00:43:26,995 --> 00:43:28,464
I see. In what way?

917
00:43:28,465 --> 00:43:31,704
- You were busy being shy yesterday. - Yes.

918
00:43:31,705 --> 00:43:33,205
- Yes. - But today,

919
00:43:34,035 --> 00:43:36,804
- you're expressing yourself a lot. - Yes? I see.

920
00:43:36,805 --> 00:43:37,904
- Is that so? - Yes.

921
00:43:37,905 --> 00:43:39,825
(She's surprised by the change in his behaviour.)

922
00:43:40,145 --> 00:43:41,425
Isn't it nice to express myself?

923
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:45,715
(He keeps flirting with her without a break.)

924
00:43:46,045 --> 00:43:47,485
- My gosh. - You know?

925
00:43:48,185 --> 00:43:49,315
Right.

926
00:43:50,415 --> 00:43:52,725
- This is fascinating for me too. - Okay.

927
00:43:53,725 --> 00:43:57,155
I have to say that I was confused in the beginning.

928
00:43:57,755 --> 00:44:00,995
To be honest, you were the one who mustered up the courage.

929
00:44:01,795 --> 00:44:06,205
You expressed yourself clearly. I noticed that about you.

930
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,035
So...

931
00:44:09,205 --> 00:44:12,175
- I was feeling timid at first. - Yes.

932
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:15,275
Then I thought, "Can I open up to her? Should I?"

933
00:44:15,515 --> 00:44:17,945
I kept thinking about that.

934
00:44:18,545 --> 00:44:20,085
So that's how it led to this.

935
00:44:21,345 --> 00:44:22,585
- I see. - Yes.

936
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,454
- This is an unexpected side of you. - Really?

937
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:27,184
- So you have a sentimental side. - What...

938
00:44:27,185 --> 00:44:30,024
kind of image did you have of me? I'm a sentimental person.

939
00:44:30,025 --> 00:44:31,095
- Really? - Yes.

940
00:44:31,395 --> 00:44:33,665
When you look at me, can you feel that?

941
00:44:34,495 --> 00:44:37,135
- From one person to another... - Can I read you?

942
00:44:37,235 --> 00:44:38,535
(Surprised)

943
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,735
- Well... - Can I?

944
00:44:41,135 --> 00:44:42,904
Shouldn't that come first?

945
00:44:42,905 --> 00:44:44,185
(He might be forced to open up.)

946
00:44:44,705 --> 00:44:45,804
(He forgot about his date's shamanistic skill.)

947
00:44:45,805 --> 00:44:48,675
- Okay. You can do it. - Okay.

948
00:44:48,775 --> 00:44:51,174
- Did you do a reading on me? - No, I didn't.

949
00:44:51,175 --> 00:44:54,014
Can you secretly read someone even if he hasn't asked?

950
00:44:54,015 --> 00:44:55,884
What do you mean by secretly?

951
00:44:55,885 --> 00:44:57,054
Let's say you're curious about someone...

952
00:44:57,055 --> 00:44:58,255
and wants to read him.

953
00:44:58,525 --> 00:44:59,585
Then can you read him?

954
00:45:01,355 --> 00:45:04,595
It will be difficult to read him completely.

955
00:45:05,365 --> 00:45:06,824
But I would use my energy, per se.

956
00:45:06,825 --> 00:45:08,564
- I see. You use your energy. - I can use my energy and focus.

957
00:45:08,565 --> 00:45:10,295
- Then I can read him. - I see.

958
00:45:11,035 --> 00:45:13,105
But I don't want to do that.

959
00:45:14,265 --> 00:45:15,335
Why not?

960
00:45:16,035 --> 00:45:17,434
I want to get to know you by talking to you.

961
00:45:17,435 --> 00:45:19,445
(I want to get to know you by talking to you.)

962
00:45:21,175 --> 00:45:23,514
This is why I feel grateful to you.

963
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:25,945
- Let me elaborate. You are... - Okay.

964
00:45:26,285 --> 00:45:28,854
Spending time with me just as Chae Yu Gyeong.

965
00:45:28,855 --> 00:45:30,354
- And you want to get to know me... - Okay.

966
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:31,824
On a person-to-person level. It's your attitude.

967
00:45:31,825 --> 00:45:34,155
Or should I call it your will?

968
00:45:34,655 --> 00:45:36,655
- I can sense that in your will. - Okay.

969
00:45:37,395 --> 00:45:38,965
So I'm grateful to you.

970
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:41,425
I see.

971
00:45:45,365 --> 00:45:49,175
(The two of them get to know each other through talking.)

972
00:45:49,905 --> 00:45:52,275
My gosh. Seriously.

973
00:45:56,115 --> 00:45:57,644
Why are you so popular?

974
00:45:57,645 --> 00:45:58,745
- Me? - Yes.

975
00:45:59,685 --> 00:46:00,715
I mean it.

976
00:46:01,015 --> 00:46:02,685
(Flustered)

977
00:46:03,155 --> 00:46:06,155
- Am I popular with you? - Yes. But not just with me.

978
00:46:07,585 --> 00:46:08,695
Another guy...

979
00:46:09,755 --> 00:46:11,125
asked you out.

980
00:46:12,695 --> 00:46:14,365
So you have to go to him.

981
00:46:16,895 --> 00:46:18,735
- We don't have much time left. - Yes.

982
00:46:19,305 --> 00:46:23,835
But you have to leave me later. I was bummed out about that.

983
00:46:27,805 --> 00:46:29,315
(In a tight spot)

984
00:46:30,145 --> 00:46:33,285
(He's disappointed that their date will be brief today.)

985
00:46:38,255 --> 00:46:40,735
It must be black tea. It's 1 of the top 3 black teas in China.

986
00:46:44,825 --> 00:46:46,024
Do you want to clink our glasses?

987
00:46:46,025 --> 00:46:47,064
- Clink our glasses? - Yes.

988
00:46:47,065 --> 00:46:48,065
(Cheers)

989
00:46:48,665 --> 00:46:49,665
(Sipping)

990
00:46:51,065 --> 00:46:53,064
- How is it? - This is so good.

991
00:46:53,065 --> 00:46:54,165
Yes, I like this too.

992
00:46:57,935 --> 00:47:00,345
- Drinking tea feels therapeutic. - Yes.

993
00:47:02,675 --> 00:47:05,615
I wish we could relax and enjoy the tea.

994
00:47:06,385 --> 00:47:07,685
But I feel like I must rush.

995
00:47:09,515 --> 00:47:10,585
Okay.

996
00:47:11,015 --> 00:47:12,125
(Glancing)

997
00:47:13,155 --> 00:47:16,294
- Anyway, we're together right now. - Yes.

998
00:47:16,295 --> 00:47:19,065
We can have a nice conversation and enjoy our time together.

999
00:47:20,695 --> 00:47:22,065
But I'm struggling to do that.

1000
00:47:23,935 --> 00:47:26,135
(He fails to let her go while maintaining his cool.)

1001
00:47:29,175 --> 00:47:30,655
- He doesn't want her to go. - Right.

1002
00:47:30,805 --> 00:47:32,675
- He's expressing himself a lot. - Oh, my.

1003
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:34,974
- He's bothered by that. - I like that.

1004
00:47:34,975 --> 00:47:36,175
I love it.

1005
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:39,444
Byeong Yeol rarely expresses his interest in front of Ho Am.

1006
00:47:39,445 --> 00:47:40,814
- Right. - Yes.

1007
00:47:40,815 --> 00:47:42,931
But he's expressing himself a lot in front of Yu Gyeong.

1008
00:47:42,955 --> 00:47:44,254
I guess it doesn't take long for me to fall in love.

1009
00:47:44,255 --> 00:47:45,584
I'm on their team now.

1010
00:47:45,585 --> 00:47:47,325
- Are you shipping them together? - Yes.

1011
00:47:48,355 --> 00:47:49,425
Oh, no.

1012
00:47:51,525 --> 00:47:54,524
It feels like we're drinking liquor, not tea.

1013
00:47:54,525 --> 00:47:56,085
- It feels like drinking liquor? - Yes.

1014
00:47:56,565 --> 00:47:57,895
- I must do a good job. - Yes.

1015
00:47:59,805 --> 00:48:01,104
You're a precious fairy.

1016
00:48:01,105 --> 00:48:04,275
(I must do a good job. You're a precious fairy.)

1017
00:48:11,345 --> 00:48:12,515
- By the way, - Yes.

1018
00:48:13,945 --> 00:48:17,455
Do you have any opinions or feelings...

1019
00:48:17,655 --> 00:48:19,785
- Yes. - about me as a shaman?

1020
00:48:20,385 --> 00:48:22,185
- As a shaman? - What are your thoughts? Yes.

1021
00:48:23,055 --> 00:48:25,365
What do you think I'll be like as a shaman?

1022
00:48:26,465 --> 00:48:28,165
- Yu Gyeong as a shaman? - Yes.

1023
00:48:28,595 --> 00:48:31,935
(She's curious about what he thinks of her job.)

1024
00:48:32,805 --> 00:48:34,085
First of all, let me just say...

1025
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:38,804
that when people get to know one another,

1026
00:48:38,805 --> 00:48:40,104
they say they get to know...

1027
00:48:40,105 --> 00:48:41,375
- more about the person. - Yes.

1028
00:48:41,845 --> 00:48:44,545
I don't think you can separate the two...

1029
00:48:44,815 --> 00:48:49,055
because being a shaman is a part of who you are.

1030
00:48:49,185 --> 00:48:50,815
Let's say things work out between us.

1031
00:48:51,255 --> 00:48:52,284
Spending time together now is one thing.

1032
00:48:52,285 --> 00:48:53,724
But we must make our final decision...

1033
00:48:53,725 --> 00:48:55,485
and think about what happens after the show.

1034
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:59,464
As I thought about how to embrace...

1035
00:48:59,465 --> 00:49:03,465
and support your job while being there for you,

1036
00:49:04,165 --> 00:49:07,735
I decided to adopt a positive mindset about it.

1037
00:49:08,775 --> 00:49:10,375
I'm quite determined to do that.

1038
00:49:12,045 --> 00:49:15,615
(She heard Byeong Yeol's opinion about Yu Gyeong as a shaman.)

1039
00:49:18,275 --> 00:49:20,515
It's true that I'm human above all else.

1040
00:49:20,615 --> 00:49:21,714
But at the same time,

1041
00:49:21,715 --> 00:49:22,814
- once we leave this show, - Yes.

1042
00:49:22,815 --> 00:49:24,985
- I must mostly live as a shaman. - Yes. Right.

1043
00:49:27,155 --> 00:49:28,894
It feels to me that...

1044
00:49:28,895 --> 00:49:30,655
you haven't considered that side of my life.

1045
00:49:30,725 --> 00:49:32,265
- I see. Really? - Yes.

1046
00:49:32,725 --> 00:49:34,995
You expressed that you wanted...

1047
00:49:35,295 --> 00:49:39,335
to know more about me and that you were interested in me.

1048
00:49:40,135 --> 00:49:43,305
But you haven't gone far enough to consider what would come after.

1049
00:49:43,405 --> 00:49:46,745
To me, it just sounds like preparing yourself is all you did.

1050
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:50,974
Personally, I thought that...

1051
00:49:50,975 --> 00:49:54,044
it wasn't a topic I could discuss lightheartedly.

1052
00:49:54,045 --> 00:49:56,955
So it was difficult to have this discussion with him.

1053
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,255
When I take the role of a shaman,

1054
00:49:59,985 --> 00:50:03,255
I talk and behave differently.

1055
00:50:03,795 --> 00:50:05,725
Moreover, when I go off to pray,

1056
00:50:06,425 --> 00:50:08,465
I won't be able to text or call frequently.

1057
00:50:09,235 --> 00:50:11,034
Almost my entire life...

1058
00:50:11,035 --> 00:50:13,105
will change quite a bit.

1059
00:50:13,405 --> 00:50:16,135
I wondered if he could be understanding despite this change.

1060
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:19,175
That was the question I was asking him.

1061
00:50:20,905 --> 00:50:23,675
Were you concerned about that?

1062
00:50:24,675 --> 00:50:25,985
- I wasn't concerned. - Okay.

1063
00:50:26,045 --> 00:50:27,945
I wondered if this crossed your mind...

1064
00:50:28,015 --> 00:50:31,085
because things could be quite different.

1065
00:50:31,255 --> 00:50:33,095
Of course, I thought about it. Let me explain.

1066
00:50:33,525 --> 00:50:35,825
In a way, given our careers,

1067
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:39,094
I thought that there might be cases...

1068
00:50:39,095 --> 00:50:41,295
where exchanging sympathy and acknowledgment...

1069
00:50:41,695 --> 00:50:44,865
might not be possible. That crossed my mind.

1070
00:50:46,235 --> 00:50:49,005
And even after coming here,

1071
00:50:49,975 --> 00:50:52,005
I found myself hesitant and overthinking.

1072
00:50:52,905 --> 00:50:54,374
I ran away from it...

1073
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:56,295
and avoided my circumstance to a certain extent.

1074
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:57,975
That's how I behaved here.

1075
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:01,685
(The day of revealing their jobs)

1076
00:51:02,055 --> 00:51:03,055
Three.

1077
00:51:03,056 --> 00:51:05,115
- Yes. I knew it. - Yes.

1078
00:51:05,885 --> 00:51:09,795
(I've been a shaman for 2 years.)

1079
00:51:10,225 --> 00:51:11,895
(Surprised)

1080
00:51:13,325 --> 00:51:14,665
(Sighing)

1081
00:51:16,935 --> 00:51:18,141
(Lee Ra Yun, Hong Yu Ra, Kim Yun Jeong, Chae Yu Gyeong)

1082
00:51:18,165 --> 00:51:20,934
"I could date a shaman. Sure."

1083
00:51:20,935 --> 00:51:23,105
That's how a part of me felt.

1084
00:51:23,905 --> 00:51:25,604
But at the same time,

1085
00:51:25,605 --> 00:51:27,445
I wasn't sure if I could fully understand her.

1086
00:51:29,175 --> 00:51:31,145
(But here's how I feel.)

1087
00:51:31,245 --> 00:51:34,314
(If things work out here, )

1088
00:51:34,315 --> 00:51:37,355
(I'd like to continue this relationship after the show.)

1089
00:51:37,485 --> 00:51:41,885
(He was looking for his other half more seriously than anyone.)

1090
00:51:43,195 --> 00:51:47,995
(Yu Gyeong approached this cautious man first.)

1091
00:51:48,695 --> 00:51:52,105
(To be honest, I'm curious about you.)

1092
00:51:53,105 --> 00:51:55,974
(He had an unexpected chance...)

1093
00:51:55,975 --> 00:52:00,005
(to spend time with Yu Gyeong.)

1094
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:04,045
(These moments with her gradually opened him up.)

1095
00:52:08,755 --> 00:52:10,855
(How about now?)

1096
00:52:11,015 --> 00:52:15,795
(Are we getting closer to becoming us?)

1097
00:52:19,995 --> 00:52:24,965
(He was unable to answer her question right away.)

1098
00:52:25,135 --> 00:52:30,105
No one in my family is a shaman.

1099
00:52:30,535 --> 00:52:33,675
Throughout my life, I have never...

1100
00:52:34,145 --> 00:52:37,275
had any kind of relationship with a shaman.

1101
00:52:37,615 --> 00:52:39,015
Despite my background,

1102
00:52:39,545 --> 00:52:44,415
I would like to become someone who can fully understand...

1103
00:52:45,055 --> 00:52:47,324
and accept her.

1104
00:52:47,325 --> 00:52:51,055
I thought about that to make sure that...

1105
00:52:51,455 --> 00:52:54,165
I was treating this relationship with sincerity.

1106
00:52:54,995 --> 00:52:59,865
(I'm starting to have feelings for her.)

1107
00:53:00,505 --> 00:53:03,905
(But she's a shaman.)

1108
00:53:05,205 --> 00:53:08,044
(What are some good things...)

1109
00:53:08,045 --> 00:53:09,814
(about dating...)

1110
00:53:09,815 --> 00:53:12,075
(a shaman?)

1111
00:53:12,185 --> 00:53:14,945
(What are some challenges for me?)

1112
00:53:15,115 --> 00:53:16,284
What should be my attitude?

1113
00:53:16,285 --> 00:53:19,825
(He had been thinking about this day and night.)

1114
00:53:20,025 --> 00:53:23,825
But I didn't want to do that anymore.

1115
00:53:24,925 --> 00:53:26,525
I thought I had to be more proactive.

1116
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:29,635
I don't want this...

1117
00:53:29,735 --> 00:53:31,795
to be the reason I miss my chance with you.

1118
00:53:32,465 --> 00:53:34,764
As I told you, this connection...

1119
00:53:34,765 --> 00:53:37,035
could turn you into an important person in my life.

1120
00:53:39,105 --> 00:53:41,305
I don't want to regret it or lose my chance.

1121
00:53:43,445 --> 00:53:46,384
We don't have much time left.

1122
00:53:46,385 --> 00:53:47,785
Honestly, I'm quite sad about that.

1123
00:53:48,545 --> 00:53:52,225
I want to focus on the present and the remaining time we have.

1124
00:53:54,885 --> 00:53:55,895
I want to focus on you.

1125
00:54:02,565 --> 00:54:03,695
- Okay. - Okay.

1126
00:54:04,735 --> 00:54:06,255
That's what I wanted to know the most.

1127
00:54:06,805 --> 00:54:08,935
I wanted to know if you had given any thought...

1128
00:54:11,475 --> 00:54:12,645
about my job.

1129
00:54:12,745 --> 00:54:13,904
- Of course, I did. - "Did he consider that?"

1130
00:54:13,905 --> 00:54:15,815
Of course, I thought about it too.

1131
00:54:16,845 --> 00:54:17,875
And regarding that,

1132
00:54:21,215 --> 00:54:23,185
it's something I have to do.

1133
00:54:24,555 --> 00:54:26,225
It's what I must do.

1134
00:54:26,425 --> 00:54:29,595
So I don't want you to worry or feel insecure...

1135
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:31,795
about something I have to do.

1136
00:54:33,325 --> 00:54:35,225
(Nodding)

1137
00:54:39,105 --> 00:54:40,164
- My gosh. - Only two days ago,

1138
00:54:40,165 --> 00:54:41,964
- he didn't express himself... - Right.

1139
00:54:41,965 --> 00:54:43,051
- to anyone. - That's right.

1140
00:54:43,075 --> 00:54:45,704
Considering his innate personality...

1141
00:54:45,705 --> 00:54:47,065
and how much he expressed himself,

1142
00:54:47,345 --> 00:54:48,604
he's trying to be proactive...

1143
00:54:48,605 --> 00:54:50,815
and pretty much laid his heart bare for her.

1144
00:54:50,915 --> 00:54:52,284
- Right? - Yes.

1145
00:54:52,285 --> 00:54:53,514
- He said that very calmly. - I can see that.

1146
00:54:53,515 --> 00:54:55,585
- But that's a huge move for him. - Yes.

1147
00:54:55,685 --> 00:54:56,854
- He opened up his heart to her. - Gosh.

1148
00:54:56,855 --> 00:54:59,361
- My gosh. How does Yu Gyeong... - He must've thought a lot about it.

1149
00:54:59,385 --> 00:55:01,354
Always end up with confessions that sound like proposals?

1150
00:55:01,355 --> 00:55:02,355
- Right. - It happened every time.

1151
00:55:02,356 --> 00:55:04,224
- Yes. She's like the heroine. - Right.

1152
00:55:04,225 --> 00:55:06,895
Two guys confessed their feelings to her in the most romantic way.

1153
00:55:07,725 --> 00:55:08,825
What is this?

1154
00:55:09,665 --> 00:55:10,945
- What you said was cool. - Yes.

1155
00:55:12,535 --> 00:55:13,834
He said he was going to muster up his courage...

1156
00:55:13,835 --> 00:55:15,164
which I didn't expect from him.

1157
00:55:15,165 --> 00:55:19,544
I thought that this kind of courage must have been on another level.

1158
00:55:19,545 --> 00:55:23,045
I would think to myself how sweet he could be.

1159
00:55:24,575 --> 00:55:26,415
But I'm not sure if things will be that easy.

1160
00:55:26,985 --> 00:55:28,955
Despite that, I want this to work out.

1161
00:55:30,585 --> 00:55:32,325
- What you said was heartwarming. - Yes.

1162
00:55:32,885 --> 00:55:33,985
- Really? - Yes.

1163
00:55:37,255 --> 00:55:38,755
- It sounds like... - Yes.

1164
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:41,164
It sounds like...

1165
00:55:41,165 --> 00:55:44,595
you've thought about this more deeply than I thought.

1166
00:55:45,605 --> 00:55:47,664
- That's how it sounds. - Yes.

1167
00:55:47,665 --> 00:55:49,375
But anyway,

1168
00:55:50,035 --> 00:55:53,075
to me, it sounds like you treasure the time...

1169
00:55:53,745 --> 00:55:55,575
we shared together.

1170
00:55:55,645 --> 00:55:56,845
- Of course, I do. - Yes.

1171
00:55:58,175 --> 00:55:59,455
It'd be sad to miss this chance.

1172
00:56:00,445 --> 00:56:01,545
You're beautiful.

1173
00:56:02,655 --> 00:56:06,025
- Is that the only reason? - What? No, there are many reasons.

1174
00:56:06,455 --> 00:56:08,224
(Teasing him)

1175
00:56:08,225 --> 00:56:09,355
There are...

1176
00:56:09,455 --> 00:56:11,394
- prettier girls in the house. - Gosh, no. There aren't.

1177
00:56:11,395 --> 00:56:12,794
- No. - I'm serious. There's none.

1178
00:56:12,795 --> 00:56:13,894
- Seriously. - I mean, Ho Am.

1179
00:56:13,895 --> 00:56:15,864
- Yes, Ho Am is pretty. - Yes.

1180
00:56:15,865 --> 00:56:17,834
- You're the two great beauties. - Ho Am is pretty.

1181
00:56:17,835 --> 00:56:19,835
- I feel small next to Ho Am. - Okay.

1182
00:56:19,935 --> 00:56:22,335
- I see. But... Yes. - He has such a small face.

1183
00:56:22,435 --> 00:56:23,515
- He's so beautiful. - Yes?

1184
00:56:25,475 --> 00:56:26,715
You're talking about him a lot.

1185
00:56:27,475 --> 00:56:28,644
It's my first time bringing him up.

1186
00:56:28,645 --> 00:56:29,645
- Is it? - Yes.

1187
00:56:29,646 --> 00:56:32,785
I noticed that you talked about me a few times.

1188
00:56:34,345 --> 00:56:36,555
(Closing her eyes)

1189
00:56:38,355 --> 00:56:40,925
The Bearbrick in my room...

1190
00:56:42,655 --> 00:56:43,855
(That's a cool Bearbrick.)

1191
00:56:43,955 --> 00:56:45,355
(He can't stop thinking about...)

1192
00:56:45,665 --> 00:56:48,865
(the Bearbrick she painted with Ho Am.)

1193
00:56:50,095 --> 00:56:51,665
(Thinking)

1194
00:56:52,195 --> 00:56:54,034
Your lotion smells nice.

1195
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,365
Which lotion do you mean?

1196
00:56:55,505 --> 00:56:56,905
(Flustered)

1197
00:56:58,275 --> 00:57:00,744
(He made hand cream with Yu Ra on his first date.)

1198
00:57:00,745 --> 00:57:03,215
- It smells nice. Yes. - Is that so?

1199
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:06,415
Do I have any lotion?

1200
00:57:06,945 --> 00:57:09,785
- You must already have used it up. - Really? This is so warm.

1201
00:57:10,455 --> 00:57:11,514
The tea, I mean.

1202
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:14,255
(The two of them enjoy their date while talking about the past.)

1203
00:57:18,395 --> 00:57:22,125
(Meanwhile, Ho Am is waiting for Yu Gyeong.)

1204
00:57:24,435 --> 00:57:25,934
I had to wait for her...

1205
00:57:25,935 --> 00:57:28,035
longer than I expected.

1206
00:57:28,135 --> 00:57:30,905
So I was worried that we wouldn't get to spend...

1207
00:57:31,005 --> 00:57:33,645
a lot of time together while waiting for her.

1208
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:35,344
If I tried to wonder about what they were doing together,

1209
00:57:35,345 --> 00:57:36,974
I would be thinking about them.

1210
00:57:36,975 --> 00:57:39,015
Then it might make me more jealous.

1211
00:57:39,815 --> 00:57:41,444
So I pretended that...

1212
00:57:41,445 --> 00:57:43,391
she was coming to see me after going for a walk by herself.

1213
00:57:43,415 --> 00:57:44,615
That's what I told myself.

1214
00:57:49,325 --> 00:57:52,355
I just couldn't wait to see her. That's what I was thinking.

1215
00:57:56,495 --> 00:57:58,235
Gosh, why does he look so sad?

1216
00:57:59,905 --> 00:58:02,734
He must have a lot on his mind about how to lead...

1217
00:58:02,735 --> 00:58:04,035
- today's date. - Right.

1218
00:58:06,205 --> 00:58:08,644
If he's too serious, it might make her uncomfortable.

1219
00:58:08,645 --> 00:58:10,445
So I don't think he can be too serious today.

1220
00:58:11,045 --> 00:58:12,174
(In agony)

1221
00:58:12,175 --> 00:58:14,085
- He must have a lot on his mind. - Yes.

1222
00:58:14,845 --> 00:58:19,055
(For some reason, he is feeling especially anxious today.)

1223
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:21,154
(Clueless of Ho Am's feelings, their date is running long.)

1224
00:58:21,155 --> 00:58:22,625
It says to pull.

1225
00:58:23,255 --> 00:58:25,055
- Here. - Thank you.

1226
00:58:25,925 --> 00:58:28,865
(They enter an instant photo booth.)

1227
00:58:29,195 --> 00:58:30,355
I see a lot of pictures here.

1228
00:58:30,565 --> 00:58:32,565
- Is it an aerial-view camera? - It's...

1229
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:34,735
- My gosh. - We can choose it here.

1230
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:36,435
- This is fascinating. - Yes.

1231
00:58:36,535 --> 00:58:37,704
- I want this one. - This one?

1232
00:58:37,705 --> 00:58:39,105
- Yes. I want big frames. - Okay.

1233
00:58:39,645 --> 00:58:40,745
- There it is. - There.

1234
00:58:41,145 --> 00:58:42,204
(They quickly pose for the camera.)

1235
00:58:42,205 --> 00:58:43,525
- Our height difference... - Yes.

1236
00:58:43,575 --> 00:58:44,575
Three, two, one.

1237
00:58:45,845 --> 00:58:46,915
(Clicking)

1238
00:58:48,485 --> 00:58:49,514
We look awkward.

1239
00:58:49,515 --> 00:58:51,475
- Should we move back? - Which pose should we do?

1240
00:58:52,315 --> 00:58:53,715
Should we put our chin on our palm?

1241
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:55,625
Chin on our palm?

1242
00:58:59,525 --> 00:59:02,865
(In no time, they're standing quite close to one another.)

1243
00:59:05,065 --> 00:59:07,035
- This feels awkward. - Yes.

1244
00:59:07,065 --> 00:59:09,174
(Glancing)

1245
00:59:11,522 --> 00:59:12,592
This is embarrassing.

1246
00:59:13,522 --> 00:59:16,122
- What's going on? - What are they going to do?

1247
00:59:16,392 --> 00:59:18,162
What? Wait. That was real.

1248
00:59:19,762 --> 00:59:21,862
- Sit back. - In Na.

1249
00:59:22,602 --> 00:59:24,871
(The atmosphere heated up with their intense eye contact.)

1250
00:59:24,872 --> 00:59:26,901
- As expected. - Wasn't it real?

1251
00:59:26,902 --> 00:59:28,071
It was real.

1252
00:59:28,072 --> 00:59:29,842
- It was real. - Of course.

1253
00:59:30,372 --> 00:59:33,111
- They almost kissed just now. - Look at that.

1254
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:34,242
Look at her eyes.

1255
00:59:34,342 --> 00:59:35,482
She wants him to get closer.

1256
00:59:37,682 --> 00:59:39,252
It's the photo booth.

1257
00:59:40,152 --> 00:59:41,922
- That's for sure. - It's where love grows.

1258
00:59:42,282 --> 00:59:44,242
What would have happened if he hadn't avoided it?

1259
00:59:49,822 --> 00:59:50,962
This is embarrassing.

1260
00:59:55,032 --> 00:59:58,202
(They complete the heart shyly.)

1261
00:59:58,702 --> 01:00:00,102
This is so awkward.

1262
01:00:02,002 --> 01:00:04,041
- Let's go. - It was so awkward.

1263
01:00:04,042 --> 01:00:05,312
What? Why?

1264
01:00:05,672 --> 01:00:07,841
We got so close.

1265
01:00:07,842 --> 01:00:08,942
The car is coming.

1266
01:00:09,582 --> 01:00:10,742
It came out nice.

1267
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:12,681
I look stiff in every photo.

1268
01:00:12,682 --> 01:00:13,911
- Are these the same picture? - I look stiffer.

1269
01:00:13,912 --> 01:00:15,922
- It was quite tough. - It was really hard.

1270
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:18,121
(It captured the heart-fluttering moment.)

1271
01:00:18,122 --> 01:00:19,252
I think it came out nice.

1272
01:00:22,222 --> 01:00:24,722
- Give me one later. - Yes. I'll give it to you later.

1273
01:00:27,192 --> 01:00:29,362
I'll have to give it to you at home.

1274
01:00:31,532 --> 01:00:33,171
The cab will be coming, right?

1275
01:00:33,172 --> 01:00:34,172
(It's time to let her go.)

1276
01:00:34,173 --> 01:00:35,742
Take care of yourself.

1277
01:00:38,942 --> 01:00:40,812
Keep the hand warmer I gave you.

1278
01:00:41,142 --> 01:00:42,812
- I'll carry it around. - Okay.

1279
01:00:44,512 --> 01:00:45,612
I wish we could stay more.

1280
01:00:50,182 --> 01:00:51,252
Bye.

1281
01:00:52,752 --> 01:00:53,852
Don't go.

1282
01:00:55,792 --> 01:00:58,392
(The cab leaves.)

1283
01:00:59,192 --> 01:01:01,702
(Byeong Yeol is left alone.)

1284
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:03,562
(Sighing)

1285
01:01:09,872 --> 01:01:12,072
Thinking that she was really leaving,

1286
01:01:12,942 --> 01:01:15,382
I really wished we had more time.

1287
01:01:16,312 --> 01:01:18,482
I wanted to stay with her longer.

1288
01:01:20,212 --> 01:01:22,052
I didn't want to let her go.

1289
01:01:23,882 --> 01:01:26,921
I said I was hesitant...

1290
01:01:26,922 --> 01:01:28,362
and contemplating,

1291
01:01:28,792 --> 01:01:32,362
but I've made up my mind now.

1292
01:01:32,792 --> 01:01:36,502
Since I've made up my mind,

1293
01:01:36,962 --> 01:01:39,532
I'll do my best,

1294
01:01:39,702 --> 01:01:42,471
thinking that it'll work out.

1295
01:01:42,472 --> 01:01:43,872
That's what I decided to do.

1296
01:01:45,772 --> 01:01:49,382
(Yu Gyeong gets to the restaurant where Ho Am is waiting.)

1297
01:01:56,182 --> 01:01:57,722
(Smiling)

1298
01:01:58,292 --> 01:01:59,422
You've come.

1299
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,521
- Oh, my. - Take a seat here.

1300
01:02:02,522 --> 01:02:07,532
(Talisman Date: Jang Ho Am and Chae Yu Gyeong)

1301
01:02:09,432 --> 01:02:10,532
Oh, my.

1302
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:11,802
- It's high, isn't it? - Yes.

1303
01:02:14,202 --> 01:02:16,002
It's cold. What is this place for?

1304
01:02:18,342 --> 01:02:21,782
They have food like a restaurant.

1305
01:02:22,542 --> 01:02:25,252
They have mocktails. You can drink that too.

1306
01:02:25,452 --> 01:02:27,152
- They do? - It doesn't have any alcohol.

1307
01:02:34,622 --> 01:02:37,092
- It got cold outside. - Yes.

1308
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:39,842
- It's very cold outside, right? - It's so cold.

1309
01:02:40,892 --> 01:02:43,931
- Have a drink. - Thank you.

1310
01:02:43,932 --> 01:02:45,132
(He gives her warm tea first.)

1311
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,002
(Drinking)

1312
01:02:57,412 --> 01:02:58,752
What did you do earlier?

1313
01:02:59,452 --> 01:03:01,311
Did you go to a cafe? Where did you go?

1314
01:03:01,312 --> 01:03:02,381
- Yes. - Did you go to a cafe?

1315
01:03:02,382 --> 01:03:03,382
- Yes. - I see.

1316
01:03:06,922 --> 01:03:08,962
(Awkward)

1317
01:03:09,562 --> 01:03:10,991
You must be hungry. You haven't eaten anything, right?

1318
01:03:10,992 --> 01:03:12,532
Yes. I'm starving.

1319
01:03:13,592 --> 01:03:14,872
- My stomach is growling. - Yes.

1320
01:03:15,162 --> 01:03:16,362
Let's enjoy the food.

1321
01:03:18,532 --> 01:03:19,532
Yes.

1322
01:03:22,872 --> 01:03:24,772
What should they talk about first?

1323
01:03:25,372 --> 01:03:26,441
It's awkward.

1324
01:03:26,442 --> 01:03:27,841
(They started to feel awkward around each other at some point.)

1325
01:03:27,842 --> 01:03:29,781
They can't help but feel awkward.

1326
01:03:29,782 --> 01:03:30,782
- Right. - Yes.

1327
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,882
Will they beat around the bush?

1328
01:03:34,182 --> 01:03:35,581
Will it be awkward?

1329
01:03:35,582 --> 01:03:37,282
Will they change their mind again?

1330
01:03:37,482 --> 01:03:40,821
- It can be their last conversation. - I know.

1331
01:03:40,822 --> 01:03:43,692
Yu Gyeong better tell him...

1332
01:03:44,322 --> 01:03:46,591
- seriously today. - Yes.

1333
01:03:46,592 --> 01:03:47,962
- Right. - I agree.

1334
01:03:49,402 --> 01:03:53,132
(Where will the conversation between them go?)

1335
01:03:54,332 --> 01:03:57,672
I asked you out through the talisman today.

1336
01:03:58,712 --> 01:04:02,042
When I gave it to you, I wanted...

1337
01:04:02,242 --> 01:04:04,542
to have a serious conversation with you today.

1338
01:04:05,852 --> 01:04:08,012
That's what I thought.

1339
01:04:12,922 --> 01:04:16,191
- After our first date, - Yes.

1340
01:04:16,192 --> 01:04:19,691
I think I was pretty honest with you.

1341
01:04:19,692 --> 01:04:22,801
And I kept wanting...

1342
01:04:22,802 --> 01:04:25,832
to go out with you.

1343
01:04:26,902 --> 01:04:29,801
But that's what I want.

1344
01:04:29,802 --> 01:04:32,612
You might not feel that way.

1345
01:04:33,112 --> 01:04:35,511
So I thought...

1346
01:04:35,512 --> 01:04:37,311
you might feel uncomfortable about it.

1347
01:04:37,312 --> 01:04:38,782
I got worried a little.

1348
01:04:39,782 --> 01:04:42,262
Maybe I shouldn't have told you about my feelings so honestly.

1349
01:04:43,222 --> 01:04:45,322
I wondered if that made you uncomfortable.

1350
01:04:45,852 --> 01:04:49,221
In a way, it might've been stressful.

1351
01:04:49,222 --> 01:04:50,491
That's what I think.

1352
01:04:50,492 --> 01:04:53,662
(Ho Am was worried that Yu Gyeong might feel uncomfortable.)

1353
01:04:55,132 --> 01:04:56,431
(Several days ago)

1354
01:04:56,432 --> 01:04:59,102
- Yu Gyeong, can we talk? - Sure.

1355
01:05:00,902 --> 01:05:02,542
- Why? Are you going to pick me? - Yes.

1356
01:05:08,142 --> 01:05:11,752
(Since the first moment when he plucked up his courage)

1357
01:05:13,552 --> 01:05:15,422
(Peeking)

1358
01:05:16,252 --> 01:05:18,752
(His feelings for Yu Gyeong haven't changed.)

1359
01:05:19,222 --> 01:05:20,592
- Good night. - Good night.

1360
01:05:21,252 --> 01:05:22,391
- Good night. - Good night.

1361
01:05:22,392 --> 01:05:23,492
(Tapping)

1362
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:31,032
The princesses like you.

1363
01:05:31,462 --> 01:05:32,572
They do?

1364
01:05:32,872 --> 01:05:35,141
The fairy is jealous because you're so pretty.

1365
01:05:35,142 --> 01:05:36,702
Oh, my gosh.

1366
01:05:41,242 --> 01:05:43,581
(You're mean.)

1367
01:05:43,582 --> 01:05:44,882
- Yu Gyeong. - Yes?

1368
01:05:45,012 --> 01:05:47,282
- Are you in there? - Yes. Just a moment.

1369
01:05:51,452 --> 01:05:53,922
- Oh, my. - I want to go out with you again.

1370
01:05:54,392 --> 01:05:58,392
(He always approached her first and expressed his feelings.)

1371
01:06:03,332 --> 01:06:07,071
I'm actually so thankful...

1372
01:06:07,072 --> 01:06:08,702
that you expressed your feelings for me.

1373
01:06:09,072 --> 01:06:10,942
I was very thankful.

1374
01:06:11,642 --> 01:06:12,672
But...

1375
01:06:13,042 --> 01:06:17,612
I feel sorry...

1376
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:21,212
because I couldn't do it as much as you.

1377
01:06:23,822 --> 01:06:26,522
Despite that,

1378
01:06:27,052 --> 01:06:29,562
you kept asking me out.

1379
01:06:32,662 --> 01:06:34,932
I'm very touched.

1380
01:06:35,602 --> 01:06:37,931
And actually, we both know...

1381
01:06:37,932 --> 01:06:40,302
- that our spirits are compatible. - Right.

1382
01:06:42,302 --> 01:06:45,342
Honestly, you're very dear to me.

1383
01:06:46,772 --> 01:06:47,812
You are.

1384
01:06:52,952 --> 01:06:54,012
Right.

1385
01:06:56,222 --> 01:06:58,921
Our spirits are very compatible.

1386
01:06:58,922 --> 01:07:01,821
So I can't help but care about him.

1387
01:07:01,822 --> 01:07:05,292
But rather than having feelings for him as a man,

1388
01:07:05,462 --> 01:07:09,962
it's more like our spirits are drawn to each other.

1389
01:07:10,562 --> 01:07:12,602
My feelings are complicated.

1390
01:07:17,872 --> 01:07:22,012
(They're close, but their hearts are far apart.)

1391
01:07:22,382 --> 01:07:24,011
Before I came here,

1392
01:07:24,012 --> 01:07:25,611
I contemplated a lot.

1393
01:07:25,612 --> 01:07:29,622
I think the feeling of love...

1394
01:07:29,822 --> 01:07:33,152
is both a blessing...

1395
01:07:33,692 --> 01:07:36,062
and a curse given by spirits.

1396
01:07:36,892 --> 01:07:39,592
- Because it can hurt. - Right.

1397
01:07:40,062 --> 01:07:41,062
You're right.

1398
01:07:41,562 --> 01:07:43,331
In a way,

1399
01:07:43,332 --> 01:07:45,452
isn't it like a problem to solve given by the spirit?

1400
01:07:46,932 --> 01:07:48,452
If it's a problem given by the spirit,

1401
01:07:48,742 --> 01:07:51,072
I want to solve it well.

1402
01:07:53,912 --> 01:07:55,381
(She has complicated feelings...)

1403
01:07:55,382 --> 01:07:58,012
(in the face of the problem given by the spirit.)

1404
01:08:02,282 --> 01:08:03,822
(Pricking up her ears)

1405
01:08:04,982 --> 01:08:06,122
It must be raining.

1406
01:08:07,152 --> 01:08:08,391
It's the cooking sound.

1407
01:08:08,392 --> 01:08:10,822
I know. I know what it is.

1408
01:08:12,432 --> 01:08:13,561
It's raining a lot.

1409
01:08:13,562 --> 01:08:14,991
- Yes. It's raining a lot. - Yes.

1410
01:08:14,992 --> 01:08:16,932
(They ease the awkward vibe with a joke.)

1411
01:08:17,702 --> 01:08:19,432
(Meanwhile)

1412
01:08:21,772 --> 01:08:25,442
(Byeong Yeol returns to the house alone.)

1413
01:08:26,472 --> 01:08:27,812
(Rummaging)

1414
01:08:28,982 --> 01:08:33,652
(He takes out the photos he took with Yu Gyeong.)

1415
01:08:38,082 --> 01:08:39,792
(Precious)

1416
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:47,592
(The video he took with Yu Gyeong)

1417
01:08:48,262 --> 01:08:50,331
Is this how it's going to be?

1418
01:08:50,332 --> 01:08:51,862
(Happy)

1419
01:08:58,472 --> 01:09:02,312
(Byeong Yeol keeps the photos in his hands.)

1420
01:09:03,042 --> 01:09:07,882
(Thus, Byeong Yeol waits for Yu Gyeong's return.)

1421
01:09:11,152 --> 01:09:14,252
The final decision is drawing near.

1422
01:09:14,622 --> 01:09:16,191
Have you made up your mind?

1423
01:09:16,192 --> 01:09:18,262
Are you still thinking?

1424
01:09:19,692 --> 01:09:20,932
(Well...)

1425
01:09:21,662 --> 01:09:25,372
(Is there certainty in Yu Gyeong's heart?)

1426
01:09:29,302 --> 01:09:30,442
As for me...

1427
01:09:31,842 --> 01:09:33,972
I had certainty at first.

1428
01:09:34,242 --> 01:09:36,312
But as time goes on,

1429
01:09:36,612 --> 01:09:38,341
I realize that I might not know.

1430
01:09:38,342 --> 01:09:40,582
I might've made a wrong judgment.

1431
01:09:43,482 --> 01:09:45,422
- That could be the case. - Yes.

1432
01:09:45,922 --> 01:09:47,052
It's even more confusing.

1433
01:09:47,852 --> 01:09:51,392
The end is drawing near, but I still don't know.

1434
01:09:51,862 --> 01:09:56,001
I think it's natural for things to become more confusing.

1435
01:09:56,002 --> 01:09:57,832
- Really? - Yes. How should I put it?

1436
01:09:58,362 --> 01:09:59,702
As each day comes and goes,

1437
01:10:00,202 --> 01:10:02,772
light-hearted decisions disappear.

1438
01:10:02,842 --> 01:10:04,802
Things gain more depth.

1439
01:10:05,612 --> 01:10:07,072
So it's natural to be confused.

1440
01:10:13,782 --> 01:10:15,622
Did you make up your mind?

1441
01:10:21,122 --> 01:10:22,192
As for me,

1442
01:10:25,932 --> 01:10:28,162
I liked you from the start.

1443
01:10:29,602 --> 01:10:31,002
I know for certain.

1444
01:10:31,262 --> 01:10:32,332
It's too...

1445
01:10:38,142 --> 01:10:40,271
- It's a bit pressuring. - That's right.

1446
01:10:40,272 --> 01:10:41,342
Right now...

1447
01:10:41,812 --> 01:10:44,042
- It's because she feels bad. - That's right.

1448
01:10:44,142 --> 01:10:46,312
Until now, how many people have you felt bad about?

1449
01:10:46,452 --> 01:10:48,152
The number must be in the dozens.

1450
01:10:48,412 --> 01:10:49,882
I've felt bad about many people.

1451
01:10:53,422 --> 01:10:55,491
- My goodness. You know, - What a comment.

1452
01:10:55,492 --> 01:10:56,962
He remains unfazed...

1453
01:10:57,722 --> 01:10:58,931
even when I tease him.

1454
01:10:58,932 --> 01:11:00,252
(Seon Ho can beat Dong Yeob now.)

1455
01:11:02,632 --> 01:11:06,372
(Ho Am ended up confessing his love today as well.)

1456
01:11:07,402 --> 01:11:08,772
(Embarrassed)

1457
01:11:16,012 --> 01:11:17,982
- When we leave the house... - Yes?

1458
01:11:18,312 --> 01:11:20,181
No matter the result,

1459
01:11:20,182 --> 01:11:22,222
do you think...

1460
01:11:23,252 --> 01:11:25,922
you'll continue these relationships?

1461
01:11:26,092 --> 01:11:27,992
After we return to our daily lives?

1462
01:11:28,052 --> 01:11:31,692
I need to live my life as a shaman,

1463
01:11:32,092 --> 01:11:34,532
so most people will make me feel a big gap.

1464
01:11:35,132 --> 01:11:37,301
Our lives can be very different, to be honest.

1465
01:11:37,302 --> 01:11:38,931
- That's right. - Our speech and behaviours...

1466
01:11:38,932 --> 01:11:40,602
can be very different.

1467
01:11:41,002 --> 01:11:42,971
If it's someone who can accept...

1468
01:11:42,972 --> 01:11:45,002
and understand such things,

1469
01:11:45,202 --> 01:11:46,962
I'll be okay with continuing a relationship.

1470
01:11:48,982 --> 01:11:50,212
A long-term relationship.

1471
01:11:53,512 --> 01:11:54,652
How about you?

1472
01:11:56,882 --> 01:11:58,162
I think I'll be able to do well.

1473
01:11:59,322 --> 01:12:00,392
Yes.

1474
01:12:01,822 --> 01:12:03,522
There'll be difficulties, for sure,

1475
01:12:05,262 --> 01:12:07,561
but I won't let go of someone...

1476
01:12:07,562 --> 01:12:10,002
because of exhaustion.

1477
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:15,032
(Ho Am delivers his resolution once more.)

1478
01:12:16,442 --> 01:12:18,072
I'll be able to make a lot of effort.

1479
01:12:19,812 --> 01:12:23,282
(Ho Am takes another step forward today.)

1480
01:12:24,312 --> 01:12:27,852
(Will Ho Am's sincerity be able to change Yu Gyeong's mind?)

1481
01:12:37,262 --> 01:12:40,462
You went to a cafe earlier today.

1482
01:12:41,532 --> 01:12:43,402
(Pretending to be asleep)

1483
01:12:44,062 --> 01:12:45,232
When you were there...

1484
01:12:45,902 --> 01:12:48,131
I'm not curious or anything, but...

1485
01:12:48,132 --> 01:12:49,272
I can't hear you.

1486
01:12:51,942 --> 01:12:54,672
Can I ask you what you guys talked about?

1487
01:12:59,052 --> 01:13:01,052
How should I say it? The end...

1488
01:13:01,582 --> 01:13:05,051
How should I say it? We talked a lot about the end.

1489
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:06,391
- The end? - Yes.

1490
01:13:06,392 --> 01:13:08,321
We're nearing the end.

1491
01:13:08,322 --> 01:13:10,222
You're right. The end is drawing near.

1492
01:13:10,492 --> 01:13:14,092
It seems like you guys had an honest conversation.

1493
01:13:21,032 --> 01:13:22,442
- Are you tired? - What?

1494
01:13:22,702 --> 01:13:24,642
I'm not tired. It's just...

1495
01:13:27,972 --> 01:13:30,342
It's just that I'm having a very nice experience.

1496
01:13:30,812 --> 01:13:32,351
- I can't deny that. - I know.

1497
01:13:32,352 --> 01:13:33,512
I really like that.

1498
01:13:34,482 --> 01:13:37,421
We truly conversed with our eyes...

1499
01:13:37,422 --> 01:13:38,852
and hearts.

1500
01:13:40,122 --> 01:13:42,221
We couldn't have gotten more honest than that.

1501
01:13:42,222 --> 01:13:43,722
That's what I think about today.

1502
01:13:43,992 --> 01:13:45,792
We were truly honest.

1503
01:13:53,402 --> 01:13:56,241
- No matter the result... Right? - Yes.

1504
01:13:56,242 --> 01:13:58,242
We're similar in this sense as well.

1505
01:14:00,642 --> 01:14:01,972
We're straightforward.

1506
01:14:04,512 --> 01:14:06,812
"I like you." Like that,

1507
01:14:07,552 --> 01:14:09,481
I told her everything honestly.

1508
01:14:09,482 --> 01:14:11,081
"I like you because you're pretty."

1509
01:14:11,082 --> 01:14:12,992
"I like you because you're honest."

1510
01:14:14,222 --> 01:14:17,292
"I like everything about you." I told her everything.

1511
01:14:17,862 --> 01:14:20,132
I'm going all in for Yu Gyeong.

1512
01:14:20,792 --> 01:14:23,102
So, I have no regrets. I just hope...

1513
01:14:23,432 --> 01:14:26,172
that she'll come to me. I have that belief.

1514
01:14:28,532 --> 01:14:31,571
Yu Gyeong seems to be very conflicted.

1515
01:14:31,572 --> 01:14:32,811
I got that from her facial expression.

1516
01:14:32,812 --> 01:14:34,871
I think she showed it a bit today.

1517
01:14:34,872 --> 01:14:37,211
- "I don't see you that way." - That's right.

1518
01:14:37,212 --> 01:14:39,182
That's right. I think...

1519
01:14:39,612 --> 01:14:42,381
Ho Am would've understood what she meant.

1520
01:14:42,382 --> 01:14:44,521
Ho Am is someone who wants to misunderstand.

1521
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:45,752
- That's right. - Her words...

1522
01:14:46,752 --> 01:14:48,251
- might've been misunderstood. - He wants to misunderstand.

1523
01:14:48,252 --> 01:14:50,762
- He might not know yet. - But when they're in the house,

1524
01:14:50,922 --> 01:14:52,991
- he'll come to a realization. - That's right.

1525
01:14:52,992 --> 01:14:55,862
When he sees Byeong Yeol and Yu Gyeong together,

1526
01:14:56,032 --> 01:14:58,562
he'll think, "She's different from when she was with me."

1527
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:05,172
Shall I take some photos?

1528
01:15:06,242 --> 01:15:10,882
(Talisman Date: Jung Hyeon U and Kim Yun Jeong)

1529
01:15:13,912 --> 01:15:15,012
(Clicking)

1530
01:15:16,252 --> 01:15:18,482
- Did they come out well? - I think so. Take a look.

1531
01:15:22,022 --> 01:15:23,162
I mean...

1532
01:15:25,222 --> 01:15:27,261
- You took them from the above. - Really?

1533
01:15:27,262 --> 01:15:28,892
(Hyeon U is a terrible photographer.)

1534
01:15:30,402 --> 01:15:31,702
You look awkward.

1535
01:15:32,532 --> 01:15:33,972
It can't be helped.

1536
01:15:34,472 --> 01:15:37,442
(Hyeon U holds her wrist so that she doesn't fall down.)

1537
01:15:37,872 --> 01:15:38,872
(Misstepping)

1538
01:15:39,712 --> 01:15:40,842
You startled me.

1539
01:15:41,712 --> 01:15:43,411
- I'm scared. I'm so scared. - Be careful.

1540
01:15:43,412 --> 01:15:45,282
- Be careful. - We can't fall into the water.

1541
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:47,082
We'll get sick in winter.

1542
01:15:48,082 --> 01:15:51,022
(Where are the two of them headed?)

1543
01:15:51,122 --> 01:15:52,351
(Engraving Beauty)

1544
01:15:52,352 --> 01:15:54,051
(For Yun Jeong, )

1545
01:15:54,052 --> 01:15:57,892
(Hyeon U prepared this date.)

1546
01:15:58,092 --> 01:16:01,232
Sweet red bean jelly is very famous here.

1547
01:16:02,502 --> 01:16:05,132
(It's a cafe that has the sweet red bean jelly.)

1548
01:16:05,332 --> 01:16:06,332
(Eating)

1549
01:16:06,532 --> 01:16:07,602
Try it.

1550
01:16:08,432 --> 01:16:09,572
How is it?

1551
01:16:11,502 --> 01:16:12,512
(Eating)

1552
01:16:13,272 --> 01:16:15,742
I think it's refreshing since it's made with plums.

1553
01:16:17,182 --> 01:16:18,582
(Satisfied)

1554
01:16:21,582 --> 01:16:24,422
Yesterday, I heard something.

1555
01:16:24,882 --> 01:16:26,992
I heard that you cried a bit yesterday as well.

1556
01:16:27,592 --> 01:16:29,592
- Right. I cried yesterday as well. - Last night.

1557
01:16:31,162 --> 01:16:34,192
To be honest, being here has been quite tough.

1558
01:16:34,432 --> 01:16:35,532
After all,

1559
01:16:36,802 --> 01:16:39,932
I was so used to hiding myself.

1560
01:16:40,332 --> 01:16:42,092
But I need to show who Jung Hyeon U is here.

1561
01:16:42,272 --> 01:16:43,978
I need to show what kind of a person he is.

1562
01:16:44,002 --> 01:16:46,812
- That's right. - So the tempo was different.

1563
01:16:47,142 --> 01:16:49,142
I had a certain tempo as a shaman.

1564
01:16:49,482 --> 01:16:50,881
But the tempo changed suddenly...

1565
01:16:50,882 --> 01:16:52,828
- and I had to show myself. - You had to show yourself.

1566
01:16:52,852 --> 01:16:54,082
It's a bit...

1567
01:16:55,352 --> 01:16:57,582
- Right. It's unfamiliar. - Yes.

1568
01:16:59,222 --> 01:17:02,522
- It's unfamiliar. - It took me a while to start.

1569
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:05,932
I kept worrying...

1570
01:17:07,092 --> 01:17:08,432
and being impatient.

1571
01:17:09,862 --> 01:17:11,101
I did that.

1572
01:17:11,102 --> 01:17:13,582
(Between being a shaman and human, Hyeon U has been worrying.)

1573
01:17:13,702 --> 01:17:14,872
You can't help...

1574
01:17:16,142 --> 01:17:18,442
but feel that way.

1575
01:17:19,542 --> 01:17:20,771
(Yun Jeong relates...)

1576
01:17:20,772 --> 01:17:24,542
(to Hyeon U's worry in a sincere manner.)

1577
01:17:26,512 --> 01:17:28,182
I'm really making an effort.

1578
01:17:34,752 --> 01:17:35,862
Right.

1579
01:17:37,722 --> 01:17:38,862
- What is it? - What?

1580
01:17:39,062 --> 01:17:41,992
You know, I was like that too.

1581
01:17:42,432 --> 01:17:45,731
I think I saw...

1582
01:17:45,732 --> 01:17:49,032
many new sides of myself.

1583
01:17:49,772 --> 01:17:51,171
New sides of yourself?

1584
01:17:51,172 --> 01:17:52,692
Calling them new sides might be wrong.

1585
01:17:53,172 --> 01:17:55,041
It was my first time...

1586
01:17:55,042 --> 01:17:57,442
being so honest before so many people.

1587
01:17:57,712 --> 01:18:02,252
I tend to be honest about the things I want to show,

1588
01:18:02,352 --> 01:18:05,822
but I really hide the things I don't want to show.

1589
01:18:07,092 --> 01:18:09,461
- That's right. - That was why I struggled a lot...

1590
01:18:09,462 --> 01:18:10,562
in the beginning.

1591
01:18:11,392 --> 01:18:13,892
People here...

1592
01:18:14,492 --> 01:18:16,401
understood me well.

1593
01:18:16,402 --> 01:18:19,032
They knew me better than myself.

1594
01:18:20,632 --> 01:18:23,072
- That's right. - That made me think a lot.

1595
01:18:24,372 --> 01:18:26,742
That made me realize many things.

1596
01:18:26,972 --> 01:18:28,211
(After spending time with the fortune tellers her age, )

1597
01:18:28,212 --> 01:18:29,942
(Yun Jeong learned how to express herself.)

1598
01:18:30,812 --> 01:18:32,651
Your facial expressions...

1599
01:18:32,652 --> 01:18:34,651
and actions changed a lot...

1600
01:18:34,652 --> 01:18:36,182
- Yes. - compared to the first day.

1601
01:18:38,782 --> 01:18:40,292
It was a big consolation.

1602
01:18:41,722 --> 01:18:43,892
We have many things in common.

1603
01:18:43,992 --> 01:18:45,661
Compared to yesterday's date,

1604
01:18:45,662 --> 01:18:48,092
she seemed to be more at ease.

1605
01:18:48,962 --> 01:18:52,262
(Hyeon U became closer to Yun Jeong.)

1606
01:18:54,602 --> 01:18:55,672
You know,

1607
01:18:56,602 --> 01:19:00,042
I was so stressed out the other day that I asked Ho Am for a reading...

1608
01:19:00,142 --> 01:19:01,142
in his room.

1609
01:19:02,072 --> 01:19:03,112
How did it go?

1610
01:19:05,012 --> 01:19:07,512
He gave me a reading in a very calm way.

1611
01:19:10,382 --> 01:19:12,322
(Two days ago)

1612
01:19:13,192 --> 01:19:18,222
(Yun Jeong asked Ho Am to give her a reading.)

1613
01:19:19,192 --> 01:19:21,232
(You know that it's the best one, right?)

1614
01:19:22,492 --> 01:19:26,432
(Just steel your heart and don't worry about other things.)

1615
01:19:29,402 --> 01:19:31,671
(Yun Jeong, )

1616
01:19:31,672 --> 01:19:33,772
(you're a cool person.)

1617
01:19:35,642 --> 01:19:39,812
(Ho Am's consolation moved Yun Jeong's heart.)

1618
01:19:42,352 --> 01:19:43,552
I cried there.

1619
01:19:46,722 --> 01:19:47,891
(She remembers...)

1620
01:19:47,892 --> 01:19:52,022
(the day Ho Am consoled her.)

1621
01:19:53,462 --> 01:19:55,262
Did you cry? My goodness.

1622
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:03,902
(Grinning)

1623
01:20:05,942 --> 01:20:08,041
I thought about it earlier.

1624
01:20:08,042 --> 01:20:09,711
"Let's stop worrying..."

1625
01:20:09,712 --> 01:20:12,112
"and think only about what's in my heart."

1626
01:20:12,442 --> 01:20:15,112
When I did that, Ho Am was still in my heart.

1627
01:20:16,282 --> 01:20:17,352
I wasn't surprised.

1628
01:20:19,352 --> 01:20:21,152
I still have a lot of feelings for him.

1629
01:20:23,162 --> 01:20:25,521
You know, it's so embarrassing.

1630
01:20:25,522 --> 01:20:27,132
Never in my life...

1631
01:20:28,092 --> 01:20:32,261
had I looked inside my heart only...

1632
01:20:32,262 --> 01:20:35,901
and admitted to liking someone.

1633
01:20:35,902 --> 01:20:36,902
So right now,

1634
01:20:38,402 --> 01:20:39,412
it's a bit embarrassing.

1635
01:20:41,972 --> 01:20:43,812
You seemed to be having a lot of fun...

1636
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:48,552
when the two of you were hiding to surprise Ho Am.

1637
01:20:49,112 --> 01:20:50,152
I had so much fun.

1638
01:20:50,682 --> 01:20:52,152
Ho Am is so cute.

1639
01:20:53,592 --> 01:20:55,922
I didn't know that he'd be so startled.

1640
01:20:56,022 --> 01:20:57,522
How cute.

1641
01:20:58,392 --> 01:20:59,892
I knew that he'd scream,

1642
01:21:00,162 --> 01:21:01,402
but he screamed multiple times.

1643
01:21:01,462 --> 01:21:06,732
(Talking about Ho Am puts a smile on Yun Jeong's face.)

1644
01:21:07,632 --> 01:21:10,042
He became startled in a handsome way.

1645
01:21:11,172 --> 01:21:13,012
- He's pretty. - He's so pretty.

1646
01:21:16,112 --> 01:21:18,312
I wonder if he was like that before he became a shaman.

1647
01:21:19,012 --> 01:21:20,012
Ho Am.

1648
01:21:20,052 --> 01:21:22,611
- That's my guess. - I see.

1649
01:21:22,612 --> 01:21:26,692
(They continue to talk about Ho Am.)

1650
01:21:27,622 --> 01:21:29,392
I wonder whom Ho Am will go on a date with.

1651
01:21:34,392 --> 01:21:37,162
- Gosh, Yun Jeong... - She keeps talking about Ho Am.

1652
01:21:37,332 --> 01:21:38,701
Seriously, she only talks about Ho Am.

1653
01:21:38,702 --> 01:21:40,072
- Seriously. - Yes.

1654
01:21:40,502 --> 01:21:43,142
I think Yun Jeong had a realization...

1655
01:21:43,472 --> 01:21:45,441
- while talking to Hyeon U. - Yes. She realized her feelings.

1656
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:49,042
"My feelings for Ho Am aren't going away."

1657
01:21:49,142 --> 01:21:51,581
I think she'll make a move now.

1658
01:21:51,582 --> 01:21:53,182
- Yes. - I think Yun Jeong will do that.

1659
01:21:53,552 --> 01:21:55,812
- It's hard. - Seriously.

1660
01:22:02,022 --> 01:22:05,022
(Talisman Date: Lee Gang Won and Lee Ra Yun)

1661
01:22:06,592 --> 01:22:08,038
I'll finish it quickly and come back.

1662
01:22:08,062 --> 01:22:10,132
- Okay. Good luck. - Thanks.

1663
01:22:11,932 --> 01:22:15,672
(Ra Yun heads somewhere on her own.)

1664
01:22:17,542 --> 01:22:21,872
(Gang Won simply watches.)

1665
01:22:24,012 --> 01:22:25,182
(Sighing)

1666
01:22:27,512 --> 01:22:31,622
(Where is Ra Yun headed?)

1667
01:22:49,742 --> 01:22:54,212
(It's a place with an unusual energy.)

1668
01:22:55,412 --> 01:22:58,982
(Ginkgo tree prayer site)

1669
01:23:01,182 --> 01:23:07,252
(Ra Yun begins to pray.)

1670
01:23:16,232 --> 01:23:18,602
"I want to pray. I want to go to a prayer site."

1671
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:19,802
I said that to him.

1672
01:23:20,432 --> 01:23:22,732
Gang Won planned a date with a visit to a prayer site.

1673
01:23:23,142 --> 01:23:24,502
I was so touched.

1674
01:23:25,372 --> 01:23:29,882
(Gang Won waits as Ra Yun prays.)

1675
01:23:32,952 --> 01:23:34,111
(The corner of Ra Yun's mouth...)

1676
01:23:34,112 --> 01:23:37,552
(turned up in a smile.)

1677
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:47,562
(What did Ra Yun hear?)

1678
01:23:54,102 --> 01:23:56,222
I saw something nice. Do you want to know what I saw?

1679
01:23:57,202 --> 01:23:59,141
- Are you curious? - Forget it.

1680
01:23:59,142 --> 01:24:00,442
- Are you curious? - What is it?

1681
01:24:01,042 --> 01:24:02,562
- You're curious, right? - What is it?

1682
01:24:03,012 --> 01:24:04,982
What do you think I saw? Guess.

1683
01:24:06,082 --> 01:24:07,852
- I don't know. - Guess.

1684
01:24:08,182 --> 01:24:09,212
I don't know.

1685
01:24:11,022 --> 01:24:12,082
Will I become rich?

1686
01:24:15,252 --> 01:24:16,762
No.

1687
01:24:17,462 --> 01:24:18,522
Won't I become rich?

1688
01:24:19,362 --> 01:24:21,032
- Guess what I saw. - What did you see?

1689
01:24:24,162 --> 01:24:26,001
"If I have a boyfriend who's a shaman,"

1690
01:24:26,002 --> 01:24:28,272
"we'll be able to go and pray together."

1691
01:24:28,432 --> 01:24:31,472
I was happy that I got a taste of it.

1692
01:24:32,372 --> 01:24:34,612
It was reassuring to go to a prayer site with Gang Won.

1693
01:24:35,942 --> 01:24:38,342
It's the shamans' date.

1694
01:24:38,512 --> 01:24:40,211
There were times we saw...

1695
01:24:40,212 --> 01:24:41,651
- some unexpected date ideas. - That's right.

1696
01:24:41,652 --> 01:24:43,281
- That's right. - Today, it was a prayer site.

1697
01:24:43,282 --> 01:24:45,982
I can explain. It's important to receive nice energy.

1698
01:24:46,152 --> 01:24:48,921
It's daily life for the shamans to pray at a prayer site...

1699
01:24:48,922 --> 01:24:50,322
with good energy.

1700
01:24:50,522 --> 01:24:52,803
But Ra Yun couldn't do that while living with the others.

1701
01:24:53,062 --> 01:24:54,508
So she went there to receive some energy...

1702
01:24:54,532 --> 01:24:56,162
and show her devotion to the spirits.

1703
01:24:57,232 --> 01:24:59,831
- I see. - There must be nice mountains...

1704
01:24:59,832 --> 01:25:01,572
- and prayer sites. - Yes.

1705
01:25:01,872 --> 01:25:05,201
The dates are fun, but it's interesting to see...

1706
01:25:05,202 --> 01:25:07,812
- everyone in the house. - Yes. I'm excited.

1707
01:25:09,242 --> 01:25:10,441
(The sweet and scary...)

1708
01:25:10,442 --> 01:25:13,112
(Talisman Date ends.)

1709
01:25:20,522 --> 01:25:22,962
I always come in 1st or 2nd.

1710
01:25:23,062 --> 01:25:24,062
I'm first.

1711
01:25:24,362 --> 01:25:27,591
(Ho Am and Yu Gyeong come back first.)

1712
01:25:27,592 --> 01:25:28,732
These are my shoes.

1713
01:25:28,892 --> 01:25:30,202
- Really? - Yes.

1714
01:25:33,172 --> 01:25:34,832
Gosh, you're back.

1715
01:25:35,832 --> 01:25:36,841
You're back.

1716
01:25:36,842 --> 01:25:38,742
(Byeong Yeol welcomes Ho Am.)

1717
01:25:39,002 --> 01:25:40,442
I was resting.

1718
01:25:43,182 --> 01:25:46,482
(Yu Gyeong brings something out.)

1719
01:25:47,712 --> 01:25:50,022
We... Other people aren't coming.

1720
01:25:50,422 --> 01:25:52,282
- It's taking them long today. - I know.

1721
01:25:53,322 --> 01:25:54,692
(Glancing over)

1722
01:25:55,492 --> 01:25:57,622
(Byeong Yeol spots Yu Gyeong.)

1723
01:25:58,762 --> 01:26:00,392
(He follows her.)

1724
01:26:00,692 --> 01:26:02,831
(He quickens his steps.)

1725
01:26:02,832 --> 01:26:03,832
Where are you going?

1726
01:26:05,002 --> 01:26:06,031
Where are you going?

1727
01:26:06,032 --> 01:26:07,272
(Grinning)

1728
01:26:07,672 --> 01:26:08,672
Where are you going?

1729
01:26:09,602 --> 01:26:10,871
- What? - Where are you going?

1730
01:26:10,872 --> 01:26:11,872
- To give jelly. - I see.

1731
01:26:11,873 --> 01:26:12,942
- You bought it. - Yes.

1732
01:26:13,442 --> 01:26:15,542
- It's this one, right? - It's Gang Won's bed.

1733
01:26:16,542 --> 01:26:17,662
Maybe I should've thrown it.

1734
01:26:18,212 --> 01:26:19,281
What did you do?

1735
01:26:19,282 --> 01:26:22,182
What? I rested and wrote a journal entry.

1736
01:26:23,752 --> 01:26:24,782
Your cheeks are red.

1737
01:26:24,882 --> 01:26:26,181
- Really? - Did you take a nap?

1738
01:26:26,182 --> 01:26:28,421
I was lying down in a warm place.

1739
01:26:28,422 --> 01:26:29,661
(Byeong Yeol follows Yu Gyeong around.)

1740
01:26:29,662 --> 01:26:30,662
What did you do today?

1741
01:26:32,292 --> 01:26:33,491
(He's cute.)

1742
01:26:33,492 --> 01:26:35,992
Gosh, he's being forward right after seeing her.

1743
01:26:36,162 --> 01:26:37,362
He's following her around.

1744
01:26:37,462 --> 01:26:39,001
He doesn't seem like someone...

1745
01:26:39,002 --> 01:26:40,902
- who moves fast. - Seriously.

1746
01:26:41,272 --> 01:26:42,432
But he's moving very fast.

1747
01:26:43,002 --> 01:26:45,283
It's because Byeong Yeol has someone he wants to impress.

1748
01:26:46,342 --> 01:26:47,718
- Guess what I did. - What did you do?

1749
01:26:47,742 --> 01:26:49,172
- Guess. - Did you eat something?

1750
01:26:49,272 --> 01:26:50,542
- Yes. - What did you eat?

1751
01:26:50,882 --> 01:26:51,911
Guess what I ate.

1752
01:26:51,912 --> 01:26:56,522
Gosh, it isn't something that makes me happy.

1753
01:26:56,622 --> 01:26:57,652
Do I need to guess?

1754
01:26:58,552 --> 01:27:00,121
- Just food. Western food. - Food?

1755
01:27:00,122 --> 01:27:01,392
- Western food? - Yes.

1756
01:27:01,692 --> 01:27:03,062
(I see.)

1757
01:27:03,792 --> 01:27:05,192
I bet you got sick and tired of it.

1758
01:27:06,192 --> 01:27:09,192
(Byeong Yeol worries over her date with Ho Am.)

1759
01:27:09,662 --> 01:27:10,662
I see.

1760
01:27:10,932 --> 01:27:15,472
- I had a good rest and... - Okay.

1761
01:27:16,742 --> 01:27:18,102
Wrote in my journal.

1762
01:27:19,042 --> 01:27:20,072
Show me your journal.

1763
01:27:22,012 --> 01:27:24,211
- Gosh, I can't... - It'll be fun.

1764
01:27:24,212 --> 01:27:26,042
- What? - Your journal.

1765
01:27:26,412 --> 01:27:28,051
My journal? Okay.

1766
01:27:28,052 --> 01:27:29,411
- Show me. Can I see it? - I'll show you.

1767
01:27:29,412 --> 01:27:30,421
Yes!

1768
01:27:30,422 --> 01:27:32,262
(Byeong Yeol concedes to Yu Gyeong's request.)

1769
01:27:32,322 --> 01:27:34,121
I want to read what you wrote today.

1770
01:27:34,122 --> 01:27:35,991
- Today's entry? - Yes.

1771
01:27:35,992 --> 01:27:37,792
Today's entry is a bit intense.

1772
01:27:38,362 --> 01:27:39,932
- Today's entry... - Okay.

1773
01:27:42,162 --> 01:27:43,802
(Hesitant)

1774
01:27:44,362 --> 01:27:46,282
Shall I read today's entry or yesterday's entry?

1775
01:27:47,632 --> 01:27:51,071
Either one is fine. The 8th and 9th.

1776
01:27:51,072 --> 01:27:52,872
(He opens the journal for Yu Gyeong to read.)

1777
01:27:52,942 --> 01:27:54,411
Will he really show it to her?

1778
01:27:54,412 --> 01:27:56,118
- Will he show it to her? - It isn't easy to do that.

1779
01:27:56,142 --> 01:27:57,981
I wouldn't even show that to my mom.

1780
01:27:57,982 --> 01:27:59,058
Isn't that a love confession?

1781
01:27:59,082 --> 01:28:00,512
He's showing her his journal?

1782
01:28:01,652 --> 01:28:04,152
- Gosh, Byeong Yeol. - Gosh, seriously.

1783
01:28:05,252 --> 01:28:06,521
- May I read it? - Sure.

1784
01:28:06,522 --> 01:28:08,952
(Byeong Yeol willingly lets her read his journal.)

1785
01:28:09,552 --> 01:28:14,862
(I'm thankful for being able to have a date with Yu Gyeong.)

1786
01:28:14,932 --> 01:28:17,161
(I think I did well to follow my heart.)

1787
01:28:17,162 --> 01:28:19,401
(A day can't get any better than this.)

1788
01:28:19,402 --> 01:28:20,472
What did you read?

1789
01:28:21,532 --> 01:28:23,402
- You sound like a rapper. - A rapper?

1790
01:28:24,172 --> 01:28:25,271
(Feeling shy)

1791
01:28:25,272 --> 01:28:26,442
I'll read it slowly.

1792
01:28:28,742 --> 01:28:30,841
(What do I want to thank at this very moment)

1793
01:28:30,842 --> 01:28:33,581
(Sharing hearts and future values with Yu Gyeong)

1794
01:28:33,582 --> 01:28:36,381
(Yu Gyeong feeling touched by my love talisman message)

1795
01:28:36,382 --> 01:28:37,822
(My parents)

1796
01:28:39,552 --> 01:28:41,552
- What were you doing? - I was watching the video.

1797
01:28:43,262 --> 01:28:44,592
I was watching this.

1798
01:28:45,822 --> 01:28:47,162
Oh, you were watching this.

1799
01:28:47,562 --> 01:28:49,461
There's a QR code for this.

1800
01:28:49,462 --> 01:28:51,332
There is a QR code, but I...

1801
01:28:52,062 --> 01:28:53,432
- It's... - What is this?

1802
01:28:55,302 --> 01:28:56,902
You should've taken it with the QR code.

1803
01:28:57,342 --> 01:28:58,372
I don't know how to.

1804
01:28:59,912 --> 01:29:01,771
Oh, the QR code will send the video.

1805
01:29:01,772 --> 01:29:03,411
This will be given to you.

1806
01:29:03,412 --> 01:29:04,932
(He took a video of that very moment.)

1807
01:29:05,142 --> 01:29:07,452
I wanted to keep the picture up here,

1808
01:29:12,982 --> 01:29:17,492
but I'm sharing this place with Ho Am.

1809
01:29:17,562 --> 01:29:19,092
I didn't want to upset him.

1810
01:29:19,792 --> 01:29:21,032
I thought it was better not to.

1811
01:29:21,792 --> 01:29:24,702
I thought that because this room isn't just for me.

1812
01:29:24,862 --> 01:29:26,032
If I used this room alone,

1813
01:29:27,172 --> 01:29:29,072
I would've put up 8 to 10 pictures.

1814
01:29:30,642 --> 01:29:31,671
Right.

1815
01:29:31,672 --> 01:29:33,671
(Byeong Yeol is filled with a heart for Yu Gyeong.)

1816
01:29:33,672 --> 01:29:35,142
(Opening)

1817
01:29:36,612 --> 01:29:40,612
(Ho Am comes out to the terrace.)

1818
01:29:45,622 --> 01:29:51,092
(He blankly looks outside.)

1819
01:29:52,392 --> 01:29:55,231
(Ho Am cannot go into the room...)

1820
01:29:55,232 --> 01:29:58,101
(with Yu Gyeong and Byeong Yeol together.)

1821
01:29:58,102 --> 01:30:00,301
I was torn...

1822
01:30:00,302 --> 01:30:03,871
and couldn't settle down with a decision.

1823
01:30:03,872 --> 01:30:06,502
Tomorrow is the day before the final decision,

1824
01:30:07,912 --> 01:30:10,142
and I feel lost.

1825
01:30:13,042 --> 01:30:14,512
(Peeking)

1826
01:30:15,612 --> 01:30:18,351
(Someone has arrived at the Possessed House.)

1827
01:30:18,352 --> 01:30:20,292
I dreamt of becoming a fish.

1828
01:30:20,352 --> 01:30:21,722
A fish?

1829
01:30:24,122 --> 01:30:27,592
(Hyeon U and Yun Jeong return from their date.)

1830
01:30:34,402 --> 01:30:35,402
It was just like that.

1831
01:30:35,403 --> 01:30:37,542
- You're here! - When did you come back?

1832
01:30:37,672 --> 01:30:38,772
Around ten minutes ago?

1833
01:30:39,772 --> 01:30:42,212
Why are you following me?

1834
01:30:44,082 --> 01:30:45,982
Because I want to see Ho Am.

1835
01:30:46,682 --> 01:30:47,981
Why do you want to see Ho Am?

1836
01:30:47,982 --> 01:30:48,888
(Why do you want to see Ho Am?)

1837
01:30:48,915 --> 01:30:50,515
Because I want to see Ho Am.

1838
01:30:51,485 --> 01:30:52,815
Why do you want to see Ho Am?

1839
01:30:53,215 --> 01:30:56,385
(Ho Am heads back inside as he is being looked for.)

1840
01:30:56,925 --> 01:30:58,294
- It's Ho Am. - Ho Am...

1841
01:30:58,295 --> 01:31:00,164
(Yun Jeong looked for Ho Am as soon as she returned.)

1842
01:31:00,165 --> 01:31:02,325
What? What is it?

1843
01:31:03,835 --> 01:31:04,965
(What is it?)

1844
01:31:08,005 --> 01:31:11,605
(Yun Jeong smiles brightly after seeing Ho Am.)

1845
01:31:15,205 --> 01:31:18,045
- This is similar to mine. - Right.

1846
01:31:18,515 --> 01:31:19,815
- The yellow one. - Right.

1847
01:31:24,555 --> 01:31:27,284
(Yun Jeong's eyes are fixed on Ho Am.)

1848
01:31:27,285 --> 01:31:29,685
I kept looking at him, and it felt great.

1849
01:31:30,425 --> 01:31:31,725
(Feeling shy)

1850
01:31:32,125 --> 01:31:33,295
Gosh.

1851
01:31:35,225 --> 01:31:36,525
It doesn't matter...

1852
01:31:37,635 --> 01:31:39,065
what the other person thinks.

1853
01:31:40,005 --> 01:31:42,565
Even if I was to get zero votes,

1854
01:31:42,705 --> 01:31:46,274
I thought that being honest would make myself proud...

1855
01:31:46,275 --> 01:31:47,445
and confident.

1856
01:31:48,305 --> 01:31:51,075
(Yun Jeong finally has become honest with her heart.)

1857
01:31:51,145 --> 01:31:52,245
Finally.

1858
01:31:52,615 --> 01:31:53,645
Right.

1859
01:31:53,745 --> 01:31:54,784
It would've been great...

1860
01:31:54,785 --> 01:31:55,861
- if that happened a bit earlier. - Right.

1861
01:31:55,885 --> 01:31:57,955
The catch of the day...

1862
01:31:57,985 --> 01:32:00,554
- is Yun Jeong wanting to see Ho Am. - Right.

1863
01:32:00,555 --> 01:32:01,884
- How nice. - It's a big catch.

1864
01:32:01,885 --> 01:32:02,955
- That's great. - Right.

1865
01:32:02,985 --> 01:32:04,494
Gosh, Yun Jeong.

1866
01:32:04,495 --> 01:32:05,525
(Feeling proud)

1867
01:32:06,625 --> 01:32:10,064
(Yun Jeong's feelings for Ho Am...)

1868
01:32:10,065 --> 01:32:13,905
(can no longer be hidden.)

1869
01:32:16,735 --> 01:32:18,974
(Sang Heok and Kyung Eon return.)

1870
01:32:18,975 --> 01:32:20,105
Gosh, it's cold.

1871
01:32:23,775 --> 01:32:24,845
Hold on.

1872
01:32:24,875 --> 01:32:26,014
(Grabbing)

1873
01:32:26,015 --> 01:32:27,495
- I'll put your shoes here. - Thanks.

1874
01:32:28,715 --> 01:32:30,355
They'll get stepped on if they are there.

1875
01:32:30,785 --> 01:32:33,184
(He takes care of Kyung Eon's shoes.)

1876
01:32:33,185 --> 01:32:34,385
You can put them on.

1877
01:32:36,185 --> 01:32:37,295
Oh, the book.

1878
01:32:37,695 --> 01:32:41,265
I'll take the talisman.

1879
01:32:42,195 --> 01:32:44,595
- The book. - Thank you.

1880
01:32:44,735 --> 01:32:46,465
I hope you'll be able to finish it.

1881
01:32:46,935 --> 01:32:48,035
Okay.

1882
01:32:53,005 --> 01:32:54,645
- The lugworm. - A worm?

1883
01:32:55,605 --> 01:32:56,875
It was from the sea?

1884
01:32:57,545 --> 01:32:58,815
Hello.

1885
01:32:59,545 --> 01:33:00,884
Hello.

1886
01:33:00,885 --> 01:33:02,985
(Looking intently)

1887
01:33:03,285 --> 01:33:04,884
- Oh, you're back. - You're back.

1888
01:33:04,885 --> 01:33:05,915
How was it?

1889
01:33:06,485 --> 01:33:07,824
It was great.

1890
01:33:07,825 --> 01:33:09,055
- It was great? - Yes.

1891
01:33:09,455 --> 01:33:10,815
Did you all do something together?

1892
01:33:11,295 --> 01:33:13,495
- Did you all do something together? - It's a talisman.

1893
01:33:14,325 --> 01:33:15,395
A talisman.

1894
01:33:15,825 --> 01:33:18,035
It's a talisman. Can you be walking around with that?

1895
01:33:20,305 --> 01:33:21,834
(Flustered)

1896
01:33:21,835 --> 01:33:23,775
- I... - Hurry up and go inside.

1897
01:33:25,235 --> 01:33:27,275
- She's rushing inside. - Hurry up and go inside.

1898
01:33:27,405 --> 01:33:28,544
Run away.

1899
01:33:28,545 --> 01:33:29,905
(Studying the room)

1900
01:33:30,815 --> 01:33:35,215
(She saw the talisman for the date request.)

1901
01:33:36,615 --> 01:33:38,554
- Why are you laughing? - It's nothing.

1902
01:33:38,555 --> 01:33:39,995
- Don't laugh. - I enjoyed the date.

1903
01:33:41,955 --> 01:33:43,255
I'm going to go in first.

1904
01:33:44,895 --> 01:33:46,425
I want to go in too!

1905
01:33:48,065 --> 01:33:49,594
We have to give the makgeolli a stir.

1906
01:33:49,595 --> 01:33:50,635
Right!

1907
01:33:52,795 --> 01:33:55,705
I think we will be able to smell it right away when it opens.

1908
01:33:56,635 --> 01:33:57,974
Happy Eonion!

1909
01:33:57,975 --> 01:33:59,234
Can that be opened already?

1910
01:33:59,235 --> 01:34:00,945
It has to be stirred.

1911
01:34:02,545 --> 01:34:05,115
(The flavour enhances each time it is taken care of.)

1912
01:34:05,875 --> 01:34:06,984
(Impressed)

1913
01:34:06,985 --> 01:34:08,945
- What is it? - It smells nice.

1914
01:34:09,545 --> 01:34:11,214
Were we told to stir it like this?

1915
01:34:11,215 --> 01:34:13,885
- From the bottom to the top. - From the bottom to the top?

1916
01:34:14,755 --> 01:34:17,095
(Being careful)

1917
01:34:19,125 --> 01:34:20,424
From the bottom to the top.

1918
01:34:20,425 --> 01:34:21,964
(Yu Ra approaches the two.)

1919
01:34:21,965 --> 01:34:22,994
This will be better.

1920
01:34:22,995 --> 01:34:24,735
- Is there another one? - Just use this.

1921
01:34:26,435 --> 01:34:28,665
Makgeolli could be made at home.

1922
01:34:29,535 --> 01:34:31,334
Oh, it would be hard to cook the rice.

1923
01:34:31,335 --> 01:34:33,035
Right. It would be hard to cook nicely.

1924
01:34:33,545 --> 01:34:36,345
- Wasn't the rice hard-steamed? - Right.

1925
01:34:36,445 --> 01:34:37,475
Right.

1926
01:34:39,415 --> 01:34:42,414
(Yu Ra moves away from them.)

1927
01:34:42,415 --> 01:34:44,335
Maybe we added too much rice. It's hard to stir.

1928
01:34:48,955 --> 01:34:53,025
(There's no room to fit in between the two of them.)

1929
01:34:55,695 --> 01:34:56,975
Would you like to give it a try?

1930
01:34:58,035 --> 01:35:00,735
- No. I'll just watch. - Really? Okay.

1931
01:35:03,635 --> 01:35:09,174
(Yu Ra watches without saying anything.)

1932
01:35:09,175 --> 01:35:10,275
Say something.

1933
01:35:10,315 --> 01:35:11,875
That was what our teacher told us.

1934
01:35:13,145 --> 01:35:15,344
Why are you getting creeped out?

1935
01:35:15,345 --> 01:35:16,345
(Looking intently)

1936
01:35:18,255 --> 01:35:20,015
She definitely wants to do something, right?

1937
01:35:20,355 --> 01:35:22,385
- There's no room. - There's no room. It's tough.

1938
01:35:23,795 --> 01:35:25,855
- Oh, no. - This scene is heartbreaking.

1939
01:35:26,155 --> 01:35:28,224
They're speaking casually with each other too.

1940
01:35:28,225 --> 01:35:29,265
Right.

1941
01:35:29,925 --> 01:35:32,994
The two who have joined a few days later than her...

1942
01:35:32,995 --> 01:35:34,635
are so close together.

1943
01:35:34,865 --> 01:35:37,074
Missing out on the date was crucial.

1944
01:35:37,075 --> 01:35:38,104
Right.

1945
01:35:38,105 --> 01:35:39,934
(This is upsetting.)

1946
01:35:39,935 --> 01:35:41,475
I'll write it down.

1947
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:45,915
I think mine will taste better now.

1948
01:35:46,245 --> 01:35:47,514
It's all thanks to my comment.

1949
01:35:47,515 --> 01:35:50,145
(The two have become very close after two days.)

1950
01:35:52,585 --> 01:35:55,524
I felt frustrated about...

1951
01:35:55,525 --> 01:35:57,095
not being able to go on a date.

1952
01:35:57,825 --> 01:36:00,094
I didn't have a chance...

1953
01:36:00,095 --> 01:36:02,325
for us to learn about each other.

1954
01:36:02,465 --> 01:36:05,365
I want to learn more about him...

1955
01:36:05,935 --> 01:36:08,364
and show more of myself...

1956
01:36:08,365 --> 01:36:11,635
through a conversation.

1957
01:36:21,545 --> 01:36:22,615
(Surprised)

1958
01:36:23,445 --> 01:36:28,625
(The bell rings once again today.)

1959
01:36:31,725 --> 01:36:35,024
Today, the owner of the fate plaque you have chosen...

1960
01:36:35,025 --> 01:36:36,095
will be revealed.

1961
01:36:37,135 --> 01:36:39,895
Head to the Hall of Sacred Spirits with your fate plaque.

1962
01:36:43,005 --> 01:36:46,935
(The day of the fate plaque reveal has finally come.)

1963
01:36:47,305 --> 01:36:48,305
(Finally)

1964
01:36:48,306 --> 01:36:49,805
Gosh!

1965
01:36:50,045 --> 01:36:51,175
Gosh, the time has come.

1966
01:36:52,275 --> 01:36:53,715
(Feeling anxious)

1967
01:36:53,945 --> 01:36:54,984
The day has come.

1968
01:36:54,985 --> 01:36:56,584
For some,

1969
01:36:56,585 --> 01:36:58,585
it might not bother them at all. But for some,

1970
01:36:58,755 --> 01:37:01,054
they might consider it...

1971
01:37:01,055 --> 01:37:02,324
- to be very important. - Right.

1972
01:37:02,325 --> 01:37:05,225
Yu Gyeong will definitely go through confusion.

1973
01:37:05,655 --> 01:37:08,564
The Gold Dragon and the Black Monkey...

1974
01:37:08,565 --> 01:37:11,264
could get really attracted to each other once they meet.

1975
01:37:11,265 --> 01:37:12,994
- Really? - That's what it's like?

1976
01:37:12,995 --> 01:37:16,535
It's unpredictable how things will turn out.

1977
01:37:17,535 --> 01:37:19,935
This season feels so unpredictable.

1978
01:37:22,445 --> 01:37:23,715
No!

1979
01:37:24,575 --> 01:37:25,845
I don't want to know.

1980
01:37:26,045 --> 01:37:27,915
- No. - This is crazy.

1981
01:37:28,215 --> 01:37:29,285
Our fate plaques?

1982
01:37:30,515 --> 01:37:31,954
The fate plaque owners...

1983
01:37:31,955 --> 01:37:33,761
- will be revealed today. - They'll be revealed. Yes.

1984
01:37:33,785 --> 01:37:35,585
I think I already know who I chose.

1985
01:37:41,025 --> 01:37:45,465
(The owners of the fate plaques will soon be revealed.)

1986
01:37:50,105 --> 01:37:51,834
(In front of fate, )

1987
01:37:51,835 --> 01:37:56,605
(will they be able to keep their hearts secure?)

1988
01:38:03,185 --> 01:38:05,185
For some reason,

1989
01:38:05,415 --> 01:38:06,715
it was a bit disappointing.

1990
01:38:07,255 --> 01:38:10,495
I think I might have closed up my heart a bit too quickly.

1991
01:38:11,595 --> 01:38:14,265
There must've been someone else that might've worked out with me.

1992
01:38:17,565 --> 01:38:20,705
I might have decided a bit too quickly.

1993
01:38:28,975 --> 01:38:32,315
(Possessed Love S2)

1994
01:38:33,515 --> 01:38:35,314
(The fate plaques that were kept hidden...)

1995
01:38:35,315 --> 01:38:37,385
(get revealed.)

1996
01:38:39,855 --> 01:38:42,755
(The fortune tellers finally approach their fates.)

1997
01:38:42,855 --> 01:38:44,055
(I don't want to know.)

1998
01:38:44,655 --> 01:38:47,665
(The fates they have chosen)

1999
01:38:47,825 --> 01:38:48,994
(It feels annoying today, doesn't it?)

2000
01:38:48,995 --> 01:38:50,165
(I feel so annoyed.)

2001
01:38:50,325 --> 01:38:52,495
(Hearts are shaken.)

2002
01:38:52,735 --> 01:38:54,134
(What about you, Yu Gyeong?)

2003
01:38:54,135 --> 01:38:57,835
(It's not a relationship that feels that comfortable.)

2004
01:38:58,075 --> 01:39:00,475
(The Fate Plaque Date begins.)

2005
01:39:00,605 --> 01:39:02,445
(My heart will really be shaken.)

2006
01:39:02,505 --> 01:39:05,074
(What must I do, Grandpa?)

2007
01:39:05,075 --> 01:39:07,484
(Fate is something hard to deny.)

2008
01:39:07,485 --> 01:39:08,844
(A presence...)

2009
01:39:08,845 --> 01:39:10,405
(that you are inevitably attracted to?)

2010
01:39:10,815 --> 01:39:13,615
(Possessed Love S2)
