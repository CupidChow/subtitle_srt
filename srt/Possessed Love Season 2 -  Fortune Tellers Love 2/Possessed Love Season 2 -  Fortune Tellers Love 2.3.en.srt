1
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:27,984
(All statements related to shamanism and fortune-telling...)

2
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:29,024
(made by the cast in this program...)

3
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:30,265
(are purely personal opinions.)

4
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:33,965
The bell rang,

5
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:37,671
and a new participant showed up.

6
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:43,075
And he was better-looking than I expected.

7
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:52,815
Like, "Is he a celebrity? He's so handsome."

8
00:01:01,255 --> 00:01:04,524
Another guy who was taller and better-looking than me...

9
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:05,725
entered,

10
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:07,065
so I even thought,

11
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,435
"Is he a celebrity," at first.

12
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:16,805
I thought, "He's very tall."

13
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:18,375
"He's handsome."

14
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:21,905
I felt smaller in comparison.

15
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:24,215
I felt that he was different from me.

16
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:27,445
He looked neat, delicate,

17
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:30,155
and sophisticated. He wasn't rough like I was.

18
00:01:32,855 --> 00:01:34,055
"The moment has come."

19
00:01:34,455 --> 00:01:36,095
I wanted to leave the house.

20
00:01:38,895 --> 00:01:41,764
He was handsome, had a small face,

21
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:43,395
and the tallest among men.

22
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:47,365
I believe...

23
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:49,305
that things will change around here.

24
00:01:52,435 --> 00:01:54,775
(Possessed Love S2)

25
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:59,015
(The confusing first day ended.)

26
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:01,644
(I might feel sad.)

27
00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:05,855
(I reckoned that I might be wrong about everything.)

28
00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:08,555
(It's not going as I predicted.)

29
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:11,355
(The participants' first date)

30
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:14,465
(They start having good feelings about each other.)

31
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:19,035
(No one can predict their feelings.)

32
00:02:19,665 --> 00:02:22,465
(At some point, this started to feel special.)

33
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:23,874
(Did you enjoy it?)

34
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,405
(I enjoyed it.)

35
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:31,715
(And an unknown man appears.)

36
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:35,585
(Kim Yun Jeong)

37
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:43,094
(The wonderful quirk of fate begins.)

38
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:45,855
(Comedian Shin Dong Yeob, and actress Yoo In Na)

39
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:47,725
- I guarantee you... - Yes.

40
00:02:48,225 --> 00:02:52,234
That of all the dating shows on the planet...

41
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:53,864
- that we live on, - Yes.

42
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:55,464
This show progresses the fastest.

43
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:57,234
- That's true. - I love it.

44
00:02:57,235 --> 00:02:58,934
- Nothing's frustrating about this. - It's so quick.

45
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:00,474
It feels new and thrilling every week.

46
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:02,274
And I still find it tough to wait for a week.

47
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:04,444
- I can't wait either. - It's faster than the US or Europe.

48
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:05,974
- Exactly. - It moves on so fast.

49
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:07,614
And it helps us get into the show faster.

50
00:03:07,615 --> 00:03:08,644
- Yes. - Indeed.

51
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:12,285
I feel like it will get far more entertaining from today.

52
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:15,524
Yun Jeong has chosen...

53
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:18,624
- the Gold Dragon from the start. - That's right.

54
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,295
While she doesn't know who it is,

55
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:23,494
the Gold Dragon will finally be...

56
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,764
- identified. - On top of that,

57
00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:27,334
the Gold Dragon chose Yun Jeong's name plaque.

58
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:28,705
That's right.

59
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:29,874
But Yun Jeong is starting...

60
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,134
to have feelings for Ho Am.

61
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:32,275
- She is. - That's right.

62
00:03:32,405 --> 00:03:33,644
What should we do about this?

63
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:35,704
And their professions will be revealed today.

64
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:37,414
- Right! - You're right.

65
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:39,445
As another person in the same field,

66
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:41,284
I wonder how their feelings will change...

67
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:43,085
after they find out about their jobs.

68
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:44,854
I can't wait to find out...

69
00:03:44,855 --> 00:03:47,154
what will happen after they realize their jobs.

70
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:48,684
A dating show that drives too fast.

71
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:49,854
(You can't take your eyes off as it progresses too fast.)

72
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,654
Possessed Love is a dating show...

73
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:53,794
that progresses the fastest among all dating shows.

74
00:03:53,795 --> 00:03:56,134
We wonder what will happen this week.

75
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,195
Let's find out right away.

76
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:58,834
I'm so excited.

77
00:03:58,835 --> 00:03:59,905
(Looking forward to it)

78
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:01,364
Here.

79
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:04,805
(The participants gather one by one.)

80
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:08,205
(Nervous)

81
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:11,714
(The 8 fortune tellers' professions will be revealed at last.)

82
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:12,745
I hope not.

83
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:18,355
I'm nervous.

84
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:21,025
We're finally doing it.

85
00:04:21,155 --> 00:04:23,824
Finally, we're introducing ourselves.

86
00:04:23,825 --> 00:04:25,394
I thought, "The moment has come."

87
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:27,724
I felt that things were pretty shaky and that something was...

88
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,795
going on at that moment.

89
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:31,695
I can't predict anything.

90
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:33,065
I was worried...

91
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,904
that he might not be...

92
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:37,305
a shaman.

93
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:39,975
You guys got me.

94
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:43,575
It was so suspicious.

95
00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:44,745
I was so curious.

96
00:04:47,315 --> 00:04:52,655
(The 8 boxes hold their tools for fortune telling.)

97
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,725
(Staring)

98
00:04:57,295 --> 00:04:58,655
I was...

99
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:00,565
so intimidated at the time,

100
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:02,025
so I couldn't speak.

101
00:05:02,295 --> 00:05:04,964
I wanted to know what their majors were.

102
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:05,965
I was curious.

103
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:07,804
I was startled,

104
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:11,035
and so were all the other participants.

105
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:16,575
Like, "Who will it be? Is my guess about him or her correct?"

106
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,374
I was nervous...

107
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,385
as well as drained at the time.

108
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:26,955
(It's so nerve-racking that they feel drained.)

109
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:30,095
- They must be so nervous. - I can't imagine.

110
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:33,924
It's something that you never see on other dating shows.

111
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:36,794
- Indeed. - You can only see it here.

112
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,894
Will they be expecting that they're not shamans?

113
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:40,565
- Right. - Or...

114
00:05:41,365 --> 00:05:42,974
some might hope that the other person is...

115
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:43,975
also a shaman.

116
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:48,844
"These are introduction boxes that hold your information."

117
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:50,875
"Please open them when everyone is here."

118
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:53,315
(Nervous)

119
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:54,785
I got chills.

120
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:57,715
- Finally. - This is wild.

121
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:02,225
(Reading the room)

122
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:06,985
Who are you most curious about among the participants?

123
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,095
- Ho Am. - Ho Am.

124
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:10,735
- Ho Am. - Ho Am.

125
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:18,835
(Everyone is curious about Ho Am's introduction box.)

126
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:21,305
I guess Ho Am is the most unpredictable.

127
00:06:21,545 --> 00:06:23,905
They must be thinking he's a saju reader or a tarot reader.

128
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:26,745
- But they all suit him. - Yes.

129
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:28,944
Everyone will be so shocked.

130
00:06:28,945 --> 00:06:30,585
(His unexpected job will shock everyone.)

131
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,485
Ho Am will open it first...

132
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:34,884
and pick the next person.

133
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:36,554
We'll keep picking the next person.

134
00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:37,654
- That sounds fun. - Sorry.

135
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:39,424
Please host the event for us.

136
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:41,095
- Then, I'll go first. - Oh, my gosh.

137
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:43,295
Oh, my.

138
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:44,564
(Ho Am will open his introduction box first.)

139
00:06:44,565 --> 00:06:45,635
I can't wait to find out.

140
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:48,535
Why am I so nervous about this? This is insane.

141
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:51,775
(Everyone's eyes are fixed on the box.)

142
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,975
Let's see.

143
00:06:57,345 --> 00:06:59,075
- A book? - A book?

144
00:06:59,215 --> 00:07:00,245
Do you think it's a book?

145
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:01,445
Yes.

146
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:04,155
- In 1, 2, 3. - What is it?

147
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:06,325
What's that?

148
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:08,325
- I'm so curious. - All right.

149
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:13,895
(An unknown pink object)

150
00:07:13,995 --> 00:07:15,565
(What is that?)

151
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:18,065
(Surprised)

152
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:20,004
Are those shamanic tools? What are those?

153
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:21,405
- Bells? - He was a shaman!

154
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:23,735
Seriously?

155
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:27,705
(He hid his bells inside the pink cloth.)

156
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:30,945
That's unbelievable.

157
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:33,985
- He was a shaman! - I just got goosebumps.

158
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:38,115
(They react more enthusiastically than expected.)

159
00:07:39,485 --> 00:07:41,885
Everyone was curious...

160
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:43,454
because they never thought...

161
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:44,524
- he was a shaman. - Yes.

162
00:07:44,525 --> 00:07:46,364
I got chills, even though I knew he was.

163
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,695
(It's still surprising.)

164
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:49,065
(Fascinated)

165
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:51,035
I said he was a shaman yesterday.

166
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:52,764
- I guessed it right too! - So did I.

167
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:53,765
I knew he was a shaman.

168
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:55,105
I guessed it correctly.

169
00:07:55,465 --> 00:07:56,605
I'm a shaman.

170
00:07:58,705 --> 00:08:00,545
He did seem a little different.

171
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,805
What we talked about during the date...

172
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:05,445
It felt like...

173
00:08:07,715 --> 00:08:11,085
he was in his own world.

174
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:17,855
What do you think my previous major was?

175
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:22,465
(Ho Am's major?)

176
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:24,465
Engineering.

177
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:25,794
- Sorry? - Engineering.

178
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:26,965
- Engineering? - Engineering.

179
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:28,735
No?

180
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:31,335
I got chills earlier...

181
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:33,074
because Yu Gyeong mentioned it.

182
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:34,205
I did?

183
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:38,875
I was in nursing school.

184
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:40,314
(A male shaman who majored in nursing)

185
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:41,885
- Oh, I see. - Really?

186
00:08:42,115 --> 00:08:43,185
What?

187
00:08:44,115 --> 00:08:45,555
Really?

188
00:08:46,315 --> 00:08:48,225
That's incredible.

189
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:49,995
It's so cool, though.

190
00:08:50,755 --> 00:08:51,995
I was in nursing school.

191
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:54,865
- Oh, I see. - Really?

192
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:57,894
You said earlier that I looked like a nurse.

193
00:08:57,895 --> 00:08:59,735
(Yu Gyeong saw right through him.)

194
00:08:59,965 --> 00:09:01,265
(Fascinated)

195
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,874
No one becomes a shaman because they want to.

196
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:07,905
Right.

197
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:09,944
It's been tough...

198
00:09:09,945 --> 00:09:12,015
because my self-loss came pretty early.

199
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,685
I suffered from it so early...

200
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:17,484
that I felt that it was unfair.

201
00:09:17,485 --> 00:09:20,055
So, I ran away from it for four years.

202
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:23,424
I delayed it for four years and accepted my initiation.

203
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:26,995
I continue to be a shaman while thinking deeply about it.

204
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:34,105
I had a clear goal in my early 20s.

205
00:09:34,265 --> 00:09:35,935
I wanted to work at a major hospital.

206
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,634
A university hospital in Seoul.

207
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:41,304
I was attracted to looking after others,

208
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:43,314
so I dreamed of being a nurse.

209
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:45,915
(Ho Am when he was in college)

210
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:50,015
I liked to party, but I got pretty good grades too.

211
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:53,284
My classmates used to say that I got good grades,

212
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:56,385
even though I enjoy my time.

213
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,895
I kept working hard...

214
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:02,224
and I was positive...

215
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:05,835
that this job suited me and that I liked it.

216
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:08,535
(Ho Am in the school PR video)

217
00:10:08,705 --> 00:10:09,805
I'm Jang Ho Am.

218
00:10:10,705 --> 00:10:12,434
(Ho Am worked hard...)

219
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:16,875
(to achieve his dream back in college.)

220
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:19,175
It's a great way to support nursing students.

221
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,515
(When he participated in volunteer work)

222
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:24,285
I've been to many nursing homes...

223
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:27,855
and volunteered at university hospitals a lot.

224
00:10:28,885 --> 00:10:31,955
It was just fun and interesting.

225
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:34,894
(He was normal and warm-hearted back in college.)

226
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:36,265
Oh, goodness.

227
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:39,434
He's such a lovely person.

228
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:42,005
I like that guy.

229
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:44,804
I wish he would look after me.

230
00:10:44,805 --> 00:10:46,105
He looks so affectionate.

231
00:10:46,575 --> 00:10:47,705
Ho Am!

232
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:49,445
So, you want to be sick.

233
00:10:50,215 --> 00:10:51,345
Ho Am.

234
00:10:52,145 --> 00:10:53,285
He must have been popular.

235
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:57,685
But...

236
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,055
after I suffered from self-loss,

237
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:03,325
I naturally couldn't focus on studying.

238
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,854
I gave in...

239
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,795
and decided to quit school.

240
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:09,795
As time went on,

241
00:11:11,165 --> 00:11:13,705
I felt closer to my divine spirits.

242
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:17,735
I realized that I was slowly becoming a true shaman...

243
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,745
and that myself as a person was disappearing.

244
00:11:20,975 --> 00:11:22,344
I decided...

245
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:24,444
to accept it as fate.

246
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:26,345
(He decided to accept his fate.)

247
00:11:28,185 --> 00:11:30,355
I couldn't graduate from nursing school, though.

248
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:34,555
The conditions worsened while I was in school,

249
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,825
and all I could do was endure it.

250
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:39,225
I couldn't make it to graduation.

251
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:41,464
I quit school along the way...

252
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:43,235
and pursued my career as a shaman.

253
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:46,465
Thanks for sharing.

254
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,535
I wondered what he felt inside.

255
00:11:51,905 --> 00:11:54,604
And I wondered how he dealt with...

256
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:56,545
and treated...

257
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:59,744
his divine spirits.

258
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:03,555
I got far more curious about him.

259
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:06,924
I'll pick Hyeon U. I'm curious.

260
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:08,155
(Next is Hyeon U.)

261
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:10,555
I was so curious.

262
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:13,964
His job is pretty unexpected too. Oh, boy.

263
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:15,605
Yun Jeong won't be able to sleep tonight.

264
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:21,765
(Another surprising introduction box by Hyeon U)

265
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:26,304
Maybe you're both shamans.

266
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:28,575
- No way. - Hyeon U as well?

267
00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:31,445
Different bells.

268
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:34,014
That looks interesting.

269
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:35,084
(Hyeon U's box is particularly long.)

270
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:37,254
- Why am I so nervous? - Let's see what it is.

271
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:38,355
Yes, it's nerve-racking.

272
00:12:38,685 --> 00:12:39,855
What do you think it is?

273
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:41,655
Why don't you guess?

274
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:44,394
- A sword? - A fan?

275
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:45,855
A sword or a fan?

276
00:12:46,195 --> 00:12:48,064
- What is it? - I wonder what it is.

277
00:12:48,065 --> 00:12:49,295
(Curious)

278
00:12:49,595 --> 00:12:51,335
Drum rolls.

279
00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:52,934
(While everyone is excited, )

280
00:12:52,935 --> 00:12:54,635
(he opens his introduction box.)

281
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:58,535
(A red object came out of the box.)

282
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:00,705
The five cardinal colours?

283
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:03,174
Oh, I see.

284
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:06,144
(The red object was a fan.)

285
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:07,245
I knew it.

286
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:09,085
- What is that? - He's a shaman.

287
00:13:09,685 --> 00:13:11,114
- I knew it. - I saw this coming.

288
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:12,254
No way.

289
00:13:12,255 --> 00:13:13,255
(Another shaman)

290
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,785
- This is wild. - Both of you?

291
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:17,094
(Bursting into laughter)

292
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:18,295
Look at Byeong Yeol's face.

293
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,165
He's very shocked.

294
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:22,065
His ears are getting redder.

295
00:13:22,425 --> 00:13:24,495
And his face is getting paler.

296
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:28,905
(Feeling dizzy)

297
00:13:30,835 --> 00:13:32,805
I guessed it right again.

298
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:34,505
Please open it.

299
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:35,874
That's a surprise.

300
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:39,045
(He does a fan celebration for revealing who he is.)

301
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:42,385
How long has it been?

302
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:45,215
It's been less than two months.

303
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:47,384
That's so recent.

304
00:13:47,385 --> 00:13:49,585
Really?

305
00:13:49,855 --> 00:13:51,025
In fact,

306
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:54,965
I'm too bewildered to be here.

307
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:59,834
It happened in the blink of an eye,

308
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:01,735
and everything was a rush.

309
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:04,575
I opened my eyes to find myself here.

310
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:08,445
As a rookie shaman, I can't exactly tell...

311
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:11,715
if it's what I want or what my spirit wants.

312
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:13,885
I can't tell those apart yet.

313
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:16,485
So, I keep training myself.

314
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:21,125
(Practice is a must for a rookie shaman.)

315
00:14:23,055 --> 00:14:25,725
(His training never stopped in the Possessed House.)

316
00:14:26,295 --> 00:14:28,125
Are you a practising shaman?

317
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:32,594
- I'm still training to be one. - Oh, you're still praying.

318
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:34,865
Yes, I'm still praying. Mother tells me...

319
00:14:35,335 --> 00:14:37,334
- That training comes first? - Yes.

320
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,404
I've been praying and training...

321
00:14:39,405 --> 00:14:41,975
in Taebaek recently.

322
00:14:43,645 --> 00:14:46,475
- In Gangwon Province? - Yes, Taebaek, Gangwon.

323
00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:48,415
(Proud)

324
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:52,414
Is this rock from Taebaek?

325
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,025
Yes. It's from my prayer site.

326
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,325
That's cute.

327
00:14:56,655 --> 00:14:58,295
You brought a rock from your prayer site?

328
00:14:58,995 --> 00:15:00,055
I brought it.

329
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:01,694
That's adorable.

330
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:05,035
This is a rock from my prayer site.

331
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:06,195
Isn't that cute?

332
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:09,035
This is...

333
00:15:09,335 --> 00:15:11,935
She finds that cute.

334
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:14,795
She said it in front of everyone.

335
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:17,815
(Is she more interested in Hyeon U, the shaman?)

336
00:15:17,975 --> 00:15:21,385
I never expected Hyeon U to be a shaman.

337
00:15:22,685 --> 00:15:25,354
I merely thought he felt pure...

338
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:28,125
as if he was standing in a vast field.

339
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:31,555
Hyeon U is a shaman?

340
00:15:32,395 --> 00:15:33,465
It was such a surprise.

341
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:37,535
I thought it had been a while, but it's only been two months.

342
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:40,364
That's what he said.

343
00:15:40,365 --> 00:15:43,135
I just thought, "He's still a newbie."

344
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:45,775
(Finding him cute)

345
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:48,875
I'm so curious about that little pouch.

346
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:50,775
- Mine? - Yes.

347
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,714
All right.

348
00:15:52,715 --> 00:15:53,715
(Byeong Yeol's introduction box is the smallest.)

349
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:55,014
(Peeking)

350
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:56,115
A saju reader?

351
00:15:57,385 --> 00:15:59,314
The two people before me were shamans,

352
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:01,355
so I was pretty shocked.

353
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,925
(What's in his introduction box?)

354
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:05,725
It's tiny.

355
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,865
Even his ring seems suspicious.

356
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:11,895
(His box is suspiciously small.)

357
00:16:11,995 --> 00:16:15,035
I'm so nervous to show you.

358
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:16,305
Go on.

359
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:18,075
Ta-da.

360
00:16:22,405 --> 00:16:24,145
- A ring! - Oh, it's a ring.

361
00:16:24,415 --> 00:16:25,474
It really is a ring.

362
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:26,545
What?

363
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:28,585
- Why is there a ring? - Oh, my.

364
00:16:28,815 --> 00:16:30,185
Can you tell fortunes with a ring?

365
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:33,725
(What's this mysterious ring?)

366
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:36,185
- A ring? What is it? - It's a ring, isn't it?

367
00:16:41,995 --> 00:16:45,135
I'm actually a saju reader.

368
00:16:45,365 --> 00:16:46,905
You must have expected it.

369
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:48,905
I guessed it right!

370
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:52,375
I thought he was a shaman.

371
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:53,575
He's a saju reader.

372
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:58,744
I gave it meaning of supplementing...

373
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:00,345
the types of energy that I lacked...

374
00:17:00,745 --> 00:17:03,445
as I crafted it.

375
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,254
Though I was born with the Water Energy,

376
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:10,801
I don't have that much of it in my fate.

377
00:17:10,825 --> 00:17:13,455
I need a lot of Water Energy to be myself.

378
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:18,995
The ripples, the flow of water, the waves, and the water droplet.

379
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:23,034
I gave it such meaning as I made it,

380
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:24,105
and I wear it.

381
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,674
It gets more fascinating, entertaining, and fun...

382
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:29,205
the more I learn about it,

383
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:31,745
so I dug deeper and studied saju.

384
00:17:32,145 --> 00:17:35,245
(Gang Won is next.)

385
00:17:36,115 --> 00:17:38,055
(Glancing)

386
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:42,884
(Gang Won's box is long.)

387
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:44,624
It's the size of a Great Divine Blade.

388
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,545
It's obviously the size of a Great Divine Blade.

389
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:49,365
- Or a Warlord's Blade. - A Warlord's Blade.

390
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:52,135
It'd be incredible if it was a sword.

391
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:55,905
Just like everyone...

392
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:58,104
predicted...

393
00:17:58,105 --> 00:17:59,134
I told you so.

394
00:17:59,135 --> 00:18:00,295
(Gang Won was also a shaman.)

395
00:18:00,505 --> 00:18:02,045
You said you weren't!

396
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:05,314
I tried to hide it, but...

397
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:06,514
Seriously?

398
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:08,544
- That's wild. - It wasn't effective.

399
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,285
- Gosh. - Well...

400
00:18:12,115 --> 00:18:13,454
They're all shamans.

401
00:18:13,455 --> 00:18:15,654
I thought I did a good job of hiding it.

402
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:17,725
(A shocking series of 3 shamans)

403
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:19,625
Look at Byeong Yeol.

404
00:18:20,255 --> 00:18:21,695
There's more.

405
00:18:22,425 --> 00:18:23,965
Poor Byeong Yeol.

406
00:18:24,065 --> 00:18:26,235
Even the way they blink looks like they're shamans.

407
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:31,834
I thought I did a good job of hiding it, but I guess not.

408
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:33,435
(What's his backstory?)

409
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,775
I realized I wasn't normal.

410
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:40,014
I started realizing that something was wrong with me...

411
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:42,345
when I was in middle school or elementary school.

412
00:18:42,745 --> 00:18:45,184
When I was little, I couldn't stop crying...

413
00:18:45,185 --> 00:18:48,684
for 2 to 3 hours every time I saw a red colour.

414
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:50,394
(Gang Won in his childhood)

415
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,054
I visited more than ten different mental hospitals,

416
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,465
but they all said I wasn't sick.

417
00:18:56,825 --> 00:19:00,195
And it worsened by far when I became an adult.

418
00:19:00,365 --> 00:19:04,074
Numerous unexplainable things happened...

419
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:05,375
around me.

420
00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:09,105
If you were to ask me to pick only one incident...

421
00:19:13,575 --> 00:19:15,614
I went to a barbecue place with a friend,

422
00:19:15,615 --> 00:19:17,335
and the moment I picked up my chopsticks...

423
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,625
(The photo of the accident)

424
00:19:22,885 --> 00:19:24,955
And I saw a car driving by next to me.

425
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:28,564
You can only react when it's moderately surprising.

426
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:31,295
I was way too surprised in such a short time,

427
00:19:32,065 --> 00:19:34,965
so I only thought, "What's going on?"

428
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:40,474
("Compact Car Crashes After Minor Collision in Busan")

429
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:42,504
("No Casualties Reported")

430
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:45,415
I wasn't wearing any armour at the time,

431
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:47,845
so I believe it was my divine spirit's way...

432
00:19:48,115 --> 00:19:49,314
of warning me of danger.

433
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:50,614
I decided to do it, thinking,

434
00:19:50,615 --> 00:19:52,135
"I might as well try it before I die."

435
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:55,385
I'll pick Ra Yun.

436
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,584
- Me? - Show us.

437
00:19:56,585 --> 00:19:57,594
(Ra Yun's turn)

438
00:19:57,595 --> 00:20:00,294
- That's... - Take a guess.

439
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:02,065
Either a fan or a five-element flag.

440
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:03,424
A five-element flag?

441
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:05,295
Is there one in that size?

442
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:07,981
It could be a child spirit's fan or a small flag.

443
00:20:08,005 --> 00:20:09,965
- It could be a small one. - Right.

444
00:20:11,205 --> 00:20:13,845
(Did Gang Won guess correctly?)

445
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:17,875
All right.

446
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:20,985
She's a shaman. She has to be.

447
00:20:21,815 --> 00:20:23,855
All right. This is pretty embarrassing.

448
00:20:25,315 --> 00:20:27,825
- I'm excited. What would it be? - I'm...

449
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:29,955
I'm...

450
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:31,555
(Opening her introduction box)

451
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:34,564
(The fairy bells appear.)

452
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:36,324
I told you so. She had to be.

453
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:37,594
(Gang Won was right.)

454
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:38,595
Yes.

455
00:20:39,235 --> 00:20:40,395
I'm a Korean shaman.

456
00:20:42,735 --> 00:20:44,975
- That looks pretty. - They're butterfly bells.

457
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:47,635
All the bells are pretty. The pink one was pretty too.

458
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,204
Don't tell me you want to have them.

459
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:50,615
I just thought they were pretty.

460
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:52,575
Which brand is it? Tiffany?

461
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:55,445
The bells have nice designs.

462
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,545
It's gorgeous.

463
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,685
(Jealous)

464
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:01,055
You're a fairy.

465
00:21:02,485 --> 00:21:05,155
(Shocked by 4 shamans)

466
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:07,495
(Embarrassed)

467
00:21:09,765 --> 00:21:11,935
I predicted it, so...

468
00:21:12,895 --> 00:21:14,005
I wasn't that surprised.

469
00:21:14,935 --> 00:21:16,864
I think we'll be so compatible yet so incompatible.

470
00:21:16,865 --> 00:21:18,034
We'll fight so hard when we fight...

471
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:19,474
and get along so well when we do.

472
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:22,345
I had a feeling that it'd be extreme.

473
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:27,785
First off, my self-loss was pretty severe.

474
00:21:28,215 --> 00:21:30,215
I fell ill for no reason.

475
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:33,055
Even my friends from my childhood would say...

476
00:21:33,855 --> 00:21:36,384
that they saw me eating without any pills...

477
00:21:36,385 --> 00:21:37,795
for the first time.

478
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:39,054
I've always been sick,

479
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:40,615
but the doctors couldn't figure it out.

480
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,565
So,

481
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,235
my family suffered...

482
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:49,735
from severe self-loss or the divine punishment,

483
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:51,934
so no one followed it.

484
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,445
They all converted and escaped.

485
00:21:54,905 --> 00:21:58,315
Our bloodline almost ended with my brother and me.

486
00:22:04,485 --> 00:22:06,355
I felt sick for no reason.

487
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:07,985
It turned out...

488
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:10,955
that there were shamans on my mother's and father's sides.

489
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:13,924
People would say, "Why does that family have..."

490
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:15,125
"such a strong divine energy?"

491
00:22:15,265 --> 00:22:17,234
My older brother couldn't control the energy,

492
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,834
and neither could I.

493
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:19,835
But...

494
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:22,904
Then, we got a spiritual message...

495
00:22:22,905 --> 00:22:24,675
that my brother had a short lifespan.

496
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:29,045
Sorry. Every time I bring this up...

497
00:22:31,615 --> 00:22:33,475
We heard that he'd have a short lifespan.

498
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,284
(Ra Yun and her brother in childhood)

499
00:22:38,285 --> 00:22:41,685
I went to a fortune teller at the time...

500
00:22:41,785 --> 00:22:43,084
and asked for my brother's fortune.

501
00:22:43,085 --> 00:22:45,494
And she said, "Is your brother dead?"

502
00:22:45,495 --> 00:22:47,695
"Why does it say that he's dead?"

503
00:22:48,565 --> 00:22:51,034
I felt so bad for him.

504
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:54,565
So, I decided that I should do it to save his life.

505
00:22:56,035 --> 00:22:58,735
We held a ritual to substitute longevity and fate.

506
00:22:59,435 --> 00:23:01,945
They said one of our family members had to step forward...

507
00:23:02,445 --> 00:23:04,445
and that it'd be fine if that person accepted it.

508
00:23:05,345 --> 00:23:06,345
So, I said I'd do it.

509
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:08,245
My dad's first words were...

510
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:11,485
Oh, I'm tearing up.

511
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:14,985
I'm sorry.

512
00:23:19,395 --> 00:23:20,395
My dad said,

513
00:23:23,895 --> 00:23:25,611
"Will you no longer be sick if you take it?"

514
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:26,995
Because I've always been sick.

515
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:30,185
So, he asked me if I wouldn't be sick anymore after the initiation.

516
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:34,345
I remember that's how I took the initiation at the time.

517
00:23:36,145 --> 00:23:37,345
He was my family, after all.

518
00:23:38,315 --> 00:23:39,415
I had to save him.

519
00:23:43,285 --> 00:23:47,425
(Ra Yun chose the path of a shaman for her family.)

520
00:23:48,685 --> 00:23:50,055
So, I'm holding his energy down.

521
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:53,595
I'm soothing him...

522
00:23:54,025 --> 00:23:55,065
so that he can live well.

523
00:23:59,795 --> 00:24:01,204
I'm getting choked up.

524
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:02,734
Yes.

525
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:06,505
She had to accept it to survive.

526
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:09,574
They all have their reasons.

527
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:12,815
Yes. It breaks my heart.

528
00:24:13,815 --> 00:24:15,015
Yes.

529
00:24:18,485 --> 00:24:20,414
As another human being and a fellow shaman,

530
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:21,785
I thought she was admirable.

531
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:23,524
It's true...

532
00:24:23,525 --> 00:24:25,394
that shamans normally go...

533
00:24:25,395 --> 00:24:28,824
through hardships with the self-loss and everything.

534
00:24:28,825 --> 00:24:30,325
It broke my heart, actually.

535
00:24:32,665 --> 00:24:34,105
I'll pick Yu Gyeong.

536
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:35,264
(Yu Gyeong's turn)

537
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,804
- All right. - Let's see.

538
00:24:36,805 --> 00:24:37,805
Let's find out.

539
00:24:38,405 --> 00:24:39,474
I'm nervous.

540
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:40,674
I feel like there are ten blades inside.

541
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:42,045
I agree.

542
00:24:42,145 --> 00:24:44,105
What if this actually is a Divine General's Flag.

543
00:24:45,115 --> 00:24:46,845
(Excited)

544
00:24:47,615 --> 00:24:48,615
This is...

545
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:51,385
a bit overpackaging.

546
00:24:52,855 --> 00:24:53,855
A five-element flag?

547
00:24:54,855 --> 00:24:55,925
What do you think it is?

548
00:24:56,825 --> 00:24:58,695
- A five-element flag? - A large one, at that.

549
00:24:59,225 --> 00:25:00,994
That length tells me it's a five-element flag.

550
00:25:00,995 --> 00:25:02,524
(Most of them guess it's a five-element flag.)

551
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:03,724
Maybe there are decks of cards.

552
00:25:03,725 --> 00:25:04,735
Multiple decks?

553
00:25:05,935 --> 00:25:06,995
All sorts of cards.

554
00:25:08,065 --> 00:25:09,105
Oh, like this?

555
00:25:09,565 --> 00:25:10,565
I'm nervous.

556
00:25:11,235 --> 00:25:13,335
It could be a sword.

557
00:25:15,005 --> 00:25:16,005
I feel bad for Byeong Yeol.

558
00:25:16,006 --> 00:25:17,974
Including Yu Gyeong, there will be five shamans.

559
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,475
- That's true. - Right?

560
00:25:19,675 --> 00:25:21,875
There are currently 4 shamans, and it may be 5 shamans.

561
00:25:21,915 --> 00:25:23,845
We'll see if he runs out.

562
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:25,955
What if he goes home?

563
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:26,984
Is he still in his seat?

564
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:29,485
(They're excited about Byeong Yeol's response.)

565
00:25:29,885 --> 00:25:32,225
- It could be a sword. - One, two,

566
00:25:33,755 --> 00:25:34,764
three.

567
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:36,764
I thought so.

568
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:38,295
It was a five-element flag.

569
00:25:38,565 --> 00:25:40,435
I recognized it.

570
00:25:40,535 --> 00:25:42,304
It's a five-element flag.

571
00:25:42,305 --> 00:25:46,135
It's been two years since I became a shaman.

572
00:25:46,705 --> 00:25:47,805
She's not a tarot reader?

573
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:50,945
(Shocked)

574
00:25:51,575 --> 00:25:55,414
(Byeong Yeol is speechless to learn that there are 5 shamans.)

575
00:25:55,415 --> 00:25:56,515
It's so gratifying.

576
00:25:57,485 --> 00:25:58,755
It's a load off my chest.

577
00:25:59,285 --> 00:26:01,625
Yu Gyeong is so surprising.

578
00:26:01,885 --> 00:26:04,154
I was sure she was a tarot reader.

579
00:26:04,155 --> 00:26:05,695
I was so certain.

580
00:26:06,095 --> 00:26:07,495
It's been so tough.

581
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:10,594
There are lots of shamans this time.

582
00:26:10,595 --> 00:26:11,664
- Right. - There are so many.

583
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:14,905
When I found out that there were so many shamans,

584
00:26:15,005 --> 00:26:16,065
I was pretty shocked.

585
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:19,504
Each shaman holds at least 12 great divine spirits,

586
00:26:19,505 --> 00:26:20,945
so there are so many...

587
00:26:22,305 --> 00:26:24,074
Aside from the 12 spirits,

588
00:26:24,075 --> 00:26:25,674
if you include all the generals...

589
00:26:25,675 --> 00:26:28,215
- Right. There are far more. - There are way more with us.

590
00:26:29,985 --> 00:26:31,085
(Surprised)

591
00:26:31,155 --> 00:26:32,385
What?

592
00:26:33,415 --> 00:26:34,425
Are you serious?

593
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,785
Byeong Yeol might pass out.

594
00:26:39,095 --> 00:26:41,825
(5 shamans and their spirits?)

595
00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:44,065
(Knocked out)

596
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,135
(That's hilarious.)

597
00:26:46,235 --> 00:26:48,135
(Holding his laughter)

598
00:26:49,505 --> 00:26:51,334
It's so exhausting.

599
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:53,934
Poor him!

600
00:26:53,935 --> 00:26:54,945
(Poor Byeong Yeol)

601
00:26:55,505 --> 00:26:58,245
(The reality is too much for him to take in.)

602
00:26:58,775 --> 00:27:00,415
We should go and pray.

603
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:02,944
We should all go and pray.

604
00:27:02,945 --> 00:27:04,014
Let's go and pray.

605
00:27:04,015 --> 00:27:05,354
We should go on a tour.

606
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:06,815
(He suggests a group prayer trip.)

607
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,325
(Completely exhausted)

608
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:14,695
Lastly, Yu Ra, the main one.

609
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,965
(Opening Yu Ra's introduction box)

610
00:27:18,365 --> 00:27:20,294
- If she pulls out... - Is she also a shaman?

611
00:27:20,295 --> 00:27:22,435
A Great Divine Fan, it'll be so...

612
00:27:22,605 --> 00:27:26,005
(He feels anxious for some reason.)

613
00:27:29,298 --> 00:27:30,637
No way. It has to be either a deck of cards or a book.

614
00:27:30,638 --> 00:27:31,738
It must be 1 of these 2.

615
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:33,868
One, two, three.

616
00:27:34,338 --> 00:27:35,338
There you go.

617
00:27:35,838 --> 00:27:37,007
Yes, I told you she was a saju reader.

618
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:38,048
Is there more?

619
00:27:39,108 --> 00:27:40,547
(Relieved)

620
00:27:40,548 --> 00:27:44,048
I'm a saju reader and a tarot reader.

621
00:27:45,018 --> 00:27:47,558
I would say that saju is more scientific.

622
00:27:47,718 --> 00:27:52,527
Tarot cards can give me more detailed readings...

623
00:27:52,528 --> 00:27:55,498
on the emotional aspect, so I like that about tarot readings.

624
00:27:55,728 --> 00:27:57,767
I do believe that the combination can improve...

625
00:27:57,768 --> 00:27:59,768
the accuracy of the readings.

626
00:28:00,668 --> 00:28:03,598
(After that night, Yu Ra...)

627
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,408
(had to spread out her cards...)

628
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,248
(again and again.)

629
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:14,028
Should I just forget about the whole thing?

630
00:28:14,078 --> 00:28:16,048
Why can't I express myself?

631
00:28:17,218 --> 00:28:19,088
The card is telling you to stop obsessing.

632
00:28:19,618 --> 00:28:21,357
(She gives them sharp advice.)

633
00:28:21,358 --> 00:28:24,288
Will my finance improve around early next year?

634
00:28:25,058 --> 00:28:26,157
(The reading looks great.)

635
00:28:26,158 --> 00:28:29,458
(She delivers readings that are good for their luck.)

636
00:28:29,858 --> 00:28:31,527
Is it the Suit of Pentacles?

637
00:28:31,528 --> 00:28:32,567
I want to know if I would end up...

638
00:28:32,568 --> 00:28:33,688
- with someone here. - Okay.

639
00:28:33,828 --> 00:28:35,398
Well, it seems...

640
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:39,838
(She becomes their personal reader of saju and tarot cards.)

641
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:44,748
I think I've done readings for over 1,000 people by now.

642
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:48,718
It's like the weather forecast.

643
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,218
It's like understanding the weather in advance.

644
00:28:51,288 --> 00:28:54,388
It's nice because people can get a heads-up about their future.

645
00:28:55,588 --> 00:28:57,017
(Lastly, it's Yun Jeong's turn to open her introduction box.)

646
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:58,578
- Let's find out her job. - What is it?

647
00:29:00,358 --> 00:29:01,358
Tarot reader.

648
00:29:02,358 --> 00:29:03,958
- Do you think I'm a card reader? - Yes.

649
00:29:04,998 --> 00:29:06,638
It'd be funny if she pulls out bells too.

650
00:29:07,838 --> 00:29:09,738
(Please no...)

651
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:12,738
What kind of shaman are you?

652
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:15,478
Which region are you from?

653
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:17,238
Are you from North Korea?

654
00:29:18,078 --> 00:29:19,308
- North Korea? - North Korea?

655
00:29:19,448 --> 00:29:21,577
Then the bells wouldn't fit in the box. They'd be too big.

656
00:29:21,578 --> 00:29:22,978
- Right. - That?

657
00:29:23,948 --> 00:29:27,018
I'm starting to get scared now.

658
00:29:27,918 --> 00:29:28,918
(Many guesses are made. What's Yun Jeong's item?)

659
00:29:28,918 --> 00:29:29,918
Mine is...

660
00:29:31,488 --> 00:29:33,288
- I wonder how they boxed it. - What is it?

661
00:29:34,058 --> 00:29:35,738
- A tarot reader, right? - A tarot reader.

662
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,798
- No. - What is it then?

663
00:29:37,898 --> 00:29:38,968
I'm not a tarot reader.

664
00:29:38,998 --> 00:29:39,998
Then what is it?

665
00:29:40,668 --> 00:29:41,838
I do work with cards.

666
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,868
I'm Astrologer Kim Yun Jeong.

667
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:48,638
(Surprised)

668
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,708
- It suits you. - It's a deck of symbolon cards.

669
00:29:52,778 --> 00:29:55,048
- My gosh, really? - Yes. These are symbolon cards.

670
00:29:55,348 --> 00:29:58,848
And I have crystals here. I'm the one with crystals.

671
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:02,018
- I use this while meditating. - I see.

672
00:30:02,318 --> 00:30:05,258
I tend to reflect on my days a lot...

673
00:30:06,028 --> 00:30:07,487
at night.

674
00:30:07,488 --> 00:30:09,368
So I always keep this with me while reflecting.

675
00:30:10,328 --> 00:30:12,697
I have a lot of crystals.

676
00:30:12,698 --> 00:30:15,067
How would one do astrology readings?

677
00:30:15,068 --> 00:30:16,437
So astrology is...

678
00:30:16,438 --> 00:30:17,967
There's a chart.

679
00:30:17,968 --> 00:30:20,607
You can find out about the constellation...

680
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:23,037
that was actually observed in the sky on the day...

681
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,978
you were born from this chart.

682
00:30:25,078 --> 00:30:27,177
We believe that the constellation...

683
00:30:27,178 --> 00:30:30,177
can give insight on one's character and overall fortune.

684
00:30:30,178 --> 00:30:31,918
In other words, it can show us a blueprint.

685
00:30:32,848 --> 00:30:34,987
That's how we analyse people and read...

686
00:30:34,988 --> 00:30:37,358
the temporary and overall luck of their lives.

687
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:39,628
An astrologer?

688
00:30:40,228 --> 00:30:42,228
She had a very unique career.

689
00:30:42,358 --> 00:30:43,457
It was my first time hearing about it...

690
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:44,598
and meeting an astrologer.

691
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,067
I wouldn't say I was drawn to her spiritually.

692
00:30:47,068 --> 00:30:48,698
I was more curious than anything.

693
00:30:49,068 --> 00:30:50,938
"How does one do astrology readings?"

694
00:30:51,568 --> 00:30:54,437
First of all, I sort of identified with her.

695
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:56,008
She wasn't a shaman.

696
00:30:56,378 --> 00:30:58,478
I didn't have many chances to talk to her.

697
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:01,918
But I was a bit curious.

698
00:31:03,048 --> 00:31:04,168
- That suits you. - My gosh.

699
00:31:04,348 --> 00:31:06,818
- That's so cool. - Hold on. I feel so betrayed.

700
00:31:07,018 --> 00:31:08,157
- Wait. - I bet no one knew...

701
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,317
that I was an astrologer.

702
00:31:09,318 --> 00:31:10,617
- Not an astrologer. - Did you know?

703
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,958
- I never even imagined. - No.

704
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:14,727
Right. I did say you were the hardest to figure out.

705
00:31:14,728 --> 00:31:16,368
- You were the hardest one. - Actually...

706
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:18,768
(She manages to fool the shamans.)

707
00:31:18,998 --> 00:31:21,298
No one guessed my job.

708
00:31:21,368 --> 00:31:23,668
No one could have guessed that I was an astrologer.

709
00:31:23,868 --> 00:31:26,668
Everyone was surprised and didn't see it coming.

710
00:31:26,738 --> 00:31:30,208
They said they felt betrayed and it was a huge surprise.

711
00:31:32,048 --> 00:31:33,078
I was like, "Score."

712
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:35,818
It was the kind of reaction I was waiting for.

713
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:38,087
Gosh, I'm also curious...

714
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:39,917
how things will change after disclosing their jobs.

715
00:31:39,918 --> 00:31:41,018
That's right.

716
00:31:41,088 --> 00:31:42,728
It will be a series of confusing moments.

717
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:44,627
Things seem to be going well so far.

718
00:31:44,628 --> 00:31:49,628
They are just getting to know one another.

719
00:31:49,928 --> 00:31:52,128
Now, the Gold Dragon...

720
00:31:52,528 --> 00:31:54,797
- will show up in a bit. - Oh, my.

721
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:56,478
- Oh, my. - The real game is starting now.

722
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:58,868
- How will it go once he arrives? - The Gold Dragon.

723
00:31:59,438 --> 00:32:01,208
This is the critical moment now.

724
00:32:01,238 --> 00:32:04,478
I can't wait to see the dynamics getting messy. But at the same time,

725
00:32:04,678 --> 00:32:06,948
I'm like, "No! Don't show up."

726
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:09,878
Is the Gold Dragon also a shaman?

727
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:12,047
It'd be crazy if he's also a shaman.

728
00:32:12,048 --> 00:32:13,087
I can't wait to find out.

729
00:32:13,088 --> 00:32:15,248
(What kind of fortune teller will the Gold Dragon be?)

730
00:32:16,488 --> 00:32:20,628
(They finish sharing about their occupations.)

731
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:23,798
(Startled)

732
00:32:25,828 --> 00:32:26,928
That was sudden.

733
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:29,337
Are we going to the Hall of Sacred Spirits again?

734
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:30,368
(An unstable gaze)

735
00:32:30,998 --> 00:32:33,338
The door to the Hall of Sacred Spirits has opened.

736
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,078
- Stop it. - That's...

737
00:32:35,378 --> 00:32:37,654
- This is making me so nervous. - We'll go right after this?

738
00:32:37,678 --> 00:32:39,608
Please take turns to visit the Hall.

739
00:32:42,148 --> 00:32:43,177
- Have some snacks. - Okay.

740
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:44,778
(It's time to make a choice once again.)

741
00:32:45,518 --> 00:32:47,088
I'm surprised by your job.

742
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:49,018
- Mine? - Yes.

743
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,318
I'm quite surprised.

744
00:32:50,518 --> 00:32:51,934
I tried so hard to hide it. Seriously.

745
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:53,527
- I tried... - You saw how shocked I was, right?

746
00:32:53,528 --> 00:32:56,858
I tried so hard not to have an intense gaze.

747
00:32:58,028 --> 00:33:00,108
Then do you have a lot of amethyst crystals at home?

748
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:02,037
I have crystals of many kinds.

749
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:03,038
- I see. Really? - I have a white crystal too.

750
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,437
I have one that's quite big and high quality.

751
00:33:05,438 --> 00:33:06,767
That's so expensive.

752
00:33:06,768 --> 00:33:08,708
- I splurged on one. - You did?

753
00:33:08,838 --> 00:33:12,077
I also meditate and practice spirituality.

754
00:33:12,078 --> 00:33:13,807
(Everyone is busy sharing about their jobs.)

755
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:15,018
That's what I do mostly.

756
00:33:15,648 --> 00:33:18,017
(Byeong Yeol is the only one who comes back to the room.)

757
00:33:18,018 --> 00:33:19,888
Gosh, this is crazy.

758
00:33:21,088 --> 00:33:23,258
(Drained)

759
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,258
(He's quite shocked from the revelation of their jobs.)

760
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,658
Byeong Yeol. Come on.

761
00:33:27,998 --> 00:33:29,657
- He's lying down, all tired. - Gosh.

762
00:33:29,658 --> 00:33:31,778
- Byeong Yeol. He's in bed, tired. - He's lying down.

763
00:33:31,828 --> 00:33:34,668
- Maybe, he should go to sleep soon. - What if his body aches tomorrow?

764
00:33:37,068 --> 00:33:41,638
(Yu Ra is the first one to leave the house.)

765
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:47,107
(Everyone except for Byeong Yeol is in the dining room.)

766
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,177
It feels so liberating...

767
00:33:48,178 --> 00:33:49,178
- now that our jobs are disclosed. - Right.

768
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:50,394
- This is great. - It's liberating.

769
00:33:50,418 --> 00:33:52,258
- It's liberating. I love it. - This is great.

770
00:33:52,418 --> 00:33:54,187
You know, I kept trying...

771
00:33:54,188 --> 00:33:55,257
to take care of other people...

772
00:33:55,258 --> 00:33:56,287
- since yesterday. - Yes.

773
00:33:56,288 --> 00:33:58,827
- That's how my grandmother was. - Your grandmother?

774
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,388
- Your spiritual grandmother? - Really?

775
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:04,128
(Staring)

776
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:07,198
Now that the secret is out, you're wearing your bracelet.

777
00:34:07,998 --> 00:34:09,338
Because we all revealed our jobs?

778
00:34:09,638 --> 00:34:12,308
(Hyeon U's spiritual bracelet)

779
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:16,454
- I see. There's such a thing? - That's a spiritual bracelet?

780
00:34:16,478 --> 00:34:18,177
We wouldn't know what it is even if we see it.

781
00:34:18,178 --> 00:34:19,577
- Right. - But they all know what it is.

782
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:20,608
It looks nice, though.

783
00:34:21,618 --> 00:34:22,777
They seem at ease...

784
00:34:22,778 --> 00:34:24,218
- after revealing their jobs. - Yes.

785
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:26,748
- That's right. - They must've felt some pressure.

786
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:30,058
Everyone. Actually, this is my spiritual ring.

787
00:34:30,758 --> 00:34:31,788
Really?

788
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:33,527
The ring of the spiritual fairy.

789
00:34:33,528 --> 00:34:35,774
(They share shamanistic accessories they've been hiding.)

790
00:34:35,798 --> 00:34:37,558
After sharing about our jobs,

791
00:34:37,728 --> 00:34:40,128
we don't have to restrain ourselves.

792
00:34:40,368 --> 00:34:43,137
That makes me feel comfortable. And I love that.

793
00:34:43,138 --> 00:34:44,767
When I was with the group,

794
00:34:44,768 --> 00:34:47,567
I wasn't sure if it was okay for me to speak up.

795
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:49,578
So I didn't talk much before.

796
00:34:49,778 --> 00:34:51,978
I feel comfortable now.

797
00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:54,378
Gosh, I feel so comfortable.

798
00:34:54,978 --> 00:34:56,817
- Seriously. - I had to watch what I said.

799
00:34:56,818 --> 00:34:59,019
(She doesn't feel nervous after sharing about her job.)

800
00:34:59,618 --> 00:35:01,388
All of us are shamans.

801
00:35:02,658 --> 00:35:03,658
- Yes. - That's right.

802
00:35:04,318 --> 00:35:05,328
Shamans.

803
00:35:06,988 --> 00:35:09,558
(There are five shamans.)

804
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,198
- I should hide. - Do you want to switch jobs?

805
00:35:14,798 --> 00:35:16,768
Byeong Yeol is lying down in bed now.

806
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,938
(Everyone has forgotten about him.)

807
00:35:21,138 --> 00:35:25,578
(He still can't get over the shock.)

808
00:35:26,878 --> 00:35:29,748
(Meanwhile, Yu Ra arrives at the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

809
00:35:35,888 --> 00:35:40,058
(To whom is she attracted to after a date and job introduction?)

810
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:44,228
(Jang Ho Am, Ha Byeong Yeol, Lee Gang Won, Jung Hyeon U)

811
00:35:45,328 --> 00:35:47,698
(She reaches out without hesitation.)

812
00:35:48,538 --> 00:35:50,738
I chose Byeong Yeol today.

813
00:35:52,668 --> 00:35:54,108
(Surprised)

814
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:55,538
After going on a date with him?

815
00:35:56,078 --> 00:35:58,978
- She chose Gang Won before. - Right.

816
00:35:59,678 --> 00:36:00,948
(Surprised)

817
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:03,077
- This shows dates are important. - They are.

818
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,148
Right.

819
00:36:06,188 --> 00:36:09,418
(She had her first date with Byeong Yeol.)

820
00:36:10,058 --> 00:36:14,357
(The two of them shared fragrances that were suitable for each other.)

821
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:17,128
After going on a date with him,

822
00:36:17,428 --> 00:36:19,598
I could feel more that he was a good person.

823
00:36:19,828 --> 00:36:23,168
I think he's someone I can trust.

824
00:36:23,498 --> 00:36:24,538
So I picked him.

825
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:26,337
(Day 2's Selection)

826
00:36:26,338 --> 00:36:29,078
(Hong Yu Ra chooses Ha Byeong Yeol.)

827
00:36:29,138 --> 00:36:32,748
(Tonight, Yu Ra's heart was drawn to Byeong Yeol.)

828
00:36:33,148 --> 00:36:35,748
(Meanwhile, Byeong Yeol is exhausted.)

829
00:36:36,948 --> 00:36:38,388
(Getting up)

830
00:36:39,918 --> 00:36:41,788
My gosh, this is crazy.

831
00:36:43,588 --> 00:36:45,528
Goodness. Unbelievable.

832
00:36:46,058 --> 00:36:48,998
(He's still in shock that there are 5 shamans.)

833
00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:54,268
Gosh, this is just crazy.

834
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:02,308
He's utterly shocked right now.

835
00:37:02,608 --> 00:37:04,008
- He looks so drawn. - Right.

836
00:37:05,878 --> 00:37:08,008
(This is so funny.)

837
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:13,147
(He comes to the Hall of Sacred Spirits...)

838
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,718
(in the midst of confusion.)

839
00:37:20,328 --> 00:37:22,158
(Sighing)

840
00:37:26,568 --> 00:37:30,438
(His smile disappears as he stands in front of the name plaques.)

841
00:37:33,938 --> 00:37:35,677
(Lee Ra Yun, Hong Yu Ra, Kim Yun Jeong, Chae Yu Gyeong)

842
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:37,778
I walked into the Hall of Sacred Spirits...

843
00:37:37,978 --> 00:37:40,408
without feeling certain about my own feelings.

844
00:37:42,048 --> 00:37:45,088
"I can't believe that I still have to pick someone."

845
00:37:46,688 --> 00:37:49,088
That's what I was thinking mostly. I was confused, actually.

846
00:37:52,928 --> 00:37:59,768
(Whom has Byeong Yeol chosen while being in this confused state?)

847
00:38:02,868 --> 00:38:07,168
(Ra Yun is in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

848
00:38:12,608 --> 00:38:18,547
(A particular name plaque grabs her eyes.)

849
00:38:18,548 --> 00:38:19,787
(Lee Gang Won)

850
00:38:19,788 --> 00:38:25,588
(Lee Ra Yun chooses Lee Gang Won.)

851
00:38:27,028 --> 00:38:28,728
I was quite happy with today.

852
00:38:29,758 --> 00:38:34,028
Gang Won was very accommodating. So it might be tough on him.

853
00:38:34,328 --> 00:38:37,238
But thanks to his effort, I was very happy.

854
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:39,838
I'll keep enjoying my happy mood for today.

855
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:44,578
I didn't even have to think about it before entering the Hall.

856
00:38:46,478 --> 00:38:48,418
I was only attracted to one person.

857
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:50,948
It was Ra Yun. I decided to continue picking her.

858
00:38:51,348 --> 00:38:53,288
That's what I thought, so I chose her.

859
00:38:53,448 --> 00:38:57,588
(Lee Gang Won chooses Lee Ra Yun.)

860
00:38:58,288 --> 00:39:00,027
- My gosh. - Oh, my. These two...

861
00:39:00,028 --> 00:39:01,697
- Look at these two. - They keep choosing each other.

862
00:39:01,698 --> 00:39:03,228
- They're going to bond well. - Yes.

863
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:05,897
I wonder if there will come a day when Ra Yun won't choose him.

864
00:39:05,898 --> 00:39:07,827
I'll be really shocked if that happens.

865
00:39:07,828 --> 00:39:10,268
- Something sad must've happened. - Right.

866
00:39:15,108 --> 00:39:19,108
(Yun Jeong arrives at the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

867
00:39:26,388 --> 00:39:27,517
(Jung Hyeon U)

868
00:39:27,518 --> 00:39:29,187
I thought about...

869
00:39:29,188 --> 00:39:31,148
what kind of chemistry I would have with Hyeon U.

870
00:39:32,688 --> 00:39:34,288
I think that's why I was...

871
00:39:34,788 --> 00:39:37,958
quite proactive around him this morning.

872
00:39:39,428 --> 00:39:42,568
(She approached him first before the first date.)

873
00:39:43,398 --> 00:39:44,938
(I'll choose him.)

874
00:39:46,338 --> 00:39:49,608
(I picked this one because I thought it'd be Hyeon U.)

875
00:39:51,908 --> 00:39:56,278
(But she saw Ho Am on the date.)

876
00:39:56,378 --> 00:39:57,478
(Jung Hyeon U)

877
00:39:58,918 --> 00:40:00,588
(Jang Ho Am)

878
00:40:04,618 --> 00:40:07,828
First of all, Ho Am is cute.

879
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:12,027
When I first met him,

880
00:40:12,028 --> 00:40:14,298
he looked like someone from a different world.

881
00:40:14,468 --> 00:40:16,137
I didn't think I would be interested in him.

882
00:40:16,138 --> 00:40:17,568
I was closed off.

883
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:20,537
But we found things in common and I became comfortable around him.

884
00:40:20,538 --> 00:40:23,107
It was definitely a new kind of feeling...

885
00:40:23,108 --> 00:40:25,948
and experience.

886
00:40:26,448 --> 00:40:27,478
So...

887
00:40:28,618 --> 00:40:31,048
the date with him was quite refreshing.

888
00:40:31,618 --> 00:40:33,217
- What? - Oh, my.

889
00:40:33,218 --> 00:40:35,958
(Her date with Ho Am left a good impression.)

890
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:38,487
- Don't they make a great couple? - They do.

891
00:40:38,488 --> 00:40:40,227
- When I watched the show at home, - Yes.

892
00:40:40,228 --> 00:40:42,197
I thought these two made the best couple.

893
00:40:42,198 --> 00:40:44,158
When they're together, they feel at ease.

894
00:40:49,438 --> 00:40:55,038
(To whom did her heart lean?)

895
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:59,978
Right. I think that brings the biggest joy.

896
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,617
Did you have friends who were shamans?

897
00:41:03,618 --> 00:41:05,487
- Like friends? - I didn't have any shaman friends.

898
00:41:05,488 --> 00:41:07,018
- Actually, I... - Same here.

899
00:41:07,518 --> 00:41:09,857
Only got my fortune read once or something.

900
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:10,917
Really?

901
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:12,838
My spiritual father didn't even read my fortune.

902
00:41:14,328 --> 00:41:16,197
I don't know any shamans...

903
00:41:16,198 --> 00:41:17,827
except for my spiritual father.

904
00:41:17,828 --> 00:41:19,588
- Really? - I don't have any shaman friends.

905
00:41:19,628 --> 00:41:21,428
I'm not acquainted with other shamans either.

906
00:41:21,498 --> 00:41:24,768
Actually, I wanted to talk to you today.

907
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:27,308
- Really? - Yes. After revealing our jobs.

908
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:29,837
I can sense that you're a calm person.

909
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:30,878
But from what I felt,

910
00:41:30,978 --> 00:41:33,908
you're calm, yet very certain about yourself.

911
00:41:34,378 --> 00:41:36,377
You speak calmly and slowly.

912
00:41:36,378 --> 00:41:38,048
But I can sense from your eyes...

913
00:41:38,218 --> 00:41:42,418
that you wholeheartedly trust and follow your divine spirit.

914
00:41:42,588 --> 00:41:44,988
- I can clearly feel that from you. - I see.

915
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:46,857
I felt that from other shamans too,

916
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:48,404
but I felt that strongly particularly from you.

917
00:41:48,428 --> 00:41:50,157
Your calm disposition helps you...

918
00:41:50,158 --> 00:41:51,898
- treat people more respectfully. - Right.

919
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:54,628
So I wanted to talk to you.

920
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:57,967
Hearing about the divine spirit is making me tear up.

921
00:41:57,968 --> 00:42:00,538
- Why? - It must be because I'm still new.

922
00:42:01,038 --> 00:42:04,308
- You're so cute. My gosh. - I'm still learning.

923
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:07,928
- Is Yu Gyeong flirting with him? - I hear that's women in love say.

924
00:42:09,148 --> 00:42:10,868
- She's comforting and sympathizing. - Yes.

925
00:42:11,248 --> 00:42:12,517
I think she's treating him...

926
00:42:12,518 --> 00:42:13,818
- like her junior. - Yes.

927
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,657
You can never lower your guard...

928
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,388
- in this house. - This is huge.

929
00:42:17,918 --> 00:42:19,458
- My gosh. What... - Yes.

930
00:42:19,758 --> 00:42:21,457
This is a date too.

931
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,298
- It's just the two of them. - My gosh. Right.

932
00:42:27,298 --> 00:42:28,967
- You're so cute. - Hearing about the divine spirit...

933
00:42:28,968 --> 00:42:30,667
- is making me tear up. - My gosh.

934
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:32,468
It must be because I'm still new.

935
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,367
- You're so cute. - Hearing about the divine spirit...

936
00:42:34,368 --> 00:42:35,738
- is making me tear up. - My gosh.

937
00:42:39,678 --> 00:42:41,318
I've never had this kind of conversation.

938
00:42:41,978 --> 00:42:43,078
Really?

939
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,548
This is fascinating. This is new.

940
00:42:47,918 --> 00:42:49,357
Only shamans can understand this.

941
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,818
- Totally. - This is so precious.

942
00:42:51,188 --> 00:42:52,588
No one but shamans gets this.

943
00:42:54,028 --> 00:42:55,927
(Ho Am heads to the Hall of Sacred Spirits...)

944
00:42:55,928 --> 00:42:57,828
(after talking to Yu Gyeong.)

945
00:43:06,538 --> 00:43:09,708
(He's standing before the name plaques.)

946
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:12,307
(Chae Yu Gyeong)

947
00:43:12,308 --> 00:43:15,718
Yu Gyeong is a shaman. I was happy to meet another shaman.

948
00:43:16,278 --> 00:43:17,477
"Gosh, she's a shaman."

949
00:43:17,478 --> 00:43:20,087
I thought there could be more things we could talk about...

950
00:43:20,088 --> 00:43:21,547
and relate to.

951
00:43:21,548 --> 00:43:23,358
That crossed my mind.

952
00:43:23,888 --> 00:43:28,258
(Then another name plaque grabs Ho Am's eyes.)

953
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:30,158
(Chae Yu Gyeong)

954
00:43:30,258 --> 00:43:32,197
(Kim Yun Jeong)

955
00:43:32,198 --> 00:43:35,938
I didn't know I'd feel attracted to Yun Jeong on the date.

956
00:43:36,668 --> 00:43:38,337
Once I went on a date with her and she and I started talking,

957
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:39,938
it was different.

958
00:43:40,338 --> 00:43:42,207
I often feel a sense of emptiness...

959
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:43,738
and loneliness.

960
00:43:43,978 --> 00:43:47,478
She and I could relate to one another with that.

961
00:43:47,778 --> 00:43:50,148
That affected my emotions the most.

962
00:43:54,848 --> 00:43:59,128
(Ho Am makes his decision after much deliberation.)

963
00:44:01,728 --> 00:44:06,628
(To whom did his heart lean tonight?)

964
00:44:07,328 --> 00:44:08,738
Why won't they show us?

965
00:44:10,938 --> 00:44:12,108
I'm curious.

966
00:44:12,738 --> 00:44:14,467
Seon Ho got angry for real during the filming...

967
00:44:14,468 --> 00:44:16,178
because the staff didn't reveal it.

968
00:44:16,678 --> 00:44:18,277
We'll get to see it anyway. Why can't you just show us now?

969
00:44:18,278 --> 00:44:19,798
- You said the show moved fast. - Yes.

970
00:44:21,308 --> 00:44:25,288
(Yu Gyeong arrives at the Hall of Sacred Spirits next.)

971
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:30,458
(She checks everyone's name plaque one after another.)

972
00:44:32,328 --> 00:44:37,028
(She's deep in thought.)

973
00:44:38,098 --> 00:44:41,068
Actually, two things came to mind.

974
00:44:41,498 --> 00:44:43,798
"Should I pick Byeong Yeol?"

975
00:44:44,338 --> 00:44:47,638
"Should I pick Hyeon U?" I was torn between the two.

976
00:44:48,678 --> 00:44:50,107
Byeong Yeol is the one...

977
00:44:50,108 --> 00:44:51,948
I'm attracted to and want to get to know more.

978
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:56,478
But the one I spent a fun day with was Hyeon U.

979
00:44:58,078 --> 00:45:00,988
(After the job introduction, he also grabs her eyes.)

980
00:45:01,348 --> 00:45:03,387
As for Ho Am,

981
00:45:03,388 --> 00:45:05,427
after sharing about our jobs...

982
00:45:05,428 --> 00:45:07,188
and having the chance to talk to him,

983
00:45:07,388 --> 00:45:10,158
I thought that he was thoughtful and calm.

984
00:45:10,258 --> 00:45:13,128
Afterward, I became curious about his inner side.

985
00:45:13,268 --> 00:45:16,238
I thought that I could be quite attracted to him.

986
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,937
(Jang Ho Am)

987
00:45:17,938 --> 00:45:23,707
(Her mind is filled with thoughts of these three men.)

988
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:25,008
(Jung Hyeon U)

989
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:31,818
(Whom did she choose?)

990
00:45:37,618 --> 00:45:39,558
- My gosh. - Goodness.

991
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:41,457
Whom did she pick?

992
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:42,757
It has to be Ho Am for sure. No?

993
00:45:42,758 --> 00:45:44,298
- You think so? - Really?

994
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:45,927
But she went on a date with Hyeon U.

995
00:45:45,928 --> 00:45:47,828
She had a good time with him.

996
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,897
- I'm so curious. - Right.

997
00:45:49,898 --> 00:45:51,938
- They won't show us the results. - I have no idea.

998
00:45:52,868 --> 00:45:56,608
(Hyeon U is also at the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

999
00:45:57,938 --> 00:46:00,308
Should I choose someone I'm curious about?

1000
00:46:04,018 --> 00:46:06,847
Or should I choose the one...

1001
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:09,688
I had a great time with on the date today?

1002
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:14,257
I thought that choosing the one I went on a date with today...

1003
00:46:14,258 --> 00:46:17,198
was the right choice. So I chose Yu Gyeong.

1004
00:46:17,998 --> 00:46:24,298
(Jung Hyeon U chooses Chae Yu Gyeong.)

1005
00:46:24,798 --> 00:46:28,608
(Everyone has finished making their choice for Day 2.)

1006
00:46:38,118 --> 00:46:40,688
(Gang Won receives a text message.)

1007
00:46:41,518 --> 00:46:45,488
(Tonight, the Black Horse chose you.)

1008
00:46:46,128 --> 00:46:50,258
I got the text message that the Black Horse chose me.

1009
00:46:51,328 --> 00:46:52,968
I think it's Ra Yun.

1010
00:46:54,198 --> 00:46:56,738
(Earlier in Hall of Sacred Spirits, )

1011
00:46:57,798 --> 00:47:00,768
(Ra Yun chose Gang Won without hesitation.)

1012
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:04,307
(Ra Yun is...)

1013
00:47:04,308 --> 00:47:05,877
(Black Horse, April 21, 1995)

1014
00:47:05,878 --> 00:47:09,348
(Black Horse, Lee Ra Yun)

1015
00:47:11,218 --> 00:47:12,948
That's why we choose again?

1016
00:47:14,718 --> 00:47:15,718
What?

1017
00:47:17,758 --> 00:47:20,457
(Tonight, the White Monkey chose you.)

1018
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:24,328
- What? - Did you receive a text?

1019
00:47:24,628 --> 00:47:26,297
- What? - I received a text.

1020
00:47:26,298 --> 00:47:27,368
Someone chose me.

1021
00:47:27,668 --> 00:47:28,668
Really?

1022
00:47:29,998 --> 00:47:32,437
(Ra Yun reads the text again.)

1023
00:47:32,438 --> 00:47:33,438
What's this?

1024
00:47:33,439 --> 00:47:35,068
(Smiling)

1025
00:47:47,648 --> 00:47:53,688
(Tonight, no one chose you in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1026
00:47:56,198 --> 00:47:58,427
(No one chose Yu Ra.)

1027
00:47:58,428 --> 00:48:00,798
- Oh, my. - She must have many thoughts.

1028
00:48:01,898 --> 00:48:04,338
Does it mean Byeong Yeol chose someone else?

1029
00:48:06,338 --> 00:48:07,707
- It's fine for now. - There's tomorrow.

1030
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:09,808
- Right. - It'll keep changing.

1031
00:48:11,238 --> 00:48:13,348
But still...

1032
00:48:15,278 --> 00:48:16,848
To some extent,

1033
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:21,888
I thought, "That can happen."

1034
00:48:23,918 --> 00:48:27,188
(Byeong Yeol who went out with her today didn't choose her.)

1035
00:48:28,388 --> 00:48:30,357
It was a little hard.

1036
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:31,358
When we talked,

1037
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:35,668
it seemed we were trying hard.

1038
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:38,908
I thought...

1039
00:48:40,338 --> 00:48:42,738
she might not be compatible with me.

1040
00:48:43,478 --> 00:48:46,948
That's why I didn't choose her.

1041
00:48:47,678 --> 00:48:50,348
(During their date today)

1042
00:48:51,148 --> 00:48:53,247
Do you think it's easy to read my mind?

1043
00:48:53,248 --> 00:48:55,018
Or is it hard?

1044
00:48:55,118 --> 00:48:56,118
- Your mind? - Yes.

1045
00:48:56,388 --> 00:48:57,388
I can't read it.

1046
00:49:01,028 --> 00:49:03,057
I don't know what you're thinking.

1047
00:49:03,058 --> 00:49:04,257
You don't?

1048
00:49:04,258 --> 00:49:05,827
It means you feel uncomfortable.

1049
00:49:05,828 --> 00:49:07,174
- Because at first, - "Uncomfortable?"

1050
00:49:07,198 --> 00:49:09,837
it can make you curious and excited,

1051
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:11,298
which is a positive feeling.

1052
00:49:11,998 --> 00:49:13,814
But it'd be uncomfortable if you kept feeling that way.

1053
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:15,038
Is that so?

1054
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:18,377
When you're in a relationship...

1055
00:49:18,378 --> 00:49:20,508
with someone,

1056
00:49:20,908 --> 00:49:23,648
you enter...

1057
00:49:23,748 --> 00:49:25,417
each other's...

1058
00:49:25,418 --> 00:49:27,118
- space. - Yes.

1059
00:49:27,518 --> 00:49:30,118
The closer you are to each other, the more careful you should be,

1060
00:49:30,388 --> 00:49:32,987
but it's also important to show your true self...

1061
00:49:32,988 --> 00:49:35,158
- and understand each other. - Yes.

1062
00:49:36,958 --> 00:49:38,657
(I see.)

1063
00:49:38,658 --> 00:49:41,398
Right. They didn't joke around.

1064
00:49:41,598 --> 00:49:42,767
They had feelings,

1065
00:49:42,768 --> 00:49:44,668
- but they didn't get along well. - Right.

1066
00:49:44,868 --> 00:49:46,208
It's tough.

1067
00:49:48,338 --> 00:49:54,378
(They were together, but they had different thoughts.)

1068
00:49:55,748 --> 00:49:59,388
(Meanwhile, someone is exercising on the 1st floor at night.)

1069
00:50:03,258 --> 00:50:07,388
(Hyeon U also received a text.)

1070
00:50:08,728 --> 00:50:13,198
(Tonight, the Black Monkey chose you.)

1071
00:50:14,028 --> 00:50:16,468
(Nodding)

1072
00:50:17,668 --> 00:50:21,667
(Yu Gyeong came back to her room.)

1073
00:50:21,668 --> 00:50:22,678
How was your day?

1074
00:50:22,778 --> 00:50:24,378
- Today? The date? - Yes.

1075
00:50:24,778 --> 00:50:29,017
I haven't really talked...

1076
00:50:29,018 --> 00:50:30,918
with Hyeon U.

1077
00:50:32,248 --> 00:50:34,517
So I wasn't sure if we would have good chemistry.

1078
00:50:34,518 --> 00:50:37,588
Surprisingly, we communicated well...

1079
00:50:38,658 --> 00:50:41,957
and had many similar interests.

1080
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:42,958
- Oh, my. - Yes.

1081
00:50:43,758 --> 00:50:45,028
And he's a shaman.

1082
00:50:45,528 --> 00:50:46,998
(That's funny.)

1083
00:50:47,698 --> 00:50:49,038
You'll be able to get closer.

1084
00:50:49,468 --> 00:50:51,698
Yes. But for now,

1085
00:50:52,098 --> 00:50:54,368
it's not like my heart flutters.

1086
00:50:54,868 --> 00:50:56,268
I just feel comfortable around him.

1087
00:51:01,078 --> 00:51:05,418
(Meanwhile, Yu Gyeong received a text.)

1088
00:51:06,788 --> 00:51:07,987
(Tonight, the Blue Chicken chose you.)

1089
00:51:07,988 --> 00:51:08,988
Who is it?

1090
00:51:19,228 --> 00:51:20,828
Who do you want to go out with tomorrow?

1091
00:51:21,268 --> 00:51:22,428
Who do I want to go out with?

1092
00:51:22,768 --> 00:51:23,768
Byeong Yeol.

1093
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:25,338
- Oh, right. Byeong Yeol. - Yes.

1094
00:51:26,538 --> 00:51:28,308
Even though...

1095
00:51:30,308 --> 00:51:33,048
I know his job, I don't know what kind of person he is at all.

1096
00:51:34,078 --> 00:51:36,347
"What kind of thoughts..."

1097
00:51:36,348 --> 00:51:37,978
"and perception does he have?"

1098
00:51:38,578 --> 00:51:40,488
He makes me curious.

1099
00:51:41,448 --> 00:51:43,518
So I'd like to talk with him...

1100
00:51:44,288 --> 00:51:46,628
and get to know him.

1101
00:51:48,558 --> 00:51:50,928
Even if we can't go out on a date,

1102
00:51:51,498 --> 00:51:54,468
I think I'll try to find time to talk with him.

1103
00:51:55,398 --> 00:51:57,968
- That's nice. - Yes. If I have a chance.

1104
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:03,638
(Yu Ra and Yu Gyeong want to know what Byeong Yeol is thinking.)

1105
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:05,437
(Meanwhile, Byeong Yeol knows nothing.)

1106
00:52:05,438 --> 00:52:08,148
(Rustling)

1107
00:52:09,018 --> 00:52:12,318
(He's writing a gratitude journal to wrap up the day.)

1108
00:52:15,688 --> 00:52:16,688
What is this?

1109
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:22,458
(Tonight, the Blue Chicken chose you.)

1110
00:52:23,128 --> 00:52:24,627
(The unexpected text makes him laugh.)

1111
00:52:24,628 --> 00:52:25,728
Really?

1112
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:33,208
What? Isn't the Blue Chicken Hyeon U?

1113
00:52:35,308 --> 00:52:36,377
(Extremely confused)

1114
00:52:36,378 --> 00:52:37,538
Hold on.

1115
00:52:37,638 --> 00:52:38,918
- Hold on. - He's right, though.

1116
00:52:39,048 --> 00:52:40,377
Hyeon U is the Blue Chicken as well.

1117
00:52:40,378 --> 00:52:41,378
- Right. - Yes.

1118
00:52:41,379 --> 00:52:43,647
I guess there's one more Blue Chicken.

1119
00:52:43,648 --> 00:52:44,648
- I see. - I see.

1120
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,087
That was crazy.

1121
00:52:46,088 --> 00:52:47,848
You don't have prejudice.

1122
00:52:48,118 --> 00:52:49,687
We talked about first experiences.

1123
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:51,658
- This could've been the first time. - I know.

1124
00:52:51,758 --> 00:52:54,328
- You don't know what will happen. - You never know.

1125
00:52:54,888 --> 00:52:57,197
I thought Yu Ra...

1126
00:52:57,198 --> 00:52:59,968
would be the Blue Chicken.

1127
00:53:01,798 --> 00:53:03,138
She's usually quiet.

1128
00:53:03,238 --> 00:53:05,168
So it was hard to read her mind.

1129
00:53:05,368 --> 00:53:08,638
That's why I thought she'd be the Blue Chicken.

1130
00:53:09,238 --> 00:53:10,538
It didn't make me...

1131
00:53:10,838 --> 00:53:13,378
want to try to make things work with her.

1132
00:53:14,748 --> 00:53:19,748
(Blue Chicken, Hong Yu Ra)

1133
00:53:21,018 --> 00:53:24,888
(Meanwhile, Ho Am is ready to go to bed.)

1134
00:53:28,688 --> 00:53:29,827
(Ringing)

1135
00:53:29,828 --> 00:53:33,098
(He's going to sleep with the bells.)

1136
00:53:33,898 --> 00:53:36,268
(Precious)

1137
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:48,507
(Tonight, the White Dog chose you.)

1138
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:51,348
When I received a text that the White Dog chose me,

1139
00:53:52,078 --> 00:53:53,148
it felt good.

1140
00:53:53,418 --> 00:53:55,618
I wondered who the White Dog was.

1141
00:53:57,218 --> 00:54:00,228
I think Yun Jeong is the White Dog.

1142
00:54:04,358 --> 00:54:05,698
Or Yu Gyeong?

1143
00:54:06,398 --> 00:54:08,297
(White Dog, November 4, 1997)

1144
00:54:08,298 --> 00:54:10,238
I'm not sure.

1145
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,738
(Who is the White Dog that chose Ho Am tonight?)

1146
00:54:18,278 --> 00:54:19,348
I didn't receive a text.

1147
00:54:19,978 --> 00:54:20,978
You didn't?

1148
00:54:22,048 --> 00:54:23,328
Will they send a message 1 by 1?

1149
00:54:24,278 --> 00:54:26,238
- One by one? - Will they send a text one by one?

1150
00:54:26,818 --> 00:54:28,118
They text people individually.

1151
00:54:29,718 --> 00:54:32,658
Why don't you wait a little? I received the text just now.

1152
00:54:33,788 --> 00:54:35,557
I'll take a shower.

1153
00:54:35,558 --> 00:54:37,027
(While Ra Yun is taking a shower, )

1154
00:54:37,028 --> 00:54:40,528
(Yun Jeong is left alone.)

1155
00:54:42,468 --> 00:54:46,668
(She's still waiting for the text she didn't receive yet.)

1156
00:54:52,548 --> 00:54:55,248
(She received the text she was waiting for.)

1157
00:54:58,118 --> 00:55:00,117
(Tonight, the Black Cow chose you.)

1158
00:55:00,118 --> 00:55:02,147
(Tonight, the White Chicken chose you.)

1159
00:55:02,148 --> 00:55:06,588
(Tonight, the Gold Dragon chose you.)

1160
00:55:07,058 --> 00:55:08,127
(She received three texts at once.)

1161
00:55:08,128 --> 00:55:09,288
- What? - She received three.

1162
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:11,678
- Including the Dragon. - Including the Gold Dragon.

1163
00:55:11,998 --> 00:55:14,668
Ho Am, Byeong Yeol, and the Gold Dragon.

1164
00:55:14,768 --> 00:55:16,068
It's three people.

1165
00:55:16,568 --> 00:55:17,568
My gosh.

1166
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:19,708
She must be so curious.

1167
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,107
Yun Jeong doesn't know who the Gold Dragon is.

1168
00:55:23,108 --> 00:55:24,108
- She doesn't. - Right?

1169
00:55:24,109 --> 00:55:26,477
She might think Ho Am might be...

1170
00:55:26,478 --> 00:55:28,007
- the Gold Dragon. - She might think so.

1171
00:55:28,008 --> 00:55:29,347
- Right. - She didn't get a text from him.

1172
00:55:29,348 --> 00:55:31,017
And she received a text from the Dragon after going out with him.

1173
00:55:31,018 --> 00:55:32,077
She might think...

1174
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,147
- Ho Am is the Gold Dragon. - Yes. She could think that way.

1175
00:55:33,148 --> 00:55:35,147
The Gold Dragon will come later.

1176
00:55:35,148 --> 00:55:36,717
- He didn't appear yet, - But she doesn't know.

1177
00:55:36,718 --> 00:55:37,857
- but she doesn't know. - She doesn't know.

1178
00:55:37,858 --> 00:55:38,858
She doesn't know,

1179
00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:40,419
so she'll think it's one of the guys...

1180
00:55:40,958 --> 00:55:43,097
- and that it's destiny. - No. Don't do that.

1181
00:55:43,098 --> 00:55:45,997
She'll have many thoughts.

1182
00:55:45,998 --> 00:55:46,998
- Right? - Yes.

1183
00:55:47,798 --> 00:55:49,898
- This is interesting. - This is interesting.

1184
00:55:50,968 --> 00:55:51,968
It's destiny.

1185
00:55:53,668 --> 00:55:55,008
(Getting up)

1186
00:55:55,708 --> 00:55:58,277
(She received a text from the Gold Dragon...)

1187
00:55:58,278 --> 00:56:00,278
(she was desperately looking for.)

1188
00:56:00,948 --> 00:56:02,047
(Sighing)

1189
00:56:02,048 --> 00:56:03,748
Who is it?

1190
00:56:07,688 --> 00:56:08,788
The Gold Dragon...

1191
00:56:21,698 --> 00:56:24,568
I still can't believe that the Gold Dragon chose me.

1192
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:30,078
First of all, I was surprised by myself.

1193
00:56:31,508 --> 00:56:34,777
(Tonight, the Gold Dragon chose Yun Jeong.)

1194
00:56:34,778 --> 00:56:36,517
(Gold Dragon, August 20, 1992)

1195
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:40,048
It was nice that I received a text from someone I wanted.

1196
00:56:40,148 --> 00:56:41,348
But three people chose me.

1197
00:56:41,448 --> 00:56:43,188
I started to get more confused.

1198
00:56:46,758 --> 00:56:48,988
Will I be able to find the Gold Dragon?

1199
00:56:59,768 --> 00:57:00,768
(The first morning...)

1200
00:57:00,769 --> 00:57:03,838
(after their occupations were revealed)

1201
00:57:05,738 --> 00:57:08,978
(Hyeon U is the first one to wake up.)

1202
00:57:14,918 --> 00:57:19,158
(He finds a nice place in the garden without hesitation.)

1203
00:57:23,828 --> 00:57:28,428
(He politely prays.)

1204
00:57:41,608 --> 00:57:45,018
(He lights the incense skilfully.)

1205
00:57:47,188 --> 00:57:49,888
(He even takes off his shoes.)

1206
00:57:53,488 --> 00:57:57,558
(He starts praying in earnest.)

1207
00:58:03,538 --> 00:58:04,568
(Breaking)

1208
00:58:07,938 --> 00:58:11,838
(He sincerely prays to the divine spirit.)

1209
00:58:13,308 --> 00:58:15,978
(Tears are falling.)

1210
00:58:18,178 --> 00:58:19,178
(What?)

1211
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:20,347
(Surprised)

1212
00:58:20,348 --> 00:58:21,348
What? Is he crying?

1213
00:58:22,918 --> 00:58:25,587
Is he repenting?

1214
00:58:25,588 --> 00:58:27,328
He couldn't do this...

1215
00:58:27,658 --> 00:58:28,938
before revealing his occupation.

1216
00:58:29,258 --> 00:58:31,457
- It's been two months only. - Yes.

1217
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:33,138
- Two months. - It's only been two months.

1218
00:58:33,498 --> 00:58:34,628
Was it caress?

1219
00:58:35,198 --> 00:58:36,397
- No. - "Caress?"

1220
00:58:36,398 --> 00:58:37,967
- No. - You mean, "rookie shaman?"

1221
00:58:37,968 --> 00:58:39,038
Dong Yeob.

1222
00:58:39,668 --> 00:58:41,637
Rookie shaman, was it?

1223
00:58:41,638 --> 00:58:43,108
- Rookie shaman. - Rookie shaman.

1224
00:58:43,378 --> 00:58:45,838
- "Caress?" What was that? - I thought I heard it wrong.

1225
00:58:45,908 --> 00:58:48,008
Rookie shaman.

1226
00:58:48,508 --> 00:58:49,518
Rookie shaman.

1227
00:58:49,918 --> 00:58:51,418
I got confused.

1228
00:58:51,678 --> 00:58:52,918
It's only been two months.

1229
00:58:53,718 --> 00:58:54,718
(Dizzy)

1230
00:58:54,718 --> 00:58:55,718
My goodness.

1231
00:58:55,719 --> 00:58:56,957
(They're making a fuss.)

1232
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:58,688
Rookie shaman.

1233
00:58:58,788 --> 00:58:59,828
He's a genius.

1234
00:59:00,928 --> 00:59:01,928
I was surprised.

1235
00:59:03,198 --> 00:59:07,328
(Meanwhile, the rookie shaman is praying peacefully.)

1236
00:59:07,568 --> 00:59:11,068
(While Hyeon U continues to train)

1237
00:59:12,908 --> 00:59:14,008
Did you not sleep well?

1238
00:59:14,208 --> 00:59:15,508
I slept well. I blacked out.

1239
00:59:15,638 --> 00:59:16,908
I'm glad to hear that.

1240
00:59:17,678 --> 00:59:19,408
Where is everyone?

1241
00:59:20,248 --> 00:59:21,278
They're making money.

1242
00:59:22,548 --> 00:59:23,577
What do you mean?

1243
00:59:23,578 --> 00:59:24,578
(They start talking by themselves in the morning.)

1244
00:59:24,578 --> 00:59:25,578
I don't know either.

1245
00:59:26,888 --> 00:59:27,888
How is your throat?

1246
00:59:28,448 --> 00:59:31,487
- I feel like dying. - You should drink warm water.

1247
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:34,458
Your throat isn't getting better because you keep drinking juice.

1248
00:59:36,328 --> 00:59:37,598
(Sighing)

1249
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:38,918
I'm going to tease you more.

1250
00:59:39,128 --> 00:59:40,367
I don't give up.

1251
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,528
You're so mean.

1252
00:59:43,368 --> 00:59:44,898
(What?)

1253
00:59:45,098 --> 00:59:46,167
(It seems something is going on between them.)

1254
00:59:46,168 --> 00:59:47,507
Did he catch a cold?

1255
00:59:47,508 --> 00:59:49,207
What's going on? Is it a newlyweds' house?

1256
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:50,637
- I think... - What's going on?

1257
00:59:50,638 --> 00:59:52,307
- there was some progression. - Yes.

1258
00:59:52,308 --> 00:59:53,447
What's going on? I guess he made everyone leave.

1259
00:59:53,448 --> 00:59:55,608
They must've done something where there was no camera.

1260
00:59:55,848 --> 00:59:56,878
What's going on?

1261
00:59:57,248 --> 00:59:59,277
If she catches a cold too, it means they kissed.

1262
00:59:59,278 --> 01:00:02,718
(We're not going to stay still if we catch you.)

1263
01:00:03,588 --> 01:00:05,718
I'm fine. I can do it.

1264
01:00:06,658 --> 01:00:07,957
You can't be sick.

1265
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:09,598
Aren't we going out on a date today?

1266
01:00:09,758 --> 01:00:11,958
If we go out on a date today,

1267
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:14,668
I'll never look at you while talking.

1268
01:00:14,728 --> 01:00:16,008
I don't want to give you a cold.

1269
01:00:16,198 --> 01:00:17,198
Why?

1270
01:00:17,598 --> 01:00:18,878
I don't want to give you a cold.

1271
01:00:19,098 --> 01:00:22,538
Give me a minute. Let me make something warm for you.

1272
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:25,878
You won't put yuzu syrup in cold water, right?

1273
01:00:26,078 --> 01:00:27,208
No.

1274
01:00:28,278 --> 01:00:30,348
You should drink warm water.

1275
01:00:30,478 --> 01:00:32,718
You must drink warm water when you have swollen tonsils.

1276
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:34,988
That's why you should've taken care of me.

1277
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,458
- What about you? - It's not my fault.

1278
01:00:37,858 --> 01:00:38,938
What are you talking about?

1279
01:00:39,828 --> 01:00:41,957
- It's really not my fault. - How old are you?

1280
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:42,958
(He jokes around with Ra Yun, using his cold as an excuse.)

1281
01:00:42,959 --> 01:00:45,498
You're too old to be taken care of.

1282
01:00:47,468 --> 01:00:48,768
Did you sleep well?

1283
01:00:49,068 --> 01:00:50,538
- Did you sleep well? - Yes.

1284
01:00:52,198 --> 01:00:55,538
(Something on the table catches their eyes.)

1285
01:00:56,738 --> 01:00:58,808
- Tiramisu? - Tiramisu cake

1286
01:01:00,048 --> 01:01:01,107
(Sweet heart-shaped tiramisu cakes)

1287
01:01:01,108 --> 01:01:02,407
It looks so good.

1288
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:04,418
The cakes are so cute.

1289
01:01:04,448 --> 01:01:05,817
- Who wants the heart spoon? - Me.

1290
01:01:05,818 --> 01:01:06,818
Me.

1291
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:08,347
They're all heart-shaped.

1292
01:01:08,348 --> 01:01:09,788
It's so cute.

1293
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:11,588
We need to break this.

1294
01:01:12,018 --> 01:01:13,088
Who wants to break it?

1295
01:01:13,888 --> 01:01:14,988
- Oh, my. - It's breaking.

1296
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:18,958
- Tiramisu with pistachios is... - It's cruel somehow.

1297
01:01:19,598 --> 01:01:20,828
It looks like ice cream.

1298
01:01:21,828 --> 01:01:23,767
- It looks delicious. - It looks like an ice cream cake.

1299
01:01:23,768 --> 01:01:24,838
Right? Is this cheese?

1300
01:01:26,508 --> 01:01:27,838
(Sweet)

1301
01:01:28,468 --> 01:01:29,908
(Eating)

1302
01:01:30,538 --> 01:01:33,208
Is this mascarpone, the creamy cheese?

1303
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:36,818
(It's delicious.)

1304
01:01:38,648 --> 01:01:40,748
Look at this. They're stacked nicely, right?

1305
01:01:41,018 --> 01:01:42,018
Did you stack them?

1306
01:01:42,688 --> 01:01:44,517
I actually loved it.

1307
01:01:44,518 --> 01:01:45,994
- You liked it, right? - When I saw it,

1308
01:01:46,018 --> 01:01:47,298
I was like, "Who stacked these?"

1309
01:01:47,588 --> 01:01:50,098
- "It's quite high." - It's nice.

1310
01:01:51,728 --> 01:01:52,728
Do you stack fruits?

1311
01:01:53,628 --> 01:01:54,728
Do your uncles stack them?

1312
01:01:55,498 --> 01:01:56,637
We stack them ourselves.

1313
01:01:56,638 --> 01:01:57,967
We don't like how our uncles do it.

1314
01:01:57,968 --> 01:02:00,488
(Yu Gyeong and Ho Am are talking about what only shamans know.)

1315
01:02:04,538 --> 01:02:05,738
What are we going to do today?

1316
01:02:06,178 --> 01:02:07,208
- I wonder. - Yes.

1317
01:02:09,818 --> 01:02:11,678
I hope the men get to choose today.

1318
01:02:11,918 --> 01:02:13,598
- You do? - I hope we can choose the item.

1319
01:02:13,748 --> 01:02:14,888
What will happen today?

1320
01:02:15,818 --> 01:02:17,318
(Anticipating)

1321
01:02:18,058 --> 01:02:19,088
Today?

1322
01:02:20,888 --> 01:02:23,158
(At that moment)

1323
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:27,928
(What?)

1324
01:02:28,268 --> 01:02:29,328
Oh, my.

1325
01:02:33,408 --> 01:02:37,838
(A man is approaching the house.)

1326
01:02:38,908 --> 01:02:40,007
I wonder how it will go.

1327
01:02:40,008 --> 01:02:41,568
Don't you think we'll go out on a date?

1328
01:02:42,078 --> 01:02:43,078
I think we will.

1329
01:02:53,988 --> 01:02:55,758
(Cheering)

1330
01:02:57,898 --> 01:03:00,098
He's so tall.

1331
01:03:00,268 --> 01:03:02,098
It looks like he's over 190cm.

1332
01:03:02,298 --> 01:03:03,298
He's 187cm?

1333
01:03:04,838 --> 01:03:06,197
(He's tall, befitting the Gold Dragon.)

1334
01:03:06,198 --> 01:03:07,537
He really is like a model.

1335
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:09,298
- He's 187cm. - I want to be as tall as him.

1336
01:03:10,508 --> 01:03:12,737
- It made me exclaim. - Yes. It made me exclaim.

1337
01:03:12,738 --> 01:03:14,478
- It did. - I exclaimed when I saw him.

1338
01:03:14,748 --> 01:03:16,147
- It's not easy. - He's like a celebrity.

1339
01:03:16,148 --> 01:03:18,117
I only exclaimed when I saw NewJeans.

1340
01:03:18,118 --> 01:03:19,178
I was like, "Oh, my."

1341
01:03:19,718 --> 01:03:21,988
(Interested)

1342
01:03:23,018 --> 01:03:28,028
(Gold Dragon, Yun Sang Hyeok)

1343
01:03:28,428 --> 01:03:30,028
I hope the weather is good today.

1344
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:32,997
I went outside for a moment. It's very warm.

1345
01:03:32,998 --> 01:03:33,998
Is it?

1346
01:03:34,328 --> 01:03:35,844
- I'm glad to hear that. - The weather is amazing.

1347
01:03:35,868 --> 01:03:37,698
I hope it continues to be peaceful like this.

1348
01:03:38,698 --> 01:03:42,408
(The Gold Dragon who will shatter the peace is here.)

1349
01:03:46,478 --> 01:03:47,578
Oh, my gosh.

1350
01:03:48,508 --> 01:03:49,948
(Oh, my gosh)

1351
01:03:52,118 --> 01:03:53,588
(Oh, my.)

1352
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:56,888
Gosh, I'm nervous.

1353
01:03:58,818 --> 01:03:59,828
What is it now?

1354
01:04:04,828 --> 01:04:09,368
(People in the house are nervous.)

1355
01:04:10,468 --> 01:04:12,668
When the bell rang,

1356
01:04:12,698 --> 01:04:14,938
I wondered why they didn't say anything.

1357
01:04:16,408 --> 01:04:18,838
I thought we would choose our date.

1358
01:04:20,308 --> 01:04:22,407
There was no message.

1359
01:04:22,408 --> 01:04:24,448
So I was like, "Did they ring the bell by mistake?"

1360
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:37,598
(Nervous)

1361
01:04:45,368 --> 01:04:46,408
He's here.

1362
01:04:47,108 --> 01:04:48,137
My goodness.

1363
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:49,938
(They're nervous as well.)

1364
01:04:51,008 --> 01:04:53,108
I'm nervous.

1365
01:04:54,478 --> 01:04:56,048
He has finally come.

1366
01:04:56,178 --> 01:04:57,918
I can't watch.

1367
01:05:11,326 --> 01:05:12,596
(What?)

1368
01:05:13,396 --> 01:05:14,426
- Who is it? - What?

1369
01:05:14,596 --> 01:05:15,626
Someone is here.

1370
01:05:15,726 --> 01:05:16,926
Oh, my gosh. Someone is here.

1371
01:05:17,326 --> 01:05:19,365
- What? Really? Hold on. - Someone is here.

1372
01:05:19,366 --> 01:05:20,436
Really?

1373
01:05:21,636 --> 01:05:22,965
- Why? - Seriously?

1374
01:05:22,966 --> 01:05:24,005
Yes.

1375
01:05:24,006 --> 01:05:26,806
(It draws everyone's attention.)

1376
01:05:31,216 --> 01:05:32,475
No. Hold on.

1377
01:05:32,476 --> 01:05:34,646
We should just act like we don't care.

1378
01:05:35,186 --> 01:05:36,216
Oh, my.

1379
01:05:37,086 --> 01:05:39,286
Hello.

1380
01:05:40,016 --> 01:05:41,086
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

1381
01:05:41,656 --> 01:05:42,656
Hello.

1382
01:05:44,056 --> 01:05:45,125
Oh, my.

1383
01:05:45,126 --> 01:05:46,426
- Hello. - Hello.

1384
01:05:51,496 --> 01:05:53,536
- Hello. - Hello.

1385
01:05:54,606 --> 01:05:55,636
Hello.

1386
01:05:56,336 --> 01:05:57,635
- Hello. - Hello.

1387
01:05:57,636 --> 01:05:59,116
- Oh, my. - Shouldn't we make a seat?

1388
01:05:59,676 --> 01:06:01,146
- Seriously. - I can't believe it.

1389
01:06:01,346 --> 01:06:02,826
- Oh, my. - Shouldn't we make a seat?

1390
01:06:03,276 --> 01:06:04,816
- Seriously. - I can't believe it.

1391
01:06:07,016 --> 01:06:08,445
Hello. I mean... Here.

1392
01:06:08,446 --> 01:06:09,946
- Oh, my. - Shouldn't we make a seat?

1393
01:06:10,446 --> 01:06:11,455
Seriously.

1394
01:06:11,456 --> 01:06:13,316
- May I take a seat? - Yes.

1395
01:06:15,986 --> 01:06:17,055
Yes.

1396
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:18,926
- May I take a seat? - Yes.

1397
01:06:21,496 --> 01:06:22,566
Oh, my.

1398
01:06:22,826 --> 01:06:23,826
(Glancing over)

1399
01:06:28,636 --> 01:06:32,306
(They can sense his confusion through the screen.)

1400
01:06:33,576 --> 01:06:35,446
Look at Gang Won's face.

1401
01:06:44,116 --> 01:06:46,086
I thought, "Oh, no. The time has finally come."

1402
01:06:47,186 --> 01:06:48,906
I just wanted to leave the Possessed House.

1403
01:06:51,526 --> 01:06:54,696
(He seems to be in a lot of shock.)

1404
01:06:55,766 --> 01:06:57,066
He's very tall.

1405
01:06:58,036 --> 01:06:59,195
He's handsome.

1406
01:06:59,196 --> 01:07:02,106
I felt small in comparison.

1407
01:07:05,806 --> 01:07:08,245
Everyone was drinking coffee.

1408
01:07:08,246 --> 01:07:09,376
- Yes. - I see.

1409
01:07:11,346 --> 01:07:12,676
Is he a celebrity?

1410
01:07:13,476 --> 01:07:14,686
He's so handsome.

1411
01:07:16,646 --> 01:07:17,956
We heard the bell.

1412
01:07:18,616 --> 01:07:21,586
Suddenly, a new person came.

1413
01:07:22,356 --> 01:07:25,625
He was much more handsome than I expected,

1414
01:07:25,626 --> 01:07:26,726
so it was fascinating.

1415
01:07:30,026 --> 01:07:31,096
Yes.

1416
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:36,335
His face was handsome and small.

1417
01:07:36,336 --> 01:07:38,076
He was the tallest too.

1418
01:07:39,276 --> 01:07:43,446
Well, I think the dynamics will change.

1419
01:07:44,146 --> 01:07:46,575
- Is it okay to drink this? - I don't think so.

1420
01:07:46,576 --> 01:07:48,245
- Someone else was drinking it. - Really?

1421
01:07:48,246 --> 01:07:49,316
Yes.

1422
01:07:49,516 --> 01:07:51,555
No one can look him in the eye.

1423
01:07:51,556 --> 01:07:54,156
Everyone is wearing comfortable clothes.

1424
01:07:54,886 --> 01:07:59,125
- He's a fortune teller as well. - That's right.

1425
01:07:59,126 --> 01:08:01,525
- I think all of us forgot that. - You're right.

1426
01:08:01,526 --> 01:08:03,125
- Exactly... Yes. - We thought he was a model.

1427
01:08:03,126 --> 01:08:04,265
I find it hard to believe.

1428
01:08:04,266 --> 01:08:07,396
- Exactly what does he do? - He's a shaman,

1429
01:08:07,636 --> 01:08:09,235
an astrologer, a saju reader,

1430
01:08:09,236 --> 01:08:10,605
- or a tarot reader. - A tarot reader.

1431
01:08:10,606 --> 01:08:11,635
He's a fortune teller, right?

1432
01:08:11,636 --> 01:08:13,375
- I have no idea what he does. - Seriously.

1433
01:08:13,376 --> 01:08:15,246
- I find it hard to believe. - Yes.

1434
01:08:16,776 --> 01:08:19,416
- Cups are over there. - I'll bring one.

1435
01:08:20,046 --> 01:08:21,085
Stay seated.

1436
01:08:21,086 --> 01:08:22,616
- I'll bring it. - Thank you.

1437
01:08:25,016 --> 01:08:27,825
- Something huge happened. - What?

1438
01:08:27,826 --> 01:08:29,125
- What? - Go out there.

1439
01:08:29,126 --> 01:08:30,155
- Why? What is it? - Hurry up and go out there.

1440
01:08:30,156 --> 01:08:31,526
- What is it? - Go and see.

1441
01:08:31,626 --> 01:08:32,826
(Running over)

1442
01:08:33,496 --> 01:08:35,366
- Something huge? - Hello.

1443
01:08:36,966 --> 01:08:38,566
(Startled)

1444
01:08:38,866 --> 01:08:39,966
- Hello. - Hello.

1445
01:08:42,106 --> 01:08:43,306
Her reaction was so funny.

1446
01:08:44,576 --> 01:08:45,975
(Embarrassed)

1447
01:08:45,976 --> 01:08:47,106
What?

1448
01:08:48,006 --> 01:08:50,406
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

1449
01:08:51,616 --> 01:08:54,886
(Figuring out the situation)

1450
01:08:59,986 --> 01:09:01,355
He stepped backward.

1451
01:09:01,356 --> 01:09:03,826
It's my first time seeing shamans become so surprised.

1452
01:09:06,496 --> 01:09:08,765
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

1453
01:09:08,766 --> 01:09:11,066
(A rare instance of a shaman becoming surprised)

1454
01:09:14,906 --> 01:09:17,306
Another man who was taller, more handsome,

1455
01:09:17,536 --> 01:09:19,376
and cooler entered the house.

1456
01:09:19,606 --> 01:09:22,205
At first, I looked at him thinking,

1457
01:09:22,206 --> 01:09:24,206
"Is he a celebrity?"

1458
01:09:24,846 --> 01:09:26,715
(Is it him?)

1459
01:09:26,716 --> 01:09:28,616
(The new occupant?)

1460
01:09:31,616 --> 01:09:32,685
What?

1461
01:09:32,686 --> 01:09:34,356
(The looks that made Hyeon U flustered)

1462
01:09:36,126 --> 01:09:37,796
It was like, "What are you doing here?"

1463
01:09:42,796 --> 01:09:44,436
When I first entered the Possessed House,

1464
01:09:46,336 --> 01:09:48,036
I was a bit nervous.

1465
01:09:49,766 --> 01:09:53,306
The people I was seeing for the first time...

1466
01:09:54,446 --> 01:09:56,176
made me feel that things wouldn't be easy.

1467
01:09:57,506 --> 01:09:58,746
Seriously.

1468
01:09:59,216 --> 01:10:01,686
I froze when I saw him walk in.

1469
01:10:02,046 --> 01:10:03,285
- I was so startled. - It was like,

1470
01:10:03,286 --> 01:10:04,486
"What are you doing here?"

1471
01:10:06,256 --> 01:10:11,826
(The air turns awkward between the men.)

1472
01:10:14,526 --> 01:10:15,795
I mean,

1473
01:10:15,796 --> 01:10:18,466
I don't even know what to ask since he came so suddenly.

1474
01:10:20,266 --> 01:10:21,465
When everyone comes,

1475
01:10:21,466 --> 01:10:23,866
- I'll introduce myself briefly. - Okay.

1476
01:10:25,636 --> 01:10:27,436
He's completely different from me.

1477
01:10:28,006 --> 01:10:31,046
He's put-together, delicate,

1478
01:10:31,616 --> 01:10:33,775
and very stylish. He isn't rough like me.

1479
01:10:33,776 --> 01:10:34,816
He's handsome.

1480
01:10:42,526 --> 01:10:44,086
Since when have you been tall?

1481
01:10:45,426 --> 01:10:47,296
I've been tall since middle school.

1482
01:10:48,896 --> 01:10:49,966
My goodness.

1483
01:10:51,696 --> 01:10:55,036
I feel distant since he's handsome.

1484
01:10:57,466 --> 01:10:58,775
(Ra Yun and Hyeon U join them.)

1485
01:10:58,776 --> 01:11:00,036
- Hello. - Hello.

1486
01:11:00,836 --> 01:11:02,006
Where do you live?

1487
01:11:02,806 --> 01:11:05,016
Busan. Well, I currently live in Seoul.

1488
01:11:05,346 --> 01:11:06,416
Seoul.

1489
01:11:06,946 --> 01:11:08,046
Thank you.

1490
01:11:10,086 --> 01:11:12,286
- This seat was taken. I'm sorry. - It's okay.

1491
01:11:13,886 --> 01:11:16,085
(Hyeon U unintentionally lost his seat.)

1492
01:11:16,086 --> 01:11:17,186
Bye.

1493
01:11:17,486 --> 01:11:19,295
Did you guys have breakfast?

1494
01:11:19,296 --> 01:11:21,295
- Yes. We're having it now. - Is this your first meal?

1495
01:11:21,296 --> 01:11:22,796
I see. This is your first meal.

1496
01:11:25,466 --> 01:11:27,366
(Staring)

1497
01:11:28,036 --> 01:11:29,366
You're handsome.

1498
01:11:32,436 --> 01:11:35,106
- Did he say that out loud? - Isn't this a drama?

1499
01:11:35,476 --> 01:11:37,875
I don't think Hyeon U realizes that he said it out loud.

1500
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:40,276
Granny!

1501
01:11:40,876 --> 01:11:42,146
Granny!

1502
01:11:42,886 --> 01:11:44,316
"You're handsome."

1503
01:11:46,716 --> 01:11:48,056
You're handsome.

1504
01:11:49,526 --> 01:11:50,625
(Startled)

1505
01:11:50,626 --> 01:11:52,056
What?

1506
01:11:52,126 --> 01:11:53,455
What?

1507
01:11:53,456 --> 01:11:55,295
- Thank you. - Are you channelling someone?

1508
01:11:55,296 --> 01:11:56,365
No.

1509
01:11:56,366 --> 01:11:58,596
Seriously. His tone suddenly changed.

1510
01:11:59,136 --> 01:12:00,696
I guess someone entered his body.

1511
01:12:02,336 --> 01:12:03,566
He was in awe.

1512
01:12:04,636 --> 01:12:05,835
(Crying)

1513
01:12:05,836 --> 01:12:07,075
He has a small face too.

1514
01:12:07,076 --> 01:12:08,245
It's so funny.

1515
01:12:08,246 --> 01:12:10,775
(Hyeon U's granny likes him.)

1516
01:12:10,776 --> 01:12:11,946
It's so funny.

1517
01:12:12,776 --> 01:12:14,046
I'm so flustered.

1518
01:12:14,546 --> 01:12:16,146
I was a bit startled.

1519
01:12:19,786 --> 01:12:22,586
I was channelling Granny,

1520
01:12:23,086 --> 01:12:26,496
so I blurted out without thinking,

1521
01:12:26,956 --> 01:12:28,426
"You're handsome."

1522
01:12:29,266 --> 01:12:31,896
It was my first time doing that, so I was flustered.

1523
01:12:33,036 --> 01:12:34,095
Yes.

1524
01:12:34,096 --> 01:12:36,016
(The divine spirit's comment left him startled.)

1525
01:12:36,736 --> 01:12:40,136
(Silence falls once again.)

1526
01:12:40,636 --> 01:12:43,906
My name is Yun Sang Hyeok.

1527
01:12:44,746 --> 01:12:47,376
- Yun Sang Hyeok. - I can reveal my profession, right?

1528
01:12:48,046 --> 01:12:50,485
I do I Ching tarot readings.

1529
01:12:50,486 --> 01:12:52,456
- I Ching tarot? - Yes.

1530
01:12:52,556 --> 01:12:54,356
- What's that? - I know what it is. Bagua.

1531
01:13:00,396 --> 01:13:03,196
(During preselection)

1532
01:13:07,696 --> 01:13:11,776
(Tarot reader, Yun Sang Hyeok)

1533
01:13:14,746 --> 01:13:16,346
When I choose a card,

1534
01:13:17,076 --> 01:13:19,846
I try to concentrate and feel the senses.

1535
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:24,216
I drew a card for each of the five fate plaques.

1536
01:13:25,656 --> 01:13:28,526
I came down to two fate plaques.

1537
01:13:30,926 --> 01:13:34,056
Red Rabbit and Black Monkey.

1538
01:13:42,106 --> 01:13:43,106
(Black Monkey)

1539
01:13:43,107 --> 01:13:46,036
For Black Monkey, I got Rolling Hill at the Field.

1540
01:13:47,576 --> 01:13:49,776
For Red Rabbit, I got Rising Sun on the Earth.

1541
01:13:50,776 --> 01:13:52,515
Something else...

1542
01:13:52,516 --> 01:13:55,716
other than tedium will enter my life.

1543
01:13:58,816 --> 01:13:59,986
Rolling Hill at the Field.

1544
01:14:00,216 --> 01:14:03,386
I decided to go with Red Rabbit no matter what.

1545
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:12,296
(Red Rabbit, December 2, 1995)

1546
01:14:14,296 --> 01:14:15,506
I'll go with Red Rabbit.

1547
01:14:15,736 --> 01:14:19,536
(Yun Sang Hyeok chooses Red Rabbit.)

1548
01:14:20,236 --> 01:14:21,376
Black Horse.

1549
01:14:22,176 --> 01:14:23,276
Black Monkey.

1550
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:33,215
What will become of that person's fate and my fate?

1551
01:14:33,216 --> 01:14:35,026
Time will tell.

1552
01:14:36,086 --> 01:14:37,586
If she and I become a couple,

1553
01:14:38,926 --> 01:14:40,526
I'll be very happy.

1554
01:14:41,696 --> 01:14:45,496
(Will he be able to find Red Rabbit?)

1555
01:14:45,696 --> 01:14:46,995
Isn't it your first time hearing about...

1556
01:14:46,996 --> 01:14:48,305
- I Ching tarot? - It's my first time.

1557
01:14:48,306 --> 01:14:49,635
- What is it? - What's I Ching tarot?

1558
01:14:49,636 --> 01:14:51,835
A traditional oriental method of I Ching fortune telling...

1559
01:14:51,836 --> 01:14:55,106
involves drawing sticks from a cylinder.

1560
01:14:55,276 --> 01:14:57,146
To simplify the method,

1561
01:14:57,346 --> 01:15:00,576
the 64 hexagrams were turned...

1562
01:15:00,816 --> 01:15:02,516
into 64 tarot cards.

1563
01:15:03,446 --> 01:15:05,815
Doing so simplified the method.

1564
01:15:05,816 --> 01:15:07,685
- I'm so curious. - It draws people in.

1565
01:15:07,686 --> 01:15:09,055
People are drawn to Sang Hyeok already.

1566
01:15:09,056 --> 01:15:10,056
I know.

1567
01:15:10,057 --> 01:15:11,826
- He has so many advantages. - I know.

1568
01:15:12,026 --> 01:15:13,096
My goodness.

1569
01:15:14,296 --> 01:15:17,065
- Seriously. Don't say it. - Isn't that how it is?

1570
01:15:17,066 --> 01:15:18,335
I guess it's famous.

1571
01:15:18,336 --> 01:15:19,336
(Glancing over)

1572
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:22,165
- Don't you feel awkward? - No, I'm okay.

1573
01:15:22,166 --> 01:15:23,306
You're Yu Ra, right?

1574
01:15:23,806 --> 01:15:24,906
Yes. How did you know?

1575
01:15:25,806 --> 01:15:27,436
- I saw it. - Where?

1576
01:15:28,806 --> 01:15:31,546
I received simple information such as names yesterday.

1577
01:15:32,346 --> 01:15:33,416
Did he see it?

1578
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:35,546
How did you see it?

1579
01:15:36,116 --> 01:15:38,186
Yu Ra, Yu Gyeong...

1580
01:15:40,316 --> 01:15:42,626
- He knows all the names. - How does he know them?

1581
01:15:44,696 --> 01:15:47,095
Ra Yun and Yun Jeong.

1582
01:15:47,096 --> 01:15:48,726
- Really? - You memorized the names.

1583
01:15:50,496 --> 01:15:52,636
(On guard)

1584
01:15:53,066 --> 01:15:55,036
Was he watching us in secret?

1585
01:15:55,206 --> 01:15:56,206
I didn't do that.

1586
01:15:56,766 --> 01:15:58,535
I just got the names.

1587
01:15:58,536 --> 01:16:00,706
(Sang Hyeok memorized all the women's names.)

1588
01:16:03,346 --> 01:16:05,646
- Did you see the photos? - Yes.

1589
01:16:06,916 --> 01:16:09,216
I got the photos and names.

1590
01:16:13,256 --> 01:16:14,726
What are the men's names?

1591
01:16:16,886 --> 01:16:18,355
But you memorized all the women's names.

1592
01:16:18,356 --> 01:16:20,295
I didn't receive men's information...

1593
01:16:20,296 --> 01:16:21,296
ahead of time.

1594
01:16:22,066 --> 01:16:24,325
You weren't interested, were you?

1595
01:16:24,326 --> 01:16:25,665
It wasn't like that.

1596
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:26,936
What's your name?

1597
01:16:30,706 --> 01:16:32,976
(Glancing over)

1598
01:16:33,576 --> 01:16:36,406
The men seemed to be very nervous.

1599
01:16:37,076 --> 01:16:40,716
Their eyes shifted when they saw him.

1600
01:16:41,146 --> 01:16:42,616
It was fun to watch.

1601
01:16:44,386 --> 01:16:47,656
The women were shaken up because they were thinking,

1602
01:16:47,986 --> 01:16:49,355
"It's a new person."

1603
01:16:49,356 --> 01:16:51,596
"What is he like?" There was curiosity or interest.

1604
01:16:52,796 --> 01:16:56,866
On the other hand, the men seemed to be on guard.

1605
01:16:57,466 --> 01:17:00,466
There was a bit of an animalistic vibe.

1606
01:17:01,136 --> 01:17:03,336
There was a bit of that vibe.

1607
01:17:04,536 --> 01:17:07,436
It looked like each one had a woman...

1608
01:17:07,536 --> 01:17:09,406
he was interested in.

1609
01:17:10,076 --> 01:17:14,886
In that situation, a new rival entered.

1610
01:17:15,816 --> 01:17:17,286
That must be it.

1611
01:17:18,156 --> 01:17:21,485
But I don't really mind.

1612
01:17:21,486 --> 01:17:24,356
I don't care about other men.

1613
01:17:24,756 --> 01:17:28,056
I plan to do what I want to do.

1614
01:17:33,136 --> 01:17:35,005
You haven't gotten a house tour yet.

1615
01:17:35,006 --> 01:17:36,736
- A house tour. - May I look around now?

1616
01:17:37,966 --> 01:17:39,036
All right.

1617
01:17:39,136 --> 01:17:40,276
Let's clean up afterward.

1618
01:17:40,836 --> 01:17:42,276
Shall we ask questions?

1619
01:17:46,576 --> 01:17:47,946
Will you be in the kitchen?

1620
01:17:48,286 --> 01:17:49,386
I'll go up later.

1621
01:17:50,446 --> 01:17:52,715
(Yun Jeong puts on a coat without thinking.)

1622
01:17:52,716 --> 01:17:53,786
Nice shoes.

1623
01:17:56,256 --> 01:17:57,326
That's my coat.

1624
01:17:57,826 --> 01:17:59,426
What? Gosh!

1625
01:18:01,696 --> 01:18:04,896
(She put on Sang Hyeok's coat by mistake.)

1626
01:18:05,436 --> 01:18:07,896
I put it on thinking that it was my coat.

1627
01:18:08,466 --> 01:18:10,635
- Whose coat is it? - His.

1628
01:18:10,636 --> 01:18:11,636
Come on.

1629
01:18:13,406 --> 01:18:14,706
She put it on by mistake.

1630
01:18:14,876 --> 01:18:16,705
Is there a chance she did that on purpose?

1631
01:18:16,706 --> 01:18:19,215
- Gosh, that's... - No way.

1632
01:18:19,216 --> 01:18:20,316
Gosh, that's...

1633
01:18:20,746 --> 01:18:23,686
Men's coats weigh differently.

1634
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:26,596
- She definitely did it on purpose. - It was a flirting skill.

1635
01:18:26,856 --> 01:18:28,586
- I bet she looked cute. - Of course.

1636
01:18:28,686 --> 01:18:29,686
How cute.

1637
01:18:29,687 --> 01:18:30,925
Look. That way, she can talk to him once more.

1638
01:18:30,926 --> 01:18:32,726
- Seriously. - She's like a puppy.

1639
01:18:32,926 --> 01:18:34,865
- Gosh. - Isn't she like a golden retriever?

1640
01:18:34,866 --> 01:18:35,866
A little bit.

1641
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:41,706
(She unintentionally showed her puppy-like charms.)

1642
01:18:43,566 --> 01:18:44,566
I'm sorry.

1643
01:18:44,567 --> 01:18:47,575
(Sang Hyeok's coat got left behind.)

1644
01:18:47,576 --> 01:18:49,206
She brought me a drink.

1645
01:18:49,746 --> 01:18:53,576
She also put on my coat by mistake.

1646
01:18:54,376 --> 01:18:56,746
The way she made an effort made me feel...

1647
01:18:57,146 --> 01:18:58,556
that she was nice.

1648
01:18:58,656 --> 01:18:59,656
She's very honest.

1649
01:18:59,716 --> 01:19:01,116
She shows herself naturally.

1650
01:19:01,526 --> 01:19:03,386
I thought she was very nice.

1651
01:19:04,826 --> 01:19:06,525
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

1652
01:19:06,526 --> 01:19:07,626
I was so startled.

1653
01:19:07,726 --> 01:19:12,196
(They made their unique story from the very first meeting.)

1654
01:19:14,906 --> 01:19:16,406
We usually gather around here.

1655
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:18,876
You guys talk here, I see.

1656
01:19:19,936 --> 01:19:21,846
- Women's rooms are there. - Women's rooms.

1657
01:19:22,176 --> 01:19:24,146
- They need privacy. - They need privacy.

1658
01:19:26,216 --> 01:19:27,576
What? There's an I Ching cylinder.

1659
01:19:28,416 --> 01:19:30,086
- What is it? - Do you know what it is?

1660
01:19:30,186 --> 01:19:31,586
- Yes. - Do you know how to use it?

1661
01:19:32,216 --> 01:19:33,655
- Do you know how to use it? - Yes.

1662
01:19:33,656 --> 01:19:35,025
How do you use it? Please go ahead.

1663
01:19:35,026 --> 01:19:36,902
(An I Ching cylinder caught Sang Hyeok's eyes.)

1664
01:19:36,926 --> 01:19:38,995
- I'm curious. - I've been very curious.

1665
01:19:38,996 --> 01:19:39,996
Same here.

1666
01:19:40,856 --> 01:19:42,666
Please pick one.

1667
01:19:43,126 --> 01:19:44,126
Like this?

1668
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,572
(Sang Hyeok's fortune telling begins on the spot.)

1669
01:19:45,596 --> 01:19:47,096
Shall I tell your fortune of the day?

1670
01:19:47,196 --> 01:19:48,206
Yes.

1671
01:19:49,466 --> 01:19:52,936
(Hyeon U picks a stick.)

1672
01:19:53,136 --> 01:19:54,206
Underground Water.

1673
01:19:54,536 --> 01:19:55,776
- Underground Water? - Yes.

1674
01:19:56,476 --> 01:19:58,616
Today,

1675
01:19:59,246 --> 01:20:01,476
you shouldn't let things flow.

1676
01:20:02,216 --> 01:20:05,956
You should make meticulous calculations and preparations.

1677
01:20:06,056 --> 01:20:07,416
- Is it I Ching? - If you do that,

1678
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:09,456
you'll be able to find success.

1679
01:20:10,326 --> 01:20:11,726
- Is it I Ching? - I think so.

1680
01:20:13,296 --> 01:20:14,396
Me too.

1681
01:20:14,496 --> 01:20:16,095
Is this how you do I Ching?

1682
01:20:16,096 --> 01:20:17,096
It's an I Ching cylinder.

1683
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:18,195
How do I do it?

1684
01:20:18,196 --> 01:20:19,196
Just pick a stick.

1685
01:20:19,197 --> 01:20:21,165
- What do you want to know? - Today's fortune.

1686
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:22,265
- Today's fortune? - Yes.

1687
01:20:22,266 --> 01:20:23,582
- What did you ask about? - Today's fortune.

1688
01:20:23,606 --> 01:20:25,166
I'll ask about today's fortune as well.

1689
01:20:25,206 --> 01:20:26,206
Oh, yes.

1690
01:20:27,506 --> 01:20:28,675
I'll spread the news.

1691
01:20:28,676 --> 01:20:29,676
That's a good idea.

1692
01:20:30,206 --> 01:20:32,215
- Let's see what it is. - Everyone.

1693
01:20:32,216 --> 01:20:34,316
(Sang Hyeok's fortune-telling is popular.)

1694
01:20:36,116 --> 01:20:37,845
She feels distant because he's so handsome,

1695
01:20:37,846 --> 01:20:39,186
but she wants to stay close.

1696
01:20:39,616 --> 01:20:40,616
She's the closest to him.

1697
01:20:41,256 --> 01:20:43,086
(She's sticking to him.)

1698
01:20:44,926 --> 01:20:47,826
(What's Yu Ra's fortune of the day?)

1699
01:20:48,296 --> 01:20:50,296
- Wind Over Water Scattered Around. - What's that?

1700
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:53,036
Wind Over Water Scattered Around means...

1701
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:57,265
that your mind will sway.

1702
01:20:57,266 --> 01:20:59,706
Your focus can be scattered...

1703
01:20:59,806 --> 01:21:01,536
- throughout the day. - Okay.

1704
01:21:01,946 --> 01:21:03,706
Are you like that today? Are you distracted?

1705
01:21:04,006 --> 01:21:05,616
Yes. It's fascinating.

1706
01:21:06,176 --> 01:21:08,945
What I can tell you is this. To lessen the distraction,

1707
01:21:08,946 --> 01:21:11,546
it might be better to focus on something.

1708
01:21:12,416 --> 01:21:14,486
It also might be better to learn about...

1709
01:21:14,586 --> 01:21:15,825
various things.

1710
01:21:15,826 --> 01:21:17,085
So learning about various things is okay?

1711
01:21:17,086 --> 01:21:18,155
Yes. That's Wind Over Water Scattered Around.

1712
01:21:18,156 --> 01:21:19,595
But will focus be good as well?

1713
01:21:19,596 --> 01:21:22,725
It won't be easy to focus on one thing.

1714
01:21:22,726 --> 01:21:23,726
- That's right. - Wind Over Water Scattered Around.

1715
01:21:23,726 --> 01:21:24,726
It suits the third day.

1716
01:21:25,266 --> 01:21:26,266
It's fascinating.

1717
01:21:26,267 --> 01:21:27,865
How about you?

1718
01:21:27,866 --> 01:21:28,906
I think it's fitting.

1719
01:21:29,406 --> 01:21:30,406
- Is it fitting? - Yes.

1720
01:21:31,836 --> 01:21:32,836
Would you like to do it?

1721
01:21:34,736 --> 01:21:35,746
Today's fortune.

1722
01:21:35,946 --> 01:21:36,976
This one.

1723
01:21:37,206 --> 01:21:38,206
All right.

1724
01:21:38,306 --> 01:21:39,346
What is it?

1725
01:21:39,746 --> 01:21:41,075
Rolling Hill at the Field.

1726
01:21:41,076 --> 01:21:43,262
- Rolling Hill at the Fire? - Rolling Hill at the Field.

1727
01:21:43,286 --> 01:21:44,346
Rolling Hill at the Field.

1728
01:21:44,986 --> 01:21:45,986
It sounds meaningful.

1729
01:21:46,716 --> 01:21:48,216
(Pouting)

1730
01:21:49,156 --> 01:21:50,156
What's up with that face?

1731
01:21:50,186 --> 01:21:53,226
It sounds like something will break.

1732
01:21:54,096 --> 01:21:56,396
- What? - Today's fortune is...

1733
01:21:57,266 --> 01:22:01,396
You should be a bit mindful.

1734
01:22:01,766 --> 01:22:02,766
That's your fortune of the day.

1735
01:22:02,767 --> 01:22:05,706
But Rolling Hill at the Field is...

1736
01:22:07,306 --> 01:22:08,946
(Nervous)

1737
01:22:09,546 --> 01:22:12,715
It could be a bit bad,

1738
01:22:12,716 --> 01:22:14,316
but it's the end of this fortune.

1739
01:22:14,646 --> 01:22:16,115
So when this day ends...

1740
01:22:16,116 --> 01:22:17,845
- and tomorrow begins, - Will things get better?

1741
01:22:17,846 --> 01:22:19,756
Something new...

1742
01:22:20,656 --> 01:22:23,355
like spring will begin.

1743
01:22:23,356 --> 01:22:25,756
That's Rolling Hill at the Field. So if you're feeling...

1744
01:22:26,096 --> 01:22:27,256
a bit down,

1745
01:22:27,696 --> 01:22:29,056
your entire day will be like that.

1746
01:22:29,196 --> 01:22:32,336
But you can look forward to a better tomorrow.

1747
01:22:32,496 --> 01:22:33,496
So I should be careful today.

1748
01:22:33,497 --> 01:22:35,466
- Shall we pay for the reading? - No.

1749
01:22:35,566 --> 01:22:37,066
- What should I bring? - Thank you.

1750
01:22:37,206 --> 01:22:38,405
Shall we pay for the reading?

1751
01:22:38,406 --> 01:22:39,846
(Sang Hyeok's I Ching reading ends.)

1752
01:22:40,136 --> 01:22:41,845
What will happen today? I'm curious.

1753
01:22:41,846 --> 01:22:42,846
Seriously.

1754
01:22:42,906 --> 01:22:45,716
We need to go on a date, but the number isn't even.

1755
01:22:45,816 --> 01:22:47,016
I'm a bit curious.

1756
01:22:48,216 --> 01:22:50,345
Maybe we'll see someone we didn't even think about.

1757
01:22:50,346 --> 01:22:52,215
That might be the case. Someone new might be there.

1758
01:22:52,216 --> 01:22:53,755
- That might happen. - That might happen.

1759
01:22:53,756 --> 01:22:54,756
Seriously.

1760
01:22:54,986 --> 01:22:56,056
I'm curious.

1761
01:22:56,786 --> 01:22:58,226
I can't predict what will happen.

1762
01:23:02,496 --> 01:23:06,536
(Hyeon U and Yun Jeong are taking photos.)

1763
01:23:08,336 --> 01:23:12,876
(Sang Hyeok remains by their side.)

1764
01:23:15,676 --> 01:23:17,176
- This one is pretty. - Really?

1765
01:23:19,676 --> 01:23:21,216
Yun Jeong is...

1766
01:23:22,286 --> 01:23:24,445
very charming.

1767
01:23:24,446 --> 01:23:26,016
Her voice is charming too.

1768
01:23:27,356 --> 01:23:30,885
She seems like a serious and careful person.

1769
01:23:30,886 --> 01:23:33,856
I want to talk to her.

1770
01:23:34,126 --> 01:23:35,966
She's someone who makes me curious...

1771
01:23:36,496 --> 01:23:38,566
about her thoughts.

1772
01:23:41,466 --> 01:23:42,606
(Glancing over)

1773
01:23:44,106 --> 01:23:45,376
- Were they there? - Yes.

1774
01:23:45,476 --> 01:23:46,805
They were there together.

1775
01:23:46,806 --> 01:23:48,046
Did something happen afterward?

1776
01:23:51,006 --> 01:23:54,776
(Sang Hyeok sits next to Yun Jeong.)

1777
01:23:55,116 --> 01:23:57,046
He sat next to her.

1778
01:23:58,656 --> 01:23:59,685
Even though she isn't looking at him,

1779
01:23:59,686 --> 01:24:01,232
- she can feel his presence. - That's right.

1780
01:24:01,256 --> 01:24:02,925
She can see him out of the corner of her eye.

1781
01:24:02,926 --> 01:24:04,686
(She can feel his presence without looking.)

1782
01:24:07,756 --> 01:24:09,265
Why do that there?

1783
01:24:09,266 --> 01:24:10,365
(Staring)

1784
01:24:10,366 --> 01:24:12,236
- Why? - Why do that there?

1785
01:24:12,936 --> 01:24:14,236
I wouldn't have stayed still.

1786
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:20,306
- What's that? - What? It was in the back.

1787
01:24:22,276 --> 01:24:25,476
Can you only do astrology at night?

1788
01:24:25,776 --> 01:24:27,816
No. It's done with a chart.

1789
01:24:28,046 --> 01:24:30,585
- A chart? - It's a bit like saju.

1790
01:24:30,586 --> 01:24:33,616
It's quite unique. Not many people do it.

1791
01:24:34,956 --> 01:24:38,225
I got into it very naturally.

1792
01:24:38,226 --> 01:24:41,296
(Sang Hyeok begins to talk to Yun Jeong naturally.)

1793
01:24:42,626 --> 01:24:44,226
I did a bit of saju,

1794
01:24:44,826 --> 01:24:46,266
but I switched since it was so hard.

1795
01:24:46,836 --> 01:24:48,295
- Saju was... - Astrology must suit you better.

1796
01:24:48,296 --> 01:24:50,566
Yes. It's rather direct.

1797
01:24:52,236 --> 01:24:54,105
So you don't look at the sky?

1798
01:24:54,106 --> 01:24:56,446
No, I don't. I just do that...

1799
01:24:58,246 --> 01:25:00,646
because I like it. It's pretty.

1800
01:25:01,016 --> 01:25:02,016
That's how it is.

1801
01:25:02,016 --> 01:25:03,016
(Staring)

1802
01:25:03,886 --> 01:25:04,916
I didn't do that.

1803
01:25:05,386 --> 01:25:09,486
Both of them don't hesitate to express their feelings.

1804
01:25:09,586 --> 01:25:10,786
They're honest.

1805
01:25:12,126 --> 01:25:13,956
I think they're a good match in that regard.

1806
01:25:14,296 --> 01:25:15,826
I had such thoughts.

1807
01:25:16,266 --> 01:25:19,396
When I study Sang Hyeok's behaviours,

1808
01:25:20,036 --> 01:25:23,666
it seems like he's moving forward with a goal in mind.

1809
01:25:24,736 --> 01:25:27,206
Because I like it. It's pretty.

1810
01:25:27,606 --> 01:25:28,606
That's how it is.

1811
01:25:29,546 --> 01:25:32,376
(Unhappy)

1812
01:25:33,346 --> 01:25:34,346
(Look at those eyes.)

1813
01:25:34,347 --> 01:25:37,645
Granny, stop coming out.

1814
01:25:37,646 --> 01:25:39,716
Granny keeps coming out.

1815
01:25:40,156 --> 01:25:42,385
- "Look at them playing!" - "Gosh!"

1816
01:25:42,386 --> 01:25:45,396
- "Gosh!" - "He's making a move on her!"

1817
01:25:46,326 --> 01:25:48,895
- "You fool." - "You fool."

1818
01:25:48,896 --> 01:25:50,326
That's the face he's making.

1819
01:25:50,966 --> 01:25:52,165
- "Gosh." - Don't misunderstand him.

1820
01:25:52,166 --> 01:25:53,336
That isn't Hyeon U.

1821
01:25:58,106 --> 01:26:00,506
(The eyes of the divine spirit)

1822
01:26:01,676 --> 01:26:02,975
That has a greater advantage.

1823
01:26:02,976 --> 01:26:06,046
(The bell rings all of a sudden.)

1824
01:26:06,676 --> 01:26:08,986
(Startled)

1825
01:26:11,446 --> 01:26:12,516
It's giving me goosebumps.

1826
01:26:20,526 --> 01:26:24,496
(Byeong Yeol is lacking energy once again today.)

1827
01:26:24,926 --> 01:26:27,835
For 30 minutes,

1828
01:26:27,836 --> 01:26:29,606
the men must make date requests.

1829
01:26:32,076 --> 01:26:33,976
Gosh, this is crazy.

1830
01:26:36,076 --> 01:26:37,446
Only one chance is given.

1831
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:39,916
The date is matched by order of arrival.

1832
01:26:40,216 --> 01:26:42,186
- This is insane. - This is insane.

1833
01:26:44,186 --> 01:26:46,685
(Thrilling date by order of arrival)

1834
01:26:46,686 --> 01:26:47,815
It's by order of arrival! Gosh!

1835
01:26:47,816 --> 01:26:49,855
Shouldn't they hurry then? They should hurry.

1836
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:50,955
Definitely.

1837
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:51,996
Oh, no!

1838
01:26:53,156 --> 01:26:56,195
I suddenly wondered if I had to ask someone on a date...

1839
01:26:56,196 --> 01:27:00,266
in front of that many people.

1840
01:27:00,766 --> 01:27:01,966
It got me really surprised.

1841
01:27:03,436 --> 01:27:06,506
The timing was so unexpected...

1842
01:27:06,676 --> 01:27:09,406
with such an unexpected date request method.

1843
01:27:09,806 --> 01:27:11,346
It got me very flustered.

1844
01:27:12,846 --> 01:27:16,816
(The men are in shock.)

1845
01:27:17,286 --> 01:27:20,155
I felt very confused.

1846
01:27:20,156 --> 01:27:23,156
It felt as if my heart hadn't settled and decided.

1847
01:27:23,986 --> 01:27:25,996
I was worried that the others would go first.

1848
01:27:26,556 --> 01:27:29,566
I thought that I had to make my request quickly.

1849
01:27:30,466 --> 01:27:32,696
If I get the chance to choose,

1850
01:27:32,996 --> 01:27:36,105
I will make an effort to make the most of my chance...

1851
01:27:36,106 --> 01:27:37,106
as soon as possible.

1852
01:27:39,036 --> 01:27:43,005
(Will the women be able to get a date request...)

1853
01:27:43,006 --> 01:27:46,646
(from the partner they wish for?)

1854
01:27:53,478 --> 01:27:55,477
So if you get denied,

1855
01:27:55,478 --> 01:27:56,977
you have to be in the House all alone.

1856
01:27:56,978 --> 01:27:57,978
Right.

1857
01:27:58,278 --> 01:28:01,017
But one of the men has to be alone...

1858
01:28:01,018 --> 01:28:02,088
no matter what.

1859
01:28:02,688 --> 01:28:04,288
There are more men than women.

1860
01:28:04,558 --> 01:28:05,727
It's by order of arrival.

1861
01:28:05,728 --> 01:28:07,208
That man has to be lonely on his own.

1862
01:28:08,858 --> 01:28:10,758
(Head hurting)

1863
01:28:12,328 --> 01:28:16,038
(The men hesitate to make a move.)

1864
01:28:17,298 --> 01:28:18,938
(Peeking)

1865
01:28:23,538 --> 01:28:25,477
Gang Won was in front of me,

1866
01:28:25,478 --> 01:28:27,978
and his eyes shook a lot.

1867
01:28:28,078 --> 01:28:29,717
He kept reading the room...

1868
01:28:29,718 --> 01:28:31,577
and wasn't able to directly talk to me.

1869
01:28:31,578 --> 01:28:34,418
He was being hesitant because of his pride.

1870
01:28:35,118 --> 01:28:37,657
We had a bit of a quarrel the day before,

1871
01:28:37,658 --> 01:28:39,778
and I said that we should learn about the others too.

1872
01:28:40,028 --> 01:28:41,828
Going up to her all of a sudden...

1873
01:28:42,558 --> 01:28:45,667
and asking, "Do you want to go on a date with me, Ra Yun?"

1874
01:28:45,668 --> 01:28:48,468
This felt too shameless in my opinion.

1875
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:51,898
(During yesterday's date)

1876
01:28:52,438 --> 01:28:53,838
There definitely will be someone...

1877
01:28:54,068 --> 01:28:56,708
that will want to talk with you.

1878
01:28:56,878 --> 01:28:58,907
Or there might be someone...

1879
01:28:58,908 --> 01:29:01,508
that will want to talk with me too.

1880
01:29:01,808 --> 01:29:04,648
So I think it's okay to just talk with the others.

1881
01:29:05,248 --> 01:29:06,987
Just because you favour me,

1882
01:29:06,988 --> 01:29:09,618
I don't want to say, "Don't talk with someone else."

1883
01:29:12,128 --> 01:29:15,258
I still wish you would talk with someone else.

1884
01:29:19,328 --> 01:29:22,698
(Letting out a sigh)

1885
01:29:23,738 --> 01:29:25,708
He's torn because of the things he said.

1886
01:29:25,868 --> 01:29:27,468
- Right. - Why did he say those things?

1887
01:29:28,108 --> 01:29:29,778
She's waiting.

1888
01:29:32,108 --> 01:29:35,308
(While everyone is being hesitant...)

1889
01:29:36,918 --> 01:29:38,048
(Getting up)

1890
01:29:41,488 --> 01:29:44,888
May I have a word with you, Yu Gyeong?

1891
01:29:46,158 --> 01:29:47,587
- Are you going to pick one for me? - Yes.

1892
01:29:47,588 --> 01:29:49,598
(Ho Am was the first to move.)

1893
01:29:50,028 --> 01:29:51,928
What? Yu Gyeong?

1894
01:29:52,698 --> 01:29:55,467
- They talked the day before. - Right.

1895
01:29:55,468 --> 01:29:57,897
Their professions were revealed as shamans,

1896
01:29:57,898 --> 01:29:59,038
and they talked together.

1897
01:29:59,168 --> 01:30:00,737
I think that was when their hearts opened up for each other.

1898
01:30:00,738 --> 01:30:01,967
Right.

1899
01:30:01,968 --> 01:30:03,007
- Right. - They got along well...

1900
01:30:03,008 --> 01:30:04,248
and could relate to each other.

1901
01:30:04,338 --> 01:30:07,148
They both looked comfortable together.

1902
01:30:07,378 --> 01:30:10,218
Right. He was interested in her from the start.

1903
01:30:10,918 --> 01:30:12,448
That was impressive from Ho Am.

1904
01:30:13,588 --> 01:30:15,087
- He's so direct. - He went straight for it...

1905
01:30:15,088 --> 01:30:16,517
while the others were being hesitant.

1906
01:30:16,518 --> 01:30:17,794
(Ho Am was the first one to pluck up his courage.)

1907
01:30:17,818 --> 01:30:21,028
I think she was the one I wanted to learn about the most.

1908
01:30:21,288 --> 01:30:22,358
It was Yu Gyeong.

1909
01:30:22,428 --> 01:30:24,197
Yu Gyeong is a shaman too.

1910
01:30:24,198 --> 01:30:27,168
Yu Gyeong must also have divine spirits that she serves.

1911
01:30:27,628 --> 01:30:29,597
It felt like there was a good connection...

1912
01:30:29,598 --> 01:30:31,238
between the divine spirits too.

1913
01:30:31,398 --> 01:30:34,067
Ho Am asked me to go down with him...

1914
01:30:34,068 --> 01:30:35,838
to talk for a second.

1915
01:30:35,938 --> 01:30:37,538
I felt quite excited.

1916
01:30:39,378 --> 01:30:41,058
- Are you going to pick one for me? - Yes.

1917
01:30:41,848 --> 01:30:43,117
(Are you going to pick one for me?)

1918
01:30:43,118 --> 01:30:44,178
(Yes.)

1919
01:30:53,088 --> 01:30:54,657
(Sighing)

1920
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:56,198
That sounds exciting.

1921
01:30:56,428 --> 01:30:58,028
You're making me feel nervous.

1922
01:31:00,268 --> 01:31:02,597
I'm scared. What do you want to talk about?

1923
01:31:02,598 --> 01:31:04,437
(The 2 of them came down to the 1st floor.)

1924
01:31:04,438 --> 01:31:06,067
Why have you brought me down with the five-element flags?

1925
01:31:06,068 --> 01:31:07,108
(Getting closer)

1926
01:31:07,638 --> 01:31:10,108
(The two have become closer.)

1927
01:31:11,778 --> 01:31:13,808
(Feeling nervous)

1928
01:31:14,278 --> 01:31:16,747
May I dare to do this for you?

1929
01:31:16,748 --> 01:31:18,847
You want me to pick one? Gosh, why?

1930
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:22,018
I'm scared. I don't want to pick one.

1931
01:31:23,018 --> 01:31:25,857
- You and I will both pick one. - Each of us will pick one?

1932
01:31:25,858 --> 01:31:27,618
- With my right hand? - You should go first.

1933
01:31:28,788 --> 01:31:30,158
My gosh!

1934
01:31:32,628 --> 01:31:34,197
Okay. You should pick one first then.

1935
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:35,518
- Should I pick one first? - Yes.

1936
01:31:41,468 --> 01:31:42,668
Should I bring up some energy?

1937
01:31:48,448 --> 01:31:50,847
To be honest, I have never picked...

1938
01:31:50,848 --> 01:31:53,788
from the five-element flags with someone else.

1939
01:31:53,988 --> 01:31:57,257
Picking from them with someone else is something that rarely happens.

1940
01:31:57,258 --> 01:31:58,557
That was when I realized...

1941
01:31:58,558 --> 01:32:01,428
that he wanted to look into our connection.

1942
01:32:03,328 --> 01:32:05,798
(Yu Gyeong carefully picks from the five-element flag.)

1943
01:32:12,908 --> 01:32:14,468
I don't know.

1944
01:32:15,708 --> 01:32:17,138
- I'll go with this one. - Okay.

1945
01:32:26,548 --> 01:32:27,988
(Smiling)

1946
01:32:33,028 --> 01:32:35,898
Yu Gyeong, may I ask you out on a date?

1947
01:32:36,028 --> 01:32:37,028
That sounds good.

1948
01:32:37,128 --> 01:32:39,068
(Heart racing)

1949
01:32:39,628 --> 01:32:41,098
This guy is just...

1950
01:32:42,338 --> 01:32:45,598
- Gosh, Ho Am! - He made a sudden move!

1951
01:32:46,108 --> 01:32:47,367
Ho Am is the real deal.

1952
01:32:47,368 --> 01:32:49,337
- That guy is good. - Right.

1953
01:32:49,338 --> 01:32:51,007
With whatever flag,

1954
01:32:51,008 --> 01:32:54,708
- he was going to say that line. - Right!

1955
01:32:55,048 --> 01:32:56,117
With whatever flag.

1956
01:32:56,118 --> 01:32:57,217
I think I'm going to watch this over five times.

1957
01:32:57,218 --> 01:33:00,118
Those bold moves really make my heart flutter.

1958
01:33:00,848 --> 01:33:02,357
- Gosh! - How is someone...

1959
01:33:02,358 --> 01:33:03,634
- that impressive? - I choose Ho Am.

1960
01:33:03,658 --> 01:33:05,618
That was amazing.

1961
01:33:11,428 --> 01:33:15,097
(Yu Gyeong, may I ask you out on a date?)

1962
01:33:15,098 --> 01:33:17,998
Yu Gyeong, may I ask you out on a date?

1963
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:19,708
(Sounds good.)

1964
01:33:24,938 --> 01:33:27,307
With our connection as a whole,

1965
01:33:27,308 --> 01:33:28,684
I looked into it with the five-element flags.

1966
01:33:28,708 --> 01:33:30,717
Yu Gyeong's side was positive.

1967
01:33:30,718 --> 01:33:32,718
It showed that I had to make an effort.

1968
01:33:33,788 --> 01:33:35,548
I had to approach her first...

1969
01:33:35,788 --> 01:33:37,988
and had to express my feelings to her in an honest way.

1970
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:39,588
- Thank you. - Green?

1971
01:33:40,928 --> 01:33:42,927
- Green? How mean. - I got the worst one,

1972
01:33:42,928 --> 01:33:44,358
and you got the best one.

1973
01:33:44,658 --> 01:33:46,068
- How mean! - How mean!

1974
01:33:47,998 --> 01:33:49,398
- It's a catchphrase. - "How mean!"

1975
01:33:51,398 --> 01:33:53,838
(Jang Ho Am and Chae Yu Gyeong have been matched for a date.)

1976
01:33:55,138 --> 01:33:57,018
He told me to pick from the five-element flags.

1977
01:33:58,678 --> 01:34:01,047
He brought me down to pick from the five-element flags.

1978
01:34:01,048 --> 01:34:02,147
- Really? - Yes.

1979
01:34:02,148 --> 01:34:04,148
- He made you... - He brought me down to pick one.

1980
01:34:04,718 --> 01:34:06,417
- You were forced to pick one? - I felt scared.

1981
01:34:06,418 --> 01:34:08,124
It feels scary when a shaman asks you to come.

1982
01:34:08,148 --> 01:34:09,617
- He had the five-element flags too. - How can a shaman...

1983
01:34:09,618 --> 01:34:10,658
ask a shaman to come?

1984
01:34:10,988 --> 01:34:12,317
He told me to come.

1985
01:34:12,318 --> 01:34:13,628
I said I didn't want to.

1986
01:34:14,688 --> 01:34:16,057
I said that I was scared as he asked me to come down...

1987
01:34:16,058 --> 01:34:17,658
with the five-element flags in his hand.

1988
01:34:18,398 --> 01:34:20,398
The two of them...

1989
01:34:21,068 --> 01:34:24,398
suddenly got a lot closer to each other.

1990
01:34:25,038 --> 01:34:27,838
There was suddenly a big shift,

1991
01:34:28,838 --> 01:34:31,638
so I felt flustered. I don't know how I feel about it.

1992
01:34:36,018 --> 01:34:37,148
I got so scared.

1993
01:34:38,248 --> 01:34:39,688
You didn't pick one, right?

1994
01:34:39,888 --> 01:34:40,888
- Me? - Yes.

1995
01:34:42,918 --> 01:34:44,158
I picked one too.

1996
01:34:45,488 --> 01:34:47,758
- You did? - I was the one to get the good one.

1997
01:34:48,288 --> 01:34:49,527
I got the worst one...

1998
01:34:49,528 --> 01:34:51,498
- and Yu Gyeong got the best one. - Really?

1999
01:34:51,598 --> 01:34:53,678
- It was a trade. - We picked them at the same time.

2000
01:35:01,808 --> 01:35:03,168
- She doesn't look happy. - Right.

2001
01:35:04,608 --> 01:35:06,908
It was the guy that she went on a date with.

2002
01:35:07,278 --> 01:35:09,238
- It must feel strange. - She doesn't look happy.

2003
01:35:10,448 --> 01:35:15,448
(Yun Jeong loses her smile.)

2004
01:35:25,198 --> 01:35:27,928
Would you like to go on a date with me today?

2005
01:35:28,428 --> 01:35:31,168
Would you like to go on a date with me today?

2006
01:35:31,698 --> 01:35:33,008
- You're asking me? - Yes.

2007
01:35:35,878 --> 01:35:37,238
That was nice.

2008
01:35:37,408 --> 01:35:39,347
He was straightforward in front of everyone.

2009
01:35:39,348 --> 01:35:41,478
- Just like a black knight for her. - Right.

2010
01:35:42,148 --> 01:35:44,778
She was feeling confused, but he came right in.

2011
01:35:47,318 --> 01:35:48,388
This is driving me crazy.

2012
01:35:48,688 --> 01:35:50,318
- Right. - This is driving me crazy.

2013
01:35:54,288 --> 01:35:56,928
Would you like to go on a date with me today?

2014
01:35:57,458 --> 01:36:00,128
Would you like to go on a date with me today?

2015
01:36:00,798 --> 01:36:02,128
- You're asking me? - Yes.

2016
01:36:03,438 --> 01:36:04,568
- Is that okay? - Yes.

2017
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:06,538
Sounds good.

2018
01:36:08,438 --> 01:36:13,778
(The Gold Dragon's...)

2019
01:36:16,818 --> 01:36:23,058
(quirk of fate begins.)

2020
01:36:31,528 --> 01:36:32,828
It really felt...

2021
01:36:37,768 --> 01:36:42,107
like a precious trip.

2022
01:36:42,108 --> 01:36:43,238
"Will I really..."

2023
01:36:49,948 --> 01:36:51,178
"be able to..."

2024
01:36:51,918 --> 01:36:54,048
"experience a moment of this much joy..."

2025
01:36:56,458 --> 01:36:57,588
"in my life again?"

2026
01:36:57,958 --> 01:36:59,488
"It was really..."

2027
01:37:00,158 --> 01:37:02,328
"a moment filled with joy in my life."

2028
01:37:03,828 --> 01:37:05,228
Those were the thoughts I got.

2029
01:37:05,358 --> 01:37:06,468
I was really...

2030
01:37:08,328 --> 01:37:11,698
filled with so much joy.

2031
01:37:14,138 --> 01:37:16,637
That was how I felt.

2032
01:37:16,638 --> 01:37:18,078
Gosh.

2033
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:20,278
I didn't expect to cry. What's wrong with me?

2034
01:37:20,548 --> 01:37:21,608
Gosh.

2035
01:37:23,548 --> 01:37:24,778
Right.

2036
01:37:27,188 --> 01:37:31,188
(Possessed Love S2)

2037
01:37:31,418 --> 01:37:32,418
(Are you asking me out on a date?)

2038
01:37:32,419 --> 01:37:33,499
(These two are intriguing.)

2039
01:37:33,658 --> 01:37:35,628
(The hearts of the fortune tellers are moving.)

2040
01:37:35,758 --> 01:37:37,728
(I don't have the heart to talk more.)

2041
01:37:37,898 --> 01:37:39,998
(Crossing each other in confusion)

2042
01:37:40,198 --> 01:37:43,298
(The hearts of the fortune tellers are shaking.)

2043
01:37:43,368 --> 01:37:44,438
(She was so beautiful.)

2044
01:37:44,498 --> 01:37:46,608
(I don't want to return to the House.)

2045
01:37:46,708 --> 01:37:47,708
(Heart)

2046
01:37:47,708 --> 01:37:48,708
(The date was the best.)

2047
01:37:48,768 --> 01:37:49,777
(Because you were with me?)

2048
01:37:49,778 --> 01:37:52,438
(Crossroads of fate brought by mixed choices)

2049
01:37:52,508 --> 01:37:54,248
(Let's follow my heart.)

2050
01:37:54,478 --> 01:37:56,348
(Their emotions change endlessly.)

2051
01:37:56,478 --> 01:37:58,317
(As a man speaking to another man, )

2052
01:37:58,318 --> 01:38:00,217
(there is something I want to tell you.)

2053
01:38:00,218 --> 01:38:01,248
(Have a cup of this.)

2054
01:38:01,388 --> 01:38:04,058
(Relationships tangling up)

2055
01:38:04,288 --> 01:38:06,188
(What?)

2056
01:38:06,358 --> 01:38:07,457
This is amazing.

2057
01:38:07,458 --> 01:38:11,858
