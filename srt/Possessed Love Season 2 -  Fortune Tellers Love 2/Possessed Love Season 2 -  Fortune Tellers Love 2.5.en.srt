1
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:27,824
(All statements related to shamanism and fortune-telling...)

2
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:28,924
(made by the cast in this program...)

3
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:30,165
(are purely personal opinions.)

4
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:56,054
Is there a spot where the cameras can't catch us?

5
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:57,755
This looks like a good blind side, right?

6
00:01:13,735 --> 00:01:17,075
(Possessed Love S2)

7
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:18,615
Do you want to go on a date with me?

8
00:01:18,675 --> 00:01:21,504
(The First Come First Date brought upon confusion.)

9
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:22,614
Are you asking me out?

10
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:23,714
They were pretty funny.

11
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:25,145
You should have been nicer to me.

12
00:01:26,515 --> 00:01:28,785
(The fortune tellers are tempted by their new dates.)

13
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:30,354
It was beautiful.

14
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:32,185
- It's a heart.
- It is.

15
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:33,524
I liked the date best.

16
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:34,525
(Because you were with me?)

17
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:35,554
What's your ideal type?

18
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:36,895
I can't look you in the eyes.

19
00:01:37,725 --> 00:01:40,265
(Their feelings grow deeper.)

20
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:44,135
(The Gold Dragon, Sang Hyeok, makes a choice.)

21
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:47,005
(On Day 3, he picked Yun Jeong.)

22
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:50,104
(Tonight, no one chose you in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

23
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:51,205
This is wild.

24
00:01:51,835 --> 00:01:53,675
So, no one chose me.

25
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:59,285
(They weren't on the same page. Where will fate lead them?)

26
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:00,715
(Actress Yoo In Na and actor Yoo Seon Ho)

27
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:01,814
This should be interesting.

28
00:02:01,815 --> 00:02:02,815
(Dancer Gabee)

29
00:02:03,115 --> 00:02:04,384
This is so fun!

30
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:05,415
(Comedian Shin Dong Yeob)

31
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:06,885
This is so fun!

32
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:10,395
Oh, my gosh!

33
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:13,525
The First Come First Date was last week.

34
00:02:13,795 --> 00:02:16,364
The Gold Dragon, Sang Hyeok, finally arrived...

35
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:18,034
and had his first date.

36
00:02:18,035 --> 00:02:20,104
- Things were going great for them.
- Right.

37
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:22,575
But that night when it all ended,

38
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,734
- he got zero votes.
- Yes.

39
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:26,304
- He said, "This is wild."
- Yes.

40
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:27,305
(Even he didn't see it coming.)

41
00:02:27,306 --> 00:02:29,444
I can't tell what Yun Jeong is thinking.

42
00:02:29,445 --> 00:02:32,684
Maybe it's because she's interested in Ho Am,

43
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,484
or she just doesn't recognize him.

44
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:36,155
- She confuses you, right?
- Yes.

45
00:02:36,315 --> 00:02:37,815
I personally think...

46
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:39,585
she chose Ho Am.

47
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:42,054
Because she loved the date from the day before?

48
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:43,055
- No!
- She couldn't forget about it?

49
00:02:43,056 --> 00:02:47,195
I loved the date between Yu Gyeong and Ho Am!

50
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:49,464
- Oh, no.
- "They're going to be a couple,"

51
00:02:49,465 --> 00:02:51,394
- Indeed.
- I thought.

52
00:02:51,395 --> 00:02:54,504
Anyhow, we haven't seen all the text messages...

53
00:02:54,505 --> 00:02:56,304
from last week.

54
00:02:56,305 --> 00:03:00,274
We'll see how the rest of the text messages backfire.

55
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:01,874
- Let's check it out.
- I'm excited.

56
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,045
My heart is beating again.

57
00:03:03,345 --> 00:03:04,414
(Excited)

58
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:05,415
This should be fun.

59
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:09,255
(The 3rd night)

60
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:17,954
(Tonight, the Blue Chicken chose you.)

61
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:22,025
(Tonight, the Black Horse chose you.)

62
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:28,305
(Gang Won was chosen by Ra Yun and Yu Ra.)

63
00:03:28,705 --> 00:03:30,834
(Tonight, the White Monkey chose you.)

64
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,445
(Tonight, the Blue Chicken chose you.)

65
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:40,215
(Ra Yun was also chosen by two men.)

66
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:46,285
(Tonight, no one chose you in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

67
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:54,425
(Tonight, no one chose you in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

68
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:06,245
(Tonight, no one chose you in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

69
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,474
(Shocked)

70
00:04:08,475 --> 00:04:09,775
(Exclaiming)

71
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:14,085
No one chose him!

72
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:17,114
Byeong Yeol hasn't exactly been that proactive.

73
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:19,524
Yes. And he missed a date.

74
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,725
It looks like he can't set his mind on one person.

75
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:24,455
- He should make a move now.
- Yes.

76
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:27,765
Okay.

77
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:38,505
I saw it coming, but I wasn't so happy.

78
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:42,845
I needed at least a date with other women,

79
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:47,345
so I thought it'd be great to have that opportunity.

80
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:50,685
Now, I reckon that I should create one.

81
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:55,925
(He promises himself that he won't be deserted tomorrow.)

82
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:09,035
(Tonight, no one chose you in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

83
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:14,405
What?

84
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:20,814
(He reads it again, just in case.)

85
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:22,215
(Scoffing)

86
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:24,515
This is wild.

87
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:27,225
So, no one chose me.

88
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:30,825
No one chose me.

89
00:05:38,795 --> 00:05:41,155
His body language says that this has never happened before.

90
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:42,835
- He can't believe it.
- Exactly.

91
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:45,935
This means that Yun Jeong chose Ho Am.

92
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:49,415
(So, Yun Jeong chose Ho Am.)

93
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:51,945
Is that it?

94
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:53,845
I thought, "How did I get zero votes?"

95
00:05:54,315 --> 00:05:57,284
It wasn't like Yun Jeong was certain about me.

96
00:05:57,285 --> 00:05:59,314
So, I thought,

97
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:00,995
"Maybe she's interested in the other guy."

98
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,224
(During the date)

99
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:06,585
What did you talk about yesterday?

100
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:08,995
- During the date?
- Yes.

101
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:11,165
During the date...

102
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:16,005
- It was pretty much the same.
- Just regular stuff?

103
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:18,505
Yes, we asked about our hobbies.

104
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,504
Do you think there are people...

105
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:24,045
who already have feelings for others?

106
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:27,385
I bet everyone does, at least a little bit.

107
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:33,285
(Yun Jeong's words sounded significant.)

108
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:38,725
I think it's because I'm not so familiar with this.

109
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:42,324
I went on the dates when I wasn't ready yet.

110
00:06:42,325 --> 00:06:45,295
I guess that's why it was tougher for me.

111
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:48,935
Or it's because I wasn't in such a good condition.

112
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:52,004
So, I couldn't focus...

113
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:54,574
on the date with him...

114
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:57,045
as well as I did yesterday.

115
00:06:57,545 --> 00:06:59,784
(During yesterday's date)

116
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:00,885
(Sure.)

117
00:07:02,045 --> 00:07:05,755
(She felt unexpected excitement on her first date with Ho Am.)

118
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:09,055
(In the Hall of Sacred Spirits tonight)

119
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,695
(On the 3rd day, Yun Jeong chose Ho Am.)

120
00:07:16,295 --> 00:07:18,464
- She didn't even hesitate!
- She didn't take time to think.

121
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:19,504
(She chose Ho Am without hesitation.)

122
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,535
- But he has Yu Gyeong.
- Exactly.

123
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:25,374
Ho Am seems to have feelings...

124
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,474
for Yu Gyeong already.

125
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:28,474
Also, when they asked each other out,

126
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:30,774
she saw Ho Am asking Yu Gyeong out...

127
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:33,184
- in person.
- When he asked her out.

128
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:34,284
- Oh, you're right.
- Right.

129
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:35,745
Goodness. Ho Am,

130
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:37,525
this is going to be a love triangle.

131
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:39,415
Poor Yun Jeong.

132
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:50,094
(Tonight, the White Dog chose you.)

133
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:54,335
(Tonight, the Black Monkey chose you.)

134
00:07:55,665 --> 00:07:59,375
I tried so hard to find out who the Black Monkey was,

135
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:02,305
and I got a text from her,

136
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:05,745
so I was certain. It felt great.

137
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,515
Can you guess who the Black Monkey is?

138
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:12,485
I loved the date with Yu Gyeong,

139
00:08:13,455 --> 00:08:16,025
and I was chosen by the Black Monkey...

140
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,295
after the date with her.

141
00:08:18,495 --> 00:08:21,765
So, I assumed...

142
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:23,295
it was Yu Gyeong.

143
00:08:23,865 --> 00:08:26,904
I thought, "In the end, things are going..."

144
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:28,205
"as the first reading."

145
00:08:29,505 --> 00:08:33,675
(He finally got a text from the Black Monkey.)

146
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:35,945
Black Monkey.

147
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:39,645
(During the preselection)

148
00:08:40,615 --> 00:08:45,015
(One of his divine spirits picked his destined partner.)

149
00:08:47,155 --> 00:08:52,655
(He was strongly attracted to the Black Monkey.)

150
00:08:56,265 --> 00:08:59,135
(And tonight)

151
00:09:00,765 --> 00:09:05,075
(Who's the Black Monkey that chose Ho Am?)

152
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:13,215
(The Black Monkey was Yu Gyeong.)

153
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:16,414
When the divine spirit and the pupil have different opinions,

154
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:18,385
it leads to a conflict.

155
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:21,454
But the divine spirit chose Yu Gyeong,

156
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:23,595
and I was also attracted to her.

157
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:26,324
I reckoned that I should try harder...

158
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:28,695
to win her favour.

159
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:32,064
He picked the Black Monkey from the get-go.

160
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:34,434
That ought to give him conviction.

161
00:09:34,435 --> 00:09:35,435
- You're right.
- Exactly.

162
00:09:35,436 --> 00:09:37,604
- What do we do?
- Ho Am has a strong Metal Energy,

163
00:09:37,605 --> 00:09:39,474
and Yu Gyeong has a strong Water Energy.

164
00:09:39,475 --> 00:09:40,744
We say that Metal nourishes Water,

165
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:42,351
so the two energies complement each other.

166
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,744
So, you can say that they're compatible.

167
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:45,115
What about with Yun Jeong?

168
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:47,984
He and Yun Jeong both have a strong Metal Energy,

169
00:09:47,985 --> 00:09:50,655
so they're both firm.

170
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:53,284
They're more like friends or acquaintances.

171
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:55,484
I think Yu Gyeong suits him better as a partner...

172
00:09:55,485 --> 00:09:56,855
as she's more talented.

173
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:59,194
I guess they can't be that close.

174
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:00,195
(Too bad)

175
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:03,165
- This is...
- Will this go smoothly?

176
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:04,565
Right.

177
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:12,335
(Yu Gyeong got a text message.)

178
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:19,215
(Tonight, the White Chicken chose you.)

179
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:21,845
Oh, you're right!

180
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:28,155
(Staring)

181
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:30,325
White Chicken.

182
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:32,994
Ho Am.

183
00:10:32,995 --> 00:10:34,964
"I guess he had fun today."

184
00:10:34,965 --> 00:10:38,665
"We were on the same page." I was thinking that.

185
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:40,405
(In the Hall of Sacred Spirits tonight)

186
00:10:41,865 --> 00:10:47,145
(He chose Yu Gyeong without hesitation.)

187
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:56,985
(White Chicken, Jang Ho Am)

188
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:08,824
(Tonight, the Black Cow chose you.)

189
00:11:08,825 --> 00:11:13,365
(Tonight, the Gold Dragon chose you.)

190
00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:15,005
What's this?

191
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:21,504
I haven't gotten a text message from the animal...

192
00:11:21,505 --> 00:11:24,374
that I'm assuming is Ho Am.

193
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,085
So, I was expecting a text from him.

194
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:29,985
That was my biggest wish.

195
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:32,515
(Feeling bad)

196
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:34,154
- Oh, no!
- So, I guess she liked Ho Am...

197
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:35,384
aside from who the Gold Dragon was.

198
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:36,625
- I guess so.
- Yes.

199
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:39,055
- She even got two votes, but...
- Yes.

200
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:41,094
- Exactly.
- She's not so happy.

201
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:43,634
At this point, she might have realized that Sang Hyeok was...

202
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:45,565
- the Gold Dragon.
- Yes.

203
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:47,004
I have a feeling she did.

204
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:49,774
- Did she?
- She might not be sure...

205
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,604
if it was Sang Hyeok or Byeong Yeol.

206
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:54,905
- She's confused between the two.
- Oh, those two.

207
00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:58,175
I hope she realizes that it's Sang Hyeok.

208
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:03,185
(The night grows deeper as Yun Jeong is lost in thought.)

209
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:06,854
(There's a tarot reading booth in the women's room.)

210
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:09,155
- But you can't spread them.
- I'll just go with it.

211
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:11,455
I shuffle them like this.

212
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:14,224
(Fancy technique)

213
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:15,964
How do you shuffle them?

214
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:17,335
- She looks professional.
- Yes.

215
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:20,205
- Ask me a question.
- A question?

216
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:25,175
- How must I approach...
- Yes.

217
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:27,845
- a man...
- Yes.

218
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:30,375
That I'm interested in...

219
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:32,715
to be close with him?

220
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,385
Okay. Are you looking for advice?

221
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,455
- To be closer.
- Okay.

222
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:38,885
Advice on how to be closer.

223
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:41,155
- Closer...
- Oh, my gosh.

224
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:43,624
Pick them.

225
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,725
- Three cards?
- Yes.

226
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:48,325
Are you kneeling?

227
00:12:50,095 --> 00:12:51,265
These two.

228
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:53,535
She's cautious.

229
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,475
I'm nervous.

230
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:03,545
(What will the three cards tell her?)

231
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:06,515
(Nervous)

232
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,915
You're only reading the room.

233
00:13:09,585 --> 00:13:11,015
You're being too defensive.

234
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:13,784
You should let your guard down...

235
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:15,184
and try talking to him.

236
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:16,955
- Try talking to him?
- Yes.

237
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:19,095
- Really?
- That's exactly what I said.

238
00:13:19,195 --> 00:13:21,525
- The same things repeat.
- You already have...

239
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:24,494
that strength within you, so utilize that and make a move.

240
00:13:24,495 --> 00:13:25,694
- Make a move?
- Yes.

241
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:28,005
- Push herself?
- Yes. Be more proactive.

242
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,834
I guess everyone can tell.

243
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:30,934
- Don't think too much.
- Right.

244
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,304
- Why can't I see it, though?
- I told you the shamanic reading...

245
00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:34,604
from the spiritual realm.

246
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,575
And she told you with a tarot reading.

247
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:38,515
It comes down to the same solution.

248
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:40,414
That's fascinating.

249
00:13:40,415 --> 00:13:41,844
(The two gave the same advice with different methods.)

250
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:43,205
I want to take a picture of these.

251
00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:45,855
Good luck.

252
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:51,595
(The three talked all night.)

253
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:55,265
(The sun rises in no time.)

254
00:13:56,425 --> 00:13:58,865
(Aren't you guys sleepy?)

255
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:02,035
(Gathered)

256
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:04,845
What are you going to wear over that white T-shirt?

257
00:14:05,035 --> 00:14:06,974
Not a zip-up hoodie. A thin...

258
00:14:06,975 --> 00:14:07,975
A cardigan?

259
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:12,675
(The men are busy picking their outfits in the morning.)

260
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:17,785
(Taking off)

261
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:20,255
Oh, man.

262
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:22,325
(His jaws drop.)

263
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,535
You have such a beautiful body.

264
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:27,894
Oh, right.

265
00:14:27,895 --> 00:14:30,035
The world is so unfair.

266
00:14:30,095 --> 00:14:31,235
Why?

267
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:35,065
He's tall and handsome, and he's fit.

268
00:14:35,335 --> 00:14:37,835
Why are those two men behind him...

269
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:42,905
(Staring)

270
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:46,715
(Noticing them)

271
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:49,885
(Two meerkats)

272
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:55,025
(He quickly changes as they're staring.)

273
00:14:55,455 --> 00:14:57,025
If I had done that...

274
00:14:58,225 --> 00:14:59,295
Try it.

275
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,295
I dare you.

276
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:04,095
- Maybe later.
- "Later."

277
00:15:04,765 --> 00:15:06,235
When I have the courage.

278
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:08,405
How old are you?

279
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:14,405
Should I eat cereal? I'm hungry.

280
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:19,275
(The participants are gathered in one room.)

281
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:21,885
What do these eyes mean?

282
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,655
That thing gives off a bad energy.

283
00:15:25,455 --> 00:15:27,925
I think my painting from yesterday is better.

284
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:31,065
You thought it was good, right?

285
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:32,695
Yes. I'm happy with it.

286
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,394
(Gazing)

287
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,895
Oh, really?

288
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:42,135
The bracelet's colour changes according to the temperature.

289
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:44,305
Right?

290
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:47,035
Are you feeling all right now?

291
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,075
Are you feeling all right now?

292
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:50,275
(Nodding)

293
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:56,185
At least you don't skip breakfast.

294
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:57,955
I'm going to start eating it now.

295
00:15:59,285 --> 00:16:01,084
To bring up my energy.

296
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,355
- Bring up your energy?
- Yes.

297
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:04,925
I didn't sleep so well last night, so...

298
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:07,665
- You didn't sleep well last night?
- No.

299
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:09,365
Why not?

300
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,035
(She can't tell him why.)

301
00:16:14,635 --> 00:16:16,675
(Tapping)

302
00:16:18,405 --> 00:16:20,305
It's about something personal.

303
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,105
It's about something personal.

304
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:25,875
But can you read my fortune...

305
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:28,444
- when you're free?
- Sure.

306
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,585
Let me ask you for a favour.

307
00:16:34,885 --> 00:16:39,425
(What's on Sang Hyeok's mind?)

308
00:16:42,565 --> 00:16:45,664
- Sang Hyeok looks so down.
- He does.

309
00:16:45,665 --> 00:16:48,504
He saw Yun Jeong...

310
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:50,504
whisper into Ho Am's ears right before his eyes.

311
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:51,865
He couldn't have heard her, right?

312
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:54,174
- That's even more upsetting.
- I know.

313
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:56,374
His imagination would get wilder if he didn't.

314
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,444
- He'll start imagining.
- Yes.

315
00:16:58,445 --> 00:17:00,384
At that moment,

316
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:02,514
he must have realized that she chose Ho Am.

317
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:03,914
- Definitely.
- I bet he realized.

318
00:17:03,915 --> 00:17:05,591
- He absolutely did.
- He must have noticed it.

319
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:06,725
Hang on.

320
00:17:06,855 --> 00:17:08,785
If Sang Hyeok said,

321
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:11,595
"Why is it so hot in here," and took his shirt off...

322
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:13,124
(He goes too far with his jokes once again.)

323
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,024
- Is that too soon?
- What would happen, then?

324
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:16,934
He could do that if it was summer.

325
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,765
That's so silly.

326
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:27,875
What do you think? Let's go.

327
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:29,375
- We need to go.
- It's time.

328
00:17:29,575 --> 00:17:30,714
We have to go now.

329
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:31,715
(Rushing out)

330
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:32,845
Goodness.

331
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:34,845
All right.

332
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:37,815
(Bursting into laughter)

333
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:41,125
The Pavilion of Connections is open.

334
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:44,254
The Pavilion of Connections is open.

335
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:45,575
It's the Pavilion of Connections.

336
00:17:47,465 --> 00:17:51,595
(Pavilion of Connections)

337
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:00,904
(Here, anyone is free to explore their romantic fate.)

338
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:02,574
(Only two people may enter at a time, regardless of gender.)

339
00:18:02,575 --> 00:18:05,135
(However, sharing each other's saju information is not allowed.)

340
00:18:06,075 --> 00:18:09,215
You may now glimpse or tell the fortune...

341
00:18:09,385 --> 00:18:10,855
of someone you're interested in.

342
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:14,985
Are you curious about anyone?

343
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:17,754
I haven't even talked to all of them, so...

344
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:18,755
- Right.
- Right.

345
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:21,315
I think it's a little too soon to be curious about anyone.

346
00:18:22,465 --> 00:18:26,635
(There's a subtle tension in the air.)

347
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:28,435
We can go right away, right?

348
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:30,175
Right away?

349
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:33,335
Yes. You, come outside.

350
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:34,444
Me?

351
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:35,645
(Startled)

352
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:40,715
(Gang Won chose Byeong Yeol.)

353
00:18:41,185 --> 00:18:42,545
I'll get a glass of water.

354
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,885
- Do you have anyone?
- What? Do I have anyone?

355
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:48,545
Anyone's fortune you want to read?

356
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:49,784
She gets straight to the point.

357
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:51,705
"I'll get a glass of water. Do you have anyone?"

358
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:54,665
- Right away...
- I know, right?

359
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:56,971
- "Do you have anyone?"
- She surprised me as well.

360
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:58,165
"Do you have anyone?"

361
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:00,611
She didn't think there were any cameras.

362
00:19:00,635 --> 00:19:01,965
But we have cameras everywhere.

363
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:03,675
Yu Gyeong is so charming.

364
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:07,375
- Do you have anyone?
- What? Do I have anyone?

365
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:08,865
Anyone's fortune you want to read?

366
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:12,575
(The anxious women gather in the kitchen.)

367
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:14,785
Should we read everyone we're curious about?

368
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,995
I think we get to bring one person and tell theirs.

369
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:22,784
That sound drains me.

370
00:19:22,785 --> 00:19:26,625
(The sound of bells drains them already.)

371
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:30,895
I'm curious.

372
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,035
I never imagined that you'd pick me.

373
00:19:34,165 --> 00:19:35,465
I know.

374
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,175
(Two men enter the Pavilion of Connections.)

375
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,304
- Can I sit here?
- Sure.

376
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:40,344
It's just that I use my right hand.

377
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,175
(Two men enter the Pavilion of Connections.)

378
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:45,245
(Getting his things)

379
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:52,485
(Getting straight to the point)

380
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:54,024
(Nervous)

381
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:55,025
This is great.

382
00:19:57,525 --> 00:20:02,165
(This is great.)

383
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:05,785
I'm a little excited.

384
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:08,285
- You know, - Yes.

385
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:12,025
It's actually my first time telling your fortune.

386
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:13,325
But I felt...

387
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:18,165
- so bad for you, man to man.
- I see.

388
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:27,074
(Byeong Yeol has been in bed all day after the job reveal.)

389
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:28,505
There's no way.

390
00:20:31,345 --> 00:20:34,185
(Yawning)

391
00:20:35,145 --> 00:20:36,384
I'm so bored.

392
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:37,915
(Scratching)

393
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,855
(A reading for Byeong Yeol who's been drained the whole time)

394
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:46,795
Give me a moment.

395
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:49,065
Sure.

396
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,135
Give me a moment. I'll go and ask.

397
00:21:05,175 --> 00:21:08,915
(His eyes shake.)

398
00:21:14,755 --> 00:21:18,995
(Contacting his divine spirit)

399
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:26,765
(Nervous)

400
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:33,035
(What will Gang Won's divine spirit say?)

401
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:37,005
(Whistling)

402
00:21:38,975 --> 00:21:42,845
(Whistling hard)

403
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:49,925
(The divine spirit must have a lot to tell me.)

404
00:21:50,795 --> 00:21:54,695
(He heard everything from the divine spirit.)

405
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:00,965
First of all,

406
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:04,985
I'd like to congratulate you, to be honest.

407
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:08,645
I'll tell you why.

408
00:22:11,575 --> 00:22:13,414
Granny believes...

409
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,684
that only a handful of us...

410
00:22:15,685 --> 00:22:18,455
will find our partners in the end.

411
00:22:18,555 --> 00:22:20,724
She says it's a couple or two at best.

412
00:22:20,725 --> 00:22:22,755
And you're one of them.

413
00:22:28,295 --> 00:22:31,035
If I were to pick one for you...

414
00:22:31,895 --> 00:22:33,865
You already have...

415
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:36,004
feelings for someone, so you're certain.

416
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:37,365
You already have feelings for her,

417
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:40,034
yet you have too many unnecessary thoughts...

418
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:42,304
and excuses,

419
00:22:42,305 --> 00:22:43,475
so it's making her waver.

420
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:47,044
The issue isn't your indecisiveness...

421
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:48,385
or that you're lost.

422
00:22:48,745 --> 00:22:49,784
It's that you lack the will.

423
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,415
(You lack the will.)

424
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:57,025
(The harsh truth came from Gang Won out of the blue.)

425
00:22:57,195 --> 00:22:59,554
In this situation, you're losing more things...

426
00:22:59,555 --> 00:23:00,565
by being calculative.

427
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:05,265
What do you think?

428
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:06,795
I like it. I needed to hear that.

429
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:11,775
I think that you have a point.

430
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:15,845
I thought that I had enough time,

431
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:19,875
but I should be more enthusiastic and show them my different sides.

432
00:23:20,475 --> 00:23:23,814
I was thinking...

433
00:23:23,815 --> 00:23:24,985
that I should start fresh,

434
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,475
and I think you saw through that.

435
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:31,325
- Anyway, - Yes.

436
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:33,425
I got sidetracked there.

437
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:38,594
She says that your wish will come true.

438
00:23:38,595 --> 00:23:40,235
(Granny says things will go as he wants.)

439
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:42,504
I believe that you're the only one...

440
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,104
who can reach...

441
00:23:44,105 --> 00:23:46,475
a good conclusion here.

442
00:23:48,075 --> 00:23:50,714
When you took out your five-element flags...

443
00:23:50,715 --> 00:23:52,035
as you spoke, what did that mean?

444
00:23:52,175 --> 00:23:54,645
She tells you to push forward.

445
00:23:56,745 --> 00:23:58,185
The picture I saw on my fan...

446
00:23:59,015 --> 00:24:00,935
and the picture I saw on my flags were the same.

447
00:24:02,325 --> 00:24:05,025
Everyone has a different pace,

448
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:09,624
so you're not slow. You were simply being careful.

449
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:12,595
(He's lost deeper in thought after hearing Gang Won's reading.)

450
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:19,435
(Yu Ra visited the Pavilion of Connections.)

451
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:23,375
(Nervous)

452
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:36,155
(Contacting his divine spirit again)

453
00:24:40,995 --> 00:24:45,265
(Gang Won's divine spirit is pretty busy today.)

454
00:24:58,645 --> 00:25:01,515
(She's not used to seeing Gang Won's professional side.)

455
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:04,715
What do you think I'll talk about first?

456
00:25:05,515 --> 00:25:06,984
- I have no idea.
- Not at all?

457
00:25:06,985 --> 00:25:07,985
No.

458
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:11,655
(Anxious)

459
00:25:13,795 --> 00:25:16,995
She tells me that you should stop hiding it and follow your heart.

460
00:25:19,965 --> 00:25:21,935
I came here to tell you that.

461
00:25:25,575 --> 00:25:28,145
She tells you to be honest.

462
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,474
(Thinking)

463
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:32,595
No matter how many times I ask, it's the same answer.

464
00:25:32,745 --> 00:25:34,715
Listening to your reading...

465
00:25:37,715 --> 00:25:38,815
I'm not so sure.

466
00:25:42,725 --> 00:25:50,065
(Will Yu Ra's day go as Gang Won's reading?)

467
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:58,135
(Ra Yun and Hyeon U also visited the Pavilion of Connections.)

468
00:25:58,635 --> 00:26:02,605
Jung. Are you from the Jung clan of Dongnae?

469
00:26:02,705 --> 00:26:03,945
Which clan are you from?

470
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:05,574
- Yeonil.
- Yeonil?

471
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:07,385
(She checks his clan first.)

472
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:18,695
(Nervous)

473
00:26:29,705 --> 00:26:30,705
(Letting out a giggle)

474
00:26:30,935 --> 00:26:33,534
No, don't go that far.

475
00:26:33,535 --> 00:26:34,775
Don't go too deep.

476
00:26:35,545 --> 00:26:37,645
Just tell me about him as a person.

477
00:26:48,585 --> 00:26:50,524
(Showing the whites of her eyes)

478
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,525
This is bad.

479
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:54,995
Why do they keep...

480
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,325
giving me spiritual messages?

481
00:26:59,165 --> 00:27:00,834
They're putting me on the spot.

482
00:27:00,835 --> 00:27:02,634
(A spiritual message is a prophecy from the divine spirit.)

483
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:03,635
Do you have a result?

484
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:05,935
I'm sorry.

485
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:08,005
I didn't mean to tell your fortune.

486
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:10,575
I heard all types of stuff.

487
00:27:12,045 --> 00:27:13,245
Maybe I should read yours too.

488
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:16,615
Will you tell me after you read it?

489
00:27:17,085 --> 00:27:18,385
- Should I?
- Sure.

490
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:25,555
(The two shamans tell each other's fortunes.)

491
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:18,814
(Covering his mouth)

492
00:28:18,815 --> 00:28:20,645
Feel free to tell me all of it.

493
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:26,385
(Sharing the reading)

494
00:28:28,255 --> 00:28:30,055
The first thing I heard was, "Poor her."

495
00:28:33,055 --> 00:28:35,165
My spirit said the same thing.

496
00:28:37,635 --> 00:28:38,894
That's why I laughed.

497
00:28:38,895 --> 00:28:40,795
(Their divine spirits said the same thing.)

498
00:28:43,565 --> 00:28:46,434
Our divine spirits seem to be on the same page.

499
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:47,904
And this is very rare...

500
00:28:47,905 --> 00:28:49,375
- in our industry.
- Right.

501
00:28:50,745 --> 00:28:54,685
But when I saw your divine spirit,

502
00:28:55,785 --> 00:28:58,585
it helped me clear up some confusion.

503
00:29:00,215 --> 00:29:02,355
- I also understood...
- Yes.

504
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,324
- what your divine spirit meant.
- Yes.

505
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,394
(The two of them checked their spiritual chemistry.)

506
00:29:06,395 --> 00:29:07,425
Right.

507
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:12,535
(Meanwhile, around the same time...)

508
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:14,235
My gosh. This is...

509
00:29:17,165 --> 00:29:21,175
(Yun Jeong also has a lot on her mind.)

510
00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:27,715
(After the big showdown of spiritual readings...)

511
00:29:34,925 --> 00:29:38,895
I want to get closer to Yu Gyeong more actively.

512
00:29:39,555 --> 00:29:41,165
I'll always stay by her side,

513
00:29:41,765 --> 00:29:43,195
follow her around,

514
00:29:44,095 --> 00:29:46,765
and spend time with her. I believe gestures like that...

515
00:29:46,895 --> 00:29:49,135
can give a sense of assurance.

516
00:29:52,475 --> 00:29:54,905
- Yu Gyeong, do you want to go out?
- What? Me?

517
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:56,575
(Me?)

518
00:29:56,775 --> 00:29:57,814
(Surprised)

519
00:29:57,815 --> 00:29:59,844
(Ho Am ambushes her with a request.)

520
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:02,515
Ho Am must have mustered up a lot of courage to ask me.

521
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:04,914
I was very grateful.

522
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:07,885
But I realized that he might be able to read my mind.

523
00:30:08,355 --> 00:30:09,715
When that thought crossed my mind,

524
00:30:10,355 --> 00:30:13,095
I was a bit scared.

525
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:16,765
I didn't want him to read me. That's how I felt.

526
00:30:20,835 --> 00:30:23,265
I wonder what you're going to tell me.

527
00:30:26,005 --> 00:30:27,105
I'm getting scared.

528
00:30:28,805 --> 00:30:30,944
Didn't we each draw a flag yesterday?

529
00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:32,015
- Yes.
- My gosh.

530
00:30:32,345 --> 00:30:34,314
I don't know how many years it has been...

531
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:36,285
since someone else did a reading on me.

532
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:40,485
I'm getting nervous, sir.

533
00:30:48,665 --> 00:30:50,665
(At the same time)

534
00:30:56,305 --> 00:31:00,605
(Yun Jeong is still in the same spot.)

535
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:09,185
(Nervous)

536
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:14,985
I hope the princesses do the reading.

537
00:31:15,385 --> 00:31:16,525
- The princesses?
- Yes.

538
00:31:18,395 --> 00:31:20,094
No. I can't let them possess me here.

539
00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:22,025
Why not? We had fun yesterday.

540
00:31:24,025 --> 00:31:27,935
I'm nervous.

541
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:32,335
(Ho Am's shamanic tools is neatly placed.)

542
00:31:34,975 --> 00:31:36,545
- I'll begin.
- Yes.

543
00:32:05,275 --> 00:32:08,475
(Ho Am smiles softly.)

544
00:32:12,915 --> 00:32:17,885
(Ho Am is asking his divine spirit about his connection to her.)

545
00:32:19,255 --> 00:32:23,255
(Yu Gyeong calmly waits for him.)

546
00:32:23,755 --> 00:32:27,965
(What kind of response did he receive?)

547
00:32:35,635 --> 00:32:37,334
Yu Gyeong. You like it...

548
00:32:37,335 --> 00:32:38,835
- when people are honest.
- Yes.

549
00:32:39,775 --> 00:32:40,805
That's true.

550
00:32:41,445 --> 00:32:45,275
You like honesty and confidence.

551
00:32:45,575 --> 00:32:46,975
That's what you like.

552
00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:48,545
Yes.

553
00:32:48,745 --> 00:32:50,445
I'm an honest and confident person.

554
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:58,355
I won't make you wonder about where I stand in a relationship.

555
00:32:58,825 --> 00:33:02,525
I can't stop feeling attracted to you.

556
00:33:02,895 --> 00:33:04,735
I want to be with you.

557
00:33:05,135 --> 00:33:06,894
I'm trying my best not to make it obvious.

558
00:33:06,895 --> 00:33:09,365
But I'm the most nervous when I'm in front of you.

559
00:33:09,935 --> 00:33:11,335
When you're in front of me,

560
00:33:12,135 --> 00:33:15,105
my heart keeps pounding. Only when you're around.

561
00:33:15,945 --> 00:33:17,675
Oh, my.

562
00:33:19,775 --> 00:33:21,484
(Heart-fluttering)

563
00:33:21,485 --> 00:33:23,045
(Touched)

564
00:33:23,685 --> 00:33:25,325
- He's confessing his feelings.
- Oh, my.

565
00:33:25,885 --> 00:33:27,415
- Is this for real?
- My goodness.

566
00:33:27,685 --> 00:33:29,824
He's telling her everything as if he was reading a letter.

567
00:33:29,825 --> 00:33:30,984
(What he said could be from a movie.)

568
00:33:30,985 --> 00:33:32,325
- That was so romantic.
- Oh, my.

569
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:34,071
- It was the sweetest thing to say.
- Totally.

570
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,164
I've never seen anyone confess their feelings this way...

571
00:33:36,165 --> 00:33:37,224
- on a dating show.
- Right.

572
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:39,235
- But that's so cool.
- Yes.

573
00:33:40,965 --> 00:33:42,511
He said he was an honest and confident man.

574
00:33:42,535 --> 00:33:44,375
- My gosh.
- She likes honesty and confidence.

575
00:33:46,035 --> 00:33:50,575
(Ho Am's confession to her showed a sense of honesty and confidence.)

576
00:33:51,515 --> 00:33:54,175
(Shy)

577
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:56,815
I want to do a reading on you too.

578
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:05,555
And...

579
00:34:06,525 --> 00:34:08,925
Before coming onto this show,

580
00:34:09,825 --> 00:34:11,964
I thought about the possibility that my divine spirit and I...

581
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:13,935
might choose different people.

582
00:34:14,235 --> 00:34:15,305
Right.

583
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:20,335
But my princesses told me they liked you.

584
00:34:21,075 --> 00:34:22,175
Really?

585
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:24,174
My fairy said...

586
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:25,414
- she liked everything about you.
- Okay.

587
00:34:25,415 --> 00:34:27,245
She said you were beautiful and great.

588
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:29,075
- Okay. What?
- But she had to say one thing.

589
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:33,255
She said she was jealous.

590
00:34:34,525 --> 00:34:35,725
Why? Of what?

591
00:34:35,985 --> 00:34:37,155
I don't know.

592
00:34:41,725 --> 00:34:43,025
Thank you.

593
00:34:45,065 --> 00:34:46,095
But...

594
00:34:46,495 --> 00:34:48,205
My gosh, this is making me feel so shy.

595
00:34:54,435 --> 00:34:57,205
I want us to draw a flag each like last time.

596
00:34:58,275 --> 00:34:59,445
Seriously?

597
00:35:00,075 --> 00:35:01,395
Do you think things have changed?

598
00:35:04,045 --> 00:35:05,085
I'm nervous.

599
00:35:05,415 --> 00:35:07,485
- Should I go first?
- How about at the same time?

600
00:35:10,385 --> 00:35:11,495
Hold on.

601
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:35,145
(Smiling)

602
00:35:36,085 --> 00:35:39,185
Since you're a shaman, I'm sure you know what this means.

603
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:45,025
This is crazy.

604
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:47,625
(Surprised)

605
00:35:48,265 --> 00:35:52,194
(The reading is interpreted as the perfect connection.)

606
00:35:52,195 --> 00:35:53,894
With that, he will be completely certain.

607
00:35:53,895 --> 00:35:55,364
He will think that...

608
00:35:55,365 --> 00:35:56,604
- she is the one for him.
- Yes.

609
00:35:56,605 --> 00:35:58,304
- Nothing can be better than that.
- I see.

610
00:35:58,305 --> 00:35:59,504
He won't doubt.

611
00:35:59,505 --> 00:36:01,444
When he asked her to pick the flag, he flirted with his finger.

612
00:36:01,445 --> 00:36:02,675
Their fingers touched.

613
00:36:02,975 --> 00:36:04,814
They touched just slightly. Their fingers grazed each other.

614
00:36:04,815 --> 00:36:07,545
(The confession with the flags is heart-fluttering in many ways.)

615
00:36:09,985 --> 00:36:11,145
This is crazy.

616
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:14,784
I wanted to show this combination, so I asked you to grab one together.

617
00:36:14,785 --> 00:36:15,885
Really?

618
00:36:16,255 --> 00:36:17,385
This is crazy.

619
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:21,665
Thank you.

620
00:36:22,865 --> 00:36:26,895
It feels like no other reading can top this.

621
00:36:28,665 --> 00:36:30,965
I wanted to show her...

622
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:33,405
that we were meant to be.

623
00:36:33,535 --> 00:36:35,545
She's a shaman, so she could feel it too.

624
00:36:35,975 --> 00:36:37,305
"Look at the five-element flags."

625
00:36:38,245 --> 00:36:40,945
"This is a spiritual union."

626
00:36:40,975 --> 00:36:43,615
As a shaman, here's how I felt.

627
00:36:43,815 --> 00:36:46,155
He said a lot of things that could belong in a proposal.

628
00:36:47,015 --> 00:36:49,184
We drew the red and white flags. Honestly speaking,

629
00:36:49,185 --> 00:36:53,094
I thought it was a very good result. I accepted it as a blessing.

630
00:36:53,095 --> 00:36:56,525
This time around, both Ho Am and I felt it...

631
00:36:57,165 --> 00:36:58,835
more clearly.

632
00:36:59,835 --> 00:37:01,865
I was quite surprised.

633
00:37:02,065 --> 00:37:05,105
(Their connection is blessed by the divine spirits.)

634
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:07,174
Shall we go inside?

635
00:37:07,175 --> 00:37:08,275
(Nodding)

636
00:37:14,945 --> 00:37:16,845
- Are you nervous?
- What? A lot.

637
00:37:19,985 --> 00:37:21,825
Hearing that is making me nervous.

638
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,225
Seriously.

639
00:37:24,385 --> 00:37:26,495
- You wanted me to see this combo?
- Yes.

640
00:37:28,465 --> 00:37:32,995
(Meanwhile, Yun Jeong is still thinking.)

641
00:37:33,635 --> 00:37:37,105
(What has she decided after thinking long and hard about it?)

642
00:37:39,075 --> 00:37:40,405
Just do both.

643
00:37:46,245 --> 00:37:50,685
(Yun Jeong begins to move after making up her mind.)

644
00:37:52,915 --> 00:37:55,455
(Hesitant)

645
00:37:55,685 --> 00:37:56,925
That's possible. No?

646
00:37:58,055 --> 00:37:59,655
I haven't done one with a woman.

647
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:02,124
- What do you think?
- Shall we go?

648
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:03,164
- Shall we?
- Don't do it?

649
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:05,794
But I can ask you, right? I've thought a lot about this.

650
00:38:05,795 --> 00:38:07,995
- Really? What do you want to read?
- How does it look?

651
00:38:08,765 --> 00:38:11,104
- You want to help me decide?
- Yes.

652
00:38:11,105 --> 00:38:12,174
I'm good.

653
00:38:12,175 --> 00:38:14,295
(She asks Yu Gyeong to have a conversation with her.)

654
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:16,004
(Tapping)

655
00:38:16,005 --> 00:38:17,444
Let me do a reading on you at the Pavilion of Connections.

656
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:19,175
- Sure.
- Really?

657
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,044
One last time.

658
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:24,085
(Yun Jeong wants to do a reading on them clueless of what happened.)

659
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:29,785
- Let's go.
- Gosh, I'm nervous.

660
00:38:31,695 --> 00:38:32,895
- Great.
- Yes.

661
00:38:34,795 --> 00:38:37,525
I'm trying to read your mind as clearly as possible.

662
00:38:38,835 --> 00:38:40,435
I'm trying to show it to you too.

663
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:46,805
(Yun Jeong casts the rune dice.)

664
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:57,345
(How will the dice read Yu Gyeong?)

665
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:03,955
Someone who can help you stand out.

666
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:05,424
Someone who can help me stand out?

667
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:09,395
Someone who can help you stand out.

668
00:39:12,265 --> 00:39:15,105
But it says there may be a sudden change.

669
00:39:16,005 --> 00:39:18,405
- So this is Uranus.
- Okay.

670
00:39:19,335 --> 00:39:21,205
Uranus represents sudden changes.

671
00:39:21,335 --> 00:39:23,045
It symbolizes confusion.

672
00:39:26,175 --> 00:39:29,785
So there might be an event that could contribute...

673
00:39:30,145 --> 00:39:31,484
to such a sudden change.

674
00:39:31,485 --> 00:39:35,385
You might suddenly feel that you're in the limelight.

675
00:39:37,785 --> 00:39:39,855
- Should I do a card reading next?
- Yes.

676
00:39:41,455 --> 00:39:42,855
Are you getting anything from this?

677
00:39:46,265 --> 00:39:48,865
This actually happened a moment ago.

678
00:39:49,835 --> 00:39:50,865
So...

679
00:39:51,235 --> 00:39:52,705
It literally happened a moment ago.

680
00:39:53,335 --> 00:39:54,404
Really?

681
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:55,775
- Yes.
- Was it subtle?

682
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:57,304
No, it wasn't subtle.

683
00:39:57,305 --> 00:40:00,144
You said there could be an event that could surprise me.

684
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:03,715
A moment ago, I was quite surprised.

685
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:05,515
It happened literally a moment ago.

686
00:40:05,715 --> 00:40:06,835
Did it make your heart beat?

687
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:09,325
- It made my heart pound quite hard.
- Really?

688
00:40:10,855 --> 00:40:11,894
Yes.

689
00:40:11,895 --> 00:40:13,325
(Thinking hard)

690
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:16,464
- You can't, right?
- What?

691
00:40:16,465 --> 00:40:17,525
You can't tell me, right?

692
00:40:17,825 --> 00:40:19,394
- I'm not sure about that.
- You can't tell me, right?

693
00:40:19,395 --> 00:40:21,565
I don't think I should.

694
00:40:22,265 --> 00:40:23,335
Right.

695
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:26,035
(A moment ago)

696
00:40:26,605 --> 00:40:29,945
(My heart keeps pounding.)

697
00:40:30,205 --> 00:40:33,915
(Yun Jeong doesn't know what happened between them.)

698
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:37,844
I'm so curious. Seriously.

699
00:40:37,845 --> 00:40:39,685
- You're curious about that?
- I want to chat.

700
00:40:40,455 --> 00:40:41,725
I want to chat with you.

701
00:40:41,825 --> 00:40:43,125
"What happened?"

702
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:45,195
Anyway...

703
00:40:46,355 --> 00:40:48,564
Oh, no. Poor Yun Jeong.

704
00:40:48,565 --> 00:40:51,224
- My gosh. I wouldn't want to ask, - Yes.

705
00:40:51,225 --> 00:40:53,264
But I would be so curious and might ask her.

706
00:40:53,265 --> 00:40:54,964
It looks like Yun Jeong knows, though.

707
00:40:54,965 --> 00:40:56,134
I think she does. She might be...

708
00:40:56,135 --> 00:40:57,495
- pretending not to know.
- Right.

709
00:41:00,105 --> 00:41:01,675
(Dropping)

710
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,904
What? Should we check this card?

711
00:41:03,905 --> 00:41:07,115
(A card falls onto her lap.)

712
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,984
It's another card that says you will stand out.

713
00:41:09,985 --> 00:41:12,145
It's the Leo Zodiac Card which means you'll stand out.

714
00:41:13,315 --> 00:41:14,515
Stand out?

715
00:41:15,425 --> 00:41:16,484
You will stand out.

716
00:41:16,485 --> 00:41:18,485
You'll be in the limelight and become the emperor.

717
00:41:20,295 --> 00:41:22,725
Yu Gyeong, you're in the center of the attention.

718
00:41:23,395 --> 00:41:26,635
He will make you feel that way when he talks to you.

719
00:41:27,335 --> 00:41:29,235
So he's someone you can talk to.

720
00:41:29,635 --> 00:41:32,375
Does it mean he and I are quite compatible?

721
00:41:34,005 --> 00:41:36,105
But are you attracted to someone like that?

722
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:37,844
What do you think?

723
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:39,275
I've never dated anyone like that.

724
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:41,374
- Never? You can't imagine it?
- No.

725
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:43,585
No. But...

726
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,346
the guy who surprised me just now might be whom you're talking about.

727
00:41:47,385 --> 00:41:49,265
When he talked to me, he made me feel that way.

728
00:41:49,455 --> 00:41:50,825
That's just how I felt.

729
00:41:50,985 --> 00:41:53,225
Was it a similar vibe?

730
00:41:53,655 --> 00:41:54,725
Yes.

731
00:41:57,095 --> 00:41:58,165
This too.

732
00:42:00,335 --> 00:42:01,565
- You're crossing over.
- Yes.

733
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:05,505
How beautiful.

734
00:42:06,035 --> 00:42:07,135
Interpret it.

735
00:42:09,345 --> 00:42:11,545
It looks like you're going on an adventure.

736
00:42:12,315 --> 00:42:13,775
Into the unknown.

737
00:42:14,775 --> 00:42:18,315
But you must feel a sense of warmth on the journey.

738
00:42:19,355 --> 00:42:22,885
And you can identify with him spiritually.

739
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,565
I can identify with him spiritually?

740
00:42:25,155 --> 00:42:27,155
(Surprised)

741
00:42:37,405 --> 00:42:40,074
(Ho Am and Yu Gyeong confirmed...)

742
00:42:40,075 --> 00:42:42,775
(that their spiritual connection was blessed.)

743
00:42:45,175 --> 00:42:48,545
Actually, if this is about the guy I was with just now,

744
00:42:49,815 --> 00:42:51,545
everything makes perfect sense.

745
00:42:52,555 --> 00:42:53,654
- Really?
- Yes.

746
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,154
- It's perfect from A to Z.
- I don't know who it is.

747
00:42:56,155 --> 00:42:57,524
To be honest, I'm getting goosebumps now.

748
00:42:57,525 --> 00:42:58,655
- Really?
- Yes.

749
00:42:58,955 --> 00:43:02,095
It happened just now. It hadn't even been an hour yet.

750
00:43:02,725 --> 00:43:04,425
- This really happened.
- It happened.

751
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:09,334
It had been several years since my heart pounded like that.

752
00:43:09,335 --> 00:43:11,735
- That's fascinating.
- That's what happened to me.

753
00:43:13,475 --> 00:43:15,745
So I'm very surprised.

754
00:43:16,775 --> 00:43:17,845
Your reading is spot on.

755
00:43:20,775 --> 00:43:21,985
I can't watch this.

756
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:24,985
(Feeling awful)

757
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:28,425
- You feel bad for her, don't you?
- Right. I feel so bad.

758
00:43:28,485 --> 00:43:29,524
Is it because we already watched it?

759
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:30,754
- Everything she said...
- Yes.

760
00:43:30,755 --> 00:43:32,115
- was spot on.
- I got goosebumps.

761
00:43:32,155 --> 00:43:33,225
I got goosebumps.

762
00:43:33,355 --> 00:43:34,554
How does Yun Jeong feel...

763
00:43:34,555 --> 00:43:35,795
- to do the reading?
- Right.

764
00:43:40,065 --> 00:43:41,394
I surprised myself.

765
00:43:41,395 --> 00:43:42,635
I could sense it.

766
00:43:42,735 --> 00:43:47,175
I tried to sort out my feelings calmly.

767
00:43:48,035 --> 00:43:50,644
I tried my best to get myself together.

768
00:43:50,645 --> 00:43:53,645
(I tried my best to get myself together.)

769
00:44:04,025 --> 00:44:05,425
(Softly screaming)

770
00:44:07,855 --> 00:44:08,965
(Smiling)

771
00:44:09,925 --> 00:44:11,065
You're here.

772
00:44:11,225 --> 00:44:12,335
Do you need the blanket?

773
00:44:12,835 --> 00:44:14,195
No, I'm good.

774
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,165
All right, let's do this.

775
00:44:19,305 --> 00:44:23,005
(Ho Am stays still and feels the energy.)

776
00:44:27,345 --> 00:44:28,485
(Opening his eyes)

777
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:38,284
It looks like you're trying to make a move.

778
00:44:38,285 --> 00:44:39,425
Make a move?

779
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:43,825
It seems you want to run.

780
00:44:44,195 --> 00:44:46,065
- Run?
- This is a running card.

781
00:44:46,195 --> 00:44:47,365
You're breaking free.

782
00:44:48,805 --> 00:44:50,045
You want to go on an adventure.

783
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:51,535
- Go on an adventure?
- Yes.

784
00:44:52,805 --> 00:44:53,905
Now...

785
00:44:55,505 --> 00:44:56,645
I'll keep drawing.

786
00:44:57,145 --> 00:44:58,275
This is...

787
00:44:59,545 --> 00:45:01,244
This card is about seduction.

788
00:45:01,245 --> 00:45:02,415
- Seduction?
- Yes.

789
00:45:02,485 --> 00:45:03,684
It's a card about seduction.

790
00:45:03,685 --> 00:45:05,091
- It's a card about seduction.
- Yes.

791
00:45:05,115 --> 00:45:07,185
This card shows your emotional state.

792
00:45:07,285 --> 00:45:09,725
You might find yourself having intense romantic feelings.

793
00:45:11,685 --> 00:45:13,425
(Nodding)

794
00:45:15,225 --> 00:45:19,095
(Then the last card is revealed.)

795
00:45:21,565 --> 00:45:23,304
You got a beautiful card.

796
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:24,835
- A beautiful card?
- Yes.

797
00:45:25,035 --> 00:45:26,735
To you, this relationship...

798
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:29,975
feels beautiful.

799
00:45:33,445 --> 00:45:37,185
(The last card was drawn as she thought about Ho Am.)

800
00:45:39,785 --> 00:45:42,385
(A while ago)

801
00:45:44,025 --> 00:45:48,725
(She drew the same card for Yu Gyeong too.)

802
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:54,565
(She read the same feeling from the two of them.)

803
00:45:55,865 --> 00:45:57,205
Can I ask you one more thing?

804
00:45:59,205 --> 00:46:00,704
I'd like to know that...

805
00:46:00,705 --> 00:46:02,825
if I'll stay with the woman I'm thinking about now...

806
00:46:03,505 --> 00:46:06,045
until the end or if there will be changes.

807
00:46:06,545 --> 00:46:07,845
If there will be changes?

808
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:11,915
- Should we do that with the dice?
- Yes.

809
00:46:15,955 --> 00:46:17,154
Will there be changes?

810
00:46:17,155 --> 00:46:20,525
(Will there be changes?)

811
00:46:24,795 --> 00:46:25,835
What?

812
00:46:31,505 --> 00:46:34,205
Seriously? It's the same symbol.

813
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,574
It's the same as the beautiful card from earlier.

814
00:46:36,575 --> 00:46:37,774
- Really?
- Yes.

815
00:46:37,775 --> 00:46:40,515
(Both the dice and cards are giving him the same answer.)

816
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:44,945
You'll find yourself having more fun with someone.

817
00:46:45,885 --> 00:46:48,485
You know those butterflies you feel when you date?

818
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:50,855
- The feelings you get as a man.
- Yes.

819
00:46:51,885 --> 00:46:55,154
From my reading, it seems you will choose the one...

820
00:46:55,155 --> 00:46:57,225
whom you feel more smitten with.

821
00:46:58,895 --> 00:47:00,765
In addition, it seems...

822
00:47:01,395 --> 00:47:03,705
you will choose someone...

823
00:47:05,165 --> 00:47:07,805
whom you can communicate fully, so you will feel as if you're one.

824
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,795
You'll choose someone whom you can share...

825
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:11,505
your innate qualities more deeply.

826
00:47:16,285 --> 00:47:20,555
(She read Ho Am's feelings in this moment.)

827
00:47:21,815 --> 00:47:26,895
(Will their connection follow her reading?)

828
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:30,325
- I got goosebumps.
- My gosh.

829
00:47:30,565 --> 00:47:32,264
(Sighing)

830
00:47:32,265 --> 00:47:34,265
He must think the energy of the entire universe...

831
00:47:34,335 --> 00:47:37,104
- is bringing him to Yu Gyeong.
- Exactly.

832
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:39,435
- Right.
- He will feel more certain now.

833
00:47:39,675 --> 00:47:42,074
From both of her readings with the cards and dice,

834
00:47:42,075 --> 00:47:45,675
she can sense that things can work out well between them,

835
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:48,345
- so she seems a bit dejected.
- Right. That's only natural.

836
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:52,414
If I were in her shoes, this would help me give up...

837
00:47:52,415 --> 00:47:54,375
- on pursuing him completely.
- Right. Same here.

838
00:47:54,555 --> 00:47:56,425
Gosh, I can't watch this. This is so painful.

839
00:47:58,825 --> 00:48:02,795
(What kind of decision will Yun Jeong make?)

840
00:48:04,325 --> 00:48:05,465
(Glancing)

841
00:48:06,795 --> 00:48:10,235
(Yun Jeong hovers around Ho Am.)

842
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:16,105
(Glancing)

843
00:48:16,505 --> 00:48:17,545
(Giving him a look)

844
00:48:19,345 --> 00:48:22,645
(She quietly signals at Ho Am to come out.)

845
00:48:23,545 --> 00:48:24,945
(Noticing)

846
00:48:27,015 --> 00:48:28,684
Is there a spot where the cameras can't catch us?

847
00:48:28,685 --> 00:48:30,325
This looks like a good blind side, right?

848
00:48:30,555 --> 00:48:32,295
- It's not about the Pavilion.
- Pardon?

849
00:48:32,355 --> 00:48:33,875
- It's not about the Pavilion.
- Okay.

850
00:48:34,355 --> 00:48:36,194
- I have a personal question...
- You have a question?

851
00:48:36,195 --> 00:48:37,425
For you.

852
00:48:37,695 --> 00:48:39,695
So I wanted to ask you.

853
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:40,795
Okay.

854
00:48:41,265 --> 00:48:42,265
So...

855
00:48:42,266 --> 00:48:44,135
Where can I read the fortune?

856
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:47,234
Where would you be comfortable? You'd be comfortable in your room.

857
00:48:47,235 --> 00:48:48,274
- Sorry?
- Isn't your room comfortable?

858
00:48:48,275 --> 00:48:49,475
- My room? Okay.
- Yes.

859
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:51,444
What do you think? Tell me...

860
00:48:51,445 --> 00:48:53,005
- where you'd feel comfortable.
- Okay.

861
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:55,645
(Glancing)

862
00:48:58,615 --> 00:49:01,955
(Yun Jeong asked Ho Am to read her fortune.)

863
00:49:03,085 --> 00:49:04,725
Shall we go now?

864
00:49:09,465 --> 00:49:13,265
(They're secretly going to the room on the 2nd floor.)

865
00:49:19,535 --> 00:49:22,875
(They're facing each other.)

866
00:49:23,605 --> 00:49:25,275
(Nervous)

867
00:49:37,185 --> 00:49:40,554
(Hearing Ho Am's whistling, )

868
00:49:40,555 --> 00:49:43,425
(Yun Jeong closes her eyes to concentrate.)

869
00:49:49,435 --> 00:49:52,735
(Yun Jeong got a yellow flag and a green flag.)

870
00:49:55,445 --> 00:49:59,114
It says your mindset and emotions...

871
00:49:59,115 --> 00:50:01,215
have significantly changed...

872
00:50:01,745 --> 00:50:03,285
since you came here.

873
00:50:03,385 --> 00:50:04,945
Both your emotions and thoughts.

874
00:50:05,015 --> 00:50:08,215
You usually express your feelings honestly and confidently.

875
00:50:08,585 --> 00:50:09,755
You're your own person.

876
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:13,425
But since you came here, you've been afraid.

877
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:23,005
(Ho Am draws another flag.)

878
00:50:26,235 --> 00:50:27,435
You're unsure.

879
00:50:29,975 --> 00:50:32,075
I can see someone.

880
00:50:32,845 --> 00:50:34,115
But I see a very faint image.

881
00:50:38,545 --> 00:50:41,015
I think it's because you're not sure about it yet.

882
00:50:44,225 --> 00:50:46,454
I hope you're not too worried about breaking up.

883
00:50:46,455 --> 00:50:48,725
You might not break up. If you get scared beforehand,

884
00:50:49,595 --> 00:50:50,635
it'll be too hard for you.

885
00:50:55,465 --> 00:50:58,005
I hope you believe in yourself more.

886
00:50:59,975 --> 00:51:02,075
Don't be afraid too much.

887
00:51:02,945 --> 00:51:04,305
I hope you push forward.

888
00:51:06,815 --> 00:51:08,885
When you're sure about something, just keep going.

889
00:51:10,415 --> 00:51:11,415
Don't be afraid.

890
00:51:14,855 --> 00:51:19,325
(Does Ho Am know how Yun Jeong feels?)

891
00:51:22,895 --> 00:51:24,055
Let me tell you what this is.

892
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,741
The divine spirit wants to encourage you...

893
00:51:26,765 --> 00:51:28,865
and help you.

894
00:51:29,905 --> 00:51:32,535
Hold two flags with your right hand.

895
00:51:38,745 --> 00:51:39,815
Hold them tightly.

896
00:51:43,345 --> 00:51:47,515
(He's praying for her.)

897
00:51:48,815 --> 00:51:50,255
(Eyes closed)

898
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:54,625
You know this one is the best, right?

899
00:51:57,695 --> 00:52:00,935
It's considered the best combination among shamans.

900
00:52:02,805 --> 00:52:04,085
Just focus on your own feelings.

901
00:52:04,505 --> 00:52:05,805
Don't worry about anything else.

902
00:52:08,205 --> 00:52:09,475
(Emotional)

903
00:52:10,775 --> 00:52:11,775
Yun Jeong.

904
00:52:13,015 --> 00:52:14,015
You're amazing.

905
00:52:17,345 --> 00:52:19,584
(She gets teary-eyed in the end.)

906
00:52:19,585 --> 00:52:21,555
- Don't be afraid.
- Okay.

907
00:52:21,655 --> 00:52:22,985
Because you're amazing.

908
00:52:27,795 --> 00:52:29,095
Be brave.

909
00:52:33,495 --> 00:52:35,365
- As I always was.
- Yes.

910
00:52:38,865 --> 00:52:40,275
Don't waver her like that.

911
00:52:40,675 --> 00:52:43,075
Don't shake her heart like that.

912
00:52:45,175 --> 00:52:46,815
Will she able to give up on her feelings?

913
00:52:46,915 --> 00:52:48,835
I know. I don't think she'll be able to do that.

914
00:52:49,585 --> 00:52:51,815
- It'll waver her even more.
- I know.

915
00:52:53,715 --> 00:52:54,855
This is driving me crazy.

916
00:52:57,285 --> 00:52:59,224
- As I always was.
- Yes.

917
00:52:59,225 --> 00:53:02,295
(While Ho Am is comforting Yun Jeong...)

918
00:53:09,705 --> 00:53:11,505
(Anxious)

919
00:53:16,945 --> 00:53:18,375
(Getting up)

920
00:53:22,315 --> 00:53:24,685
(Yu Gyeong goes to the 2nd floor.)

921
00:53:26,115 --> 00:53:27,185
(Glancing)

922
00:53:31,785 --> 00:53:34,225
(She takes her shamanic tools...)

923
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:38,065
(and goes to where Ho Am and Yun Jeong are.)

924
00:53:39,295 --> 00:53:40,295
(Surprised)

925
00:53:40,295 --> 00:53:41,295
(What?)

926
00:53:41,535 --> 00:53:42,535
Oh, my.

927
00:53:43,105 --> 00:53:44,105
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

928
00:53:46,105 --> 00:53:47,204
She can't stay still.

929
00:53:47,205 --> 00:53:48,485
Is she just going into the room?

930
00:53:51,905 --> 00:53:54,215
(Knocking)

931
00:53:56,685 --> 00:53:59,955
- Not done yet?
- Give us more time.

932
00:54:04,055 --> 00:54:06,355
(Shaking)

933
00:54:09,795 --> 00:54:11,965
Oh, my gosh.

934
00:54:12,435 --> 00:54:14,235
(Dizzy)

935
00:54:14,495 --> 00:54:17,004
(The atmosphere suddenly turned cold.)

936
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:19,134
"Why are you disturbing me?" That's what it looked like, right?

937
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,234
How should I interpret that?

938
00:54:21,235 --> 00:54:23,505
Oh, my gosh.

939
00:54:23,605 --> 00:54:24,644
My goodness.

940
00:54:24,645 --> 00:54:27,445
- This is driving me nuts.
- Seriously.

941
00:54:27,545 --> 00:54:28,545
Hold on.

942
00:54:32,455 --> 00:54:33,915
What do I do?

943
00:54:34,815 --> 00:54:37,585
- What do I do?
- The drama is so interesting.

944
00:54:54,175 --> 00:54:55,175
They say...

945
00:54:55,635 --> 00:54:58,275
whether it's good or bad,

946
00:54:58,375 --> 00:54:59,545
it's like...

947
00:55:00,215 --> 00:55:04,015
(Yu Gyeong is concerned about them.)

948
00:55:05,815 --> 00:55:08,584
(How will their relationship...)

949
00:55:08,585 --> 00:55:12,385
(change?)

950
00:55:14,755 --> 00:55:16,795
There's a group date today.

951
00:55:17,825 --> 00:55:20,335
Split into two teams and have a great time.

952
00:55:23,205 --> 00:55:28,705
(Group date: Hyeon U, Gang Won, Ra Yun, and Yu Ra)

953
00:55:32,615 --> 00:55:33,944
I think it's a good idea.

954
00:55:33,945 --> 00:55:35,825
(Gang Won naturally goes to the driver's seat.)

955
00:55:36,145 --> 00:55:38,385
(Rushing)

956
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,455
- Me?
- No.

957
00:55:43,585 --> 00:55:48,655
(Yu Ra takes the passenger seat.)

958
00:55:54,295 --> 00:55:55,295
(Glancing)

959
00:55:56,665 --> 00:55:59,805
"This is my seat." You can't say something like this.

960
00:55:59,905 --> 00:56:01,305
And she took the front seat.

961
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,374
She didn't seem to be happy about it.

962
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:07,815
She tried to hide it, but it was quite obvious.

963
00:56:08,075 --> 00:56:10,485
I didn't tell anyone to sit next to me.

964
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:12,884
I just took a seat, then I saw Yu Ra next to me.

965
00:56:12,885 --> 00:56:14,484
In that situation,

966
00:56:14,485 --> 00:56:16,724
I couldn't say, "Can you sit in the back?"

967
00:56:16,725 --> 00:56:19,595
I actually didn't do anything.

968
00:56:19,955 --> 00:56:21,125
(He thinks it's unfair.)

969
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:24,364
(There's a strange vibe between the four of them.)

970
00:56:24,365 --> 00:56:25,365
Does it take long?

971
00:56:30,135 --> 00:56:31,655
- Would you like to go with me?
- Yes.

972
00:56:32,135 --> 00:56:34,075
Should we get ready now?

973
00:56:34,205 --> 00:56:35,405
This idea is...

974
00:56:36,145 --> 00:56:38,475
Oh, you look good in that outfit.

975
00:56:39,675 --> 00:56:41,275
I've been wearing this since I was born.

976
00:56:41,575 --> 00:56:42,714
Have fun.

977
00:56:42,715 --> 00:56:43,745
I'll see you later.

978
00:56:44,015 --> 00:56:45,414
I'll leave when the clock hits 50 minutes.

979
00:56:45,415 --> 00:56:47,975
(Ra Yun was concerned about Yu Ra and Gang Won going on a date.)

980
00:56:49,885 --> 00:56:50,925
Come here.

981
00:56:52,425 --> 00:56:53,995
(Glancing)

982
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:58,224
(Hyeon U got the chance to have a date with Ra Yun.)

983
00:56:58,225 --> 00:56:59,635
Are you asking me out?

984
00:57:00,095 --> 00:57:01,935
Is it okay to say it in front of other people?

985
00:57:07,405 --> 00:57:08,775
(Can you wipe it?)

986
00:57:13,945 --> 00:57:15,415
(There's a lot of chocolate.)

987
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,515
(Giggling)

988
00:57:16,515 --> 00:57:17,515
(Laughing)

989
00:57:17,715 --> 00:57:18,945
(It looks like a mole.)

990
00:57:20,915 --> 00:57:22,054
(Touching)

991
00:57:22,055 --> 00:57:23,975
(He thinks about the sweet moments with Ra Yun.)

992
00:57:27,925 --> 00:57:30,525
(You're as amazing as I thought.)

993
00:57:30,765 --> 00:57:33,434
(No, you're even more amazing than I thought.)

994
00:57:33,435 --> 00:57:35,395
(I'm glad I talked to you.)

995
00:57:36,265 --> 00:57:39,835
(Yu Ra grew fonder of him after their date yesterday.)

996
00:57:40,675 --> 00:57:45,205
(Everyone fell into their thoughts.)

997
00:57:45,305 --> 00:57:47,975
They're the four people involved in the Table War.

998
00:57:48,775 --> 00:57:50,684
This is a war.

999
00:57:50,685 --> 00:57:52,215
This is a war.

1000
00:57:52,415 --> 00:57:53,454
This is a war,

1001
00:57:53,455 --> 00:57:55,154
- not a date.
- It's a war.

1002
00:57:55,155 --> 00:57:56,924
It's a war. Look at their faces.

1003
00:57:56,925 --> 00:57:58,645
- Look at their faces.
- They look serious.

1004
00:57:58,685 --> 00:58:00,354
"I don't mind dying." This is their attitude.

1005
00:58:00,355 --> 00:58:01,954
It's a war today.

1006
00:58:01,955 --> 00:58:03,324
They're not even at a table.

1007
00:58:03,325 --> 00:58:05,565
- But the war has started now.
- Right.

1008
00:58:05,895 --> 00:58:07,694
Today's date...

1009
00:58:07,695 --> 00:58:09,304
- will either solidify...
- Right.

1010
00:58:09,305 --> 00:58:11,064
- or flip the dynamics.
- That's possible.

1011
00:58:11,065 --> 00:58:12,065
- Right?
- It can happen.

1012
00:58:12,066 --> 00:58:13,735
It's going to be interesting today.

1013
00:58:15,275 --> 00:58:17,244
(The four of them tangled...)

1014
00:58:17,245 --> 00:58:19,205
(in a complicated situation are on a date.)

1015
00:58:21,675 --> 00:58:26,815
(What will be the final result of the Table War?)

1016
00:58:31,992 --> 00:58:37,562
(Their first date takes place among a flock of sheep.)

1017
00:58:38,332 --> 00:58:39,731
It's snow.

1018
00:58:39,732 --> 00:58:41,561
It's snow and animals.

1019
00:58:41,562 --> 00:58:42,802
It's snow.

1020
00:58:44,002 --> 00:58:45,941
- It's so pretty.
- Oh, my gosh.

1021
00:58:45,942 --> 00:58:48,002
- Gosh, it's so pretty.
- It's wonderful.

1022
00:58:48,042 --> 00:58:49,511
The snowflakes are so big.

1023
00:58:49,512 --> 00:58:51,312
I haven't seen snow like this for many years.

1024
00:58:52,312 --> 00:58:53,632
- What's that?
- I saw something.

1025
00:58:55,082 --> 00:58:57,212
- What is it?
- Hi, guys.

1026
00:58:57,582 --> 00:59:00,152
- What is it?
- It has a very long neck.

1027
00:59:02,282 --> 00:59:03,351
Hi.

1028
00:59:03,352 --> 00:59:05,021
(The one with a long neck is an alpaca.)

1029
00:59:05,022 --> 00:59:08,662
It kind of looks like Hyeon U.

1030
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:15,832
I see the resemblance.

1031
00:59:16,802 --> 00:59:18,432
They look so alike.

1032
00:59:19,132 --> 00:59:20,871
I think it was also surprised when it saw Hyeon U.

1033
00:59:20,872 --> 00:59:22,942
- I know.
- They look so alike.

1034
00:59:25,072 --> 00:59:28,881
It kind of looks like Hyeon U.

1035
00:59:28,882 --> 00:59:31,111
Hey, your feet are so cute.

1036
00:59:31,112 --> 00:59:32,211
- Oh, my. You're right.
- Hyeon U.

1037
00:59:32,212 --> 00:59:33,481
- Why are you so cute?
- It's smiling.

1038
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:34,802
- It's smiling.
- You're so cute.

1039
00:59:36,222 --> 00:59:38,721
The mother also has deep eyes.

1040
00:59:38,722 --> 00:59:40,092
Are you guys listening?

1041
00:59:40,122 --> 00:59:43,092
- The mother has deep eyes.
- If you're, blink twice.

1042
00:59:43,462 --> 00:59:44,462
Hyeon U.

1043
00:59:44,463 --> 00:59:45,791
- Why are you so cute?
- It's smiling.

1044
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:47,112
- It's smiling.
- You're so cute.

1045
00:59:48,832 --> 00:59:51,392
- Why are their feet so cute?
- Oh, my. Their eyes look so kind.

1046
00:59:51,772 --> 00:59:53,002
They look so kind.

1047
00:59:54,342 --> 00:59:56,148
Be careful. They spit when they're not happy about something.

1048
00:59:56,172 --> 00:59:57,541
Really? Why?

1049
00:59:57,542 --> 00:59:59,342
They'll probably spit when they're irritated.

1050
00:59:59,742 --> 01:00:01,342
Do you also spit when you're irritated?

1051
01:00:01,882 --> 01:00:03,282
(Ignoring)

1052
01:00:03,412 --> 01:00:04,652
(Embarrassed)

1053
01:00:05,212 --> 01:00:07,051
Do you know because you're the same species?

1054
01:00:07,052 --> 01:00:08,581
They spit when they're not happy about something.

1055
01:00:08,582 --> 01:00:09,651
Do you know...

1056
01:00:09,652 --> 01:00:11,091
- because you're the same species?
- Yes, I do.

1057
01:00:11,092 --> 01:00:12,121
(He couldn't interrupt them.)

1058
01:00:12,122 --> 01:00:13,592
- Spit.
- You know.

1059
01:00:15,062 --> 01:00:16,162
They're a family.

1060
01:00:16,392 --> 01:00:17,461
- Where?
- Here.

1061
01:00:17,462 --> 01:00:18,782
There's a baby on the right side.

1062
01:00:19,232 --> 01:00:20,902
Gosh, aren't you guys cold?

1063
01:00:21,002 --> 01:00:22,462
- They're cute.
- They're cute.

1064
01:00:22,772 --> 01:00:24,212
Why is its fur in a different colour?

1065
01:00:24,402 --> 01:00:26,242
Are they not a couple?

1066
01:00:27,172 --> 01:00:28,401
- No.
- Both of them might be females.

1067
01:00:28,402 --> 01:00:29,911
Right? Each one has a baby.

1068
01:00:29,912 --> 01:00:30,912
Are they mixed blood?

1069
01:00:31,612 --> 01:00:32,642
I'm sorry.

1070
01:00:34,012 --> 01:00:35,311
That was a little...

1071
01:00:35,312 --> 01:00:36,781
Look at them. They're so cute.

1072
01:00:36,782 --> 01:00:39,851
Oh, my. I want to feed them milk. What are you eating?

1073
01:00:39,852 --> 01:00:41,122
Are you chewing the cud?

1074
01:00:45,722 --> 01:00:47,662
They keep ignoring...

1075
01:00:47,992 --> 01:00:49,061
when Gang Won says something.

1076
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,691
Isn't their date exhausting?

1077
01:00:51,692 --> 01:00:53,662
- I know.
- This is tough.

1078
01:00:53,902 --> 01:00:55,231
They're keeping a slight distance from him.

1079
01:00:55,232 --> 01:00:56,401
(She feels bad.)

1080
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:58,832
From what I remember, they didn't talk to me.

1081
01:00:59,942 --> 01:01:01,442
It was actually very hard.

1082
01:01:02,142 --> 01:01:03,171
If you put yourself in my shoes,

1083
01:01:03,172 --> 01:01:05,842
talking to yourself is so miserable.

1084
01:01:06,642 --> 01:01:09,012
(Keeping a distance)

1085
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:13,922
(Gang Won feels miserable.)

1086
01:01:16,522 --> 01:01:18,692
- It's pretty.
- It looks dangerous, Yu Ra.

1087
01:01:18,852 --> 01:01:20,091
Why?

1088
01:01:20,092 --> 01:01:22,012
You might step on a stone and sprain your ankle.

1089
01:01:23,532 --> 01:01:24,662
(Glancing)

1090
01:01:26,362 --> 01:01:27,762
Yu Ra, you might sprain your ankle.

1091
01:01:27,802 --> 01:01:29,232
- Why?
- Seriously.

1092
01:01:29,302 --> 01:01:30,772
- You think I might fall?
- Yes.

1093
01:01:34,602 --> 01:01:35,802
(Pouty)

1094
01:01:37,772 --> 01:01:39,111
(Ra Yun's ears are turning toward the back.)

1095
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,752
- I don't want to sprain my ankle.
- Yes.

1096
01:01:43,482 --> 01:01:46,782
I paid all my attention to Gang Won.

1097
01:01:47,352 --> 01:01:49,112
They weren't talking about important things,

1098
01:01:49,922 --> 01:01:51,552
but I was a little jealous.

1099
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:54,121
He was in the back with Yu Ra.

1100
01:01:54,122 --> 01:01:56,832
Whenever he said, "Be careful,"

1101
01:01:57,532 --> 01:02:00,962
I was like, "Why does he say that?"

1102
01:02:03,972 --> 01:02:05,902
Oh, there's something on my shoes.

1103
01:02:07,072 --> 01:02:08,242
You can just shake it off.

1104
01:02:08,702 --> 01:02:09,872
It doesn't matter.

1105
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:15,512
- Aren't they ostriches?
- Ostriches? Where?

1106
01:02:16,582 --> 01:02:19,952
(Ostriches are here.)

1107
01:02:20,922 --> 01:02:22,352
- There are ostriches.
- What?

1108
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,352
They look like Byeong Yeol.

1109
01:02:24,892 --> 01:02:26,361
Who? Byeong Yeol?

1110
01:02:26,362 --> 01:02:27,362
Yes.

1111
01:02:27,822 --> 01:02:29,162
(Cackling)

1112
01:02:29,762 --> 01:02:31,731
- They resemble who?
- Byeong Yeol.

1113
01:02:31,732 --> 01:02:32,802
Byeong Yeol?

1114
01:02:33,532 --> 01:02:35,201
Byeong Yeol, you're tall as always.

1115
01:02:35,202 --> 01:02:37,132
(They met Byeong Yeol at the sheep farm.)

1116
01:02:37,272 --> 01:02:40,002
(Real Byeong Yeol in the meantime)

1117
01:02:40,242 --> 01:02:41,441
(Bursting into laughter)

1118
01:02:41,442 --> 01:02:42,571
Oh, my. Wait.

1119
01:02:42,572 --> 01:02:45,471
(Laughing)

1120
01:02:45,472 --> 01:02:47,312
- They really look alike.
- He resembles them.

1121
01:02:56,692 --> 01:03:00,122
(Sang Hyeok, Ho Am, Byeong Yeol, Yu Gyeong, and Yun Jeong)

1122
01:03:00,822 --> 01:03:04,232
We usually bow once in front of the gate.

1123
01:03:04,492 --> 01:03:05,591
- In front of the gate?
- A little bow...

1124
01:03:05,592 --> 01:03:06,702
with your hands together.

1125
01:03:09,102 --> 01:03:10,601
A little bow with your hands together here.

1126
01:03:10,602 --> 01:03:11,671
(Sang Hyeok who is a Buddhist lead them.)

1127
01:03:11,672 --> 01:03:13,572
Like this.

1128
01:03:16,172 --> 01:03:18,088
- Shall we write on one candle?
- Let's write on the same one.

1129
01:03:18,112 --> 01:03:20,082
- Do you want to write your wish?
- Yes.

1130
01:03:20,212 --> 01:03:21,811
Write down your birthdays and names.

1131
01:03:21,812 --> 01:03:23,452
We can't write our birthdays.

1132
01:03:23,582 --> 01:03:25,081
We can't reveal it.

1133
01:03:25,082 --> 01:03:27,181
We'll just write our names without the birthdays.

1134
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:28,222
Just the names?

1135
01:03:28,452 --> 01:03:30,551
Should we write our wishes under our names?

1136
01:03:30,552 --> 01:03:31,891
(They're going to write their names only.)

1137
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:34,173
- What wish should I write?
- Do you want to write first?

1138
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:38,331
(The fortune tellers are writing their wishes.)

1139
01:03:38,332 --> 01:03:39,332
What did you write?

1140
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:41,053
I was going to write about staying healthy.

1141
01:03:41,632 --> 01:03:43,331
(Their wishes are written on one candle.)

1142
01:03:43,332 --> 01:03:44,402
Shall we go up?

1143
01:03:45,932 --> 01:03:50,242
(They came to the Main Hall to light up the wish candle.)

1144
01:03:51,512 --> 01:03:52,872
"We hope your wishes are granted."

1145
01:03:53,082 --> 01:03:54,282
(Opening)

1146
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,481
(He carefully places the candle.)

1147
01:03:57,482 --> 01:03:58,582
The candle.

1148
01:03:59,082 --> 01:04:00,082
(Peeking)

1149
01:04:00,082 --> 01:04:01,082
- Nice.
- Yes.

1150
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:03,691
I've lit it.

1151
01:04:03,692 --> 01:04:04,932
(He lit the candle reverently.)

1152
01:04:05,022 --> 01:04:06,262
I hope everything will be okay.

1153
01:04:07,722 --> 01:04:11,292
(They pray for their wishes to come true.)

1154
01:04:11,762 --> 01:04:13,262
(Bowing)

1155
01:04:15,302 --> 01:04:20,202
(What kind of wishes are written on the candle?)

1156
01:04:21,072 --> 01:04:24,372
It has a majestic atmosphere.

1157
01:04:25,642 --> 01:04:27,941
- Shall we stack the stones?
- That's a good idea.

1158
01:04:27,942 --> 01:04:30,223
(Statues of Buddha and a wish tower in front of the rock)

1159
01:04:30,612 --> 01:04:32,292
I should put a stone on the biggest stone.

1160
01:04:32,782 --> 01:04:34,782
- I'll put a stone on a big one.
- Okay.

1161
01:04:35,352 --> 01:04:36,492
(Putting)

1162
01:04:37,492 --> 01:04:38,521
- Oh, my.
- That was a bold move.

1163
01:04:38,522 --> 01:04:40,442
- Do you want to put a stone here?
- Each of us?

1164
01:04:40,592 --> 01:04:41,592
Yes.

1165
01:04:41,892 --> 01:04:44,052
- Let's stack stones together.
- Let's do it together.

1166
01:04:45,732 --> 01:04:48,801
(They stack wish stones on Sang Hyeok's stone.)

1167
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,002
Okay. I did it.

1168
01:04:51,502 --> 01:04:54,842
Ho Am and Yu Gyeong were together.

1169
01:04:55,302 --> 01:04:57,172
I tried not to be self-conscious...

1170
01:04:57,842 --> 01:05:01,781
between them.

1171
01:05:01,782 --> 01:05:03,752
That's what I put my effort into the most.

1172
01:05:05,282 --> 01:05:08,222
- I can tell.
- Putting effort itself is hard.

1173
01:05:08,382 --> 01:05:09,621
Gosh.

1174
01:05:09,622 --> 01:05:12,121
All her attention must be...

1175
01:05:12,122 --> 01:05:14,761
- on Ho Am.
- Yes. All her attention is on him.

1176
01:05:14,762 --> 01:05:16,092
You're right.

1177
01:05:21,232 --> 01:05:22,462
(Taking a photo)

1178
01:05:26,242 --> 01:05:27,272
Somehow...

1179
01:05:27,942 --> 01:05:29,272
- This...
- Yes.

1180
01:05:30,942 --> 01:05:32,811
Shall we take 5 photos so that each of us can have 1?

1181
01:05:32,812 --> 01:05:33,812
- Sorry?
- Shall we take five photos...

1182
01:05:33,812 --> 01:05:34,812
for each of us?

1183
01:05:34,813 --> 01:05:35,912
- This?
- Yes.

1184
01:05:37,252 --> 01:05:39,211
- Okay. Let's do that.
- Somehow...

1185
01:05:39,212 --> 01:05:41,452
There are many frames. Let's not save them too much.

1186
01:05:41,882 --> 01:05:43,291
But this is important.

1187
01:05:43,292 --> 01:05:44,751
- When the photo comes out, - How...

1188
01:05:44,752 --> 01:05:46,222
the water might spread on it.

1189
01:05:46,822 --> 01:05:49,321
- It shouldn't get rained on.
- Yes. I'll hold the umbrella.

1190
01:05:49,322 --> 01:05:50,792
- Here?
- Yes.

1191
01:05:50,992 --> 01:05:52,161
Please hold it...

1192
01:05:52,162 --> 01:05:53,301
- while I'm taking pictures.
- Okay.

1193
01:05:53,302 --> 01:05:54,302
(Byeong Yeol blocks the rain for Yun Jeong.)

1194
01:05:54,303 --> 01:05:55,561
- Five pictures.
- Yes.

1195
01:05:55,562 --> 01:05:57,202
I'm not good at taking pictures.

1196
01:05:58,032 --> 01:05:59,102
In 1, 2, 3.

1197
01:06:00,272 --> 01:06:01,272
(Taking a photo)

1198
01:06:04,172 --> 01:06:05,241
Give me the photo.

1199
01:06:05,242 --> 01:06:07,112
- Here.
- I couldn't see it properly.

1200
01:06:10,312 --> 01:06:12,752
Their clothes are the same colour.

1201
01:06:13,022 --> 01:06:15,322
(Looking intently)

1202
01:06:15,822 --> 01:06:18,092
(In the meantime)

1203
01:06:18,792 --> 01:06:20,521
I hope we can come to a place like this sometimes...

1204
01:06:20,522 --> 01:06:22,321
- as if we went camping.
- It'll be so fun.

1205
01:06:22,322 --> 01:06:23,392
Right.

1206
01:06:23,662 --> 01:06:25,732
Let's not argue next time.

1207
01:06:27,002 --> 01:06:28,538
I think we're the only ones who fought.

1208
01:06:28,562 --> 01:06:29,672
Is that so?

1209
01:06:29,772 --> 01:06:31,001
- I think it's just the two of us.
- Yes. It's just...

1210
01:06:31,002 --> 01:06:32,232
- the two.
- Is that so?

1211
01:06:32,872 --> 01:06:35,142
- I think it's just the two of us.
- We've never argued.

1212
01:06:36,142 --> 01:06:37,642
We were good.

1213
01:06:37,772 --> 01:06:38,971
The rumour has spread already.

1214
01:06:38,972 --> 01:06:40,441
We can't pretend like we didn't.

1215
01:06:40,442 --> 01:06:42,312
- Did it spread already?
- It did.

1216
01:06:44,782 --> 01:06:45,912
Anyway.

1217
01:06:46,352 --> 01:06:47,482
Why?

1218
01:06:48,122 --> 01:06:49,182
Because it's interesting.

1219
01:06:49,892 --> 01:06:50,892
(Scoffing)

1220
01:06:52,752 --> 01:06:53,892
(Sighing)

1221
01:06:54,822 --> 01:06:56,062
(Sighing)

1222
01:06:57,532 --> 01:06:58,891
(A bitter laughter)

1223
01:06:58,892 --> 01:06:59,932
Why?

1224
01:07:00,102 --> 01:07:01,162
It's nothing.

1225
01:07:02,502 --> 01:07:03,871
- Why did you burst into laughter?
- It's nothing.

1226
01:07:03,872 --> 01:07:04,902
Why?

1227
01:07:05,172 --> 01:07:06,342
It's nothing.

1228
01:07:07,372 --> 01:07:10,172
- Never mind.
- Why? Tell me. I'm curious.

1229
01:07:11,672 --> 01:07:18,082
(There's a strange vibe among the four of them.)

1230
01:07:18,782 --> 01:07:21,422
I was just curious...

1231
01:07:22,052 --> 01:07:24,152
about how you were feeling, Ra Yun.

1232
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:26,962
(Surprised)

1233
01:07:28,592 --> 01:07:30,561
It got me surprised.

1234
01:07:30,562 --> 01:07:32,242
- It felt like I was attacked.
- Oh, gosh.

1235
01:07:32,592 --> 01:07:34,061
She suddenly asked a question she could ask...

1236
01:07:34,062 --> 01:07:35,401
during a game of truth or dare.

1237
01:07:35,402 --> 01:07:37,082
- That was out of nowhere. Gosh.
- I know.

1238
01:07:37,702 --> 01:07:39,472
Suddenly, I'm nervous.

1239
01:07:41,042 --> 01:07:42,701
- It's nerve-racking.
- They're walking on thin ice.

1240
01:07:42,702 --> 01:07:43,871
Seriously. They're walking on thin ice.

1241
01:07:43,872 --> 01:07:45,392
(The question changed the atmosphere.)

1242
01:07:45,712 --> 01:07:48,412
I just want to know...

1243
01:07:49,012 --> 01:07:50,952
how you're feeling right now, Ra Yun.

1244
01:07:52,782 --> 01:07:54,151
(Yu Ra threw the question in the end.)

1245
01:07:54,152 --> 01:07:55,881
- I just want to know that.
- What should I do?

1246
01:07:55,882 --> 01:07:57,298
(Yu Ra threw the question in the end.)

1247
01:07:57,322 --> 01:07:58,392
Me?

1248
01:07:58,622 --> 01:08:00,192
To be completely honest,

1249
01:08:00,592 --> 01:08:03,692
I was indeed interested in him.

1250
01:08:05,092 --> 01:08:07,462
I was indeed straightforward. However...

1251
01:08:10,202 --> 01:08:11,302
(Fidgeting...)

1252
01:08:11,532 --> 01:08:12,532
(nervously)

1253
01:08:17,412 --> 01:08:19,212
However,

1254
01:08:21,012 --> 01:08:25,011
I clearly think that we expressed interest in each other.

1255
01:08:25,012 --> 01:08:26,582
I think everyone knows that.

1256
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:31,451
But if he doesn't want to do that anymore,

1257
01:08:31,452 --> 01:08:32,952
I have no intention to drag it out.

1258
01:08:33,122 --> 01:08:34,762
I need to respect his wishes.

1259
01:08:35,122 --> 01:08:36,192
However,

1260
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:39,692
if he simply...

1261
01:08:40,132 --> 01:08:43,932
can't figure out what he wants,

1262
01:08:44,202 --> 01:08:46,472
I can help him by his side.

1263
01:08:47,072 --> 01:08:48,442
If I have certainty,

1264
01:08:48,772 --> 01:08:51,142
I can grab his hand and lead him.

1265
01:08:55,782 --> 01:08:57,582
(Glancing over)

1266
01:09:00,882 --> 01:09:02,182
Do you have one, Yu Ra?

1267
01:09:02,822 --> 01:09:03,922
Someone I like?

1268
01:09:05,492 --> 01:09:07,662
There's someone I have good feelings about.

1269
01:09:11,262 --> 01:09:16,532
(The two women continue to have a war of nerves.)

1270
01:09:20,342 --> 01:09:21,472
However...

1271
01:09:22,142 --> 01:09:23,612
(Glancing over)

1272
01:09:28,042 --> 01:09:29,482
Say it honestly.

1273
01:09:31,112 --> 01:09:32,252
(Glancing over)

1274
01:09:33,922 --> 01:09:36,622
(Feeling uncomfortable)

1275
01:09:38,122 --> 01:09:40,262
(Quaking)

1276
01:09:42,722 --> 01:09:45,331
What's this? No one did anything wrong.

1277
01:09:45,332 --> 01:09:50,102
(They feel like they're suffocating.)

1278
01:09:50,832 --> 01:09:53,248
They're having that conversation with Gang Won right next to them.

1279
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:55,672
- Gang Won must know...
- That's right.

1280
01:09:56,072 --> 01:09:57,792
- Oh, no.
- that they're talking about him.

1281
01:09:58,842 --> 01:10:00,002
My energy is getting drained.

1282
01:10:01,442 --> 01:10:03,312
(Nervous)

1283
01:10:05,812 --> 01:10:07,352
I was like, "What's this?"

1284
01:10:07,522 --> 01:10:09,992
"What am I supposed to do here?"

1285
01:10:10,192 --> 01:10:13,561
Those thoughts filled my head.

1286
01:10:13,562 --> 01:10:14,792
(Well...)

1287
01:10:15,892 --> 01:10:17,332
One thought was dominant.

1288
01:10:17,532 --> 01:10:19,662
"What kind of a lunatic planned this?"

1289
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:29,672
(Silence fills the room.)

1290
01:10:35,242 --> 01:10:37,352
There's someone you have good feelings about, but...

1291
01:10:37,652 --> 01:10:39,411
What? There's that.

1292
01:10:39,412 --> 01:10:42,682
But there are things I'm unsure about.

1293
01:10:43,792 --> 01:10:44,852
For now,

1294
01:10:49,422 --> 01:10:50,591
I'm watching him.

1295
01:10:50,592 --> 01:10:51,792
- You're watching him.
- Yes.

1296
01:11:00,202 --> 01:11:03,342
Yu Ra, do what you want so that there won't be any regrets.

1297
01:11:06,112 --> 01:11:09,212
I've always been like that.

1298
01:11:10,282 --> 01:11:11,882
I do things when I want to.

1299
01:11:13,822 --> 01:11:14,882
Okay.

1300
01:11:16,822 --> 01:11:18,922
But the first step is hard.

1301
01:11:21,992 --> 01:11:26,292
(Yu Ra leaves a meaningful comment.)

1302
01:11:29,632 --> 01:11:33,742
(He's suffering.)

1303
01:11:39,672 --> 01:11:40,882
How about you, Hyeon U?

1304
01:11:44,582 --> 01:11:46,212
- How am I feeling?
- Yes.

1305
01:11:47,852 --> 01:11:49,052
I'll step outside.

1306
01:11:50,952 --> 01:11:52,192
This is driving me crazy.

1307
01:11:52,592 --> 01:11:54,762
Why did you ask?

1308
01:11:55,062 --> 01:11:56,162
Hyeon U,

1309
01:11:56,962 --> 01:11:58,432
I'm honestly curious...

1310
01:11:59,432 --> 01:12:01,062
about how you feel.

1311
01:12:05,002 --> 01:12:06,802
Why are you curious about how I feel?

1312
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:09,001
Were my actions so confusing?

1313
01:12:09,002 --> 01:12:12,212
I didn't mean it like that. I'm simply curious as a roommate.

1314
01:12:12,842 --> 01:12:14,322
Does my curiosity make me suspicious?

1315
01:12:15,412 --> 01:12:16,512
How do I feel?

1316
01:12:18,012 --> 01:12:20,052
How is it? How's your current state?

1317
01:12:21,322 --> 01:12:22,521
There's just one thing.

1318
01:12:22,522 --> 01:12:24,552
I don't want to leave behind any regrets.

1319
01:12:24,892 --> 01:12:25,992
That's right.

1320
01:12:30,232 --> 01:12:36,202
(Everyone becomes thoughtful upon hearing Hyeon U's words.)

1321
01:12:36,562 --> 01:12:38,772
(Staring)

1322
01:12:41,502 --> 01:12:42,872
(Sighing)

1323
01:12:43,302 --> 01:12:44,412
Seriously.

1324
01:12:46,342 --> 01:12:47,482
It's hard.

1325
01:12:47,882 --> 01:12:49,012
It's hard.

1326
01:12:51,212 --> 01:12:53,982
Even in fortune telling,

1327
01:12:54,622 --> 01:12:57,192
the thing that's hardest to govern is human emotions. Right?

1328
01:12:58,622 --> 01:13:01,322
Human emotions are the hardest...

1329
01:13:02,192 --> 01:13:03,591
especially if they're about you,

1330
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:05,232
not the client.

1331
01:13:05,732 --> 01:13:07,032
Then it's so hard.

1332
01:13:08,802 --> 01:13:10,301
I know what you mean.

1333
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:13,942
I'm not a divine spirit, but a human disciple.

1334
01:13:14,642 --> 01:13:15,842
So it's like that.

1335
01:13:23,342 --> 01:13:24,652
So...

1336
01:13:25,252 --> 01:13:27,722
has everyone felt a change in heart?

1337
01:13:28,522 --> 01:13:30,291
I wouldn't call it a change in heart.

1338
01:13:30,292 --> 01:13:32,251
I've felt a change in mindset.

1339
01:13:32,252 --> 01:13:33,422
I became more cheerful.

1340
01:13:35,092 --> 01:13:36,972
I realized that it'd be okay to be more honest.

1341
01:13:37,092 --> 01:13:38,262
Of course.

1342
01:13:39,092 --> 01:13:41,031
So today and tomorrow as well,

1343
01:13:41,032 --> 01:13:42,631
I plan to do everything I want.

1344
01:13:42,632 --> 01:13:43,772
Of course.

1345
01:13:44,332 --> 01:13:46,272
- That suits you.
- Yes.

1346
01:13:46,532 --> 01:13:47,742
That's the right thing to do.

1347
01:13:50,472 --> 01:13:53,942
To be honest, I did waver.

1348
01:13:55,412 --> 01:13:56,782
I did waver.

1349
01:13:58,982 --> 01:14:02,452
I don't know if it's my personality or what.

1350
01:14:04,792 --> 01:14:06,092
As for me,

1351
01:14:06,862 --> 01:14:10,392
there's someone I'm worried about.

1352
01:14:10,692 --> 01:14:13,231
So talking to and joking around...

1353
01:14:13,232 --> 01:14:15,732
with other people...

1354
01:14:16,462 --> 01:14:18,831
didn't change my mind.

1355
01:14:18,832 --> 01:14:22,242
So it's rather uncomfortable.

1356
01:14:22,902 --> 01:14:26,542
I want to play more, but my personality isn't like that.

1357
01:14:27,112 --> 01:14:28,511
- Your personality?
- Yes.

1358
01:14:28,512 --> 01:14:30,812
By nature,

1359
01:14:31,382 --> 01:14:34,022
I gain a lot of satisfaction from one thing.

1360
01:14:34,822 --> 01:14:37,692
So I can't get myself involved with other people.

1361
01:14:38,452 --> 01:14:42,392
But to avoid discomfort from both sides,

1362
01:14:42,492 --> 01:14:44,662
I try to do it.

1363
01:14:46,592 --> 01:14:49,501
But whenever I really think about it,

1364
01:14:49,502 --> 01:14:51,131
(Ra Yun carefully delivers how she really feels.)

1365
01:14:51,132 --> 01:14:52,932
I can't do it very well.

1366
01:14:53,202 --> 01:14:54,942
That's how it is.

1367
01:14:56,502 --> 01:14:57,612
Well...

1368
01:15:02,182 --> 01:15:04,752
She was more daring and amazing than I thought.

1369
01:15:05,182 --> 01:15:06,921
Ra Yun understands me...

1370
01:15:06,922 --> 01:15:08,251
and pulls pranks on me.

1371
01:15:08,252 --> 01:15:09,952
Thanks to her,

1372
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:12,191
I received consolation and help.

1373
01:15:12,192 --> 01:15:15,791
Being with both Ra Yun and Yu Ra made me more certain.

1374
01:15:15,792 --> 01:15:16,961
The one...

1375
01:15:16,962 --> 01:15:19,732
who's more attractive and reassuring...

1376
01:15:19,962 --> 01:15:22,602
is Ra Yun.

1377
01:15:23,432 --> 01:15:26,332
He said something along the line of,

1378
01:15:26,532 --> 01:15:28,441
"I think I've made up my mind."

1379
01:15:28,442 --> 01:15:29,942
I want to believe that.

1380
01:15:30,102 --> 01:15:31,442
For now,

1381
01:15:31,872 --> 01:15:34,442
I want to agree with and support his feelings...

1382
01:15:35,442 --> 01:15:39,112
and move forward with him.

1383
01:15:42,752 --> 01:15:44,451
She's confessing her love for Gang Won.

1384
01:15:44,452 --> 01:15:45,522
That's right.

1385
01:15:45,822 --> 01:15:48,892
That's right. Things become certain when you have a group date.

1386
01:15:50,062 --> 01:15:52,262
The two of them will become tight.

1387
01:15:52,562 --> 01:15:54,102
What will Yu Ra do?

1388
01:15:54,562 --> 01:15:56,302
My heart aches.

1389
01:15:57,832 --> 01:15:59,002
I don't know.

1390
01:16:00,032 --> 01:16:03,102
I can sense that...

1391
01:16:03,502 --> 01:16:06,672
he still hasn't made up his mind.

1392
01:16:08,282 --> 01:16:10,982
Now, I'm...

1393
01:16:11,282 --> 01:16:12,812
frustrated.

1394
01:16:13,352 --> 01:16:17,052
I had to think about Gang Won again.

1395
01:16:18,052 --> 01:16:21,322
I wasn't annoyed with the atmosphere.

1396
01:16:21,892 --> 01:16:24,932
However, the situation...

1397
01:16:25,332 --> 01:16:28,762
didn't go smoothly and I didn't get any chance.

1398
01:16:28,962 --> 01:16:30,302
I'm disappointed about that.

1399
01:16:33,642 --> 01:16:39,842
(The group date ends.)

1400
01:16:41,042 --> 01:16:43,182
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1401
01:16:43,282 --> 01:16:44,482
It's good. It's tasty.

1402
01:16:45,552 --> 01:16:47,682
- Is it bone-in chicken?
- I think it's boneless.

1403
01:16:47,982 --> 01:16:49,282
Freshly-fried chicken.

1404
01:16:49,722 --> 01:16:52,422
- Their fried chicken is famous.
- Yes.

1405
01:16:52,622 --> 01:16:53,922
It looks tasty.

1406
01:16:54,862 --> 01:16:56,222
(Eating)

1407
01:16:57,892 --> 01:17:00,632
(Taking a big bite)

1408
01:17:02,702 --> 01:17:04,272
(My goodness)

1409
01:17:04,332 --> 01:17:06,032
It's moist, not dry.

1410
01:17:07,902 --> 01:17:09,572
It isn't hard. It's tasty.

1411
01:17:10,872 --> 01:17:12,742
The bone-in chicken is spicy and nice.

1412
01:17:15,212 --> 01:17:16,892
The seasoning is tasty because it's spicy.

1413
01:17:17,682 --> 01:17:20,782
I looked it up and ordered it before. It was nice. It was tasty.

1414
01:17:22,852 --> 01:17:24,822
- I can take it off easily.
- That's right.

1415
01:17:25,792 --> 01:17:26,922
That's good enough.

1416
01:17:27,362 --> 01:17:28,421
Thank you.

1417
01:17:28,422 --> 01:17:31,061
- Everyone did well today.
- Thank you.

1418
01:17:31,062 --> 01:17:32,582
(They wrap up the day with cold beer.)

1419
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:34,632
(Drinking)

1420
01:17:41,572 --> 01:17:43,002
Gosh, it's refreshing.

1421
01:17:48,582 --> 01:17:50,412
The Hall of Sacred Spirits has opened.

1422
01:17:51,312 --> 01:17:52,812
Please enter in turns.

1423
01:17:54,882 --> 01:17:58,992
(Yu Ra is the first one to enter the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1424
01:18:01,962 --> 01:18:07,062
(Tonight, whom will Yu Ra choose?)

1425
01:18:12,932 --> 01:18:15,772
Although I was a bit torn,

1426
01:18:16,342 --> 01:18:19,072
I chose Gang Won...

1427
01:18:19,442 --> 01:18:21,242
because I saw the way..

1428
01:18:21,582 --> 01:18:24,182
He tried to look after me attentively.

1429
01:18:25,382 --> 01:18:26,982
It made my heart go out to him.

1430
01:18:27,352 --> 01:18:29,452
However, I can tell that...

1431
01:18:30,792 --> 01:18:33,662
he still hasn't made up his mind.

1432
01:18:34,122 --> 01:18:37,232
I had negative feelings back then.

1433
01:18:37,592 --> 01:18:41,432
If Gang Won doesn't give me his vote today,

1434
01:18:42,132 --> 01:18:43,132
this will be...

1435
01:18:44,532 --> 01:18:45,602
the end.

1436
01:18:53,142 --> 01:18:56,682
(Lee Ra Yun)

1437
01:18:56,782 --> 01:18:59,512
To be honest, Hyeon U was by Ra Yun's side all along.

1438
01:18:59,852 --> 01:19:01,582
I don't have much room in my mind.

1439
01:19:02,122 --> 01:19:04,222
In the current situation, it's 10 to 0.

1440
01:19:05,352 --> 01:19:07,522
It isn't even 9 to 1. It's 10 to 0.

1441
01:19:12,592 --> 01:19:19,772
(Lee Gang Won chooses Lee Ra Yun.)

1442
01:19:21,272 --> 01:19:22,741
(Well...)

1443
01:19:22,742 --> 01:19:24,072
This time has come today as well.

1444
01:19:29,342 --> 01:19:30,712
It's always before my eyes.

1445
01:19:32,652 --> 01:19:34,321
(Lee Gang Won)

1446
01:19:34,322 --> 01:19:36,282
Gang Won entered my mind right away.

1447
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:40,252
From our first meeting to now,

1448
01:19:41,062 --> 01:19:44,992
we currently have the most amount of certainty in each other.

1449
01:19:46,932 --> 01:19:50,362
(As always, she picks up Gang Won's name plaque.)

1450
01:19:51,102 --> 01:19:56,372
(Lee Ra Yun chooses Lee Gang Won.)

1451
01:19:57,472 --> 01:20:00,212
Did I decide too quickly? This is bad.

1452
01:20:03,282 --> 01:20:06,982
(Lee Ra Yun)

1453
01:20:09,622 --> 01:20:12,892
I chose Ra Yun once more today.

1454
01:20:14,022 --> 01:20:20,292
(Jung Hyeon U chooses Lee Ra Yun.)

1455
01:20:21,562 --> 01:20:24,101
To be honest, I thought hard about it.

1456
01:20:24,102 --> 01:20:26,672
When I voted at the Hall of Sacred Spirits,

1457
01:20:26,772 --> 01:20:28,672
I had no confidence.

1458
01:20:30,102 --> 01:20:33,942
I'm thinking, "I might not get any votes today as well."

1459
01:20:35,042 --> 01:20:39,452
(Ho Am enters the Hall of Sacred Spirits next.)

1460
01:20:43,552 --> 01:20:45,668
When we read our fortunes at the Pavilion of Connections,

1461
01:20:45,692 --> 01:20:47,222
we got a red flag and a white flag.

1462
01:20:47,692 --> 01:20:49,292
They mean "Completion."

1463
01:20:49,662 --> 01:20:52,092
The result told me that my efforts paid off.

1464
01:20:52,192 --> 01:20:54,962
I'll continue to show Yu Gyeong that I like her.

1465
01:20:55,762 --> 01:20:59,371
To be honest, Ho Am put it very clearly...

1466
01:20:59,372 --> 01:21:02,942
at the Pavilion of Connections.

1467
01:21:03,042 --> 01:21:05,241
I could feel that he had the intention...

1468
01:21:05,242 --> 01:21:08,312
to approach me romantically.

1469
01:21:08,412 --> 01:21:11,152
I was very thankful.

1470
01:21:13,612 --> 01:21:17,452
(Chae Yu Gyeong chooses Jang Ho Am.)

1471
01:21:21,092 --> 01:21:25,532
(Jang Ho Am chooses Chae Yu Gyeong.)

1472
01:21:26,462 --> 01:21:32,332
(The two of them chose each other tonight as well.)

1473
01:21:38,042 --> 01:21:39,212
Completion.

1474
01:21:39,742 --> 01:21:41,011
We knew that it'd happen.

1475
01:21:41,012 --> 01:21:42,492
- That's right.
- Ho Am is like that.

1476
01:21:42,612 --> 01:21:43,612
How about Yun Jeong?

1477
01:21:44,352 --> 01:21:46,482
- Whom will Yun Jeong choose?
- Yun Jeong.

1478
01:21:47,252 --> 01:21:48,321
What will Yun Jeong do?

1479
01:21:48,322 --> 01:21:49,982
It breaks my heart.

1480
01:21:51,892 --> 01:21:54,121
(Yun Jeong's eyes are...)

1481
01:21:54,122 --> 01:21:57,262
(on Ho Am's name plaque.)

1482
01:21:59,462 --> 01:22:01,432
Ho Am and Yu Gyeong are...

1483
01:22:01,602 --> 01:22:04,472
both shamans.

1484
01:22:04,572 --> 01:22:06,502
I can't come between them...

1485
01:22:06,902 --> 01:22:09,702
because they click on a deep level.

1486
01:22:10,472 --> 01:22:13,541
I keep being dishonest...

1487
01:22:13,542 --> 01:22:17,112
and pulling up a wall to defend myself.

1488
01:22:17,612 --> 01:22:20,111
I can't open my heart easily,

1489
01:22:20,112 --> 01:22:21,122
so I'm...

1490
01:22:22,482 --> 01:22:24,392
in a frustrated state.

1491
01:22:30,022 --> 01:22:34,462
(After much deliberation, Yun Jeong makes up her mind.)

1492
01:22:36,062 --> 01:22:39,731
(Did Yun Jeong make an honest decision?)

1493
01:22:39,732 --> 01:22:43,402
(Lee Ra Yun, Hong Yu Ra, Kim Yun Jeong, Chae Yu Gyeong)

1494
01:22:46,012 --> 01:22:49,912
(Whom will Byeong Yeol choose tonight?)

1495
01:23:02,722 --> 01:23:06,592
(Sang Hyeok's thoughts deepen.)

1496
01:23:11,032 --> 01:23:17,312
(Nine fortune tellers finished making a decision.)

1497
01:23:18,372 --> 01:23:21,442
(Snow falls as if it was covering their worries.)

1498
01:23:26,682 --> 01:23:28,651
(Tonight, the Blue Chicken chose you.)

1499
01:23:28,652 --> 01:23:33,122
(Tonight, the Black Horse chose you.)

1500
01:23:33,622 --> 01:23:35,462
(Sighing)

1501
01:23:36,992 --> 01:23:42,002
(Gang Won's face is dark.)

1502
01:23:47,102 --> 01:23:49,002
I think the Blue Chicken is Yu Ra.

1503
01:23:49,842 --> 01:23:51,811
I can't help but worry about it.

1504
01:23:51,812 --> 01:23:53,572
She was someone I talked to.

1505
01:23:53,912 --> 01:23:55,812
So my heart was troubled, to be honest.

1506
01:24:01,282 --> 01:24:04,752
(Ra Yun receives the messages as well.)

1507
01:24:05,452 --> 01:24:07,321
(Tonight, the White Monkey chose you.)

1508
01:24:07,322 --> 01:24:11,132
(Tonight, the Blue Chicken chose you.)

1509
01:24:11,732 --> 01:24:14,061
After going on a date with Hyeon U,

1510
01:24:14,062 --> 01:24:15,632
I kept receiving a message.

1511
01:24:16,862 --> 01:24:18,972
So I think the Blue Chicken is Hyeon U.

1512
01:24:19,872 --> 01:24:22,702
So I feel apologetic...

1513
01:24:22,802 --> 01:24:25,312
and embarrassed.

1514
01:24:29,012 --> 01:24:30,752
I think you feel a prick of conscience.

1515
01:24:32,352 --> 01:24:34,581
This isn't fortune reading.

1516
01:24:34,582 --> 01:24:36,981
(Tonight, no one chose you in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1517
01:24:36,982 --> 01:24:38,252
Seriously.

1518
01:24:39,652 --> 01:24:42,962
I received a message that no one chose me.

1519
01:24:45,562 --> 01:24:46,962
I thought I was fine,

1520
01:24:47,362 --> 01:24:50,062
but it made me feel complicated.

1521
01:24:51,872 --> 01:24:55,102
"If I continue to go straight,"

1522
01:24:56,302 --> 01:24:58,612
"I'll get badly injured in case of an accident."

1523
01:24:59,372 --> 01:25:01,882
That worry entered my mind.

1524
01:25:02,842 --> 01:25:04,482
"I should empty my expectations."

1525
01:25:05,582 --> 01:25:06,912
I had that thought.

1526
01:25:08,482 --> 01:25:10,481
The reading? Hold on.

1527
01:25:10,482 --> 01:25:11,791
- You got it.
- Did you get it?

1528
01:25:11,792 --> 01:25:12,792
You got a message.

1529
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:16,062
(Glancing over)

1530
01:25:17,662 --> 01:25:20,592
(Tonight, the White Dog chose you.)

1531
01:25:21,745 --> 01:25:25,915
(Very surprised)

1532
01:25:27,145 --> 01:25:30,315
She's looking at that expression in real-time.

1533
01:25:31,415 --> 01:25:33,055
I didn't know that he was so expressive.

1534
01:25:33,355 --> 01:25:34,624
I understand why he's flustered.

1535
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:36,324
- Of course.
- She's right next to him.

1536
01:25:36,325 --> 01:25:37,594
- She's right next to him.
- Seriously.

1537
01:25:37,595 --> 01:25:39,464
This is fun. She's watching him in real-time.

1538
01:25:39,465 --> 01:25:41,895
- What a timing.
- Seriously.

1539
01:25:45,235 --> 01:25:46,865
(Glancing over)

1540
01:25:47,535 --> 01:25:49,234
- He's acting with his face.
- Is he acting?

1541
01:25:49,235 --> 01:25:50,434
He's acting with his face.

1542
01:25:50,435 --> 01:25:54,105
He must've gotten a message from someone new.

1543
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:58,685
(She can't help but listen to their conversation.)

1544
01:26:00,745 --> 01:26:04,355
(The White Dog's message is quite shocking.)

1545
01:26:05,825 --> 01:26:08,384
- What's that reaction?
- He's acting.

1546
01:26:08,385 --> 01:26:10,905
(Byeong Yeol's flustered reaction is shocking to other people.)

1547
01:26:11,555 --> 01:26:14,225
(Glancing over)

1548
01:26:17,235 --> 01:26:18,535
It's a bit surprising.

1549
01:26:19,865 --> 01:26:20,865
I'm surprised.

1550
01:26:21,165 --> 01:26:22,405
Was he chosen by 2 to 3 people?

1551
01:26:23,075 --> 01:26:24,935
(Frustrated)

1552
01:26:29,215 --> 01:26:31,645
(Sullen)

1553
01:26:32,785 --> 01:26:35,345
(A while ago at the Hall of Sacred Spirits)

1554
01:26:35,855 --> 01:26:42,155
(Kim Yun Jeong chooses Ha Byeong Yeol.)

1555
01:26:42,795 --> 01:26:46,025
(The identity of Yun Jeong that chose Byeong Yeol)

1556
01:26:46,425 --> 01:26:51,465
(White Dog, Kim Yun Jeong)

1557
01:26:52,765 --> 01:26:56,975
(Why did Yun Jeong choose Byeong Yeol?)

1558
01:26:57,905 --> 01:27:01,504
I was quite exhausted and confused at that point.

1559
01:27:01,505 --> 01:27:05,345
"I don't know. I'll try my best with my abilities."

1560
01:27:05,585 --> 01:27:07,145
This was the heart that I had.

1561
01:27:07,315 --> 01:27:10,185
(During the pre-selection)

1562
01:27:10,285 --> 01:27:12,324
(Gold Dragon, August 20, 1992)

1563
01:27:12,325 --> 01:27:14,185
I chose the Gold Dragon.

1564
01:27:15,855 --> 01:27:18,255
I focused just on that...

1565
01:27:18,325 --> 01:27:20,525
to get away from my problem.

1566
01:27:25,335 --> 01:27:27,605
I think Byeong Yeol is the Gold Dragon.

1567
01:27:31,505 --> 01:27:33,475
She doesn't know at all.

1568
01:27:33,605 --> 01:27:34,845
You're wrong.

1569
01:27:35,975 --> 01:27:37,474
She had the group date today.

1570
01:27:37,475 --> 01:27:39,314
She read their fortunes before that...

1571
01:27:39,315 --> 01:27:41,414
and was able to figure out...

1572
01:27:41,415 --> 01:27:43,215
Ho Am and Yu Gyeong's hearts.

1573
01:27:43,555 --> 01:27:45,455
I think there has been a change in her heart.

1574
01:27:46,385 --> 01:27:47,624
Right.

1575
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:49,425
She chose Byeong Yeol.

1576
01:27:49,925 --> 01:27:51,855
Is she finding the Gold Dragon?

1577
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,525
Or is she hiding her heart?

1578
01:27:55,795 --> 01:27:57,634
(Yun Jeong's choice is hard to understand.)

1579
01:27:57,635 --> 01:27:59,005
This feels just like a drama.

1580
01:28:02,105 --> 01:28:05,334
If I'm right about the animal,

1581
01:28:05,335 --> 01:28:08,345
Byeol Yeol is the Gold Dragon.

1582
01:28:13,285 --> 01:28:15,855
(The 2nd night)

1583
01:28:18,655 --> 01:28:21,725
(Yun Sang Hyeok chooses Kim Yun Jeong.)

1584
01:28:24,525 --> 01:28:26,625
He consistently chose me.

1585
01:28:26,695 --> 01:28:28,194
(The 3rd night)

1586
01:28:28,195 --> 01:28:29,835
He chose me again yesterday.

1587
01:28:30,195 --> 01:28:36,105
(Yun Sang Hyeok chooses Kim Yun Jeong.)

1588
01:28:36,675 --> 01:28:39,805
I did think that I should open up...

1589
01:28:40,505 --> 01:28:45,345
and talk with him a bit more.

1590
01:28:45,915 --> 01:28:47,645
There's still time left...

1591
01:28:47,945 --> 01:28:51,014
and it may be a short time,

1592
01:28:51,015 --> 01:28:53,085
but you never know what will happen.

1593
01:28:53,855 --> 01:28:58,395
(Yun Jeong mistook Byeong Yeol to be the Gold Dragon.)

1594
01:29:05,365 --> 01:29:10,205
(Tonight, no one chose you in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1595
01:29:11,275 --> 01:29:14,805
(Yun Jeong got 0 votes for the first time.)

1596
01:29:17,015 --> 01:29:18,345
Out of all days!

1597
01:29:18,945 --> 01:29:20,245
(Shocked)

1598
01:29:21,585 --> 01:29:22,615
This is the first time.

1599
01:29:23,655 --> 01:29:25,825
The flow of things keeps changing.

1600
01:29:26,125 --> 01:29:29,194
She happened to open her heart...

1601
01:29:29,195 --> 01:29:30,754
- to Byeong Yeol for the first time.
- Right.

1602
01:29:30,755 --> 01:29:31,995
But no one chose her.

1603
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:34,325
- What to do?
- Gosh.

1604
01:29:35,365 --> 01:29:37,594
These confusing things keep happening...

1605
01:29:37,595 --> 01:29:38,865
- Right.
- just to Yun Jeong.

1606
01:29:48,145 --> 01:29:50,444
I'll get going. Bye.

1607
01:29:50,445 --> 01:29:51,545
See you tomorrow.

1608
01:29:56,455 --> 01:29:58,515
Gosh, I don't think I'm right.

1609
01:30:00,425 --> 01:30:03,795
(Yun Jeong is confused about the missing Gold Dragon.)

1610
01:30:11,295 --> 01:30:15,875
(Tonight, no one chose you in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1611
01:30:26,585 --> 01:30:29,414
(Yun Jeong missed her destined partner...)

1612
01:30:29,415 --> 01:30:32,214
(right in front of her eyes.)

1613
01:30:32,215 --> 01:30:33,425
This is driving me insane.

1614
01:30:42,025 --> 01:30:46,935
(Tonight, the Black Monkey chose you.)

1615
01:30:47,565 --> 01:30:49,275
(Peeking)

1616
01:30:50,935 --> 01:30:54,145
The Black Monkey was someone that I thought to be special.

1617
01:30:54,305 --> 01:30:57,645
It felt great to receive a message from her for two days straight.

1618
01:30:58,045 --> 01:31:01,844
I felt proud as it felt like a result...

1619
01:31:01,845 --> 01:31:04,085
that came from my efforts.

1620
01:31:06,385 --> 01:31:10,795
(He can't hide his smile.)

1621
01:31:11,855 --> 01:31:13,025
I don't feel sleepy.

1622
01:31:13,565 --> 01:31:15,735
My head hurts so much.

1623
01:31:17,195 --> 01:31:19,105
Talk with me.

1624
01:31:19,365 --> 01:31:21,235
It'll be the other way around today.

1625
01:31:21,735 --> 01:31:24,074
I can speak while lying down, right?

1626
01:31:24,075 --> 01:31:25,335
I feel so exhausted.

1627
01:31:25,845 --> 01:31:29,215
This happened earlier today.

1628
01:31:29,545 --> 01:31:31,275
I went to the Pavilion of Connections.

1629
01:31:31,675 --> 01:31:34,085
- Right.
- Ho Am called me there.

1630
01:31:34,845 --> 01:31:36,354
I went to the Pavilion of Connections...

1631
01:31:36,355 --> 01:31:37,885
as Ho Am called me there.

1632
01:31:38,585 --> 01:31:40,025
As a shaman,

1633
01:31:43,455 --> 01:31:46,664
I think he has made a big confession to me.

1634
01:31:46,665 --> 01:31:48,224
- He confessed his feelings to me.
- Really?

1635
01:31:48,225 --> 01:31:50,794
A confession as a shaman? What does that mean?

1636
01:31:50,795 --> 01:31:53,505
Out of the things a shaman can say,

1637
01:31:53,965 --> 01:31:55,804
it felt like he said...

1638
01:31:55,805 --> 01:31:58,305
the best thing that could be said to me.

1639
01:31:58,435 --> 01:32:03,644
He said that I liked being certain and honest with things,

1640
01:32:03,645 --> 01:32:06,205
so he said that he would express himself certainly and honestly.

1641
01:32:07,115 --> 01:32:08,315
That's the best thing to hear.

1642
01:32:08,615 --> 01:32:12,585
It felt like I heard something that went beyond a confession.

1643
01:32:14,025 --> 01:32:16,654
I felt so grateful...

1644
01:32:16,655 --> 01:32:19,201
and it would be a lie if I said it didn't make my heart flutter.

1645
01:32:19,225 --> 01:32:20,895
But for some reason,

1646
01:32:23,835 --> 01:32:27,165
I keep getting this thought of wanting to talk with Byeong Yeol.

1647
01:32:28,735 --> 01:32:31,105
- Right.
- "I want to talk with Byeong Yeol."

1648
01:32:31,335 --> 01:32:33,774
That thought kept running through my mind...

1649
01:32:33,775 --> 01:32:37,075
during the whole group date, to be honest.

1650
01:32:37,775 --> 01:32:39,344
(Shocked)

1651
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:40,445
Look at that.

1652
01:32:40,485 --> 01:32:41,814
(Amazed)

1653
01:32:41,815 --> 01:32:44,085
- Look at that.
- She still had that thought.

1654
01:32:45,885 --> 01:32:47,385
I'm getting goosebumps right now.

1655
01:32:49,025 --> 01:32:51,101
She's curious about him. She keeps feeling curious about him.

1656
01:32:51,125 --> 01:32:54,064
When she talked about his clothes...

1657
01:32:54,065 --> 01:32:55,464
When she mentioned that,

1658
01:32:55,465 --> 01:32:57,334
it was because he caught her attention.

1659
01:32:57,335 --> 01:32:58,394
She mentioned it on purpose.

1660
01:32:58,395 --> 01:33:00,435
(Thrilled)

1661
01:33:03,835 --> 01:33:09,445
(Byeol Yeol filled her head while she was with Ho Am.)

1662
01:33:09,775 --> 01:33:11,315
I gave it some thought...

1663
01:33:12,415 --> 01:33:14,645
and I could understand more of my heart.

1664
01:33:14,845 --> 01:33:16,814
I think I was attracted to Byeong Yeol...

1665
01:33:16,815 --> 01:33:18,184
right from the start.

1666
01:33:18,185 --> 01:33:20,985
(During the pre-selection)

1667
01:33:23,255 --> 01:33:25,055
I was attracted to that fate plaque the most.

1668
01:33:25,965 --> 01:33:27,964
I felt that I was going to be attracted to that person a lot.

1669
01:33:27,965 --> 01:33:29,465
(Gold Dragon)

1670
01:33:32,065 --> 01:33:36,075
(She was led to the Gold Dragon as her destined partner.)

1671
01:33:36,735 --> 01:33:38,675
(During the first encounter)

1672
01:33:41,045 --> 01:33:44,175
I'm Ha Byeong Yeol. Hello.

1673
01:33:47,315 --> 01:33:50,355
I felt nothing from him...

1674
01:33:50,685 --> 01:33:52,245
and that was made me curious about him.

1675
01:33:52,785 --> 01:33:55,624
(Who is that person?)

1676
01:33:55,625 --> 01:33:57,455
(What does he have?)

1677
01:33:58,055 --> 01:33:59,764
(She was attracted to Byeong Yeol for some reason...)

1678
01:33:59,765 --> 01:34:01,495
(from their first encounter.)

1679
01:34:02,695 --> 01:34:05,694
I'm not sure if this is my true heart,

1680
01:34:05,695 --> 01:34:09,305
but I kept being curious about Byeong Yeol.

1681
01:34:09,475 --> 01:34:12,074
(Is he the one chosen by the spirit?)

1682
01:34:12,075 --> 01:34:14,705
I still am not certain about my heart.

1683
01:34:15,075 --> 01:34:17,815
It could be Byeong Yeol.

1684
01:34:18,415 --> 01:34:21,145
(He could be the Gold Dragon.)

1685
01:34:21,585 --> 01:34:24,685
(During the group date)

1686
01:34:25,655 --> 01:34:27,454
- Your...
- What's wrong?

1687
01:34:27,455 --> 01:34:29,124
Are my legs too spread apart?

1688
01:34:29,125 --> 01:34:30,495
I'll sit comfortably.

1689
01:34:31,725 --> 01:34:33,425
That's too much though.

1690
01:34:35,265 --> 01:34:37,865
- Am I taking your space?
- Not at all.

1691
01:34:39,065 --> 01:34:40,904
- But it is a bit embarrassing.
- But...

1692
01:34:40,905 --> 01:34:42,875
Really? I noticed something.

1693
01:34:43,335 --> 01:34:45,004
I saw different shamans...

1694
01:34:45,005 --> 01:34:47,304
and they seemed to share this in common.

1695
01:34:47,305 --> 01:34:49,075
That is a sign of affection from us.

1696
01:34:49,315 --> 01:34:50,315
- Really?
- We won't talk to people...

1697
01:34:50,315 --> 01:34:51,315
if we aren't interested in them.

1698
01:34:51,316 --> 01:34:52,374
- It's not picking up a fight.
- What is it called?

1699
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:53,444
It's a prank.

1700
01:34:53,445 --> 01:34:55,084
- It's a sign of affection.
- Really?

1701
01:34:55,085 --> 01:34:56,715
It's a sign of affection from us.

1702
01:34:59,885 --> 01:35:03,454
Should we take five of these and share them?

1703
01:35:03,455 --> 01:35:04,455
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1704
01:35:04,695 --> 01:35:06,865
- Away from the rain.
- I'll cover you from the rain.

1705
01:35:07,295 --> 01:35:08,565
- Here?
- Yes.

1706
01:35:09,125 --> 01:35:11,765
The two of them are matching in colour too.

1707
01:35:13,235 --> 01:35:18,535
(Her eyes kept heading toward Byeong Yeol.)

1708
01:35:20,345 --> 01:35:21,545
The Gold Dragon...

1709
01:35:22,245 --> 01:35:23,275
is Byeong Yeol.

1710
01:35:23,645 --> 01:35:26,345
I just feel that he is the Gold Dragon.

1711
01:35:27,645 --> 01:35:28,815
I'm 100 percent certain.

1712
01:35:31,255 --> 01:35:32,315
What?

1713
01:35:34,985 --> 01:35:37,454
Yun Jeong and Yu Gyeong...

1714
01:35:37,455 --> 01:35:40,824
both are thinking Byeong Yeol to be the Gold Dragon.

1715
01:35:40,825 --> 01:35:42,164
(Nobody expected this to happen.)

1716
01:35:42,165 --> 01:35:43,464
He isn't the Gold Dragon.

1717
01:35:43,465 --> 01:35:44,534
- It isn't him.
- What would happen...

1718
01:35:44,535 --> 01:35:45,564
if they find out later?

1719
01:35:45,565 --> 01:35:46,605
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

1720
01:35:47,265 --> 01:35:49,334
It's the day she got the best confession.

1721
01:35:49,335 --> 01:35:50,505
But on that day,

1722
01:35:50,905 --> 01:35:53,005
she happened to realize her heart...

1723
01:35:53,245 --> 01:35:55,874
of her being curious about Byeong Yeol.

1724
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:56,875
Right.

1725
01:35:59,145 --> 01:36:00,245
I'm curious about him.

1726
01:36:00,485 --> 01:36:02,544
I realized this.

1727
01:36:02,545 --> 01:36:04,755
I'm curious about that person.

1728
01:36:05,915 --> 01:36:08,285
I'm really curious about Byeong Yeol.

1729
01:36:13,825 --> 01:36:15,065
- Hold on.
- right.

1730
01:36:15,825 --> 01:36:17,964
(Tonight, the Black Bull chose you.)

1731
01:36:17,965 --> 01:36:19,404
(Tonight, the Gold Dragon chose you.)

1732
01:36:19,405 --> 01:36:20,605
- What?
- Right.

1733
01:36:23,175 --> 01:36:24,475
- What?
- What?

1734
01:36:24,705 --> 01:36:25,935
Really?

1735
01:36:26,405 --> 01:36:27,475
- What?
- Hold on.

1736
01:36:27,975 --> 01:36:29,775
(A result that is hard to believe)

1737
01:36:30,475 --> 01:36:33,715
- Gosh, this is amazing.
- Yu Ra was chosen?

1738
01:36:34,145 --> 01:36:36,984
Byeong Yeol went on a date with Yu Ra...

1739
01:36:36,985 --> 01:36:39,154
and stopped being interested in her. Did he go back to her?

1740
01:36:39,155 --> 01:36:40,325
- That must be it.
- Gosh!

1741
01:36:41,255 --> 01:36:43,254
Did something happen? I'm curious.

1742
01:36:43,255 --> 01:36:45,295
- Gosh, this is crazy.
- Gosh.

1743
01:36:45,595 --> 01:36:47,095
(Puzzled)

1744
01:36:47,665 --> 01:36:48,864
- What?
- Right.

1745
01:36:48,865 --> 01:36:51,964
(Messages from the Gold Dragon and Black Cow...)

1746
01:36:51,965 --> 01:36:53,104
Is it someone else?

1747
01:36:53,105 --> 01:36:54,625
(with Yu Gyeong right in front of her)

1748
01:36:56,605 --> 01:36:59,445
What? This is strange.

1749
01:37:00,905 --> 01:37:03,115
- Why?
- I'm not sure about this.

1750
01:37:11,015 --> 01:37:16,755
(Yun Sang Hyeok chooses Hong Yu Ra.)

1751
01:37:17,925 --> 01:37:22,995
(Ha Byeong Yeol chooses Hong Yu Ra.)

1752
01:37:24,295 --> 01:37:29,904
(Two men chose Yu Ra tonight.)

1753
01:37:29,905 --> 01:37:31,375
I'm getting goosebumps right now.

1754
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:35,844
Byeong Yeol and Sang Hyeok...

1755
01:37:35,845 --> 01:37:36,914
weren't able to get any votes...

1756
01:37:36,915 --> 01:37:38,175
- until now.
- Right.

1757
01:37:38,475 --> 01:37:40,715
So they decided...

1758
01:37:40,915 --> 01:37:43,685
- to move onto someone else.
- Right.

1759
01:37:43,915 --> 01:37:45,684
- They had a change in heart.
- How was it timed like this?

1760
01:37:45,685 --> 01:37:47,401
How did they all miss each other like this?

1761
01:37:47,425 --> 01:37:48,625
What is love?

1762
01:37:49,825 --> 01:37:52,624
The timing is insane.

1763
01:37:52,625 --> 01:37:53,724
Seriously.

1764
01:37:53,725 --> 01:37:55,005
(The timing was tragically off.)

1765
01:37:55,265 --> 01:37:57,035
I need to get things sorted.

1766
01:38:10,075 --> 01:38:15,215
(Tonight, the White Chicken chose you.)

1767
01:38:16,815 --> 01:38:17,985
(Putting down)

1768
01:38:18,385 --> 01:38:23,555
(Yu Gyeong puts on a sombre look after getting Ho Am's message.)

1769
01:38:24,495 --> 01:38:26,224
In the midst of that...

1770
01:38:26,225 --> 01:38:29,095
The person that I think to be the White Chicken...

1771
01:38:30,095 --> 01:38:33,765
is Ho Am. I got a message from him.

1772
01:38:34,165 --> 01:38:35,635
I thought that...

1773
01:38:36,605 --> 01:38:38,735
I should be careful with my actions.

1774
01:38:40,245 --> 01:38:42,145
This was what I thought.

1775
01:38:42,945 --> 01:38:47,685
(Yu Gyeong suddenly heads out with her coat.)

1776
01:38:47,885 --> 01:38:49,045
Right.

1777
01:38:52,615 --> 01:38:55,655
(She follows Byeong Yeol.)

1778
01:38:58,195 --> 01:38:59,395
Ho Am isn't here.

1779
01:39:00,465 --> 01:39:01,564
Right.

1780
01:39:01,565 --> 01:39:02,565
(Closing shut)

1781
01:39:04,765 --> 01:39:06,935
(Peeking)

1782
01:39:07,065 --> 01:39:08,605
Should I turn on the lights? Hold on.

1783
01:39:08,865 --> 01:39:10,505
I'll be back after turning on the lights.

1784
01:39:17,445 --> 01:39:22,715
(Yu Gyeong suddenly came into Byeong Yeol's room.)

1785
01:39:28,625 --> 01:39:32,925
(The door closes with just the two of them inside.)

1786
01:39:36,835 --> 01:39:38,065
When is the woman coming?

1787
01:39:38,435 --> 01:39:40,304
I was reading into the catfish.

1788
01:39:40,305 --> 01:39:42,435
- What? Really?
- Awesome!

1789
01:39:42,535 --> 01:39:43,604
Hey! Gosh.

1790
01:39:43,605 --> 01:39:45,134
- How is she?
- I keep saying "hey."

1791
01:39:45,135 --> 01:39:46,474
- Let me ask you this.
- I got so excited.

1792
01:39:46,475 --> 01:39:47,915
- Is she pretty?
- I got so excited.

1793
01:39:48,075 --> 01:39:49,245
Is she pretty?

1794
01:39:51,945 --> 01:39:53,145
She's pretty.

1795
01:39:53,445 --> 01:39:54,684
Is she full of confidence?

1796
01:39:54,685 --> 01:39:56,185
She's emotional too.

1797
01:39:57,155 --> 01:40:00,084
She's great at her job and is competent.

1798
01:40:00,085 --> 01:40:01,605
She's talented in many different ways.

1799
01:40:01,685 --> 01:40:02,995
She's full of confidence too.

1800
01:40:03,355 --> 01:40:06,524
But she might not be satisfied with the men here.

1801
01:40:06,525 --> 01:40:07,824
That woman?

1802
01:40:07,825 --> 01:40:08,865
Right.

1803
01:40:09,065 --> 01:40:10,795
- Awesome.
- She's a total queen.

1804
01:40:11,395 --> 01:40:12,934
- This is crazy.
- A queen is coming.

1805
01:40:12,935 --> 01:40:14,105
- She is coming.
- Right.

1806
01:40:14,535 --> 01:40:16,805
"She is coming."

1807
01:40:17,075 --> 01:40:18,235
Oh, dear fairy.

1808
01:40:19,035 --> 01:40:21,175
I think she will take over this place.

1809
01:40:26,175 --> 01:40:27,945
I think someone will be very direct.

1810
01:40:28,315 --> 01:40:29,915
- Someone will be direct?
- Yes.

1811
01:40:33,855 --> 01:40:36,225
- Hello.
- Hello.

1812
01:40:36,455 --> 01:40:37,595
All right.

1813
01:40:38,625 --> 01:40:40,025
Shall we begin?

1814
01:40:41,765 --> 01:40:45,465
(Possessed Love S2)

1815
01:40:45,565 --> 01:40:47,435
(Date chosen by scratching a scratch card?)

1816
01:40:47,765 --> 01:40:49,264
(The person I'm most curious about...)

1817
01:40:49,265 --> 01:40:50,605
(is Byeong Yeol.)

1818
01:40:50,805 --> 01:40:53,205
(The shaman that is focused on just one man)

1819
01:40:53,275 --> 01:40:55,145
(I should get my heart sorted.)

1820
01:40:55,275 --> 01:40:56,615
(For me, it's Sang Hyeok.)

1821
01:40:56,845 --> 01:40:58,391
(The fortune tellers are feeling shaken?)

1822
01:40:58,415 --> 01:40:59,914
(Finally, )

1823
01:40:59,915 --> 01:41:02,115
(the Red Rabbit appears.)

1824
01:41:02,245 --> 01:41:03,315
(It's great to see you.)

1825
01:41:03,355 --> 01:41:04,485
(You look beautiful.)

1826
01:41:04,585 --> 01:41:06,114
(Why me?)

1827
01:41:06,115 --> 01:41:07,331
(During the unfamiliar meetings, )

1828
01:41:07,355 --> 01:41:10,325
(the men start to feel shaken.)

1829
01:41:10,925 --> 01:41:12,355
(When is the woman coming?)

1830
01:41:12,495 --> 01:41:14,175
(Is she having dates with them in secret?)

1831
01:41:14,295 --> 01:41:15,925
With the new woman's choice...

1832
01:41:16,495 --> 01:41:18,235
(Confusion brought by the Red Rabbit!)

1833
01:41:18,335 --> 01:41:19,335
(This is intense.)

1834
01:41:19,336 --> 01:41:20,365
(It's cruel.)

1835
01:41:21,035 --> 01:41:25,005
(Possessed Love S2)
