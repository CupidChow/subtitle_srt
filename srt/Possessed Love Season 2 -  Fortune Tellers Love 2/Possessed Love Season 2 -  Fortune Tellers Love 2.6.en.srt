1
00:00:25,644 --> 00:00:27,843
(All statements related to shamanism and fortune-telling...)

2
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:29,084
(made by the cast in this program...)

3
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:30,348
(are purely personal opinions.)

4
00:00:35,678 --> 00:00:38,418
(White Chicken)

5
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:07,107
(Possessed Love S2)

6
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,628
(Yu Ra, are you interested in anyone?)

7
00:01:09,048 --> 00:01:12,147
(The fortune tellers feel each other out.)

8
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:13,547
(Follow your heart.)

9
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:16,947
(I'm the type to do so in the first place.)

10
00:01:16,948 --> 00:01:18,387
(When I'm in front of you, Yu Gyeong, )

11
00:01:18,388 --> 00:01:19,688
(my heart races.)

12
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:22,287
(Ho Am goes straight to Yu Gyeong.)

13
00:01:22,288 --> 00:01:25,397
(My princesses say that they like you.)

14
00:01:25,398 --> 00:01:28,868
(Feelings grow.)

15
00:01:29,428 --> 00:01:32,468
(I have a personal question.)

16
00:01:32,668 --> 00:01:35,868
(And relationships get entangled.)

17
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,638
(Not yet?)

18
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,077
(Just a little more.)

19
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:42,377
(What will happen to these three?)

20
00:01:42,378 --> 00:01:45,447
(I went to read the love fortune with Ho Am, )

21
00:01:45,448 --> 00:01:47,477
(and I can't help but feel...)

22
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:48,517
(that I want to talk to Byeong Yeol.)

23
00:01:48,518 --> 00:01:51,317
(Was this connection made by the spirits?)

24
00:01:51,318 --> 00:01:53,458
(Gold Dragon)

25
00:01:54,818 --> 00:01:55,988
Maybe.

26
00:01:57,658 --> 00:01:59,197
You know, at the same time.

27
00:01:59,198 --> 00:02:01,928
(Yu Gyeong follows Byeong Yeol out of the blue.)

28
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:05,498
Ho Am isn't here.

29
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:08,938
(Slamming)

30
00:02:11,238 --> 00:02:12,307
(Glancing)

31
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:15,047
I felt bad for Ho Am,

32
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:17,578
and I felt sorry.

33
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:21,147
However, I was curious about Byeong Yeol.

34
00:02:21,148 --> 00:02:23,817
As soon as I realized that I was into him,

35
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:25,958
I made a move.

36
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:33,197
(Awkward)

37
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:34,918
You didn't clean your room at all, did you?

38
00:02:34,998 --> 00:02:37,527
- I don't. - The room is...

39
00:02:37,528 --> 00:02:39,667
I thought Ho Am would be the type...

40
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:41,038
to keep his room clean,

41
00:02:41,238 --> 00:02:44,307
but we turned out to be the same. It's convenient.

42
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:46,108
He only keeps his shrine clean.

43
00:02:46,178 --> 00:02:47,977
- Only his shrine? - Yes, just his shrine.

44
00:02:47,978 --> 00:02:49,478
There's not a speck of dust.

45
00:02:50,548 --> 00:02:54,348
(Their conversation in the room gets on his nerves.)

46
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:56,518
I have a question for you.

47
00:02:57,548 --> 00:02:58,618
What is it?

48
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:02,128
(Hesitating)

49
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:06,897
We've only spent half the program here.

50
00:03:06,898 --> 00:03:08,097
I think we have...

51
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:10,327
- enough time to talk. - I agree.

52
00:03:10,328 --> 00:03:12,498
I was curious about you,

53
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:14,298
so...

54
00:03:14,468 --> 00:03:16,867
I followed you into this room.

55
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:19,638
Thanks for telling me that first.

56
00:03:20,178 --> 00:03:22,807
Although we don't know each other that deeply,

57
00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:24,648
we know each other to a certain extent.

58
00:03:25,478 --> 00:03:29,717
But I wonder what you like about me.

59
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:31,348
Are you curious about that?

60
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:35,927
So, this isn't about being friends or colleagues.

61
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:38,458
Are you saying that you want to...

62
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:41,598
get to know me more?

63
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:43,597
Is that what you mean? I'm not...

64
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,697
exactly sure what you're trying to say.

65
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:47,037
(He struggled to ask her how she felt.)

66
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:48,767
I'll be honest.

67
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:50,268
I'm curious about you.

68
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:52,737
(Surprised)

69
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:53,978
You want to know more about me?

70
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:55,078
- Yes. - I see.

71
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:57,777
If I'm being honest...

72
00:03:57,778 --> 00:03:58,877
You're so hip-hop.

73
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:00,148
I believe...

74
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:04,788
- that I'm making my feelings clear. - Thank you for that.

75
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:08,088
I was pretty shocked.

76
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:12,497
I thought we had wrapped it up...

77
00:04:12,498 --> 00:04:14,057
as close friends or colleagues,

78
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:16,768
so I was going to feel comfortable around her.

79
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:22,067
But she came to me to talk...

80
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:25,638
about re-establishing our relationship.

81
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:30,177
I realized that I had been mistaken...

82
00:04:30,178 --> 00:04:32,048
by myself.

83
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:33,978
However, I still found it odd.

84
00:04:35,018 --> 00:04:37,417
There's another thing that surprised me.

85
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:38,587
Although you just told me this,

86
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:40,518
I obviously thought you were into Ho Am.

87
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:41,787
Aren't you?

88
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:43,828
About that... How should I put it?

89
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:45,957
(He asked her about her feelings for Ho Am.)

90
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:49,567
I'm... I don't know how to explain this.

91
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:50,668
It's a bit...

92
00:04:54,368 --> 00:04:58,777
In terms of our divine spirits, we're really compatible.

93
00:04:58,778 --> 00:05:02,278
"Is this what people say about the spirits coming to an agreement?"

94
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:04,447
We're so compatible...

95
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:06,948
that I almost think that.

96
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:09,548
I'm thankful.

97
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:11,887
Thankful to him.

98
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:13,918
- Thankful? - I'm thankful to Ho Am.

99
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:18,428
So, if I'm being honest,

100
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:20,798
I'm most curious about you.

101
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:23,097
(Surprised)

102
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:24,168
Goodness.

103
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:27,338
She was that into him?

104
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:29,268
I didn't know how big her feelings were.

105
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:32,278
- She's being completely honest. - She's so honest.

106
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:36,778
(I'm most curious about you.)

107
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:40,647
(He found out about her feelings for him.)

108
00:05:40,648 --> 00:05:41,718
Okay.

109
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:51,158
(And Ho Am can't figure out what's on her mind.)

110
00:05:51,928 --> 00:05:53,728
- Can I ask you one last question? - Yes.

111
00:05:54,698 --> 00:05:57,528
Will the conversations we've had so far...

112
00:05:57,898 --> 00:05:59,597
affect your decision?

113
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:01,598
- The conversations between us? - Yes.

114
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:03,567
Yes, they will.

115
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:06,277
To be frank, it's very embarrassing that I'm sitting here.

116
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:08,137
- It's so... - Is it?

117
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:10,707
Yes. I believe so.

118
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,817
I'll see you in a different kind of way.

119
00:06:13,818 --> 00:06:16,088
But I won't be...

120
00:06:16,618 --> 00:06:19,488
as awkward as I was before when I'm around you.

121
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:22,357
I'm not certain...

122
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:25,358
about anyone else yet, so...

123
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,728
Anyway,

124
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:34,168
I'd like to go on a date with you.

125
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:36,038
(Smiling)

126
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:38,467
That answer was good enough.

127
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:39,537
- Was it? - Okay.

128
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:41,707
If we get a chance...

129
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,107
I mean, if I get a chance to pick,

130
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:45,548
I'd like to pick you.

131
00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:49,188
And if you get a chance to pick,

132
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:53,388
I'll feel pretty good if you pick me.

133
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:56,388
- So, this is nice. - Yes.

134
00:06:56,828 --> 00:06:59,658
Thanks for telling me all this.

135
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:04,767
You must have felt so burdened.

136
00:07:04,768 --> 00:07:06,597
- Seriously. - Right?

137
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:07,758
That's what comes to my mind.

138
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:11,768
(This man burns with anxiety as their chat gets longer.)

139
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:16,108
(The door finally opens.)

140
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:18,878
It's snowing.

141
00:07:19,248 --> 00:07:21,047
- Is it snowing? - It is!

142
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:22,148
It's gorgeous.

143
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:24,918
It's snowing again.

144
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:32,858
(He looks at Yu Gyeong instead of out the window.)

145
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:36,097
He looked.

146
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:39,497
That situation must bother him so much.

147
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:41,297
Do you also notice that Yu Gyeong and Byeong Yeol...

148
00:07:41,298 --> 00:07:42,744
have gotten more intimate all of a sudden?

149
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:43,967
Ho Am will feel rushed.

150
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:46,278
- I wonder how he feels. - Poor him.

151
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:49,708
I think she talked to Byeong Yeol...

152
00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:53,748
for about 30 minutes.

153
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:57,887
So, I thought, "Was I mistaken?"

154
00:07:57,888 --> 00:07:59,387
"Why are they talking for so long?"

155
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:01,017
"Do they have that much to talk about?"

156
00:08:01,018 --> 00:08:03,727
I assume...

157
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:07,258
that Yu Gyeong has feelings for me,

158
00:08:07,428 --> 00:08:08,968
but I'm worried she'll waver.

159
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:11,728
That's what's on my mind.

160
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:15,868
(The 4 women are in 1 room.)

161
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:22,877
- You two... - What?

162
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,948
- Hey. - Why?

163
00:08:26,178 --> 00:08:27,878
Why? Do you want to join us?

164
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:29,048
I was just curious.

165
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:32,088
Women usually talk in their rooms, right?

166
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:33,457
Never outside.

167
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,194
I think you're the first person to come here.

168
00:08:35,218 --> 00:08:37,418
- You're right. He's the 1st one. - You're the 1st one.

169
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:38,958
Come in. Take a seat.

170
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:40,388
I was going to go to the bathroom.

171
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:42,597
Come over here.

172
00:08:42,598 --> 00:08:43,598
- Can I come in? - Sure.

173
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,697
Of course, you can.

174
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:47,067
- I don't... - Welcome, Fairy.

175
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,097
(First male guest in the women's room)

176
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:49,708
This is nice.

177
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:51,437
(Staring)

178
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:52,938
I think he got used to it.

179
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,888
- Right? He seems comfortable. - Him?

180
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:56,478
- Him? - Me?

181
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:58,978
So, this...

182
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:01,047
(In the room without Yu Gyeong, )

183
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:04,388
(there's awkwardness.)

184
00:09:05,518 --> 00:09:08,788
(Yu Gyeong returns.)

185
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:10,758
(Glancing)

186
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:14,958
- The first man to enter this room. - You're right.

187
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:17,198
It's snowing so much.

188
00:09:18,428 --> 00:09:22,168
(Yu Gyeong tries to change the subject.)

189
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:25,207
She mentions the snow as she feels awkward.

190
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,677
- It's been snowing the whole time. - For no reason.

191
00:09:26,678 --> 00:09:28,807
Oh, my gosh!

192
00:09:28,808 --> 00:09:30,378
Are they staying quiet?

193
00:09:30,878 --> 00:09:32,008
It's so awkward.

194
00:09:36,048 --> 00:09:37,518
(Looking)

195
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:41,588
How are you holding up?

196
00:09:41,888 --> 00:09:44,188
Me? It's fun.

197
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:46,558
It's pretty fun.

198
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:49,297
Is it fun? What is?

199
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,268
Watching them, or...

200
00:09:51,668 --> 00:09:52,698
I just find this fun.

201
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,098
Being on this program.

202
00:09:56,368 --> 00:09:57,468
That's good.

203
00:09:58,068 --> 00:09:59,478
I'm making the most of every day.

204
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,248
Making the most of every day is good.

205
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:05,278
Didn't you regret anything while you were here?

206
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:08,278
Regret? Well,

207
00:10:08,518 --> 00:10:10,117
there were things I could have done better,

208
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:11,288
but nothing I regretted.

209
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:16,628
(Yu Gyeong silently listens to Ho Am.)

210
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:18,688
I felt stuffy.

211
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,768
If I had realized my feelings sooner,

212
00:10:24,668 --> 00:10:27,768
Ho Am could have...

213
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:31,108
made a different choice.

214
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:32,677
Yes, bring it.

215
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:34,278
(He could have made a different choice.)

216
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:37,578
I should wash up.

217
00:10:37,878 --> 00:10:39,177
- Oh, look. - Good night.

218
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:40,278
Good night.

219
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:42,317
- Good night. - Good night.

220
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:44,348
(Ho Am leaves the room after saying good night.)

221
00:10:46,088 --> 00:10:47,088
(Tapping)

222
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,328
(Oh, my.)

223
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:52,358
(Tapping)

224
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:54,458
He touched you!

225
00:10:55,598 --> 00:10:57,667
- I didn't mean to take this. - It's mine, right?

226
00:10:57,668 --> 00:10:59,497
(He accidentally took Yu Gyeong's hand warmer.)

227
00:10:59,498 --> 00:11:00,998
Have a good night.

228
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:03,968
That's the best expression...

229
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:06,407
an INTP can show.

230
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:07,937
(Yu Ra says it's the best an INTP can do.)

231
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:11,077
That's the best type of expression an INTP can show?

232
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:12,318
I guess so.

233
00:11:12,448 --> 00:11:14,877
Ho Am is the White Chicken,

234
00:11:14,878 --> 00:11:16,947
and I reckon he wasn't born with the ability...

235
00:11:16,948 --> 00:11:18,018
to express his feelings.

236
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:20,587
That was probably the best he could do.

237
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:24,187
Ho Am seems to be doing his best the whole time he's here.

238
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:25,758
I agree.

239
00:11:26,258 --> 00:11:27,297
Yes.

240
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:29,728
I can't help but notice Yun Jeong.

241
00:11:30,968 --> 00:11:32,598
They're both uncomfortable.

242
00:11:34,638 --> 00:11:35,638
(Sighing)

243
00:11:35,868 --> 00:11:37,408
(Falling)

244
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:41,478
(She has a lot on her mind after Ho Am expressed his feelings.)

245
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:44,448
(Turning)

246
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,988
(The white snow piled up as if to cover their worries.)

247
00:11:55,518 --> 00:11:59,828
(Ho Am and Byeong Yeol get ready for bed.)

248
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:10,038
What would be the pros and cons...

249
00:12:10,368 --> 00:12:12,738
of dating a shaman? For me, I mean.

250
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:17,547
(An unexpected question from Byeong Yeol)

251
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:19,117
He's so...

252
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:20,577
I don't think he means shamans in general.

253
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:22,117
He specifically means Yu Gyeong.

254
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:25,417
Because the only shamans are Ra Yun and Yu Gyeong.

255
00:12:25,418 --> 00:12:27,118
- But... - You're right.

256
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:28,788
Does he know what he's doing?

257
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:31,288
He must have so much on his mind.

258
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:36,628
(Byeong Yeol asked him about dating a shaman.)

259
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:40,338
- The good thing is... - Yes?

260
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:46,207
That they're considerate.

261
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,508
Their hunches are spot-on as they're quick-witted.

262
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:52,578
Probably those things. And...

263
00:12:53,818 --> 00:12:55,278
you may get into a fight,

264
00:12:55,518 --> 00:12:57,647
but it never goes down the wrong path.

265
00:12:57,648 --> 00:12:59,118
(Thinking)

266
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:01,688
I would say those are the pros.

267
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:05,587
Then, what should I brace myself for?

268
00:13:05,588 --> 00:13:06,857
What you should brace yourself for?

269
00:13:06,858 --> 00:13:08,428
You can never beat her.

270
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:12,228
Shamans can be incredibly proud,

271
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:14,378
and they need to do what they want to do.

272
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:16,668
So, they'll never let you win.

273
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,438
If you try to win, you'll get into a huge fight.

274
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:29,188
But, of course, you'll both have to work to suit each other.

275
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:38,728
Come to think of it, all the shamans seem...

276
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,658
like they're intimidating.

277
00:13:44,368 --> 00:13:49,208
(Ho Am only drinks water without answering him anymore.)

278
00:13:55,308 --> 00:13:56,748
I find it uncomfortable.

279
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:01,618
(Thinking)

280
00:14:04,288 --> 00:14:06,318
It seems to me like Byeong Yeol...

281
00:14:06,618 --> 00:14:09,228
also has feelings for Yu Gyeong.

282
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:12,798
And we're roommates.

283
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,728
So, it's pretty uncomfortable.

284
00:14:16,828 --> 00:14:20,198
That we're competing for one person.

285
00:14:21,938 --> 00:14:28,308
(The roommates have Yu Gyeong between them.)

286
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:36,848
(How will the relationship between these three go?)

287
00:14:37,718 --> 00:14:43,128
(The whole world is covered in snow in the 5th morning.)

288
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:51,128
(The rookie shaman, Hyeon U, begins his morning routine.)

289
00:14:54,898 --> 00:15:00,008
(He drives out the bad energy with incense.)

290
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:04,478
(Placing)

291
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:09,748
(He takes a seat in front of the window upstairs.)

292
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:16,428
I prayed...

293
00:15:16,658 --> 00:15:18,928
that they make me...

294
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:21,628
stronger.

295
00:15:21,898 --> 00:15:26,268
I wanted to communicate better with my divine spirit.

296
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:30,508
(While he's communing with his divine spirit)

297
00:15:32,038 --> 00:15:34,778
(Stomping)

298
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,178
(Yu Ra showed up.)

299
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:41,318
(Halting)

300
00:15:42,118 --> 00:15:46,087
(She quietly heads to her room...)

301
00:15:46,088 --> 00:15:49,458
(and turns around.)

302
00:15:51,788 --> 00:15:55,158
(She doesn't want to miss this for some reason.)

303
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:01,998
(Watching him pray from the front row)

304
00:16:02,538 --> 00:16:08,078
(Something new happens every day in the Possessed House.)

305
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:20,188
I thought it was too long.

306
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:22,388
I was like, "We'll be there for eight days?"

307
00:16:22,788 --> 00:16:25,657
But it's shorter than I thought.

308
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:26,758
Right.

309
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:32,268
What awaits us today?

310
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:36,438
(Surprised)

311
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:39,208
- That sound makes my heart race. - Same.

312
00:16:40,308 --> 00:16:41,408
Oh, my gosh.

313
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:43,008
What is it now?

314
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,148
(Getting up)

315
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:51,447
- The women will now... - What's going on?

316
00:16:51,448 --> 00:16:53,558
Gather in the upstairs living room.

317
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:58,427
(The women head to the living room.)

318
00:16:58,428 --> 00:16:59,497
Here.

319
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:00,928
Oh, they beat me.

320
00:17:06,198 --> 00:17:07,268
What are these?

321
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:11,438
What's that?

322
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:13,937
At last... What is that?

323
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:16,547
(The reason only the women were invited to the upstairs living room)

324
00:17:16,548 --> 00:17:18,678
(Amazed)

325
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:22,077
(Scratch cards to determine the order of dates)

326
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:23,187
They're scratch cards.

327
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:25,817
(Scratch cards to determine the order of dates)

328
00:17:25,818 --> 00:17:27,387
(Scratch off the card of your choice to reveal your rank.)

329
00:17:27,388 --> 00:17:28,987
(You may choose your date in the order of your ranking.)

330
00:17:28,988 --> 00:17:31,128
Oh, we can pick our dates?

331
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:32,997
- What? - What?

332
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:34,927
(A new way of picking their dates)

333
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,168
That's how it goes?

334
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:38,368
They have to scratch it with a coin?

335
00:17:40,438 --> 00:17:41,498
We're picking them?

336
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:42,968
Great.

337
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:46,237
- That's new. - It is.

338
00:17:46,238 --> 00:17:48,208
(Reading the room)

339
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:49,577
Okay.

340
00:17:49,578 --> 00:17:54,778
(They get to pick their dates according to the ranking.)

341
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:57,128
The order of choosing our dates.

342
00:17:57,388 --> 00:17:58,388
(Four different colours of scratch cards)

343
00:17:58,389 --> 00:17:59,458
How should we choose?

344
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,187
Is there a colour you want?

345
00:18:04,188 --> 00:18:05,188
Yes.

346
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:07,257
- Really? You should pick first. - Are you sure?

347
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:08,258
- Sure. - Go ahead.

348
00:18:09,328 --> 00:18:10,828
I'll just pick one, then.

349
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:15,437
(Yu Ra picked the red scratch card.)

350
00:18:15,438 --> 00:18:17,268
- Can I go next? - Yes.

351
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:19,168
I want the blue one.

352
00:18:20,338 --> 00:18:22,807
(Yu Gyeong picked the blue one.)

353
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:23,978
A date scratch card.

354
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:27,517
One of my divine spirits is...

355
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:29,217
the Dragon King,

356
00:18:29,218 --> 00:18:31,247
so I like blue.

357
00:18:31,248 --> 00:18:33,717
I picked the blue one, thinking,

358
00:18:33,718 --> 00:18:35,388
"Give me your energy, Dragon King!"

359
00:18:37,588 --> 00:18:38,908
Which one do you want, Yun Jeong?

360
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:42,257
(Reading her face)

361
00:18:42,258 --> 00:18:44,168
I was thinking of pink.

362
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:46,268
(Take it.)

363
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:47,668
Can I?

364
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:50,468
(Grabbing)

365
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:53,118
You wanted that one, didn't you?

366
00:18:53,578 --> 00:18:55,707
- Did you? - I think so.

367
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,308
(While they wait for the result of their scratch cards...)

368
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:00,788
I wonder how the dates will go today.

369
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:04,618
The women have never picked their dates before.

370
00:19:04,718 --> 00:19:06,318
- Right. - So, I can't predict anything.

371
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:09,558
(Getting up)

372
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:12,958
What will it be? Aren't you curious?

373
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:16,228
I am curious.

374
00:19:17,868 --> 00:19:18,868
Well...

375
00:19:19,738 --> 00:19:21,938
(In the meantime)

376
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:31,807
(Red Rabbit, Lee Kyung Eon)

377
00:19:31,808 --> 00:19:33,478
(A surprise appearance)

378
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:35,078
Here she comes.

379
00:19:35,518 --> 00:19:37,418
She's so atmospheric.

380
00:19:37,548 --> 00:19:39,088
Who will she choose? She's pretty.

381
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:42,488
They made the women scratch their tickets...

382
00:19:42,688 --> 00:19:44,687
- and had a new woman... - Right.

383
00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:45,688
(A new resident appeared to surprise everyone.)

384
00:19:45,689 --> 00:19:46,898
I'm so curious about her.

385
00:19:49,698 --> 00:19:54,268
(She's coming to change everyone's fate.)

386
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:59,037
(She heads to the Pavilion of Connections...)

387
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,078
(without letting anyone know.)

388
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:06,678
(And an unknown sandglass appeared with her.)

389
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:07,948
Should we scratch it?

390
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:09,417
(The women don't know about this.)

391
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:11,688
- I'm so nervous. - So am I.

392
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,688
(They get the coins to scratch the cards.)

393
00:20:18,028 --> 00:20:19,658
What if I'm last again?

394
00:20:22,328 --> 00:20:27,398
(They wish that they're 1st.)

395
00:20:29,168 --> 00:20:30,168
I'm excited.

396
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:34,878
(Who will win the love lottery?)

397
00:20:35,438 --> 00:20:36,548
I'm last.

398
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,708
- Seriously? - Yes.

399
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:40,217
Wait, it's not me? Oh, it is me.

400
00:20:40,218 --> 00:20:41,348
Is it a number?

401
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:42,548
I'm fourth.
(Yun Jeong is last.)

402
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:44,888
(Looking)

403
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:46,588
Third.

404
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:50,257
(Yun Jeong is last, so they have a higher chance of being 1st.)

405
00:20:50,258 --> 00:20:52,728
(They scratch them faster.)

406
00:20:53,258 --> 00:20:56,428
(Meanwhile, two men just stand in front of the door.)

407
00:20:56,868 --> 00:20:59,068
(Listening in)

408
00:20:59,938 --> 00:21:03,367
(They're desperate to know what's going on outside.)

409
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:04,507
I must be second.

410
00:21:04,508 --> 00:21:06,178
- I'm 3rd. - I think I'm 2nd.

411
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:09,238
(Yu Gyeong is 3rd.)

412
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:12,308
(Yu Ra is 2nd.)

413
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:15,278
(Then, who's 1st?)

414
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:17,387
(Ra Yun picked the green scratch card.)

415
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:18,418
Great.

416
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:20,688
(Jealous)

417
00:21:22,888 --> 00:21:25,057
- Congratulations. - I picked the last card,

418
00:21:25,058 --> 00:21:26,088
and I won first place.

419
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:27,728
The lucky ones get everything.

420
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:32,468
And it wasn't even my decision.

421
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:36,068
It was the last card left, and I won first.

422
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:39,608
I thought, "I knew I made the right decision."

423
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,407
Do we get to pick our dates here?

424
00:21:43,408 --> 00:21:44,777
Right here?

425
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:45,778
(Time to pick their dates according to the ranking)

426
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:47,848
Is there anyone you want?

427
00:21:48,778 --> 00:21:51,888
Me? Who do I want?

428
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:58,228
(Looking over)

429
00:22:02,498 --> 00:22:07,168
At the moment, Gang Won is the only one.

430
00:22:11,368 --> 00:22:12,368
Oh, what do I do?

431
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:15,678
I was wary of Yu Ra.

432
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:19,978
So, I thought about changing my decision,

433
00:22:20,648 --> 00:22:24,048
but there was no one I wanted to go on a date with...

434
00:22:24,618 --> 00:22:26,918
other than Gang Won.

435
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:29,927
So, I said to myself, "Sorry, Yu Ra,"

436
00:22:29,928 --> 00:22:31,328
and picked Gang Won.

437
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,767
(A woman has requested a conversation with you.)

438
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:42,798
(Come to the Pavilion of Connections discreetly without telling anyone.)

439
00:22:43,508 --> 00:22:46,878
(Without telling anyone?)

440
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:51,848
(Fortunately, Hyeon U is focused on his book.)

441
00:22:55,218 --> 00:22:58,088
(He secretly leaves the room.)

442
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:07,198
(Who's the woman that wants to talk to him?)

443
00:23:10,628 --> 00:23:11,628
Hello.

444
00:23:12,828 --> 00:23:13,682
Goodness.

445
00:23:13,689 --> 00:23:14,689
(Startled)

446
00:23:15,142 --> 00:23:16,212
Oh, my.

447
00:23:16,456 --> 00:23:17,495
- He's like, "Who are you?" - Right?

448
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,496
He must be so startled.

449
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:21,896
Ra Yun was so excited that she won first.

450
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:24,365
(What do we do?)

451
00:23:24,366 --> 00:23:26,365
Even if you had feelings for one of the women in the building,

452
00:23:26,366 --> 00:23:28,166
you'd be thrilled to find someone new, right?

453
00:23:28,736 --> 00:23:29,736
He seems happy.

454
00:23:31,406 --> 00:23:33,076
(I know, right?)

455
00:23:34,476 --> 00:23:35,476
Hello.

456
00:23:36,646 --> 00:23:37,646
Goodness.

457
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:39,286
(Bowing)

458
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:42,216
(He politely greets her.)

459
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:43,986
Hello.

460
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:47,226
Aren't you too surprised?

461
00:23:49,396 --> 00:23:50,825
(Flustered)

462
00:23:50,826 --> 00:23:52,266
- Hello. - Hello.

463
00:23:52,726 --> 00:23:54,196
(This is so funny.)

464
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:59,966
(Restless)

465
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:04,706
(She finds Gang Won's reaction funny.)

466
00:24:06,276 --> 00:24:08,756
I ran there, thinking it was Ra Yun, but there was a stranger.

467
00:24:10,276 --> 00:24:11,676
Yes. So, I was like,

468
00:24:12,946 --> 00:24:13,946
"What's going on?"

469
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:18,215
(The new female resident...)

470
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:19,925
(will have a private talk...)

471
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:22,696
(with all the men for 15 minutes each...)

472
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:25,225
(and choose one of them...)

473
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:27,825
(to go on a date before anyone else.)

474
00:24:27,826 --> 00:24:29,786
She can go on a date with him before anyone else.

475
00:24:30,296 --> 00:24:31,365
Although...

476
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:32,886
- No way. - she didn't scratch a card.

477
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:35,775
- Yes, she deserves a benefit. - She joined them late.

478
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:38,306
That's a huge benefit.

479
00:24:40,476 --> 00:24:42,045
(One of these women...)

480
00:24:42,046 --> 00:24:50,106
(may be left out, based on the new resident's choice.)

481
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:53,926
We get to have a conversation...

482
00:24:54,256 --> 00:24:56,356
- for about 15 minutes. - Yes.

483
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:59,425
(The 15-minute talk begins.)

484
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:00,426
So, let's talk.

485
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,966
Why me?

486
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:13,676
(Gang Won seems to be mistaken.)

487
00:25:16,946 --> 00:25:18,886
(Flustered)

488
00:25:21,046 --> 00:25:22,046
Did you...

489
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:24,986
pick me, by any chance?

490
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:27,955
(This is embarrassing.)

491
00:25:27,956 --> 00:25:29,226
Gang Won!

492
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:32,125
(I can't watch this.)

493
00:25:32,126 --> 00:25:33,466
Oh, my goodness.

494
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,666
This is so embarrassing.

495
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:38,296
Let me hide for a moment. It's so embarrassing.

496
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:39,606
The secondhand embarrassment.

497
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:44,076
He said, "Why me?"

498
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,876
- "Did you pick me?" - He was so...

499
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,046
- Goodness. - "Why me?"

500
00:25:50,346 --> 00:25:51,376
Come on, Gang Won.

501
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,785
Did you pick me, by any chance?

502
00:25:56,786 --> 00:26:01,186
No, I get to talk to everyone.

503
00:26:01,486 --> 00:26:03,926
- I got a chance to talk to them. - I see.

504
00:26:04,226 --> 00:26:05,665
(Fortunately, the misunderstanding was resolved.)

505
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:07,066
I see.

506
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:09,666
These guys make it interesting.

507
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:13,836
Gang Won.

508
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,436
He was hilarious.

509
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:20,375
Gang Won turned out to be...

510
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:22,076
a joyful and funny guy.

511
00:26:23,576 --> 00:26:24,576
May I ask your name?

512
00:26:24,846 --> 00:26:26,815
- Lee Gang Won. - Gang Won?

513
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:27,945
Like Gangwon Province.

514
00:26:27,946 --> 00:26:30,856
I see. I'm Lee Kyung Eon.

515
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:32,526
- Kyung Eon? - Eon.

516
00:26:33,656 --> 00:26:34,926
We have the same initials.

517
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,856
- Sorry? - We have the same Korean initials.

518
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:38,896
A vowel, K, and a vowel.

519
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,795
Oh, our initials!

520
00:26:40,796 --> 00:26:42,772
(Their names start with a vowel, K, and a vowel in Korean.)

521
00:26:42,796 --> 00:26:44,866
(Pondering)

522
00:26:46,966 --> 00:26:49,906
Do you have any questions for me?

523
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,406
I'd like to know what you do for a living.

524
00:26:53,276 --> 00:26:55,176
What do you think I do for a living?

525
00:26:56,346 --> 00:26:57,915
- Well... - It's customary to ask that here.

526
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,616
- Is that so? - Yes.

527
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:01,846
Do you do spiritual readings?

528
00:27:02,516 --> 00:27:04,256
Why do you think I do spiritual readings?

529
00:27:05,786 --> 00:27:07,226
(Smiling)

530
00:27:08,056 --> 00:27:09,796
- Just because. Yes. - Okay.

531
00:27:10,856 --> 00:27:11,856
Am I wrong?

532
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:13,795
You're right. I've been a shaman...

533
00:27:13,796 --> 00:27:15,595
- for three years. - I see.

534
00:27:15,596 --> 00:27:16,665
- Okay. - Yes.

535
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,165
I didn't see this coming at all.

536
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:20,265
So I don't even know what to ask you.

537
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:21,636
I don't know what to talk about.

538
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:27,576
(He starts whistling.)

539
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:33,076
- Kyung Eon is shocked. - That's scary.

540
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:36,455
- Gang Won is scary. - She must be confused right now.

541
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:38,316
Oh, no. He's whistling for no reason.

542
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,525
Is he trying to show off his special talent?

543
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:41,726
He's trying to charm her.

544
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,555
(He's charming her without being asked.)

545
00:27:43,556 --> 00:27:45,226
I think Ra Yun will be safe.

546
00:27:47,726 --> 00:27:50,066
(He suddenly whistles during their first meeting.)

547
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:53,606
(Truly shocked)

548
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:55,936
Gang Won...

549
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:59,876
He started to whistle.

550
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:01,876
Initially, I thought...

551
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:05,076
it was coming from a bird.

552
00:28:05,886 --> 00:28:07,045
So...

553
00:28:07,046 --> 00:28:09,486
(Thinking about it still makes her laugh.)

554
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:11,016
(Whistling)

555
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:12,956
(Whistling)

556
00:28:14,556 --> 00:28:16,695
(With the chirping sound, )

557
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:19,966
(their 15-minute conversation ends.)

558
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:24,496
- What about you, Yu Ra? - Maybe...

559
00:28:26,506 --> 00:28:27,566
Sang Hyeok?

560
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:34,245
Starting yesterday,

561
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:36,846
I thought that we didn't have much time left.

562
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:39,316
So I wanted to make my move.

563
00:28:39,686 --> 00:28:42,585
I wanted to make my stance clear.

564
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:43,956
That crossed my mind.

565
00:28:44,186 --> 00:28:46,656
(He's meditating.)

566
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:54,795
(A woman has requested a conversation with you.)

567
00:28:54,796 --> 00:28:57,676
(Come to the Pavilion of Connections discreetly without telling anyone.)

568
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:03,305
(Sang Hyeok heads to the Pavilion of Connections...)

569
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:05,906
(after getting the message.)

570
00:29:14,446 --> 00:29:16,286
- Hello. - Hello.

571
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,856
- Hello. - Hello.

572
00:29:21,486 --> 00:29:24,756
- Nice to meet you. Yes. - Hello. Nice to meet you.

573
00:29:25,796 --> 00:29:27,466
- You must be very cold. - Yes.

574
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,066
- Isn't it cold? - Yes.

575
00:29:32,866 --> 00:29:34,836
- Was the trip here okay? - Yes.

576
00:29:41,776 --> 00:29:42,846
Isn't it awkward?

577
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:44,346
Yes.

578
00:29:55,726 --> 00:29:57,556
(Staring)

579
00:29:58,056 --> 00:29:59,065
(Surprised)

580
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:01,996
It sort of looks like there's a romantic vibe.

581
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,496
Right. Gang Won only chirped like a bird in front of her.

582
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:07,235
Since both of them joined the group at a later time,

583
00:30:07,236 --> 00:30:08,305
they have that in common.

584
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,406
- Yes. - Right.

585
00:30:10,306 --> 00:30:11,375
And appearance-wise,

586
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,876
- they make a good couple. - They do.

587
00:30:13,746 --> 00:30:17,516
He didn't avoid eye contact. He kept looking right at me.

588
00:30:18,146 --> 00:30:21,016
That was slightly uncomfortable.

589
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:25,085
I wondered if he was trying to figure me out...

590
00:30:25,086 --> 00:30:29,856
since he was a shaman like the previous guy.

591
00:30:32,156 --> 00:30:33,426
- What is it? - Yes?

592
00:30:33,826 --> 00:30:35,765
- What's your name? Yes. - Right. Let me introduce myself.

593
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:38,995
My name is Yun Sang Hyeok.

594
00:30:38,996 --> 00:30:40,606
- Sang Hyeok? I see. - Yes.

595
00:30:40,836 --> 00:30:43,475
My name is Lee Kyung Eon.

596
00:30:43,476 --> 00:30:44,776
- Kyung Eon? - Yes.

597
00:30:45,706 --> 00:30:47,406
Must I guess what your job is?

598
00:30:48,006 --> 00:30:49,146
No.

599
00:30:50,676 --> 00:30:52,586
- A tarot reader? - A tarot reader?

600
00:30:53,646 --> 00:30:54,746
Or are you a saju reader?

601
00:30:55,716 --> 00:30:57,086
Yes, I am.

602
00:30:58,586 --> 00:30:59,986
- You read saju. - Yes.

603
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,496
(Gazing)

604
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:07,865
- Should I tell you what my job is? - Yes.

605
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,365
I'm an I Ching tarot reader.

606
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:11,965
- You're a tarot reader? - Yes.

607
00:31:11,966 --> 00:31:13,705
You can think of it...

608
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,635
as an Asian style of tarot from the old days.

609
00:31:15,636 --> 00:31:16,806
I see.

610
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,376
How long have you been a tarot reader?

611
00:31:19,406 --> 00:31:21,776
It's been two years now.

612
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:23,676
It's been about two years.

613
00:31:23,946 --> 00:31:25,446
Have you gone to tarot readings?

614
00:31:26,346 --> 00:31:29,756
Well, I'd gone to tarot readings when I was in my early 20s.

615
00:31:30,386 --> 00:31:32,855
So far, I mostly got my fortune read...

616
00:31:32,856 --> 00:31:35,486
for the new year through saju.

617
00:31:35,756 --> 00:31:38,296
Then there would be things I wanted to do.

618
00:31:38,326 --> 00:31:42,326
Like the things that excite me. You know what I mean?

619
00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:44,765
I tend to get readings about those.

620
00:31:44,766 --> 00:31:45,866
What excites you?

621
00:31:46,066 --> 00:31:47,735
Do you like to exercise?

622
00:31:47,736 --> 00:31:48,866
Yes, I do.

623
00:31:49,306 --> 00:31:50,836
- Do you exercise? - Yes.

624
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:53,245
- What do you do? - I... CrossFit.

625
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:54,906
- I used to do CrossFit. - I see.

626
00:31:54,976 --> 00:31:57,476
Yes. Not yoga, though.

627
00:31:58,576 --> 00:32:01,045
I like activities that make me sweat.

628
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:02,855
- I prefer activities like that. - Like energetic activities?

629
00:32:02,856 --> 00:32:04,855
- Yes. I like those activities. - I see.

630
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,585
- I like different types of sports. - Like what?

631
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:08,626
- I love physical activities. - Like what?

632
00:32:08,756 --> 00:32:09,955
Have you tried horseback riding?

633
00:32:09,956 --> 00:32:11,455
No. I'm kind of scared...

634
00:32:11,456 --> 00:32:13,895
- of riding animals. - You're scared of them.

635
00:32:13,896 --> 00:32:15,165
But everyone is like that...

636
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,035
- because animals are much bigger. - Yes.

637
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,735
Despite that, it's really nice.

638
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:21,706
- Once you do it, you're hooked. - So I have heard.

639
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,605
Right. You seem quite tall.

640
00:32:23,606 --> 00:32:26,245
- Yes. I'm 165cm. - I see.

641
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:28,245
But with heels on,

642
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,245
- I'd be 170cm tall. - Would you be 170cm tall?

643
00:32:30,246 --> 00:32:31,366
Are you wearing heels today?

644
00:32:36,286 --> 00:32:40,026
(Their conversation flows smoothly for 15 minutes.)

645
00:32:43,326 --> 00:32:45,896
I need to think about it.

646
00:32:47,596 --> 00:32:50,166
(Glancing)

647
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,535
I do want to go on a date with him,

648
00:32:54,536 --> 00:32:57,505
but if I had to choose the one I'm most curious about,

649
00:32:57,506 --> 00:32:58,606
it would be Byeong Yeol.

650
00:33:00,806 --> 00:33:01,876
You're so honest.

651
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:04,246
(Shy)

652
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:05,886
What about you?

653
00:33:06,086 --> 00:33:07,186
I...

654
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:12,286
(Yun Jeong can choose between...)

655
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:16,555
(Ho Am whom she has feelings for...)

656
00:33:16,556 --> 00:33:19,796
(and Hyeon U whom she hasn't gone on a date with yet.)

657
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:23,036
(Pondering)

658
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:24,896
- I'd choose Hyeon U. Yes. - Hyeon U?

659
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:27,236
Did you make up your mind?

660
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:29,976
Did you make up your mind? Are you certain?

661
00:33:31,336 --> 00:33:32,976
We've never gone on a date together.

662
00:33:33,876 --> 00:33:35,475
- Really? - What?

663
00:33:35,476 --> 00:33:36,815
- That's right. - What did you say?

664
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:39,416
- She never had a date with him. - She never had a date with him.

665
00:33:40,946 --> 00:33:42,016
Go on a date with him.

666
00:33:43,986 --> 00:33:45,116
- Not with Hyeon U? - But...

667
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:48,385
you guys looked so close on the first day.

668
00:33:48,386 --> 00:33:50,095
So I naturally assumed that...

669
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:51,755
- you guys did go on a date. - That's true.

670
00:33:51,756 --> 00:33:53,226
We never had a chance since day one.

671
00:33:53,396 --> 00:33:55,125
- Since that day? - Yes. So I thought...

672
00:33:55,126 --> 00:33:56,365
I should at least have one date...

673
00:33:56,366 --> 00:33:57,395
- with him. - Let's do it.

674
00:33:57,396 --> 00:33:58,736
You waited a long time then.

675
00:33:58,866 --> 00:34:01,766
(She chose Hyeon U, not Ho Am.)

676
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,605
This is...

677
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:05,775
Why didn't she pick Ho Am?

678
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:07,245
Is she giving up on pursuing him?

679
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:08,975
- She feels more distant from him... - Yes.

680
00:34:08,976 --> 00:34:10,515
Than from the other guys now.

681
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:12,345
She was miserable for two days.

682
00:34:12,346 --> 00:34:13,745
- Yes, she was. - After feeling so miserable,

683
00:34:13,746 --> 00:34:15,986
- Right. - he just became a guy who hurt her.

684
00:34:16,816 --> 00:34:19,056
- She'd rather pick other guys now. - She hates him now.

685
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:22,486
- I'm not sure. - I wonder what she's going through.

686
00:34:22,696 --> 00:34:25,896
(She chose Hyeon U. What's her true feeling behind it?)

687
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:30,496
(Hyeon U is heading to the Pavilion of Connections.)

688
00:34:34,736 --> 00:34:35,736
Hello.

689
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,646
- Hello. - Hello.

690
00:34:43,076 --> 00:34:44,146
We need to talk.

691
00:34:45,046 --> 00:34:46,745
- That's what we're doing here. - Hello.

692
00:34:46,746 --> 00:34:47,785
(Dazed)

693
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:48,786
Hello.
(Giggling)

694
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,485
- I guess you didn't know. - Pardon?

695
00:34:51,486 --> 00:34:53,485
Were you not informed that I would be here?

696
00:34:53,486 --> 00:34:54,726
- No. - I see.

697
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,496
- I was just told to come out here. - I see.

698
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,496
My name is Jung Hyeon U.

699
00:35:00,026 --> 00:35:02,426
- Jung Hyeon U? - Yes. Hyeon U.

700
00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:05,736
- Nice to meet you. - Yes.

701
00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:08,135
Nice to meet you.

702
00:35:08,136 --> 00:35:09,936
(He keeps greeting her like a broken record.)

703
00:35:12,506 --> 00:35:14,645
You're so pretty.

704
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,016
You think so? Thank you.

705
00:35:16,176 --> 00:35:17,475
(Shy)

706
00:35:17,476 --> 00:35:20,345
(He blurts out a compliment.)

707
00:35:20,346 --> 00:35:24,216
I'm quite surprised that they suddenly put us together.

708
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:27,625
(She can't stop laughing at Hyeon U as he struggles.)

709
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,025
- I'm a shaman. - I see. Okay.

710
00:35:30,026 --> 00:35:31,425
- I'm a shaman. - Yes.

711
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:33,066
- It's only been two months. - I see.

712
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,626
- Then... I see. - I'm still very green.

713
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:38,566
I got it.

714
00:35:40,936 --> 00:35:42,605
Do you have any hobbies?

715
00:35:42,606 --> 00:35:45,906
This might sound boring to you, but I like to read books.

716
00:35:46,506 --> 00:35:48,675
- I like playing games too. - Games?

717
00:35:48,676 --> 00:35:51,876
The only game I know how to play is Tekken.

718
00:35:53,616 --> 00:35:54,746
- Tekken? - Yes.

719
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,056
- I'm quite good at it. - You are?

720
00:35:57,816 --> 00:35:58,816
That sounds fun.

721
00:35:58,817 --> 00:36:01,855
I don't play games like Halli Galli.

722
00:36:01,856 --> 00:36:04,255
- I'm bad at board games. - You don't play board games?

723
00:36:04,256 --> 00:36:06,365
I'm only good at Tekken.

724
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:07,565
(The two of them bond pretty fast thanks to the game.)

725
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:09,296
With Hyeon U,

726
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:11,895
it was so comfortable.

727
00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:14,706
I felt that he knew how to make people feel at ease.

728
00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:17,176
That's how I felt when I was talking to him.

729
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:20,806
(Byeong Yeol also heads to the Pavilion of Connections.)

730
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:24,276
Hello.

731
00:36:26,816 --> 00:36:27,886
Hello.

732
00:36:29,456 --> 00:36:30,985
- Nice to meet you. - Yes, nice to meet you.

733
00:36:30,986 --> 00:36:32,316
- We haven't met. - Right.

734
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,586
Yes.

735
00:36:35,756 --> 00:36:37,125
(Flustered)

736
00:36:37,126 --> 00:36:38,995
- I didn't see this coming at all. - Is that so?

737
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,125
Right.

738
00:36:40,126 --> 00:36:41,496
(Chuckling)

739
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:43,965
This gesture is Byeong Yeol's thing.

740
00:36:43,966 --> 00:36:45,035
- That's his thing. - This.

741
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,236
(Byeong Yeol's signature pose)

742
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:48,616
Losing his energy must be an everyday thing for him.

743
00:36:49,366 --> 00:36:50,675
(Byeong Yeol loses his energy whenever or wherever.)

744
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:51,736
It keeps happening to him.

745
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,376
He keeps losing his energy.

746
00:36:54,176 --> 00:36:55,906
(This is hilarious.)

747
00:36:58,116 --> 00:36:59,915
- I didn't see this coming at all. - Is that so?

748
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:01,085
Right.

749
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:02,446
(He's rambling now.)

750
00:37:02,786 --> 00:37:03,855
"Right?"

751
00:37:03,856 --> 00:37:04,856
(Giggling)

752
00:37:06,326 --> 00:37:07,425
Surprise.

753
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:08,426
Yes. It's a surprise.

754
00:37:09,856 --> 00:37:11,336
You must have waited for a long time.

755
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:12,965
No.

756
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:14,365
- Oh, yes. - Okay.

757
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:15,425
I was wondering, "Why isn't she here?"

758
00:37:15,426 --> 00:37:16,495
"When will she come?"

759
00:37:16,496 --> 00:37:19,066
I mean, we were heading into the second half of the program.

760
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:21,166
I came too late, didn't I?

761
00:37:22,236 --> 00:37:23,536
What do you do for a living?

762
00:37:25,106 --> 00:37:26,305
I read saju.

763
00:37:26,306 --> 00:37:27,666
- I see. Saju. - Yes, I read saju.

764
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:29,745
- Same here. - Are you a saju reader too?

765
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:32,046
- Yes. I've been studying saju. - I see.

766
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:35,086
- Are you a saju reader too? I see. - Yes. I've been studying saju.

767
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,232
It's great to meet a colleague. I've been doing this for two years.

768
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,625
- I see. Okay. - And you? How long has it been?

769
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:44,795
I started to study saju more like a hobby...

770
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,526
- quite a long time ago. - I see.

771
00:37:47,026 --> 00:37:51,765
But I just started to study saju in a more professional manner.

772
00:37:51,766 --> 00:37:54,066
- It's the same with me. - I see.

773
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,306
(Smiling)

774
00:37:58,006 --> 00:37:59,436
(Shy)

775
00:37:59,776 --> 00:38:02,076
- What? - My gosh. What's going on?

776
00:38:02,946 --> 00:38:05,416
- He's really happy to see her. - He's elated. My gosh.

777
00:38:05,646 --> 00:38:08,215
Byeong Yeol seems very interested in her.

778
00:38:08,216 --> 00:38:09,685
These two seem to be at ease around each other.

779
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:12,985
I'm getting really curious about whom Kyung Eon will pick...

780
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:14,655
- later. - Right?

781
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:15,686
Yes.

782
00:38:15,886 --> 00:38:18,695
Do you have an ideal type?

783
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:19,996
- My type? - Yes?

784
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:22,165
- I like... - Yes.

785
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:27,066
- Since I'm quite tall for a girl, - Yes?

786
00:38:27,366 --> 00:38:30,335
I like men who are tall.

787
00:38:30,336 --> 00:38:31,806
- You like tall guys? - Yes.

788
00:38:31,906 --> 00:38:34,445
- When I put on heels... Yes. - Right. With heels.

789
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,106
- I become even taller. - Yes.

790
00:38:36,676 --> 00:38:38,045
- And I like... - Right.

791
00:38:38,046 --> 00:38:39,475
Men who are on the same wavelength.

792
00:38:39,476 --> 00:38:40,945
- On the same wavelength? - Yes.

793
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:42,885
- Could you elaborate? - I want someone...

794
00:38:42,886 --> 00:38:44,385
I can connect with naturally,

795
00:38:44,386 --> 00:38:48,126
without having to force myself. I guess that's what I look for.

796
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,026
Even if he has flaws, I could accept them as part of him.

797
00:38:51,126 --> 00:38:53,026
And I want someone who can see...

798
00:38:53,226 --> 00:38:55,725
beyond my flaws and still adore me.

799
00:38:55,726 --> 00:38:58,465
Someone who can do that would be close to my ideal type.

800
00:38:58,466 --> 00:39:00,635
- Right. You can see that... - That's right.

801
00:39:00,636 --> 00:39:01,942
- when you spend time with people. - Yes.

802
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:04,806
If you don't mind and I could be of help,

803
00:39:05,036 --> 00:39:07,406
- I'll try to help you. - Thank you.

804
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,715
You have such a lovely impression. You seem like a good person.

805
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:12,846
- Is that so? - Yes.

806
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:14,446
Thank you.

807
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,585
Byeong Yeol had such an amicable face.

808
00:39:18,586 --> 00:39:22,456
Actually, he said he was a saju reader like me.

809
00:39:22,686 --> 00:39:25,326
So I wanted to talk to him more.

810
00:39:25,756 --> 00:39:27,125
- I'll see you later. - It was fun.

811
00:39:27,126 --> 00:39:28,525
- I'll see you in the house. - Yes.

812
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:30,336
- Thank you. - Bye.

813
00:39:32,296 --> 00:39:35,206
(Their 15-minute conversation ends on a cheerful note.)

814
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:40,946
(Sighing)

815
00:39:44,346 --> 00:39:45,616
(Bursting into laughter)

816
00:39:46,046 --> 00:39:48,285
(His legs go weak.)

817
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:51,616
- Byeong Yeol must go back to bed. - That's his routine.

818
00:39:51,816 --> 00:39:53,586
He must lie down for 15 minutes.

819
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:56,766
- Byeong Yeol is so funny. - Why is he so hilarious?

820
00:40:08,236 --> 00:40:11,706
(He must have been quite nervous.)

821
00:40:13,146 --> 00:40:14,446
When will the new girl come?

822
00:40:16,616 --> 00:40:19,346
Are they secretly going on a date without telling us?

823
00:40:20,316 --> 00:40:21,945
(Getting the chills)

824
00:40:21,946 --> 00:40:23,216
She's indeed a shaman.

825
00:40:23,456 --> 00:40:25,715
My gosh. I can't believe she just said that.

826
00:40:25,716 --> 00:40:27,585
- It's way too quiet. - Yes.

827
00:40:27,586 --> 00:40:28,932
(Nothing can get past the shaman.)

828
00:40:28,956 --> 00:40:30,226
Shamans are scary.

829
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:35,796
Are they secretly going on a date without telling us?

830
00:40:36,766 --> 00:40:39,806
But it would be so obvious if that were the case.

831
00:40:41,336 --> 00:40:42,866
Maybe I'm wrong. Who knows?

832
00:40:45,236 --> 00:40:48,446
(Just like Yu Gyeong's spot-on prediction, )

833
00:40:50,016 --> 00:40:53,986
(Kyung Eon is secretly going on dates with the guys.)

834
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,685
I drew this card about the new girl.

835
00:40:56,686 --> 00:40:57,715
- Really? - What?

836
00:40:57,716 --> 00:40:58,916
- No way. - What?

837
00:40:58,986 --> 00:41:00,585
- How does it look? - I keep talking casually with you.

838
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:01,985
- Let me ask you this. - I was just curious.

839
00:41:01,986 --> 00:41:03,466
- Is she pretty? - I got too excited.

840
00:41:03,626 --> 00:41:05,525
- Is she pretty? - What did you ask?

841
00:41:05,526 --> 00:41:06,995
(Pondering)

842
00:41:06,996 --> 00:41:09,026
I think she will be quite popular.

843
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:11,595
- Yes, I think so too. - Yes, I'm sure of it.

844
00:41:11,596 --> 00:41:13,505
Otherwise, she wouldn't have joined the show.

845
00:41:13,506 --> 00:41:15,436
I sense an abundance within her.

846
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:17,076
She's also pretty.

847
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:19,775
Is she brimming with confidence?

848
00:41:19,776 --> 00:41:21,206
She's also sentimental.

849
00:41:21,606 --> 00:41:23,746
She's competent and good at many things.

850
00:41:23,976 --> 00:41:25,216
She's confident too.

851
00:41:26,176 --> 00:41:28,016
- She's a total queen. - She sounds legendary.

852
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:29,855
- A total queen. - A queen.

853
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,315
- She's a queen. - She's coming.

854
00:41:31,316 --> 00:41:33,386
We... She said, "She's coming."

855
00:41:33,456 --> 00:41:35,386
- No way. - Ms. Fairy.

856
00:41:36,756 --> 00:41:40,096
(Yu Ra studies the cards a little more.)

857
00:41:40,696 --> 00:41:42,666
Someone will pursue her.

858
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:45,035
Someone will pursue her quite actively.

859
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:47,636
It says a man will pursue her in a straightforward manner.

860
00:41:48,866 --> 00:41:49,976
A man?

861
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:57,116
I thought it could be Yu Gyeong.

862
00:41:57,246 --> 00:41:58,676
That crossed my mind.

863
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:05,256
(Ho Am leaves, hoping he'd see Yu Gyeong.)

864
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,226
(Sighing)

865
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:22,736
(He hurries over to the Pavilion of Connections.)

866
00:42:24,136 --> 00:42:26,646
Oh, my. Hello.

867
00:42:27,976 --> 00:42:30,616
- Hello. - Hello.

868
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:32,916
Nice to meet you.

869
00:42:33,516 --> 00:42:34,646
- Yes. - Hello.

870
00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:39,856
We're going to talk for 15 minutes.

871
00:42:40,526 --> 00:42:41,586
Yes.

872
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:44,096
- Shall we begin? - Yes.

873
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,096
(The 15-minute conversation begins.)

874
00:42:49,996 --> 00:42:51,766
(Happy to see him)

875
00:42:52,596 --> 00:42:55,235
(Trying to figure out what's going on)

876
00:42:55,236 --> 00:42:57,375
- Nice to meet you. - Yes. Hello.

877
00:42:57,376 --> 00:42:58,436
Yes.

878
00:42:59,736 --> 00:43:01,406
Oh, right. What's your name?

879
00:43:01,606 --> 00:43:03,546
My name is Jang Ho Am.

880
00:43:03,746 --> 00:43:04,746
- Ho... - Am.

881
00:43:04,747 --> 00:43:05,946
- Am. - Yes.

882
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:09,015
My name is Lee Kyung Eon.

883
00:43:09,016 --> 00:43:10,516
- Lee Kyung Eon? - Yes.

884
00:43:10,816 --> 00:43:12,686
Eon as in sister in Korean.

885
00:43:12,816 --> 00:43:14,526
- You have a unique name. - Right?

886
00:43:15,256 --> 00:43:16,855
(Trailing off)

887
00:43:16,856 --> 00:43:18,425
- How fascinating. I'm so surprised. - You seem really surprised.

888
00:43:18,426 --> 00:43:19,596
Is that so?

889
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:25,566
How do you feel? You're about to move into the house.

890
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:29,365
I feel more at ease than I expected.

891
00:43:29,366 --> 00:43:30,475
- Really? - Yes.

892
00:43:30,476 --> 00:43:31,706
You're not nervous?

893
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,906
- I don't think I am. - My gosh.

894
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:38,176
- But you seem nervous. - Yes. I'm more nervous.

895
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:41,316
(She dominates the mood when he's been here longer.)

896
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:43,646
I guess your energy is compatible with the house.

897
00:43:44,216 --> 00:43:47,256
I guess so. It must be compatible with the location.

898
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:50,232
You'll get used to the environment quite fast.

899
00:43:50,256 --> 00:43:52,772
- You think so? That's a relief. - Your personality suits the place.

900
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,195
- Before your arrival, - Yes?

901
00:43:54,196 --> 00:43:55,196
We talked about...

902
00:43:55,197 --> 00:43:56,365
what kind of lady would join us.

903
00:43:56,366 --> 00:43:57,935
- Actually... - We tried to guess that.

904
00:43:57,936 --> 00:43:59,466
- Yes. - We said that...

905
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:01,365
she might be cheerful and passionate.

906
00:44:01,366 --> 00:44:03,105
- That's what we mostly predicted. - I see.

907
00:44:03,106 --> 00:44:04,706
- I think we were right. - Is that so?

908
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:07,475
When I saw you,

909
00:44:07,476 --> 00:44:09,306
- Is that so? - I sensed that vibe from you.

910
00:44:11,146 --> 00:44:12,645
Your energy reminds me of fire.

911
00:44:12,646 --> 00:44:13,716
Really?

912
00:44:15,216 --> 00:44:16,516
(Surprised)

913
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:19,356
But that is true.

914
00:44:19,656 --> 00:44:21,926
- She's the Red Rabbit. - Then...

915
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:25,355
for someone with a lot of fire energy,

916
00:44:25,356 --> 00:44:26,965
is it better to meet someone with water energy?

917
00:44:26,966 --> 00:44:28,742
Or is it better to meet someone with the same fire energy?

918
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,095
Someone with fire energy...

919
00:44:30,096 --> 00:44:31,866
could be nice as they could be good friends.

920
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,806
Or someone with water energy could offer compatibility.

921
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,905
Or someone with earth energy could neutralize the fire energy.

922
00:44:36,906 --> 00:44:38,475
Someone with water energy could suppress the fire energy.

923
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:40,716
But I need to check the rest of the energy elements too.

924
00:44:40,776 --> 00:44:42,646
As for Lee Kyung Eon,

925
00:44:42,876 --> 00:44:45,015
dating a guy with metal or earth energy could be nice.

926
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,446
- Ho Am does have metal energy. - I see.

927
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:51,115
He seems shy, flustered, and nervous...

928
00:44:51,116 --> 00:44:53,085
in front of her.

929
00:44:53,086 --> 00:44:54,885
- But he's quickly leading... - Yes.

930
00:44:54,886 --> 00:44:56,696
- the conversation. - Right.

931
00:44:56,956 --> 00:44:58,196
- Ho Am has good energy. - Yes.

932
00:44:59,156 --> 00:45:00,825
Curiosity is killing me.

933
00:45:00,826 --> 00:45:02,342
(Getting more curious about Kyung Eon's decision)

934
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,465
- I don't know how to read saju. - Yes.

935
00:45:04,466 --> 00:45:07,005
But when those who studied saju talked about you,

936
00:45:07,006 --> 00:45:08,866
that was the image they associated with you.

937
00:45:09,836 --> 00:45:11,236
Someone passionate.

938
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:15,046
"Passionate?" That's interesting.

939
00:45:15,506 --> 00:45:18,845
- How would you describe yourself? - Yes?

940
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:19,986
Describe myself?

941
00:45:22,646 --> 00:45:25,256
I tend to follow my heart.

942
00:45:25,616 --> 00:45:28,386
I think that's in my disposition.

943
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:30,756
- Yes. So... - Would you say you're closer...

944
00:45:30,926 --> 00:45:32,656
- to a go-getter? - Well...

945
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:36,636
You're right. Once I make up my mind,

946
00:45:36,936 --> 00:45:40,706
I tend to go for it without any hesitation.

947
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:49,075
You had to choose a plaque at the Hall of Sacred Spirits...

948
00:45:49,076 --> 00:45:50,446
- on your first day. - Yes.

949
00:45:50,616 --> 00:45:52,696
Did you check everyone's saju before you picked one?

950
00:45:54,146 --> 00:45:55,715
- Yes. - Then you could have grasped...

951
00:45:55,716 --> 00:45:57,916
our personalities through saju before coming here.

952
00:45:58,216 --> 00:45:59,285
You didn't do that?

953
00:45:59,286 --> 00:46:01,325
No. If I did that,

954
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:03,525
I would be awkward like a robot.

955
00:46:03,526 --> 00:46:08,025
To show people the real side of me,

956
00:46:08,026 --> 00:46:10,496
I thought I should skip that.

957
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:12,966
So I didn't study the saju on the plaques extensively.

958
00:46:13,636 --> 00:46:16,106
What about your reading? Has it been accurate so far?

959
00:46:16,706 --> 00:46:19,206
I think it's going well, just as my reading predicted.

960
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:23,345
- Did you do it before coming here? - Yes.

961
00:46:23,346 --> 00:46:24,475
Really?

962
00:46:24,476 --> 00:46:26,145
But I don't know how things will change...

963
00:46:26,146 --> 00:46:27,815
- from now on. - Okay.

964
00:46:27,816 --> 00:46:29,445
- But I'm behaving... - Yes.

965
00:46:29,446 --> 00:46:31,156
Just like my reading said I would.

966
00:46:35,056 --> 00:46:38,656
I noticed that he was trying to stay grounded.

967
00:46:39,056 --> 00:46:40,896
That was something I could learn from him.

968
00:46:41,096 --> 00:46:44,066
That left a strong impression on me.

969
00:46:44,166 --> 00:46:47,836
I was more attracted to him because of that...

970
00:46:47,936 --> 00:46:49,406
at that moment.

971
00:46:51,836 --> 00:46:54,305
They asked me yesterday,

972
00:46:54,306 --> 00:46:56,276
- "What if a new person comes in?" - Who did?

973
00:46:56,376 --> 00:46:57,376
The guys.

974
00:46:57,746 --> 00:46:59,315
"Do you think you would feel jealous?"

975
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,385
They asked you that?

976
00:47:00,386 --> 00:47:01,585
- They asked you that? - Did they really ask you that?

977
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:02,946
Why did they ask you that?

978
00:47:03,046 --> 00:47:05,755
They asked, "Do you think you'd feel competitive?"

979
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,426
- Honestly... - I would.

980
00:47:07,756 --> 00:47:11,525
It's not because of the choices...

981
00:47:11,526 --> 00:47:12,855
the guys would make, but...

982
00:47:12,856 --> 00:47:13,866
Like instinctively?

983
00:47:14,526 --> 00:47:17,235
I think I would feel jealous as a woman.

984
00:47:17,236 --> 00:47:18,395
You would feel that way as a woman.

985
00:47:18,396 --> 00:47:19,696
I'd feel a little competitive.

986
00:47:20,306 --> 00:47:21,705
Rather than thinking,

987
00:47:21,706 --> 00:47:23,705
- "I want to make him mine," - I just...

988
00:47:23,706 --> 00:47:24,775
it's more like, "Am I not attractive?"

989
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:26,135
Right. That's how I'd feel.

990
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:27,205
"I can't believe he didn't choose me."

991
00:47:27,206 --> 00:47:28,945
- It's something like that. - Right.

992
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:29,946
"Do you not know..."

993
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:31,175
- "how charming I am?" - Yes.

994
00:47:31,176 --> 00:47:32,176
"He didn't choose me?"

995
00:47:32,246 --> 00:47:34,986
It's not like, "Will she take the person I've been liking?"

996
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:38,285
But if all the men paid attention to her,

997
00:47:38,286 --> 00:47:40,185
I'd feel upset as a woman.

998
00:47:40,186 --> 00:47:41,556
- "Am I not attractive?" - Yes.

999
00:47:41,886 --> 00:47:44,395
They say men's ideal type is a new woman.

1000
00:47:44,396 --> 00:47:45,895
- What does that mean? - Right.

1001
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,365
They say it's a new woman.

1002
00:47:47,366 --> 00:47:48,495
(While the women feel nervous...)

1003
00:47:48,496 --> 00:47:49,496
That's honest.

1004
00:47:51,796 --> 00:47:56,206
(Kyung Eon is going to the Hall of Sacred Spirits to make a choice.)

1005
00:47:58,636 --> 00:48:05,376
(Who will she choose today?)

1006
00:48:12,986 --> 00:48:15,025
(The new female resident...)

1007
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:18,295
(can check the fate plaques of two people...)

1008
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:21,966
(and choose one person to go on a date with.)

1009
00:48:23,396 --> 00:48:25,395
- I'm curious. - Let's see.

1010
00:48:25,396 --> 00:48:26,635
(Kyung Eon is given the privilege to check the fate plaques.)

1011
00:48:26,636 --> 00:48:27,636
Who will she choose?

1012
00:48:27,637 --> 00:48:28,942
- What's her choice? - Who will she choose?

1013
00:48:28,966 --> 00:48:30,676
It'd be either Sang Hyeok or Byeong Yeol.

1014
00:48:31,106 --> 00:48:34,045
Don't you think she has feelings for Byeong Yeol?

1015
00:48:34,046 --> 00:48:35,682
- Right? - Based on her facial expression?

1016
00:48:35,706 --> 00:48:37,315
- Yes. I felt it too. - Yes.

1017
00:48:37,316 --> 00:48:38,376
They have the same saju.

1018
00:48:38,476 --> 00:48:40,315
I feel like she would choose Byeong Yeol.

1019
00:48:40,316 --> 00:48:41,316
Right.

1020
00:48:41,317 --> 00:48:45,716
(Who will Kyung Eon choose?)

1021
00:48:49,786 --> 00:48:50,826
Hyeon U.

1022
00:48:51,726 --> 00:48:55,096
(Jung Hyeon U)

1023
00:48:56,596 --> 00:48:59,865
Eyes are important to me,

1024
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:02,666
so I tend to pay attention to them.

1025
00:49:02,936 --> 00:49:07,106
He greeted me comfortably, as if he were doing so with his eyes.

1026
00:49:07,506 --> 00:49:11,576
When we met and talked for the first time,

1027
00:49:11,816 --> 00:49:13,846
I felt very comfortable.

1028
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:17,015
(Yun Sang Hyeok)

1029
00:49:17,016 --> 00:49:20,185
When Sang Hyeok was walking toward me,

1030
00:49:20,186 --> 00:49:22,226
he left a good first impression,

1031
00:49:22,956 --> 00:49:24,956
which drew my attention.

1032
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:28,066
So I'd like to talk with him more.

1033
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:34,265
(Kyung Eon chose...)

1034
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:36,506
(Sang Hyeok and Hyeon U.)

1035
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:43,576
(She checks the fate plaques of the two.)

1036
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:52,686
(What answer will their fate plaques give her?)

1037
00:50:06,936 --> 00:50:14,246
(Gold Dragon, Yun Sang Hyeok)

1038
00:50:17,176 --> 00:50:21,846
(Blue Chicken, Jung Hyeon U)

1039
00:50:22,146 --> 00:50:24,416
(Surprised)

1040
00:50:25,256 --> 00:50:26,256
"Blue Chicken."

1041
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:28,855
I think I felt comfortable around him...

1042
00:50:28,856 --> 00:50:32,525
because of the characteristics...

1043
00:50:32,526 --> 00:50:33,896
of the Yin Wood in his saju.

1044
00:50:34,126 --> 00:50:37,396
(During the preselection)

1045
00:50:39,566 --> 00:50:43,566
(The destined partner Kyung Eon chose)

1046
00:50:44,576 --> 00:50:51,476
(Lee Kyung Eon chooses the Blue Chicken.)

1047
00:50:51,976 --> 00:50:55,486
(She found her destined partner at a glance.)

1048
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:59,616
(Which one will she choose between the two?)

1049
00:51:00,256 --> 00:51:03,656
(If she chooses Hyeon U, Yun Jeong will be left behind.)

1050
00:51:04,056 --> 00:51:07,696
(If she chooses Sang Hyeok, Yu Ra will be left behind.)

1051
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:12,336
(Her choice will determine their destiny.)

1052
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:23,006
(She made a choice.)

1053
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:28,686
If she chooses Hyeon U,

1054
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:30,655
- Yun Jeong and Ho Am... - Yun Jeong...

1055
00:51:30,656 --> 00:51:31,715
- Right. - will be left.

1056
00:51:31,716 --> 00:51:32,956
I'm happy about that too.

1057
00:51:33,656 --> 00:51:35,456
Then Yun Jeong...

1058
00:51:35,756 --> 00:51:38,796
might be able to tell him how she actually felt.

1059
00:51:39,226 --> 00:51:40,295
She can, if there are just the two of them.

1060
00:51:40,296 --> 00:51:41,565
If there are just the two of them.

1061
00:51:41,566 --> 00:51:44,206
- If there are just the two of them? - Yes. She can talk about it.

1062
00:51:44,436 --> 00:51:47,666
If she chooses Sang Hyeok,

1063
00:51:48,006 --> 00:51:50,436
- Yu Ra will be left. - Yu Ra and Ho Am.

1064
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,886
- No way. - What is it?

1065
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:06,015
I hope it's the new woman.

1066
00:52:06,016 --> 00:52:08,156
- That might be the case. - What?

1067
00:52:08,456 --> 00:52:09,485
I hope that's the case.

1068
00:52:09,486 --> 00:52:10,996
Do I look too shabby today?

1069
00:52:12,026 --> 00:52:14,496
(Yu Ra is ready for the date.)

1070
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:17,695
- Is the new person here? - That's what I'm thinking.

1071
00:52:17,696 --> 00:52:18,735
That's what I'm thinking.

1072
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:19,736
- Aren't you too happy about it? - I'm curious.

1073
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:23,306
(Everyone is waiting for the last resident to appear.)

1074
00:52:24,529 --> 00:52:27,049
The date matching has ended.

1075
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:29,749
Sang Hyeok's date has changed...

1076
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,249
due to the new woman's choice.

1077
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:37,058
Yu Ra. Please stay in the house.

1078
00:52:37,059 --> 00:52:41,259
(Yu Ra. Please stay in the house.)

1079
00:52:42,899 --> 00:52:44,328
Please stay in the house.

1080
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:45,828
(Shocked)

1081
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,299
Please stay in the house.

1082
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:50,068
This is not right.

1083
00:52:50,069 --> 00:52:52,109
(The unexpected notice shatters the peace.)

1084
00:52:52,609 --> 00:52:54,579
(Shocked)

1085
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:57,378
She chose Sang Hyeok. Oh, my gosh.

1086
00:52:57,379 --> 00:52:59,979
Yu Ra dressed up so nicely.

1087
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:03,118
And it was announced publicly through a speaker.

1088
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,188
(She had her date taken away in front of everyone.)

1089
00:53:04,189 --> 00:53:05,219
I know.

1090
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,218
- I feel so bad. - That's so cruel.

1091
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:08,858
The day before, Sang Hyeok...

1092
00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:10,888
texted Yu Ra.

1093
00:53:10,889 --> 00:53:13,899
- Yes. It's a bummer. - Right.

1094
00:53:14,429 --> 00:53:17,199
It's really not easy to meet someone.

1095
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:19,498
What does this mean?

1096
00:53:19,499 --> 00:53:22,068
(The men are trying to understand the situation.)

1097
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:23,169
It's changed.

1098
00:53:23,469 --> 00:53:25,039
His date has been changed?

1099
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:26,509
I think it can be changed.

1100
00:53:28,209 --> 00:53:32,309
(A twist of fate that has struck the Possessed House)

1101
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:36,019
Gosh. What do I do?

1102
00:53:36,989 --> 00:53:38,419
How did this happen?

1103
00:53:41,019 --> 00:53:45,459
(Kyung Eon didn't choose her destined partner.)

1104
00:53:47,129 --> 00:53:51,969
(Lee Kyung Eon chooses Yun Sang Hyeok as her date.)

1105
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:57,069
This is cruel.

1106
00:53:58,209 --> 00:53:59,309
This is so intense.

1107
00:54:01,209 --> 00:54:02,679
(Shocked)

1108
00:54:05,779 --> 00:54:11,089
(The men have realized what has happened belatedly.)

1109
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:14,589
(Glancing)

1110
00:54:14,689 --> 00:54:15,759
This is intense.

1111
00:54:25,069 --> 00:54:26,469
It's so sudden.

1112
00:54:26,969 --> 00:54:28,899
I'm bewildered.

1113
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:30,439
To me,

1114
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:33,039
she's the person who took my date away from me.

1115
00:54:34,339 --> 00:54:36,108
"What is she thinking?"

1116
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:37,609
It made me think like this.

1117
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:44,549
I was very upset.

1118
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,559
- In the house... - Earlier, everyone...

1119
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:51,958
was matched for a date without any overlap, which was neat.

1120
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:53,859
- Right. - It was neat.

1121
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:00,699
(Glancing)

1122
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:10,479
(Everyone is thinking about the new woman's choice.)

1123
00:55:12,649 --> 00:55:14,219
(Sighing)

1124
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:19,848
- Dismissed. - Dismissed.

1125
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:20,859
Dismissed?

1126
00:55:25,729 --> 00:55:26,729
- Why? - What? Nothing.

1127
00:55:29,229 --> 00:55:31,368
You dressed so nicely. You were looking forward to it.

1128
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,468
- I know. - This is what I said earlier.

1129
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:35,068
I think the cards were saying what would happen.

1130
00:55:35,069 --> 00:55:38,038
Earlier, among the three cards, one was what you wanted.

1131
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:40,978
But the other two cards weren't so good.

1132
00:55:40,979 --> 00:55:43,278
It's like you can get closer, but you don't know what will happen.

1133
00:55:43,279 --> 00:55:45,248
It feels like the card was saying...

1134
00:55:45,249 --> 00:55:46,489
- that I'd stay alone. - Right.

1135
00:55:46,979 --> 00:55:48,019
Yes.

1136
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:50,279
Yu Ra's tarot reading is accurate.

1137
00:55:52,589 --> 00:55:53,789
I got this again.

1138
00:55:53,959 --> 00:55:55,218
What's that? What does it mean?

1139
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:56,389
Indifference.

1140
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:00,259
- I think it'll come closer. - Yes.

1141
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:01,758
I think so too.

1142
00:56:01,759 --> 00:56:03,998
But I don't know which one is indifferent.

1143
00:56:03,999 --> 00:56:05,298
That would be you.

1144
00:56:05,299 --> 00:56:06,868
It says it'll get closer.

1145
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:09,068
(The reading felt ambiguous for some reason.)

1146
00:56:09,069 --> 00:56:11,569
I guess that's why you got those cards.

1147
00:56:12,739 --> 00:56:14,139
That's what it meant.

1148
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:16,339
But it's so...

1149
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:19,378
I'm so upset. Today was your chance.

1150
00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:20,419
(The fortune came true.)

1151
00:56:24,249 --> 00:56:27,488
(Kim Yun Jeong asked you out. Please get ready for a date.)

1152
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:30,989
(Lee Kyung Eon asked you out. Please get ready for a date.)

1153
00:56:31,289 --> 00:56:34,499
(Lee Ra Yun asked you out. Please get ready for a date.)

1154
00:56:34,899 --> 00:56:36,828
(Chae Yu Gyeong asked you out. Please get ready for a date.)

1155
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:37,829
(Surprised)

1156
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:38,929
Why?

1157
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,599
Did someone ask you out?

1158
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:42,299
Is it that?

1159
00:56:43,169 --> 00:56:44,739
(Nodding)

1160
00:56:50,479 --> 00:56:52,179
Oh, no.

1161
00:56:52,279 --> 00:56:53,379
Ho Am.

1162
00:56:53,479 --> 00:56:55,049
- Oh, no. - And they're together.

1163
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:57,219
How come they're together?

1164
00:56:57,549 --> 00:56:59,849
- Ho Am doesn't know yet. - Right.

1165
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:01,658
(Upset)

1166
00:57:01,659 --> 00:57:03,619
He doesn't know that Yu Gyeong chose Byeong Yeol.

1167
00:57:04,929 --> 00:57:07,599
I feel bad for Ho Am. I hope he never finds out.

1168
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:10,598
- Oh, no. - Oh, my gosh.

1169
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:12,359
(The cruel reality that is not easy to face)

1170
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:15,298
I need to get ready.

1171
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:16,339
Do you need to get ready?

1172
00:57:18,509 --> 00:57:22,839
(Byeong Yeol starts getting ready for a date.)

1173
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:31,789
(Ho Am didn't receive any text yet.)

1174
00:57:37,429 --> 00:57:39,428
- Byeong Yeol. - Yes?

1175
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:40,735
Did they tell you who your date was?

1176
00:57:40,759 --> 00:57:42,329
Did they tell you who your date was?

1177
00:57:43,659 --> 00:57:44,829
Really?

1178
00:57:54,779 --> 00:58:02,079
(No one chose you as their date. Please stay in the house.)

1179
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:04,949
(Upset)

1180
00:58:08,289 --> 00:58:10,789
Oh, no. "Please stay in the house."

1181
00:58:12,189 --> 00:58:14,558
- He told her about his feelings. - Yes.

1182
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,828
He must feel like he was rejected.

1183
00:58:17,829 --> 00:58:21,098
Yesterday, he basically said...

1184
00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:22,638
he wanted to be her boyfriend.

1185
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:24,808
And the next day, she goes on a date with another man.

1186
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:26,208
- It means she rejected him. - He's rejected.

1187
00:58:26,209 --> 00:58:27,979
- He's rejected. - Right.

1188
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:30,479
People I'm rooting for aren't getting together.

1189
00:58:31,879 --> 00:58:34,519
- Maybe I shouldn't root for them. - I'm upset.

1190
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:40,559
(He checks the message again.)

1191
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:45,158
Looking at the message only made me feel bad.

1192
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:46,859
But I kept looking at it.

1193
00:58:47,529 --> 00:58:49,529
How should I put it? Was I trying to deny reality?

1194
00:58:49,999 --> 00:58:51,129
"How did this happen?"

1195
00:58:52,069 --> 00:58:53,499
Byeong Yeol.

1196
00:58:54,299 --> 00:58:56,939
I guess she asked him out.

1197
00:58:58,509 --> 00:59:00,679
When the result came out,

1198
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:04,479
I was a little disappointed and jealous.

1199
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:10,479
(He has mixed feelings.)

1200
00:59:14,189 --> 00:59:19,129
(Ho Am quietly sits somewhere else.)

1201
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:26,069
(Pick one for me.)

1202
00:59:26,499 --> 00:59:27,499
(Surprised)

1203
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,639
- Oh, my. - Gosh!

1204
00:59:28,839 --> 00:59:30,668
That's so cruel.

1205
00:59:30,669 --> 00:59:33,469
- Why did he ask him to choose? - He asked him to choose?

1206
00:59:33,609 --> 00:59:36,738
Just choose anything and go out.

1207
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:39,048
- They can't change the room, right? - Right.

1208
00:59:39,049 --> 00:59:41,489
They'll play "I Believe," and he'll say, "My Yu Gyeong is..."

1209
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:44,489
I guess he's the clueless type.

1210
00:59:48,519 --> 00:59:50,289
(Upset)

1211
00:59:52,429 --> 00:59:53,429
This?

1212
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:55,805
(Byeong Yeol looks happy without knowing how Ho Am is feeling.)

1213
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:56,929
This?

1214
00:59:57,399 --> 00:59:58,569
(Nodding)

1215
01:00:03,169 --> 01:00:07,879
(He keeps looking at the message.)

1216
01:00:10,749 --> 01:00:14,849
(The two extremes)

1217
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:18,519
(Tapping)

1218
01:00:23,459 --> 01:00:25,689
(How do I look?)

1219
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:28,558
You look good in it.

1220
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,828
(Ho Am still answers.)

1221
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:31,969
It looks good.

1222
01:00:33,939 --> 01:00:38,109
(He's especially serious about choosing an outfit today.)

1223
01:00:41,279 --> 01:00:45,649
(He definitely doesn't know what has happened.)

1224
01:00:49,249 --> 01:00:50,949
(Approaching)

1225
01:00:51,589 --> 01:00:53,069
Are you not getting ready for a date?

1226
01:00:54,259 --> 01:00:55,619
I'm not going out today.

1227
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,288
I'm not going out today.

1228
01:00:58,289 --> 01:01:00,059
(He finds out the truth.)

1229
01:01:00,259 --> 01:01:02,159
- Not yet? - They said I wouldn't go out.

1230
01:01:03,529 --> 01:01:05,398
(Oh, no.)

1231
01:01:05,399 --> 01:01:07,269
They might tell you to go out later.

1232
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:09,739
(Awkward)

1233
01:01:11,009 --> 01:01:15,909
(Ho Am is just upset.)

1234
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:24,049
(What will Ho Am think while he stays in the house?)

1235
01:01:26,289 --> 01:01:29,059
(An afternoon filled with sparkling sunlight)

1236
01:01:31,029 --> 01:01:34,199
When we met and talked for the first time,

1237
01:01:34,829 --> 01:01:37,099
he left a good impression.

1238
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:40,669
It made me curious about him.

1239
01:01:40,869 --> 01:01:43,139
So I'd like to talk with him more.

1240
01:01:44,109 --> 01:01:47,409
(Kyung Eon is waiting for Sang Hyeok on the bamboo path.)

1241
01:01:50,279 --> 01:01:53,109
When I heard that I would go on a date with her...

1242
01:01:54,279 --> 01:01:56,579
I was curious about her.

1243
01:01:58,549 --> 01:02:01,789
"What kind of person would she be?" It made me excited.

1244
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,269
(Turning)

1245
01:02:22,779 --> 01:02:24,309
Aren't you cold? Please stay seated.

1246
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:26,749
Okay.

1247
01:02:26,949 --> 01:02:28,078
Aren't you cold?

1248
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:29,079
- Not yet. - Is it okay?

1249
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,440
- Yes. I'm fine. - It's good then.

1250
01:02:31,389 --> 01:02:34,088
(Hall of Sacred Spirits Date: Lee Kyung Eon and Yun Sang Hyeok)

1251
01:02:34,089 --> 01:02:35,389
This place is beautiful.

1252
01:02:38,529 --> 01:02:40,689
- Have you been to Osaka? Yes. - Osaka?

1253
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:43,528
- No. I haven't been there yet. - You haven't?

1254
01:02:43,529 --> 01:02:45,569
There's a place like this in Osaka and Kyoto.

1255
01:02:49,869 --> 01:02:54,039
(They try to ease the tension with small talk.)

1256
01:02:54,909 --> 01:02:58,009
I wanted to spend...

1257
01:02:59,249 --> 01:03:01,219
more time with you.

1258
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:04,789
- So I asked you out. - Thank you.

1259
01:03:04,819 --> 01:03:05,989
Thank you so much.

1260
01:03:06,389 --> 01:03:09,119
- You thank me? - Thank you. I mean it.

1261
01:03:09,459 --> 01:03:12,729
- Okay. You did? - I also wanted to get to know you.

1262
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:15,158
- You haven't eaten yet, right? - No, I haven't.

1263
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:16,628
- Since the morning? - Yes.

1264
01:03:16,629 --> 01:03:17,729
You must be hungry.

1265
01:03:17,969 --> 01:03:21,569
I picked a place I wanted to go.

1266
01:03:21,769 --> 01:03:23,799
I think we'll go there today.

1267
01:03:24,669 --> 01:03:25,669
Sounds good.

1268
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:27,308
You said you like activities earlier.

1269
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:28,938
Yes. So I chose...

1270
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:32,149
something like that today.

1271
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:34,249
- Shall we go now? - Shall we?

1272
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:37,379
- Let's go. - Shall we? Yes.

1273
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:43,088
You knew you were coming...

1274
01:03:43,089 --> 01:03:44,158
- quite late, right? - Yes.

1275
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:45,529
Yes. I knew.

1276
01:03:47,129 --> 01:03:48,958
Can I also say something?

1277
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:49,999
What is it?

1278
01:03:50,529 --> 01:03:52,569
- I also came only a few days ago. - You did?

1279
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:06,709
(Meanwhile, the two of them are left in the house.)

1280
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:13,119
(Sighing)

1281
01:04:13,919 --> 01:04:17,559
(The house is quiet while everyone is gone.)

1282
01:04:18,659 --> 01:04:20,959
Everyone must be having fun on their date.

1283
01:04:24,629 --> 01:04:29,099
(They feel sad thinking about it.)

1284
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:32,469
The weather is good, though.

1285
01:04:34,979 --> 01:04:36,039
Right.

1286
01:04:38,279 --> 01:04:43,749
(The sunny weather makes them curious about the others.)

1287
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:47,958
(Scratch card Date: Chae Yu Gyeong and Ha Byeong Yeol)

1288
01:04:47,959 --> 01:04:49,458
Do you have nicknames?

1289
01:04:49,459 --> 01:04:52,059
- Nicknames? - Your name is actually unique.

1290
01:04:52,429 --> 01:04:54,189
So I wonder what kind of nicknames you have.

1291
01:04:54,659 --> 01:04:56,059
Is there anything you can think of?

1292
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:58,799
(Thinking hard)

1293
01:04:58,999 --> 01:05:00,569
I don't know.

1294
01:05:01,669 --> 01:05:04,368
- Is it okay to say this? - What is it?

1295
01:05:04,369 --> 01:05:06,929
Something like Byeong Gyun, which sounds like "germs" in Korean.

1296
01:05:07,739 --> 01:05:09,978
Since elementary students joke around a lot.

1297
01:05:09,979 --> 01:05:10,979
I'm sorry.

1298
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:13,848
Many people called me Jik Yeol, which means "series" in Korean.

1299
01:05:13,849 --> 01:05:17,348
- Jik Yeol? - Yes. Jik Yeol and Byeong Yeol.

1300
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:18,549
- Like in science? - Yes.

1301
01:05:19,189 --> 01:05:20,549
And...

1302
01:05:20,889 --> 01:05:22,789
- in Gyeongsang Province, - Yes.

1303
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:25,058
Many people call me by a one-syllable name.

1304
01:05:25,059 --> 01:05:27,329
- Like Yeol? - Yes. They're like, "Yeol."

1305
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:30,499
- Is it a term of endearment? - Yes.

1306
01:05:34,129 --> 01:05:36,138
Can I call you by that name when we get closer?

1307
01:05:36,139 --> 01:05:37,269
That'd be nice.

1308
01:05:40,009 --> 01:05:42,279
- I have a question. - What is it?

1309
01:05:43,209 --> 01:05:45,678
- You're a shaman. - Yes.

1310
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:49,878
Does it make you more comfortable to date...

1311
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:51,749
a fellow shaman?

1312
01:05:52,249 --> 01:05:55,319
Then you'll have more things to talk about or have in common.

1313
01:05:55,759 --> 01:05:57,258
"Shall we go on a prayer date?"

1314
01:05:57,259 --> 01:05:58,728
You'll be able to say that.

1315
01:05:58,729 --> 01:06:00,259
I thought...

1316
01:06:00,629 --> 01:06:02,959
it was fascinating.

1317
01:06:03,029 --> 01:06:04,128
A prayer date?

1318
01:06:04,129 --> 01:06:05,429
If I were to compare it...

1319
01:06:06,199 --> 01:06:08,169
- to office workers, - Okay.

1320
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:10,598
It's like saying, "Shall we study at a cafe?"

1321
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:11,838
- So that's what it's like. - Yes.

1322
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:15,479
I thought it might bring two people closer.

1323
01:06:16,509 --> 01:06:17,949
I don't know. As for me...

1324
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:22,478
- It isn't like I have... - Okay.

1325
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:25,819
A definitive idea. I currently think...

1326
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:28,789
that I should do what I want.

1327
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:35,059
I hope you'll have fun today.

1328
01:06:35,399 --> 01:06:36,798
That's the only thought...

1329
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:37,968
- in my head. - I see.

1330
01:06:37,969 --> 01:06:39,529
- "I hope he'll have fun today?" - Yes.

1331
01:06:42,439 --> 01:06:44,469
- I'm excited. - Are you excited?

1332
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:47,139
I hope you'll have fun today.

1333
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:52,079
Yu Gyeong's energy is different.

1334
01:06:52,209 --> 01:06:54,108
- Yu Gyeong's expression is bright. - I know.

1335
01:06:54,109 --> 01:06:55,319
Her expression is different.

1336
01:06:58,949 --> 01:07:02,859
(Yu Gyeong and Byeong Yeol's first plan for the date)

1337
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:07,089
- Go ahead. - Thank you.

1338
01:07:09,999 --> 01:07:12,099
- Gosh, this place is so pretty. - Yes.

1339
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:15,569
There are many flowers.

1340
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,769
Today, we'll use flowers...

1341
01:07:19,809 --> 01:07:21,108
to make this.

1342
01:07:21,109 --> 01:07:22,478
- Is that what we're doing? - Yes.

1343
01:07:22,479 --> 01:07:24,479
(Making the fragrant flower candles)

1344
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:28,418
- Do you like flowers? - It's my first time doing this.

1345
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:30,149
- Right? - Yes. It's my first time.

1346
01:07:31,689 --> 01:07:33,848
- You'll make a candle holder first. - Okay.

1347
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:36,418
Choose the ingredients...

1348
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:37,789
to put together a design.

1349
01:07:38,129 --> 01:07:41,128
There are leaves and flowers.

1350
01:07:41,129 --> 01:07:43,499
- Okay. Thank you. - Thank you.

1351
01:07:44,299 --> 01:07:45,429
Which ones will you add?

1352
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:47,129
As for me,

1353
01:07:49,499 --> 01:07:50,939
- I'll add flowers. - Flowers?

1354
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:54,169
- It'll be fun. - I know.

1355
01:08:00,649 --> 01:08:01,649
(Cutting)

1356
01:08:03,419 --> 01:08:05,889
(Byeong Yeol sticks in an ingredient without hesitation.)

1357
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,419
They're big.

1358
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:11,059
- Are they too big? - No.

1359
01:08:17,129 --> 01:08:18,569
I'll use the small ones...

1360
01:08:18,999 --> 01:08:20,169
with pretty colours.

1361
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:24,569
(Yu Gyeong decorates it in a cute way.)

1362
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:27,169
All right.

1363
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:30,309
I think I like achromatic colours.

1364
01:08:32,009 --> 01:08:35,279
(They have opposite tastes.)

1365
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,019
(Blinking)

1366
01:08:38,619 --> 01:08:39,819
(Focused)

1367
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,389
(Yu Gyeong is absorbed in her work.)

1368
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:47,289
(Glancing over)

1369
01:08:48,429 --> 01:08:51,099
(Byeong Yeol is done already.)

1370
01:08:51,799 --> 01:08:53,999
(He feels awkward for no reason.)

1371
01:08:56,669 --> 01:08:57,769
Are you done?

1372
01:08:58,209 --> 01:08:59,539
I'm done.

1373
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:01,778
Did I work too fast?

1374
01:09:01,779 --> 01:09:04,179
The two of us must be very different.

1375
01:09:05,009 --> 01:09:08,519
Our dispositions are very different.

1376
01:09:08,619 --> 01:09:09,718
Seriously.

1377
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:11,389
I thought that we'd be similar.

1378
01:09:12,489 --> 01:09:15,289
- I actually thought the same. Yes. - That we'd be similar?

1379
01:09:16,059 --> 01:09:18,929
But we're more different than I imagined.

1380
01:09:20,959 --> 01:09:23,958
Do you prefer getting to know someone who is similar...

1381
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:25,729
or someone who is different?

1382
01:09:26,269 --> 01:09:27,399
What are you normally like?

1383
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:30,699
Normally...

1384
01:09:31,969 --> 01:09:34,169
(Nervous)

1385
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:38,149
I prefer getting to know someone who is different.

1386
01:09:40,249 --> 01:09:42,018
When two different people meet,

1387
01:09:42,019 --> 01:09:45,049
they make up for each other's weaknesses.

1388
01:09:45,249 --> 01:09:48,989
But it might take them a long time to understand each other.

1389
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:51,188
Conflicts might come easily...

1390
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:53,388
due to the things they don't get about each other.

1391
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:54,498
- When they're different? - Yes.

1392
01:09:54,499 --> 01:09:57,259
But once they adjust to each other,

1393
01:09:58,929 --> 01:10:00,928
the differences will be nice.

1394
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:02,439
(The differences will be nice.)

1395
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:07,169
(Byeong Yeol's words make her smile.)

1396
01:10:08,309 --> 01:10:10,508
It felt like we were finding a way to talk to each other.

1397
01:10:10,509 --> 01:10:12,378
It felt like we were learning about...

1398
01:10:12,379 --> 01:10:14,448
each other's way of talking and values.

1399
01:10:14,449 --> 01:10:17,348
Looking at each other and having a private conversation...

1400
01:10:17,349 --> 01:10:18,889
made me nervous...

1401
01:10:19,519 --> 01:10:20,789
in and of themselves.

1402
01:10:22,859 --> 01:10:24,458
- My goodness. - Gosh.

1403
01:10:24,459 --> 01:10:26,329
- What's happening? - Right now, Yu Gyeong...

1404
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,258
- There's nervousness. - She's nervous.

1405
01:10:29,259 --> 01:10:31,158
I think she likes him more than we thought.

1406
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:32,168
- It seems that way. - Yes.

1407
01:10:32,169 --> 01:10:33,668
- Yu Gyeong. - She hid her feelings better...

1408
01:10:33,669 --> 01:10:34,699
than we thought.

1409
01:10:36,669 --> 01:10:38,769
We could have an ordinary conversation...

1410
01:10:38,869 --> 01:10:40,769
in a natural way.

1411
01:10:42,209 --> 01:10:44,709
It was nice. Also,

1412
01:10:44,909 --> 01:10:47,708
I felt comfortable and excited...

1413
01:10:47,709 --> 01:10:49,649
even without making an effort.

1414
01:10:51,419 --> 01:10:52,519
I felt...

1415
01:10:53,619 --> 01:10:54,819
such emotions.

1416
01:10:55,019 --> 01:10:56,188
- Afterward, - Yes?

1417
01:10:56,189 --> 01:10:58,459
You'll pour the solution in.

1418
01:10:58,889 --> 01:11:02,159
- All right. - You'll add 70g each.

1419
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:04,299
- Did you say 70g? - Yes.

1420
01:11:04,729 --> 01:11:06,489
- We're adding a lot. - You're adding a lot.

1421
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:10,799
(Squeezing out)

1422
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:15,009
It isn't coming out.

1423
01:11:15,409 --> 01:11:17,679
- I didn't open the lid. - Please open the lid.

1424
01:11:18,909 --> 01:11:22,449
I see that you have a funny side.

1425
01:11:23,019 --> 01:11:25,449
(Embarrassed)

1426
01:11:29,559 --> 01:11:32,029
- It's peaceful, right? - Yes.

1427
01:11:33,559 --> 01:11:35,098
Do you like flowers?

1428
01:11:35,099 --> 01:11:36,159
- Flowers? - Yes.

1429
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,769
I don't know much about them.

1430
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:40,528
But I'm positive about them.

1431
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:41,999
It's nice to look at them.

1432
01:11:42,869 --> 01:11:44,398
- Do you like flowers? - Flowers?

1433
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:46,769
- Yes. - We make frequent purchases...

1434
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:49,239
of large quantities of flowers.

1435
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:53,608
For your home? For the shrine?

1436
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:54,879
- Yes. - Is that right?

1437
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:58,119
There are many divine spirits. You can't even count all of them.

1438
01:11:58,749 --> 01:12:01,189
Since we can't make a shrine for each one of them,

1439
01:12:01,559 --> 01:12:04,118
we buy a lot of flowers and contribute them.

1440
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:06,689
Then they sit on every petal.

1441
01:12:07,159 --> 01:12:10,198
That's why we buy flowers each season.

1442
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:11,919
(Flowers are very meaningful to Yu Gyeong.)

1443
01:12:12,599 --> 01:12:13,668
That's right.

1444
01:12:13,669 --> 01:12:17,899
- You are affected by a place. - Yes.

1445
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:21,509
So I think it's nice to decorate it with flowers.

1446
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:24,439
Saju readers often say,

1447
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:26,778
"Grow a plant if there aren't any trees."

1448
01:12:26,779 --> 01:12:28,878
- I see. - "Grow a living thing."

1449
01:12:28,879 --> 01:12:30,719
- "Get a pet." - I see.

1450
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:33,449
I have no talent for keeping plants.

1451
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:37,489
Even cacti die under my care.

1452
01:12:37,759 --> 01:12:39,958
So I thought, "I shouldn't keep any plants."

1453
01:12:39,959 --> 01:12:42,279
(The two of them get to know each other in a natural way.)

1454
01:12:42,329 --> 01:12:43,428
This is fun.

1455
01:12:43,429 --> 01:12:44,789
- Let me pick another one. - Okay.

1456
01:12:44,829 --> 01:12:46,699
- You shuffle them this time. - Okay.

1457
01:12:46,969 --> 01:12:51,439
(A tarot reading has begun.)

1458
01:12:53,139 --> 01:12:54,568
Since there are tarot cards,

1459
01:12:54,569 --> 01:12:56,478
I feel like I should spread my fan as well.

1460
01:12:56,479 --> 01:12:57,739
- I'll bring my fan. - No way.

1461
01:12:59,179 --> 01:13:00,279
I'm nervous.

1462
01:13:01,449 --> 01:13:04,919
(A meeting between tarot cards and a fan?)

1463
01:13:07,619 --> 01:13:08,919
(My goodness)

1464
01:13:10,389 --> 01:13:12,559
(Nervous)

1465
01:13:19,569 --> 01:13:21,839
(It's her first time seeing Ho Am's fan.)

1466
01:13:25,809 --> 01:13:28,309
- Yu Ra, spread the cards. - Okay.

1467
01:13:28,509 --> 01:13:29,779
I'll spread the fan.

1468
01:13:31,609 --> 01:13:32,709
Okay.

1469
01:13:36,949 --> 01:13:41,689
(Under the warm sunlight, )

1470
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:48,399
(the two of them spread out their fortune-telling tools.)

1471
01:13:55,899 --> 01:14:01,609
(The cards and the fan face each other.)

1472
01:14:03,109 --> 01:14:04,238
(Getting goosebumps)

1473
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:07,978
It's such a fascinating scene.

1474
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:09,018
It's a mysterious scene.

1475
01:14:09,019 --> 01:14:12,448
It's a scene you can't see in other dating shows.

1476
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:14,449
I don't know what I'm witnessing.

1477
01:14:15,559 --> 01:14:17,359
- Looks like they're playing cards. - I know.

1478
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:18,789
(Fascinated)

1479
01:14:19,459 --> 01:14:23,228
(Yu Ra awaits Ho Am's question.)

1480
01:14:23,229 --> 01:14:24,698
(Thinking)

1481
01:14:24,699 --> 01:14:25,799
The question.

1482
01:14:34,669 --> 01:14:36,439
Can I ask a question like this?

1483
01:14:37,939 --> 01:14:42,079
"Shall I continue on with my original decision?"

1484
01:14:42,949 --> 01:14:44,749
- Can I ask that question? - Yes.

1485
01:14:45,289 --> 01:14:46,749
Please give me a reading for that.

1486
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:55,659
(Shall I continue on with my original decision?)

1487
01:14:59,229 --> 01:15:05,709
(Yu Ra picks cards for Ho Am.)

1488
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:10,909
(Grinning)

1489
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:13,179
(Nervous)

1490
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:17,749
(Ho Am picks up the five-element flags.)

1491
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:26,728
(Ho Am's five-element flags...)

1492
01:15:26,729 --> 01:15:28,599
(and Yu Ra's cards)

1493
01:15:33,799 --> 01:15:38,069
(What will be the answer to Ho Am's question?)

1494
01:15:40,609 --> 01:15:41,839
How are the cards?

1495
01:15:42,879 --> 01:15:43,879
(Ho Am asks for the meaning of the cards.)

1496
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:44,978
The cards...

1497
01:15:44,979 --> 01:15:46,749
(Ho Am asks for the meaning of the cards.)

1498
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:50,049
(Nervous)

1499
01:15:52,349 --> 01:15:54,149
- What does this card mean? - Absence.

1500
01:15:54,589 --> 01:15:55,619
Absence of emotions?

1501
01:15:58,059 --> 01:16:01,059
(Staring)

1502
01:16:03,129 --> 01:16:05,669
It's the beggar card.

1503
01:16:06,099 --> 01:16:07,169
- The beggar card? - Yes.

1504
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:09,598
This man looks like me.

1505
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,998
(Ho Am?)

1506
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:12,009
What?

1507
01:16:12,669 --> 01:16:13,669
A beggar?

1508
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:15,038
(Why did he get such a card?)

1509
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:16,039
What's that?

1510
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:19,278
Did he come to have the mind of a beggar?

1511
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:21,085
(Did Ho Am come to have the mind of a beggar?)

1512
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:25,719
(The beggar card makes him feel a bit troubled.)

1513
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:31,159
Charging forward won't be beneficial.

1514
01:16:32,059 --> 01:16:34,088
I think it'll be better to watch for a bit longer.

1515
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:35,729
- I should watch for a bit longer. - Yes.

1516
01:16:38,529 --> 01:16:40,099
Still...

1517
01:16:42,039 --> 01:16:43,838
While it might be hard for you emotionally,

1518
01:16:43,839 --> 01:16:45,869
a new phrase could begin.

1519
01:16:49,539 --> 01:16:51,239
There might be a turning point.

1520
01:16:55,049 --> 01:16:57,249
My reading told me...

1521
01:17:03,389 --> 01:17:05,865
that it might be different from the divine spirit's intention.

1522
01:17:05,889 --> 01:17:07,089
The divine spirit's intention?

1523
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:09,858
It might get twisted. My reading told me that.

1524
01:17:09,859 --> 01:17:11,699
(It might get twisted.)

1525
01:17:15,869 --> 01:17:18,839
Originally, the tarot cards and I Ching cylinder told me...

1526
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:22,779
that everything was nice and the results would be favourable.

1527
01:17:23,809 --> 01:17:25,808
But as I began to have worries,

1528
01:17:25,809 --> 01:17:27,179
the readings...

1529
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:30,078
changed completely. It's fascinating.

1530
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:31,759
- It has only been a day or two. - I know.

1531
01:17:32,549 --> 01:17:35,758
(Ho Am's reading has changed from the beginning.)

1532
01:17:35,759 --> 01:17:37,079
The tarot card reading told me...

1533
01:17:38,019 --> 01:17:39,259
that there would be a twist...

1534
01:17:40,259 --> 01:17:43,759
and a change. I picked the cards with such meanings.

1535
01:17:45,469 --> 01:17:47,868
I thought, "I'm full of certainty."

1536
01:17:47,869 --> 01:17:49,769
"How will I change?"

1537
01:17:50,969 --> 01:17:51,969
However,

1538
01:17:53,939 --> 01:17:57,038
my emotions fluctuated a lot...

1539
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:59,079
in a single day.

1540
01:18:06,619 --> 01:18:11,319
(What kind of a turning point will Ho Am welcome?)

1541
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:16,399
Yu Ra gave him a reading that was warmer and more consoling...

1542
01:18:16,429 --> 01:18:19,599
than what the cards expressed.

1543
01:18:19,969 --> 01:18:22,138
I guess the cards are worse than she made them out to be.

1544
01:18:22,139 --> 01:18:24,269
They could be interpreted that way.

1545
01:18:24,469 --> 01:18:27,468
She sugarcoated the meaning as a new beginning.

1546
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:28,708
The reading was heartwarming.

1547
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:29,709
- That's right. - Yes.

1548
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:31,778
The cards looked very serious.

1549
01:18:31,779 --> 01:18:33,248
- Yes. - There was a stabbed person.

1550
01:18:33,249 --> 01:18:35,979
- The beggar card. - The card showed a dozen swords...

1551
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:37,648
- stabbing a person. - "A new beginning will come."

1552
01:18:37,649 --> 01:18:39,889
- Seriously. - Will his feelings get hurt?

1553
01:18:39,989 --> 01:18:41,189
She put it nicely.

1554
01:18:48,499 --> 01:18:49,499
Thank you.

1555
01:18:50,629 --> 01:18:51,699
It helped a lot.

1556
01:18:52,999 --> 01:18:57,739
(Yu Ra's tarot card reading consoled Ho Am.)

1557
01:18:59,309 --> 01:19:02,009
(Meanwhile...)

1558
01:19:03,509 --> 01:19:05,109
- To one side? - Yes.

1559
01:19:05,709 --> 01:19:06,908
Pour it in.

1560
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,749
- It's pretty. - Yes.

1561
01:19:12,049 --> 01:19:13,049
I'm done.

1562
01:19:14,589 --> 01:19:16,759
- Gosh, it's pretty. - I'm done.

1563
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:20,128
You're very artistic.

1564
01:19:20,129 --> 01:19:21,805
(Byeong Yeol's candle holder is effortless and delicate.)

1565
01:19:21,829 --> 01:19:23,459
- I think it came out well. - Yes.

1566
01:19:25,229 --> 01:19:27,669
(Yu Gyeong's candle holder is colourful.)

1567
01:19:28,669 --> 01:19:31,699
(It's time to light up the candles.)

1568
01:19:32,039 --> 01:19:33,999
- I bet you do this a lot. Right? - That's right.

1569
01:19:34,309 --> 01:19:36,579
We put out candles with our hands.

1570
01:19:37,879 --> 01:19:39,849
We have no fear of fire.

1571
01:19:41,609 --> 01:19:43,318
(Excited)

1572
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:45,348
A bit to the side.

1573
01:19:45,349 --> 01:19:46,489
(Nervous)

1574
01:19:52,029 --> 01:19:53,129
(Blowing out)

1575
01:19:55,159 --> 01:19:56,528
You burned it.

1576
01:19:56,529 --> 01:19:58,049
(He burned Yu Gyeong's candle holder.)

1577
01:19:58,569 --> 01:20:00,329
- You burned it. - What should I do?

1578
01:20:01,699 --> 01:20:03,269
(Laughing)

1579
01:20:03,769 --> 01:20:04,799
That was funny.

1580
01:20:06,509 --> 01:20:08,369
Was it that funny?

1581
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:13,008
- She definitely likes him. - Yes.

1582
01:20:13,009 --> 01:20:14,249
She likes him.

1583
01:20:14,549 --> 01:20:18,818
Yu Gyeong is more suited for a leading role.

1584
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:20,259
- It seems that way. - That's right.

1585
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:23,219
(Burning)

1586
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:25,728
It's pretty.

1587
01:20:25,729 --> 01:20:28,010
(He succeeds in lighting it up again after much trouble.)

1588
01:20:28,359 --> 01:20:29,359
Is your hand okay?

1589
01:20:30,229 --> 01:20:31,229
They're pretty.

1590
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:32,768
(The date at a candle-making studio ends with a big laughter.)

1591
01:20:32,769 --> 01:20:34,869
- Let's go and eat. - That sounds nice.

1592
01:20:35,839 --> 01:20:38,439
(The hour is late.)

1593
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:40,708
We talked about it earlier.

1594
01:20:40,709 --> 01:20:42,508
- What? - Liking someone who is different...

1595
01:20:42,509 --> 01:20:43,509
from you.

1596
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:47,749
That's right. I really like someone who is different from me.

1597
01:20:49,479 --> 01:20:50,648
(Staring)

1598
01:20:50,649 --> 01:20:52,619
It's exactly as I put it earlier.

1599
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:55,049
(Glancing over)

1600
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:00,029
There may be conflicts,

1601
01:21:00,229 --> 01:21:01,629
but...

1602
01:21:04,899 --> 01:21:07,169
What is it?

1603
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:10,899
It just seemed like...

1604
01:21:11,969 --> 01:21:14,038
- What? - you were a bit shy.

1605
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:16,109
- Just now? - You couldn't meet my eyes.

1606
01:21:16,409 --> 01:21:18,378
I stared because I wondered if you were someone...

1607
01:21:18,379 --> 01:21:19,819
who found eye contact uncomfortable.

1608
01:21:22,819 --> 01:21:24,119
(Blinking)

1609
01:21:25,249 --> 01:21:26,249
You're blinking.

1610
01:21:27,589 --> 01:21:28,988
I think I'm a bit like that.

1611
01:21:28,989 --> 01:21:29,989
Why?

1612
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:32,958
Do you dislike...

1613
01:21:32,959 --> 01:21:33,999
- eye contact? - You know,

1614
01:21:34,929 --> 01:21:35,929
it's like this.

1615
01:21:37,929 --> 01:21:41,028
I mean, we have something between us.

1616
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:42,999
So, it's a bit like...

1617
01:21:44,999 --> 01:21:46,039
You have a cute side.

1618
01:21:46,139 --> 01:21:47,139
- Is that so? - Yes.

1619
01:21:48,209 --> 01:21:49,709
- But... - Was that too much?

1620
01:21:49,809 --> 01:21:51,008
No.

1621
01:21:51,009 --> 01:21:52,009
Your eyes...

1622
01:21:53,179 --> 01:21:57,079
The... The cutest person called me cute, so...

1623
01:21:57,419 --> 01:21:58,479
Thank you.

1624
01:21:59,389 --> 01:22:00,689
(Satisfied)

1625
01:22:00,989 --> 01:22:01,989
What was that?

1626
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:03,359
That was nice.

1627
01:22:04,059 --> 01:22:05,459
That stutter was the key.

1628
01:22:06,529 --> 01:22:09,099
"The... The cutest person..."

1629
01:22:09,829 --> 01:22:11,159
(That's so funny.)

1630
01:22:11,499 --> 01:22:14,428
Yu Gyeong is so happy. I don't know what to do.

1631
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:15,468
She forgot about Ho Am.

1632
01:22:15,469 --> 01:22:17,368
She didn't have a single thought about Ho Am.

1633
01:22:17,369 --> 01:22:19,168
You know, I didn't think about Ho Am either.

1634
01:22:19,169 --> 01:22:20,169
Seriously.

1635
01:22:21,939 --> 01:22:25,248
It was fun. Candle-making was so much fun.

1636
01:22:25,249 --> 01:22:27,249
- That's right. - I had so much fun.

1637
01:22:27,579 --> 01:22:29,019
There were my favourite flowers.

1638
01:22:29,619 --> 01:22:30,919
The fragrance was strong.

1639
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:34,089
I was with someone I was curious about.

1640
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:35,988
- The trinity. - It was the perfect combination.

1641
01:22:35,989 --> 01:22:38,189
Yes, it was perfect. I had so much fun.

1642
01:22:39,089 --> 01:22:41,029
- How was it for you? - I had the same thought.

1643
01:22:42,699 --> 01:22:43,899
It was exactly as you said.

1644
01:22:46,999 --> 01:22:48,169
(Glancing over)

1645
01:22:48,369 --> 01:22:50,539
What? I'm serious.

1646
01:22:52,409 --> 01:22:56,278
I told you that I was curious about you, Yu Gyeong.

1647
01:22:56,279 --> 01:22:57,279
Yes.

1648
01:22:57,509 --> 01:22:59,309
So talking about various things...

1649
01:22:59,709 --> 01:23:01,678
and doing an activity...

1650
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:04,049
with someone I was curious about were nice.

1651
01:23:04,849 --> 01:23:08,588
Yu Gyeong seems like someone...

1652
01:23:08,589 --> 01:23:12,959
who speaks what's in her heart.

1653
01:23:14,189 --> 01:23:15,899
We might be a good match.

1654
01:23:18,769 --> 01:23:19,769
It was...

1655
01:23:21,569 --> 01:23:23,939
an emotion I haven't felt before.

1656
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:27,769
I tend to be honest when it comes to my emotions.

1657
01:23:28,339 --> 01:23:31,779
I make positive expressions without holding back.

1658
01:23:32,309 --> 01:23:33,608
So I wanted to tell him,

1659
01:23:33,609 --> 01:23:35,379
"I like you."

1660
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:39,349
How is it now?

1661
01:23:40,219 --> 01:23:44,959
Are you getting closer to calling the two of us "we?"

1662
01:23:49,993 --> 01:23:52,323
(Curious)

1663
01:23:53,023 --> 01:23:54,892
Can I give you my answer...

1664
01:23:54,893 --> 01:23:57,433
- on our way back to the house? - Sure.

1665
01:23:58,603 --> 01:24:00,362
Do you need to think about it for a bit longer?

1666
01:24:00,363 --> 01:24:02,032
It isn't like that.

1667
01:24:02,033 --> 01:24:03,279
(Byeong Yeol put off his answer.)

1668
01:24:03,303 --> 01:24:04,303
It's just that...

1669
01:24:05,403 --> 01:24:07,603
I want to tell you then.

1670
01:24:08,873 --> 01:24:09,943
- Okay. - All right.

1671
01:24:10,773 --> 01:24:12,313
(Troubled)

1672
01:24:13,713 --> 01:24:16,353
- You think that I drew a line. - Yes.

1673
01:24:19,523 --> 01:24:24,023
(What will be Byeong Yeol's answer after the date?)

1674
01:24:24,123 --> 01:24:25,192
Let's take a seat.

1675
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:26,193
Okay.

1676
01:24:26,194 --> 01:24:28,633
(Kyung Eon and Sang Hyeok arrive at the location.)

1677
01:24:28,933 --> 01:24:30,532
You'll begin making it now.

1678
01:24:30,533 --> 01:24:32,262
- So please put on an apron. - What is it?

1679
01:24:32,263 --> 01:24:33,462
You'll make traditional liquor.

1680
01:24:33,463 --> 01:24:35,473
- I see. Traditional liquor? - Yes.

1681
01:24:35,673 --> 01:24:37,233
(Embarrassed)

1682
01:24:37,703 --> 01:24:38,773
That's incredible.

1683
01:24:41,503 --> 01:24:43,642
This is a traditional liquor distillery.

1684
01:24:43,643 --> 01:24:46,583
You will experience making makgeolli.

1685
01:24:47,643 --> 01:24:51,622
(Fruit makgeolli-making)

1686
01:24:49,919 --> 01:24:54,629
(Are you getting closer to calling the two of us "we?")

1687
01:24:51,623 --> 01:24:54,052
I don't enjoy drinking,

1688
01:24:54,053 --> 01:24:57,492
but I'm interested in traditional liquor.

1689
01:24:57,493 --> 01:24:59,593
I was curious about the making process.

1690
01:25:01,633 --> 01:25:02,633
What?

1691
01:25:02,893 --> 01:25:03,963
Is this right?

1692
01:25:04,293 --> 01:25:05,732
(Struggling)

1693
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:07,563
Use the ones back here.

1694
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:09,333
Right.

1695
01:25:09,833 --> 01:25:11,902
- Should I help you? - Please help me.

1696
01:25:11,903 --> 01:25:13,843
- Hold on. - I'm lost.

1697
01:25:14,073 --> 01:25:16,242
- Should I pull it all the way up? - Yes.

1698
01:25:16,243 --> 01:25:18,883
(Kyung Eon helps Sang Hyeok put his apron on.)

1699
01:25:20,443 --> 01:25:21,713
Both sides are pulled.

1700
01:25:23,813 --> 01:25:25,752
It's not too tight, is it?

1701
01:25:25,753 --> 01:25:26,783
- It's fine. - Okay.

1702
01:25:28,693 --> 01:25:30,352
- Done. - Should I help you?

1703
01:25:30,353 --> 01:25:32,022
- No. I've already put it on. - Is it okay?

1704
01:25:32,023 --> 01:25:33,903
- I put it on right away. - You put it on well.

1705
01:25:35,233 --> 01:25:36,593
- I should keep this off. - Right.

1706
01:25:37,933 --> 01:25:40,232
Rice steamed for making wine...

1707
01:25:40,233 --> 01:25:42,533
is called hard-steamed rice. You have to spread it out.

1708
01:25:43,003 --> 01:25:45,072
- It cools down quickly. - Has it cooled down?

1709
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:46,143
Right?

1710
01:25:47,243 --> 01:25:48,803
- This part is slightly... - Is it hot?

1711
01:25:48,973 --> 01:25:50,743
You can still feel its warmth.

1712
01:25:52,043 --> 01:25:53,343
This part is a bit cold.

1713
01:25:53,713 --> 01:25:54,713
Am I wrong?

1714
01:25:55,413 --> 01:25:56,653
(Finding her to be cute)

1715
01:25:56,953 --> 01:25:58,553
Do you like making things?

1716
01:25:59,083 --> 01:26:00,222
- Me? - Yes.

1717
01:26:00,223 --> 01:26:03,022
- This was the last thing I made. - Yes?

1718
01:26:03,023 --> 01:26:04,493
- I did a temple stay... - Right.

1719
01:26:04,923 --> 01:26:06,062
And made a scarf...

1720
01:26:06,063 --> 01:26:08,023
- with natural colouring. - I see.

1721
01:26:09,593 --> 01:26:13,003
A temple stay? I wanted to try doing a temple stay too.

1722
01:26:13,803 --> 01:26:16,003
I went to Tongdo Temple recently.

1723
01:26:16,473 --> 01:26:19,843
- Hold on. I've heard of that place. - It's in Yangsan, Ulsan.

1724
01:26:20,073 --> 01:26:22,372
Right. It's a really old temple, right?

1725
01:26:22,373 --> 01:26:24,072
- It's old and very big. - Right.

1726
01:26:24,073 --> 01:26:26,083
The tiles there...

1727
01:26:26,743 --> 01:26:28,552
- are really old, right? - Yes.

1728
01:26:28,553 --> 01:26:30,213
- It's huge there. - Right.

1729
01:26:30,553 --> 01:26:31,753
I've been there.

1730
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:33,683
(Peeking)

1731
01:26:33,883 --> 01:26:36,523
(Sang Hyeok spots her prayer bead bracelet.)

1732
01:26:37,453 --> 01:26:38,493
Are you a temple-goer?

1733
01:26:38,723 --> 01:26:42,192
I'm not actually a Buddhist.

1734
01:26:42,193 --> 01:26:43,433
Did you get it as a gift?

1735
01:26:43,493 --> 01:26:45,162
- I got it because it was pretty. - I see.

1736
01:26:45,163 --> 01:26:46,362
Which temple did you get it from?

1737
01:26:46,363 --> 01:26:48,203
I got this in Busan.

1738
01:26:49,133 --> 01:26:50,233
Yonggung Temple?

1739
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:52,403
- You're right. - I see.

1740
01:26:53,473 --> 01:26:55,342
Yonggung Temple is the one on a cliff, right?

1741
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:57,912
- Right. - It's by the sea.

1742
01:26:57,913 --> 01:26:59,783
- You're right. - I've been there too.

1743
01:27:00,743 --> 01:27:03,953
I looked around, and my sister and I both got one.

1744
01:27:04,213 --> 01:27:06,252
- You have two bracelets, though. - Oh, this one.

1745
01:27:06,253 --> 01:27:08,422
(Another bracelet that Kyung Eon has on)

1746
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:10,253
- It's from Yongju Temple. - Yongju Temple?

1747
01:27:10,593 --> 01:27:11,873
You've been to a lot of temples.

1748
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:14,163
- Well... - Aren't you a Buddhist?

1749
01:27:14,293 --> 01:27:16,962
It found it pretty in a cafe.

1750
01:27:16,963 --> 01:27:18,932
- It's sold in a cafe? - They sold it there.

1751
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:20,063
Isn't it really pretty?

1752
01:27:20,233 --> 01:27:21,772
- The one in the back? - Yes.

1753
01:27:21,773 --> 01:27:23,213
- They look like gemstones. - Right.

1754
01:27:24,733 --> 01:27:27,873
(They found a similar hobby as soon as they met.)

1755
01:27:28,713 --> 01:27:30,913
You're doing well. You're doing well, Sang Hyeok.

1756
01:27:32,543 --> 01:27:34,383
- They're getting along well. - Right.

1757
01:27:34,613 --> 01:27:36,312
- They look natural together. - Right.

1758
01:27:36,313 --> 01:27:37,552
They look comfortable, natural,

1759
01:27:37,553 --> 01:27:39,022
- and impressive together. - Right.

1760
01:27:39,023 --> 01:27:42,722
Talking about temples could be something hard to talk about...

1761
01:27:42,723 --> 01:27:44,492
- if there's no interest. - Right.

1762
01:27:44,493 --> 01:27:46,522
With these moments,

1763
01:27:46,523 --> 01:27:49,593
I think they will be slightly more interested in each other.

1764
01:27:49,693 --> 01:27:51,133
- They look really natural. - Right.

1765
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:55,703
It felt like he was serious about that culture.

1766
01:27:55,973 --> 01:27:57,613
That was why it was fun to talk with him.

1767
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:01,302
I thought that he would be quite flashy.

1768
01:28:01,303 --> 01:28:05,242
He was different from what I expected,

1769
01:28:05,243 --> 01:28:07,142
and that was interesting to me.

1770
01:28:07,143 --> 01:28:09,753
I didn't know much about her, but I got excited about her.

1771
01:28:10,213 --> 01:28:13,252
I was excited to learn about what kind of person she was.

1772
01:28:13,253 --> 01:28:17,823
I thought that it would be fun to get to know her.

1773
01:28:18,893 --> 01:28:20,163
This must taste really good.

1774
01:28:20,323 --> 01:28:22,263
- Right? - It'll be made with our own hands.

1775
01:28:23,863 --> 01:28:25,332
It smells really nice.

1776
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:27,932
Right. It's mixed with the scent of tangerines.

1777
01:28:27,933 --> 01:28:29,333
(Pressing)

1778
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:32,972
But if you eat a lot of tangerines,

1779
01:28:32,973 --> 01:28:33,973
- your hands turn yellow. - Your hands turn yellow?
How do you know that?

1780
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:37,543
I saw it somewhere.

1781
01:28:37,743 --> 01:28:39,663
I was told that it makes your hands turn yellow.

1782
01:28:40,113 --> 01:28:41,912
My mother lives on Jeju Island.

1783
01:28:41,913 --> 01:28:43,552
- Really? - She says her hands turn yellow...

1784
01:28:43,553 --> 01:28:44,553
every winter.

1785
01:28:46,523 --> 01:28:49,422
Do you go to meet her often...

1786
01:28:49,423 --> 01:28:51,322
to travel around Jeju Island?

1787
01:28:51,323 --> 01:28:53,162
- No. - You don't?

1788
01:28:53,163 --> 01:28:56,663
- I go with my younger brother. - Right.

1789
01:28:57,163 --> 01:28:58,803
We go to experience different activities.

1790
01:28:58,903 --> 01:29:01,762
You must be able to go horseback riding often.

1791
01:29:01,763 --> 01:29:03,772
- No. - No?

1792
01:29:03,773 --> 01:29:06,172
Are you close to your younger brother?

1793
01:29:06,173 --> 01:29:07,873
- We are really close. - Really?

1794
01:29:07,943 --> 01:29:09,742
- Your younger brother? - Yes.

1795
01:29:09,743 --> 01:29:12,612
- I see. - We really love each other.

1796
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:13,943
- Really? - Yes.

1797
01:29:14,443 --> 01:29:16,053
- For our family, - Yes?

1798
01:29:16,483 --> 01:29:18,182
There are times when we meet and say goodbye.

1799
01:29:18,183 --> 01:29:20,483
- We all live apart from each other. - Right.

1800
01:29:21,223 --> 01:29:22,799
So you all feel a lot more affectionate.

1801
01:29:22,823 --> 01:29:25,263
- We always give each other hugs. - Really?

1802
01:29:27,463 --> 01:29:28,763
It's the same with my father.

1803
01:29:31,663 --> 01:29:33,502
I asked if he got along with his younger brother.

1804
01:29:33,503 --> 01:29:35,672
Me asking him that...

1805
01:29:35,673 --> 01:29:37,973
was a sign of interest toward him.

1806
01:29:39,003 --> 01:29:42,213
I also consider my family to be important.

1807
01:29:42,843 --> 01:29:47,443
I wished that he would think the same way as me.

1808
01:29:48,983 --> 01:29:51,143
He seemed to have a good relationship with his family.

1809
01:29:51,283 --> 01:29:53,622
That was the part...

1810
01:29:53,623 --> 01:29:56,593
that made me feel more interested in him.

1811
01:30:00,093 --> 01:30:02,992
There are a lot of people who consider that to be important.

1812
01:30:02,993 --> 01:30:05,603
She's slowly expressing her interest in him.

1813
01:30:06,133 --> 01:30:07,773
- They're getting along so well. - Right.

1814
01:30:08,233 --> 01:30:10,933
- That was a clear expression. - Right.

1815
01:30:13,003 --> 01:30:14,672
It will be poured on top.

1816
01:30:14,673 --> 01:30:17,743
(They can't miss out on trying the makgeolli.)

1817
01:30:21,443 --> 01:30:22,682
(Amazed)

1818
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:23,683
- Did you get it? - Yes.

1819
01:30:23,684 --> 01:30:24,964
It's a lot more than I expected.

1820
01:30:26,153 --> 01:30:27,353
Is this too much?

1821
01:30:27,553 --> 01:30:29,892
Just try it like that.

1822
01:30:29,893 --> 01:30:31,092
- You should clink your glasses. - Shall we clink our glasses?

1823
01:30:31,093 --> 01:30:32,123
Oh, right!

1824
01:30:32,563 --> 01:30:34,163
- You must've been in a hurry. - No.

1825
01:30:34,723 --> 01:30:36,063
It smells great.

1826
01:30:38,703 --> 01:30:39,703
(Amazed)

1827
01:30:41,133 --> 01:30:43,603
It tastes a bit like Milkis.

1828
01:30:45,073 --> 01:30:46,403
Gosh, it's delicious.

1829
01:30:50,013 --> 01:30:51,312
It's really smooth.

1830
01:30:51,313 --> 01:30:52,883
(Downing it without leaving any)

1831
01:30:53,683 --> 01:30:57,783
(Lastly, it's time to name the makgeolli.)

1832
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:00,583
(Writing)

1833
01:31:01,653 --> 01:31:02,852
You're not hesitant.

1834
01:31:02,853 --> 01:31:03,923
Right?

1835
01:31:04,693 --> 01:31:07,062
(Kyung Eon writes it right away while Sang Hyeok is hesitant.)

1836
01:31:07,063 --> 01:31:08,123
What should I call it?

1837
01:31:10,663 --> 01:31:14,903
(Sang Hyeok's two hands look lost.)

1838
01:31:15,533 --> 01:31:16,832
(Peeking)

1839
01:31:16,833 --> 01:31:20,143
It's easier when you choose a theme.

1840
01:31:21,543 --> 01:31:22,673
Do you have a nickname?

1841
01:31:24,443 --> 01:31:27,912
- "Eon" is uncommon in names. - Right.

1842
01:31:27,913 --> 01:31:30,513
So I get called "Eonion."

1843
01:31:31,553 --> 01:31:33,153
(Giggling)

1844
01:31:34,023 --> 01:31:35,153
"Kyung Eonion."

1845
01:31:37,223 --> 01:31:38,663
I get called that.

1846
01:31:39,063 --> 01:31:41,523
- Ms. Eoni? - Right.

1847
01:31:42,793 --> 01:31:45,133
All right. I'll call you Ms. Eoni from now on.

1848
01:31:50,273 --> 01:31:53,003
(Still thinking)

1849
01:31:54,143 --> 01:31:55,443
(Giggling)

1850
01:31:56,773 --> 01:32:00,313
(He moves his pen as he thinks of something.)

1851
01:32:01,883 --> 01:32:02,912
(Surprised)

1852
01:32:02,913 --> 01:32:03,983
I'm sorry.

1853
01:32:05,213 --> 01:32:07,852
(The name Kyung Eon came up with: Party Party)

1854
01:32:07,853 --> 01:32:09,322
(Happy Onion)

1855
01:32:09,323 --> 01:32:10,722
(The name Sang Hyeok came up with)

1856
01:32:10,723 --> 01:32:14,822
I said Happy Onion was my nickname.

1857
01:32:14,823 --> 01:32:17,562
He used that as the name.

1858
01:32:17,563 --> 01:32:20,463
That was when...

1859
01:32:21,133 --> 01:32:22,903
my heart fluttered a bit.

1860
01:32:24,433 --> 01:32:26,872
I was the one who decided the date,

1861
01:32:26,873 --> 01:32:28,602
but he did well to get along with me.

1862
01:32:28,603 --> 01:32:31,012
He was also very focused.

1863
01:32:31,013 --> 01:32:33,013
I felt grateful for that.

1864
01:32:34,413 --> 01:32:36,782
- I think the drink... - Yes?

1865
01:32:36,783 --> 01:32:38,583
- was stronger than I thought. - Really?

1866
01:32:39,823 --> 01:32:41,382
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

1867
01:32:41,383 --> 01:32:43,753
My face turned quite red.

1868
01:32:44,293 --> 01:32:45,763
- I think it's this place. - Right.

1869
01:32:48,963 --> 01:32:51,763
(The two have come for dinner.)

1870
01:32:53,503 --> 01:32:54,762
We have to mix it up?

1871
01:32:54,763 --> 01:32:55,772
(They will be having a Japanese iron griddle dish.)

1872
01:32:55,773 --> 01:32:56,873
Awesome.

1873
01:32:58,603 --> 01:32:59,773
Should I get some for you?

1874
01:33:00,373 --> 01:33:02,642
- Thank you. - A piece with the shrimp?

1875
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:04,442
No. I'll get it myself.

1876
01:33:04,443 --> 01:33:06,043
- Okay. - I'll get it.

1877
01:33:07,143 --> 01:33:08,752
I'll get the shrimp for you.

1878
01:33:08,753 --> 01:33:09,853
Thank you.

1879
01:33:10,013 --> 01:33:12,153
- The one with cheese. - Thank you.

1880
01:33:15,253 --> 01:33:16,653
(Eating)

1881
01:33:18,253 --> 01:33:20,093
(Satisfied)

1882
01:33:22,633 --> 01:33:23,663
Is it good?

1883
01:33:23,733 --> 01:33:25,803
(Expectant)

1884
01:33:26,103 --> 01:33:27,203
You're tasting it.

1885
01:33:28,363 --> 01:33:29,803
(Peeking)

1886
01:33:30,203 --> 01:33:32,303
Kyung Eon was on my right.

1887
01:33:33,273 --> 01:33:35,303
She looked very pretty from the side.

1888
01:33:35,573 --> 01:33:37,143
I really liked that about her.

1889
01:33:38,273 --> 01:33:40,212
You never want to sleep late?

1890
01:33:40,213 --> 01:33:41,343
I sleep early.

1891
01:33:41,983 --> 01:33:43,143
I sleep early no matter what.

1892
01:33:44,083 --> 01:33:46,523
Oh, no. I shouldn't be laughing about this.

1893
01:33:46,683 --> 01:33:48,653
- It got much better, though. - Really?

1894
01:33:53,863 --> 01:33:56,062
Since when have you been a temple-goer?

1895
01:33:56,063 --> 01:33:57,593
Has it been around two years?

1896
01:33:58,593 --> 01:34:03,873
I didn't have any religious beliefs.

1897
01:34:04,173 --> 01:34:06,572
Right before I moved,

1898
01:34:06,573 --> 01:34:08,442
I used to be a Christian.

1899
01:34:08,443 --> 01:34:10,242
- Really? Did you change religions? - Yes.

1900
01:34:10,243 --> 01:34:12,243
It wasn't much of a change. I just went to church.

1901
01:34:13,113 --> 01:34:14,942
- You just went to church. - Right.

1902
01:34:14,943 --> 01:34:16,583
- I just went to the temple too. - I see.

1903
01:34:16,713 --> 01:34:20,753
Now, I'm an actual Buddhist...

1904
01:34:21,053 --> 01:34:22,523
and have been given a Buddhist name.

1905
01:34:22,893 --> 01:34:24,592
What about your parents?

1906
01:34:24,593 --> 01:34:26,123
My parents? My father is...

1907
01:34:26,723 --> 01:34:28,662
a Christian, along with my mother.

1908
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:31,063
- My goodness. - I always say this to my father.

1909
01:34:31,193 --> 01:34:35,433
"I'll get you a bracelet for a good cause."

1910
01:34:35,533 --> 01:34:37,172
But he refuses to receive it and gets frightened by it.

1911
01:34:37,173 --> 01:34:38,633
Because they were prayer beads.

1912
01:34:40,873 --> 01:34:44,513
I don't have strong religious beliefs,

1913
01:34:44,713 --> 01:34:48,013
but there are positives from each religion.

1914
01:34:48,143 --> 01:34:50,782
I like following those things.

1915
01:34:50,783 --> 01:34:53,182
I think they're called spousal prayers.

1916
01:34:53,183 --> 01:34:54,483
What are spousal prayers?

1917
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:59,093
I heard it's a prayer...

1918
01:34:59,393 --> 01:35:01,423
for a future spouse you will meet.

1919
01:35:01,693 --> 01:35:04,933
We get asked, "What is your ideal type?"

1920
01:35:05,163 --> 01:35:06,502
And the answers we give are obvious...

1921
01:35:06,503 --> 01:35:08,703
when the things you want from someone aren't organized.

1922
01:35:09,303 --> 01:35:11,732
"A tall person." It's that kind of answer.

1923
01:35:11,733 --> 01:35:14,543
But when you make that prayer,

1924
01:35:14,743 --> 01:35:16,972
I think it sets up an objective frame...

1925
01:35:16,973 --> 01:35:19,983
of the person I want to meet in the future.

1926
01:35:20,343 --> 01:35:23,452
It makes me find someone...

1927
01:35:23,453 --> 01:35:25,482
within those boundaries.

1928
01:35:25,483 --> 01:35:26,923
- So... - Did you find that person?

1929
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:29,293
Did you find that person?

1930
01:35:30,053 --> 01:35:32,693
Well, I haven't started with that prayer yet.

1931
01:35:33,063 --> 01:35:35,663
I'm planning to soon.

1932
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:37,363
I'll be starting soon.

1933
01:35:37,933 --> 01:35:40,002
- It's hard to find someone perfect. - Right.

1934
01:35:40,003 --> 01:35:43,732
It's hard to find someone perfect...

1935
01:35:43,733 --> 01:35:45,903
as I'm not a perfect person myself.

1936
01:35:46,903 --> 01:35:49,012
As I mentioned earlier,

1937
01:35:49,013 --> 01:35:51,473
there's someone you click with.

1938
01:35:51,813 --> 01:35:55,282
A small mistake could be seen as something cute.

1939
01:35:55,283 --> 01:35:57,513
When something is said,

1940
01:35:57,783 --> 01:36:00,923
there's a response right away.

1941
01:36:01,723 --> 01:36:05,253
I want to meet someone who is like that with me.

1942
01:36:08,893 --> 01:36:10,663
(Impressed)

1943
01:36:10,763 --> 01:36:13,033
- They look great together. - Right.

1944
01:36:13,163 --> 01:36:15,032
- Don't they look comfortable? - They look very comfortable.

1945
01:36:15,033 --> 01:36:16,373
- Nothing feels off. - Right.

1946
01:36:16,503 --> 01:36:18,972
Doesn't Kyung Eon seem smart?

1947
01:36:18,973 --> 01:36:21,443
She's calm and has leadership.

1948
01:36:21,543 --> 01:36:24,113
OWPNS. Do you know what that is?

1949
01:36:24,573 --> 01:36:25,759
- What? - Do you know what that is?

1950
01:36:25,783 --> 01:36:27,113
Of course, I do.

1951
01:36:27,883 --> 01:36:30,053
You should teach him as he might not know.

1952
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:33,183
I think you can teach him yourself.

1953
01:36:33,723 --> 01:36:35,993
"Open." That's not it?

1954
01:36:37,193 --> 01:36:38,922
"On one's own, well,"

1955
01:36:38,923 --> 01:36:41,263
- "perfectly, neatly, smartly." - Right.

1956
01:36:41,393 --> 01:36:42,732
OWPNS.

1957
01:36:42,733 --> 01:36:45,292
They both feel comfortable, and I think their hearts...

1958
01:36:45,293 --> 01:36:46,432
have silently connected with one another.

1959
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:47,502
Right.

1960
01:36:47,503 --> 01:36:49,932
It felt more natural and comfortable...

1961
01:36:49,933 --> 01:36:52,172
- than any other date. - It felt really nice.

1962
01:36:52,173 --> 01:36:53,273
Right.

1963
01:36:57,213 --> 01:36:59,143
- It was fun to talk. - Really?

1964
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:01,313
I really enjoyed the time we spent talking.

1965
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:03,183
Me too.

1966
01:37:04,153 --> 01:37:05,212
Thank you.

1967
01:37:05,213 --> 01:37:07,123
(The two are full of laughter until the end.)

1968
01:37:08,453 --> 01:37:10,133
It's been a while since I sat in the back.

1969
01:37:11,123 --> 01:37:12,823
I've usually been in the front these days.

1970
01:37:14,423 --> 01:37:16,432
Do you not get nervous easily...

1971
01:37:16,433 --> 01:37:19,532
or do you hide it when you feel nervous?

1972
01:37:19,533 --> 01:37:21,403
- I don't get nervous easily. - Really?

1973
01:37:21,963 --> 01:37:26,073
You were the only person who didn't seem surprised to see me.

1974
01:37:26,703 --> 01:37:28,673
- Everyone else... - Was that unexpected?

1975
01:37:29,913 --> 01:37:31,753
- Did you think I would get nervous? - Well...

1976
01:37:33,513 --> 01:37:36,183
When you walked toward me,

1977
01:37:37,253 --> 01:37:41,223
I thought that you gave a good impression.

1978
01:37:41,323 --> 01:37:42,393
When you looked at me,

1979
01:37:43,353 --> 01:37:44,992
it was like your eyes were saying,

1980
01:37:44,993 --> 01:37:47,022
- "Let's take a look." - Really?

1981
01:37:47,023 --> 01:37:48,123
Yes.

1982
01:37:50,893 --> 01:37:52,832
I do get that from time to time.

1983
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:56,703
But if I'm not curious or interested,

1984
01:37:56,733 --> 01:37:58,333
- I don't look. - Really?

1985
01:37:58,773 --> 01:38:00,602
I try to look at someone pretty.

1986
01:38:00,603 --> 01:38:01,743
My eyes would be like this.

1987
01:38:02,103 --> 01:38:04,372
Your eyes didn't look away.

1988
01:38:04,373 --> 01:38:07,183
(They first greeted each other with deep eye contact.)

1989
01:38:09,153 --> 01:38:11,653
I liked everything about her.

1990
01:38:11,853 --> 01:38:15,183
To be honest, before the date,

1991
01:38:15,453 --> 01:38:17,992
I was just curious about her as a person.

1992
01:38:17,993 --> 01:38:20,863
When Kyung Eon first came,

1993
01:38:21,163 --> 01:38:24,192
I just thought it was someone new.

1994
01:38:24,193 --> 01:38:26,763
I wasn't that surprised.

1995
01:38:27,303 --> 01:38:31,102
But after talking with her,

1996
01:38:31,103 --> 01:38:33,343
I felt her charms.

1997
01:38:33,773 --> 01:38:36,413
I also got attracted to her.

1998
01:38:37,113 --> 01:38:40,243
I didn't expect to feel this way after coming here.

1999
01:38:41,683 --> 01:38:45,083
It was fascinating that I experienced that.

2000
01:38:45,213 --> 01:38:46,453
It was great.

2001
01:38:47,653 --> 01:38:49,792
I tried to stay still.

2002
01:38:49,793 --> 01:38:50,952
(Will the two be able to make a new start together?)

2003
01:38:50,953 --> 01:38:53,423
That was why I waited for a while.

2004
01:38:58,633 --> 01:39:00,262
This is what I think.

2005
01:39:00,263 --> 01:39:02,873
I don't know Yu Gyeong that much,

2006
01:39:04,273 --> 01:39:08,343
but she feels a lot more mature...

2007
01:39:08,903 --> 01:39:10,442
than at the start.

2008
01:39:10,443 --> 01:39:11,673
- Who? - Yu Gyeong.

2009
01:39:11,773 --> 01:39:12,913
Yu Gyeong?

2010
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:17,152
After meeting her here,

2011
01:39:17,153 --> 01:39:19,623
she seems to be a lot better...

2012
01:39:19,883 --> 01:39:24,922
than other people her age.

2013
01:39:24,923 --> 01:39:27,363
She feels like a great person compared to others her age.

2014
01:39:28,123 --> 01:39:30,593
When I talk to her,

2015
01:39:31,093 --> 01:39:33,203
I think I can sense...

2016
01:39:33,833 --> 01:39:35,533
a bit of depth from her.

2017
01:39:35,973 --> 01:39:38,603
That is why it's exciting to talk with her.

2018
01:39:40,503 --> 01:39:44,872
(Possessed Love S2)

2019
01:39:44,873 --> 01:39:50,053
(Kyung Eon appears at the House.)

2020
01:39:50,213 --> 01:39:52,522
(But Byeong Yeol's ears are red.)

2021
01:39:52,523 --> 01:39:57,292
(A mysterious tension flows around the House.)

2022
01:39:57,293 --> 01:39:59,693
(We really click spiritually.)

2023
01:39:59,763 --> 01:40:01,403
(I think Byeong Yeol is the Gold Dragon.)

2024
01:40:02,763 --> 01:40:04,662
(That's cute.)

2025
01:40:04,663 --> 01:40:08,863
(It was a new emotion.)

2026
01:40:14,203 --> 01:40:15,273
What?

2027
01:40:15,543 --> 01:40:16,942
(I'm losing my mind.)

2028
01:40:16,943 --> 01:40:18,513
(I'm totally losing it.)

2029
