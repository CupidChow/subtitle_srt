1
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,779
(All statements related to shamanism and fortune-telling...)

2
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,089
(made by the cast in this program...)

3
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,150
(are purely personal opinions.)

4
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,360
(Prologue)

5
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,140
(Who is your destined partner?)

6
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,490
(Kim Yun Jeong)

7
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,190
(Possessed Love S2)

8
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,690
(They asked their divine spirits who their destined partners were.)

9
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,799
(They tell their own fate...)

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,870
(to find their other half.)

11
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,039
(It's time for the first impression selection.)

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,039
(They saw how they felt about each other from the start.)

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,069
(She stood out.)

14
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,070
(I wanted to go on a date with her.)

15
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,070
(I was drawn to her.)

16
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:26,080
(She caught my attention.)

17
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,009
(Hong Yu Ra, who has received the most votes,)

18
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,179
(may check one person's animal of the day.)

19
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,249
(Lucky her.)

20
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,149
(It was fun.)

21
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,219
(Ha Byeong Yeol, Jang Ho Am)

22
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,989
(Who is the first man to have his identity revealed?)

23
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,259
(Lee Gang Won, Jung Hyeon U)

24
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,360
(Yu Ra chooses Gang Won on Day 1.)

25
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,360
(Gang Won was a White Monkey.)

26
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:50,800
(The unpredictable maelstrom of fate begins.)

27
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,540
(The night of Day 1)

28
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,740
(Yu Ra returned after her choice in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

29
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,940
- Have you been here by yourself? - Yes.

30
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,880
- You're enjoying that sandwich. - Well, I'm hungry!

31
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,479
It's got a lot of stuff in it.

32
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,480
Eggs.

33
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,879
That looks tasty.

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,450
- Were you just coming back? - Yes.

35
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,720
(The 3 naturally gathered in 1 place.)

36
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,520
I wonder what the animal of the person I chose was.

37
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,859
- Don't you wonder? - I wonder who chose whom.

38
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,929
But we can't tell.

39
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,530
I checked one of their animals.

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,470
Oh, right! That's where you're coming from!

41
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,600
Oh, right. Did you check it?

42
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,200
It's so much fun.

43
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,809
- You could only check one of them? - Yes.

44
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,740
I put in the plaque of the person, and they gave it back.

45
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,040
- What his animal is? - Yes.

46
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,009
Oh, my.

47
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,710
It came out of Haetae's mouth.

48
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,050
That must have been so much fun.

49
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,060
I'm so jealous.

50
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,260
It was so fun.

51
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,060
I'm itching to tell.

52
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,730
I want to know!

53
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,469
Oh, it's cold.

54
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,569
(Ho Am joins them.)

55
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,730
Take a seat.

56
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,240
(Eating)

57
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,809
I always have to eat three meals.

58
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:07,940
- So do I. - Right.

59
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,050
But you're so skinny for someone who never skips a meal, Yu Gyeong.

60
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,350
I guess it's because I'm active.

61
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,950
Do you work out?

62
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,989
You don't?

63
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,019
- I don't like it. - Exercising?

64
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,420
Yes, I hate exercising.

65
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,629
Do you like to work out?

66
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,889
I used to.

67
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,330
Before I got this job.

68
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,100
Like what? Skating?

69
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,799
Try and guess. It's a type of sport.

70
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,900
- I see. - Really?

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,309
(His question triggered the fortune tellers' hunches.)

72
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,839
Did it require equipment or not?

73
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
It did.

74
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,949
Fencing!

75
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,110
How did you know?

76
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,850
Fencing.

77
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,150
(Startled)

78
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,919
(Proud)

79
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,250
(She saw right through a shaman.)

80
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
(Surprised)

81
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
(What?)

82
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:57,289
(What just happened?)

83
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,200
(Yu Ra guessed correctly in one attempt.)

84
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,500
How did she know? Fencing?

85
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,900
(I can't believe she did that.)

86
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,300
(Fencing!)

87
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:10,040
(How did you know?)

88
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,510
- How did she know? - I think Yu Ra is a shaman.

89
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,779
- I think she's a shaman. - I could see it.

90
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,180
- She must be a shaman. - Right.

91
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,410
- Really? - But it's a rare sport.

92
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,520
- I wonder how she knew. - So, you fenced.

93
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,989
It suits you, though.

94
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,090
It does.

95
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,620
This is...

96
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,360
(Yoo In Na, Actress)

97
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,659
Seriously.

98
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,759
(Gabee, Dancer)

99
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,030
The participants met for the first time last week.

100
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,569
There was a tremendous amount of tension,

101
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,899
and they tried their best to guess who was a shaman...

102
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,009
and who was a saju reader.

103
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,569
Today, we'll see who they text.

104
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,279
The show started with something that we were most curious about.

105
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,979
(The result of their feelings on Day 1)

106
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,549
- Let's check it out. - I get to see it first.

107
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,280
(Who will they have chosen?)

108
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,120
(Ho Am returned to his room.)

109
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:14,440
(Tonight, no one chose you in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

110
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,969
(Surprised)

111
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,040
No one?

112
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,379
- I'm shocked. - Hang on.

113
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,279
But he's been kind of lovey-dovey with Yu Gyeong.

114
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,549
- Right. - Yes.

115
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,580
- Then, who did she choose? - Right.

116
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,490
(Ho Am seems to feel complicated.)

117
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,300
No one chose me in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.

118
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,430
I was disappointed.

119
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,970
It didn't feel good.

120
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,570
It wasn't one specific person. I just felt...

121
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,540
upset.

122
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,269
(During the first impression selection)

123
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,040
(Ho Am gave Yu Ra his name plaque.)

124
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,520
(Yu Ra chose Ho Am back.)

125
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,749
- Do you want to make dessert? - Sorry?

126
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,320
- Do you want to make dessert? - Sure.

127
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,859
We can plate it nicely.

128
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,060
(And he'd been intimate with Yu Gyeong all evening.)

129
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,700
I don't think it's going the way I expected.

130
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,640
I got a text.

131
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,370
(Glancing)

132
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,910
(Tonight, no one chose you in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

133
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,780
- What is going on? Seriously? - What is this?

134
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,820
Ho Am didn't choose Yu Gyeong either?

135
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,359
(Ho Am and Yu Gyeong didn't pick each other.)

136
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,719
There were...

137
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,629
some behaviours and gestures of his...

138
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,100
that kept bothering me.

139
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,960
At first, I assumed I was mistaken.

140
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,340
I'll have to see how it goes once we get closer.

141
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,340
(Whose text was she waiting for?)

142
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,549
(Tonight, the Black Monkey chose you.)

143
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,350
The Black Monkey chose me.

144
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,989
Her only Day Master is Ren Water.

145
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,859
Of all the water types, it's the one with yang energy.

146
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,300
Seawater, for instance.

147
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,430
And the sea is normally deep.

148
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,200
The ones that I can't easily figure out are...

149
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,199
Yu Ra and Yu Gyeong.

150
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,610
They give me that impression.

151
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,279
(Who's the Black Monkey...)

152
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,410
(who's difficult to read, just like the deep sea?)

153
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,249
How was it today? Were you certain...

154
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,950
when you put the plaque into Haetae?

155
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,220
Me? Yes.

156
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,820
Without a doubt?

157
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,090
I doubted it for like three seconds.

158
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,300
You were pretty certain, then.

159
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,830
(Thinking hard)

160
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,200
What is it now? I'm scared.

161
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,309
What is it?

162
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,939
(Tonight, the Black Cow chose you.)

163
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,310
(Tonight, the White Monkey chose you.)

164
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,949
The White Monkey. That's him.

165
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,789
- Gang Won. - Yes, Gang Won.

166
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,819
And she got a text from the White Monkey.

167
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,990
I got chills.

168
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,229
That means someone else chose her. Who could it be?

169
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,689
- Who's the Black Cow? - This is so intriguing.

170
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,700
(Who's the Black Cow that also chose Ra Yun?)

171
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,140
(Ra Yun was chosen by two men.)

172
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,679
I don't think I'll be able to sleep.

173
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,709
You'll do well. Pardon?

174
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,779
- You can't sleep? - I don't think so.

175
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,650
- Why not? - I'm nervous.

176
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,680
I'm so nervous.

177
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,850
I don't know anymore.

178
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,889
I wanted to get a text from the White Monkey,

179
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,319
so I was startled when I got it.

180
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,420
I was like, "Who is it?"

181
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,130
And I was glad too.

182
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,130
(During the preselection)

183
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,230
What?

184
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,599
(Her divine spirit chose the White Monkey for her.)

185
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,710
Are you serious?

186
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,240
You can't be serious.

187
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,280
I think I felt the mysterious connection.

188
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,310
It's mysterious, but it's fine, and I'm all right with it.

189
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,319
Maybe, we'll have a good connection.

190
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,320
I had high hopes for that.

191
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,889
(Ra Yun chose the White Monkey as her destined partner.)

192
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,059
(White Monkey)

193
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,330
I'm sure there's a reason.

194
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,100
There has to be.

195
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,169
I'll go. Here.

196
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,770
(Gang Won chose Ra Yun in the first impression selection.)

197
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,410
(Ra Yun also chose Gang Won.)

198
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:53,520
(They also chose each other in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

199
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,620
How did this happen?

200
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,730
This is so nerve-racking.

201
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,209
(Tonight, the Blue Chicken chose you.)

202
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,110
(Tonight, the Black Horse chose you.)

203
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,989
(He was chosen by two women.)

204
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,990
I'm more flustered as I didn't predict this.

205
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,390
(During the preselection)

206
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,400
I assumed that the Red Rabbit was Ra Yun,

207
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,840
but it got even more confusing.

208
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,909
(Ra Yun chose Gang Won tonight.)

209
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,980
Good.

210
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,409
(The Blue Chicken and the Black Horse...)

211
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,249
(chose Gang Won tonight.)

212
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,250
(Black Horse)

213
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,120
Hold on. That's...

214
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,889
It was revealed last week.

215
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,460
- Yu Ra said... - Yes.

216
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,899
that she was interested in another man,

217
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,159
other than the two men who picked her.

218
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,170
She did.

219
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,729
So, those two are the ones.

220
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,170
- Ra Yun and Yu Ra. - Yu Ra?

221
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,739
(Ra Yun or Yu Ra...)

222
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,040
(may be the Blue Chicken or the Black Horse.)

223
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,440
(Tonight, the White Chicken chose you.)

224
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,150
I got a text saying that the White Chicken chose me.

225
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,790
I have a strong feeling that the White Chicken...

226
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,550
is Ho Am.

227
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,689
(Do you like to work out?)

228
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,690
(I used to.)

229
00:11:41,691 --> 00:11:43,360
(Before I got this job.)

230
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,059
(Yu Ra stared at Ho Am...)

231
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,930
(and guessed his past correctly right away.)

232
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,040
I was guessing that he had the Day Master of the White Chicken,

233
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,540
and White Chickens usually represent...

234
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,010
swords and metal in their saju.

235
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,910
So, it reminded me of fencing right away.

236
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,720
It was an educated guess based on fortune-telling.

237
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,920
If she guessed this correctly...

238
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,120
(Is Ho Am the White Chicken as Yu Ra guesses?)

239
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,860
That's fascinating.

240
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,570
(Tonight, the White Dog chose you.)

241
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,910
(Grinning)

242
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,579
It felt mysterious and wonderful.

243
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,780
And I was grateful.

244
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,850
I was really curious about her, to be frank.

245
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,890
Will it be the person I have in mind?

246
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,090
We actually...

247
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,990
exchanged our votes at first.

248
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,730
So, I suppose it's Yun Jeong.

249
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,799
(Is Yun Jeong the White Dog...)

250
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,569
(that chose Hyeon U?)

251
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,870
I have a lot on my mind.

252
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,910
(Tonight, the Blue Chicken chose you.)

253
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,390
I might feel a little sad.

254
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,490
Why?

255
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,290
- What? - Why?

256
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,690
What's the matter?

257
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,760
I won't cry, though.

258
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,700
I won't cry just yet.

259
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,170
It's too soon to cry.

260
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,970
- What? - What?

261
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,899
- Why? - Really?

262
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,709
(Yun Jeong feels sad after getting the Blue Chicken's text?)

263
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,680
Hold on. But that's...

264
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,180
(What does Yun Jeong mean?)

265
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,680
I won't cry, though.

266
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,650
I won't cry just yet.

267
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,120
It's too soon to cry.

268
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,290
It was totally unexpected.

269
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,190
I had a feeling...

270
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,300
that Hyeon U was the Gold Dragon.

271
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,270
If I was right,

272
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,470
I didn't get a message from the man I wanted.

273
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,870
Although I wouldn't be able to guess them all, I kept trying.

274
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,710
(During the preselection)

275
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,220
The Gold Dragon was...

276
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,520
the one that I said I'd been looking for.

277
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,260
He was a Leo.

278
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,600
He had the face of a model with a strong aura.

279
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,030
What?

280
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,400
(What are you talking about?)

281
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,840
Secrets.

282
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,010
It's one of the zodiac signs that get a lot of attention.

283
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,510
(I'll be gone.)

284
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,619
(He's gotten everyone's attention all day.)

285
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,349
(I don't know what it is,)

286
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:02,119
(but he keeps laughing at specific things by himself.)

287
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,760
(I found a lot of them cute.)

288
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,060
It is cute.

289
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,499
When he makes up his mind to get someone's attention,

290
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,769
he tends to look for his chance.

291
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,400
(Should we make aglio e olio by ourselves, then?)

292
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,940
(Give it a taste.)

293
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,879
His ascendant stretches over Scorpio,

294
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,010
so he gives off a strong decadent vibe.

295
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,180
If he really is a Leo,

296
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,919
I think it'll be...

297
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,290
smooth sailing. We'll feel so comfortable around each other.

298
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,160
(Hyeon U chose Yun Jeong in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

299
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,430
But then, I got a text from the Blue Chicken.

300
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,210
I was making all these assumptions,

301
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,980
then I reckoned that I might be absolutely wrong about everything.

302
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,680
(What's the animal of Hyeon U who chose Yun Jeong tonight?)

303
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,660
(Blue Chicken, Jung Hyeon U)

304
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,060
Oh, he was the Blue Chicken. Right.

305
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,730
She thought it was Hyeon U, but it wasn't.

306
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,229
Yun Jeong liked the Gold Dragon, right?

307
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,769
- Yes. - The Leo.

308
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,169
- Yes. - Yes, the Leo.

309
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,939
Yun Jeong must have been drawn to Hyeon U...

310
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,969
because she assumed he was the Gold Dragon.

311
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:22,999
From the get-go.

312
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,409
- She might change her mind... - Yes.

313
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,539
- as she realizes. - Yes, it'll get more confusing.

314
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,710
Right.

315
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,910
Who on earth is the Gold Dragon, then?

316
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,949
Then, who's the Gold Dragon?

317
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,080
Byeong Yeol?

318
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,380
Maybe it's Ho Am.

319
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,589
Goldie, when will you show yourself?

320
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,619
I can't wait to find out who you are.

321
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,650
"Goldie."

322
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,090
Totally. It's gone terribly wrong.

323
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,160
I think I stayed up...

324
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,700
until 3am or something.

325
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,370
(Tossing...)

326
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,600
(and turning)

327
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,940
(Sighing)

328
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,770
(Exclaiming)

329
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,540
It's...

330
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,150
(She takes another look at the men's natal chart.)

331
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,620
It's so difficult.

332
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,489
I was like, "Who are you?"

333
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,690
And I thought about what to do.

334
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,130
Also, I asked myself, "How do I feel about them?"

335
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,869
I covered myself with a comforter...

336
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,169
and meditated in secret...

337
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,300
while looking at the chart.

338
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,539
(Her head is in a jumble.)

339
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,780
I'm clueless.

340
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,250
(Getting up)

341
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,920
I couldn't make...

342
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,090
clear predictions with the chart.

343
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,160
I couldn't tell who had which chart.

344
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,160
It was so hard that I couldn't organize them.

345
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,300
I had a mental breakdown.

346
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,609
(Who's the Leo that she's desperately looking for?)

347
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,679
(Gold Dragon, August 20, 1992)

348
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,809
I can be sure only if the last man arrives.

349
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,250
(Gold Dragon, August 20, 1992)

350
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,620
(The last man to complete the puzzle of fate)

351
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,230
Who are you?

352
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
What?

353
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,670
I don't know anymore.

354
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,080
(Inhaling sharply)

355
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,990
It's so difficult.

356
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,240
(Sighing)

357
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:19,180
(The last veiled man arrived at the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

358
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,179
(Feeling dizzy)

359
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,220
Is he the Gold Dragon?

360
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,290
No way. Is he?

361
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,820
(The last man finally showed himself.)

362
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,320
How come he's so handsome?

363
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,430
He's good-looking.

364
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
He looks great.

365
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:37,800
He's so cute when he smiles.

366
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,170
So this is why it gets complicated.

367
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,339
I was wondering who it was among the four of them.

368
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,940
Even we're confused when we're watching from here.

369
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,449
But they're in the scene.

370
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,450
- Exactly! - Definitely.

371
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:54,949
- They'll go insane. - Right.

372
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,049
- Then, - This is incredible.

373
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,189
will she recognize him instantly...

374
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,159
- It's so interesting. - when she sees him?

375
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,559
- It's... - She might recognize him.

376
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,630
- I know, right? Maybe she will. - She might.

377
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,459
- Come on in. - Come in.

378
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,530
- Yun Jeong is waiting for you. - The Goldie.

379
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,470
(Their first morning at the Possessed House)

380
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,940
I was going to microwave instant rice and grill Spam.

381
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,339
That's not a bad idea.

382
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,339
I was going to microwave instant rice and grill Spam.

383
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,010
But I'm the only one who eats instant rice here.

384
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,849
How about the three of us share it?

385
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,079
Should we?

386
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,920
I think I'll be able to eat if there are other people.

387
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,489
Maybe they'll come and eat if the house smells like Spam.

388
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,920
Should we start marketing our breakfast?

389
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,420
You've been wanting to eat Spam since yesterday.

390
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,890
It seems tasty.

391
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:37,890
You should eat it, then. Let's eat.

392
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,960
Shall we?

393
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:41,830
I think I feel sick now that everyone's here.

394
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,629
Why?

395
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,630
I'm not sure.

396
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,370
I won't go down.

397
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,039
(Startled)

398
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
Oh, my gosh.

399
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,440
- Gosh. - What's going on now?

400
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,380
Your first dates will be held today.

401
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,350
Oh, my gosh.

402
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,980
The women will now come to the Pavilion of Connections.

403
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,020
(Flustered)

404
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,160
Awesome.

405
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,730
Finally!

406
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,590
Let's go!

407
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,130
I haven't heard the name, Pavilion of Connections, in so long.

408
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,230
I wonder how they'll choose this time.

409
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,570
Let's go.

410
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,070
I'm so nervous. What do you think we'll do?

411
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,609
Which way is the Pavilion of Connections?

412
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,610
That way.

413
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:31,710
(Pavilion of Connections)

414
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,819
(Their first dates will be decided here,)

415
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,620
(where they foretell their fate with their partners.)

416
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,720
(The exciting first date!)

417
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,220
Wait.

418
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,360
It says something.

419
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,930
There's a card.

420
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,929
"Our dates will be determined..."

421
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,770
"once we choose an object that draws our hearts."

422
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,640
It's just like how you...

423
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,740
choose a person's belongings in a group blind date.

424
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,910
- But the hints from last night... - Right.

425
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,510
- What's this? - It's a cat toy.

426
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,180
It's for cats?

427
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,610
- It is. - A bronze medal.

428
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,710
I wonder what it is.

429
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:08,649
(Book)

430
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,350
(Photos)

431
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:15,620
(Which objects will they choose?)

432
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,660
I wonder what it is.

433
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,600
(No one seems to step up.)

434
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,540
(In the meantime)

435
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,740
Sitting here like this,

436
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,049
I feel like I'm waiting for a surgery.

437
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,220
It feels strange.

438
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:42,979
I'm scared.

439
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,689
(The men who are waiting are also anxious.)

440
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,620
Do you think you'll go on a date with the one you want?

441
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,060
Not me.

442
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,290
I can't get a read on Ho Am.

443
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,160
I have no idea who his date will be.

444
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,070
I think Hyeon U will go...

445
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,930
on a date with Yun Jeong.

446
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,440
Who should go first?

447
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,940
How should we decide?

448
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,109
- Rock-paper-scissors? - I like that!

449
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,510
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

450
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,510
The loser goes 1st, or the winner goes 1st?

451
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,650
- The winner? - The winner goes first?

452
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,550
Rock, paper, scissors.

453
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,759
(Yu Gyeong and Yun Jeong will go 3rd and 4th.)

454
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,760
(Envious)

455
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:23,490
- But I don't want to go first. - Rock, paper, scissors.

456
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,459
(Yu Gyeong will go last.)

457
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,500
(Yun Jeong is 3rd.)

458
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,100
Do you want to go first?

459
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,970
- No, you go first. - Please.

460
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,639
(Thinking hard)

461
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,910
I'll go first, then. Sorry.

462
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,910
(There are four objects in front of Ra Yun.)

463
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,720
(Sighing)

464
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,450
I'll go with the obvious one.

465
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,030
I chose the cat toy that looked like a fish cake skewer.

466
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,330
I thought it'd be Gang Won's.

467
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,829
(When they first met)

468
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,800
(I have a Russian Blue.)

469
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,699
(I also prefer to be alone,)

470
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,310
(but I got a rescue cat.)

471
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,010
I got the impression that we were similar.

472
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,709
I decided to go with Gang Won...

473
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,420
to see the end of it.

474
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,650
- Next. - Yu Ra?

475
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,860
(Pondering)

476
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,990
What's this? Where is this?

477
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,100
(She chose photos from a trip.)

478
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,930
- These? - Okay.

479
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,770
I like going on dates in nature.

480
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,639
So I was drawn to these photos.

481
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,910
(Yu Ra chose the photos.)

482
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,510
Who won?

483
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,210
- Me. I'm third. - Third?

484
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,950
(There's a medal and a book remaining.)

485
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,250
Who would it be?

486
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,649
I'll pick this one.

487
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,019
(Yun Jeong chose the medal.)

488
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,020
So, I get the book.

489
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,830
Fencing? He's a fencing athlete?

490
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,299
(The fencing medal caught Yun Jeong's attention.)

491
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,260
It was a medal for fencing.

492
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,029
I thought, "Who could be a fencing athlete?"

493
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,699
I vaguely thought...

494
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,570
that only tall people could fence.

495
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,540
I'm so simple.

496
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,440
That's why...

497
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,640
- Do you know who it is? - No.

498
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,080
I don't.

499
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,450
Oh, no.

500
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,920
Do you have a guess?

501
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,190
(Everyone but Yun Jeong seems to know.)

502
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,830
Why? I must have missed something last night.

503
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,560
Maybe I wasn't focused.

504
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,030
Oh, except for Yun Jeong?

505
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,069
Right!

506
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,569
Only Yun Jeong doesn't know that the medal...

507
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,270
- belongs to Ho Am. - She doesn't know.

508
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,810
She's the only one in the dark.

509
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,209
That's why you should never leave the room in a dating show.

510
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,210
Indeed.

511
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,250
You'll have to be fixed to the chair.

512
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,310
(Last night)

513
00:26:00,311 --> 00:26:01,320
(Fencing!)

514
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,650
(When these three women found out that Ho Am was a fencing athlete,)

515
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:11,330
(Yun Jeong was preoccupied with finding the Gold Dragon.)

516
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,159
(The first date with Ho Am...)

517
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,900
(that only Yun Jeong doesn't know about)

518
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,399
- The book? Who would it be? - It must be...

519
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,370
(Yu Gyeong will go on a date with the owner of the book.)

520
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,309
It's going to be so boring.

521
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,979
(The unpredictable first date matching session ends.)

522
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,080
Maybe it's because I went last.

523
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,550
I'm so disoriented.

524
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,050
(The men get ready for their dates.)

525
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,919
When you style your hair after drying it,

526
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,989
you start off by trimming the sideburns.

527
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,760
(Realizing)

528
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,699
- You didn't know, did you? - No.

529
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,100
(They share styling tips.)

530
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,599
(Sighing)

531
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,670
What's wrong all of a sudden?

532
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,800
(Groaning)

533
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,739
(Byeong Yeol acts bizarrely...)

534
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,070
(as he's nervous about the first date.)

535
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,480
(Ho Am began meditating.)

536
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,350
(I'm so nervous.)

537
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,049
(That's cute.)

538
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,219
You get to see a person's true colours...

539
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,659
when you're alone with them.

540
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,390
- Right. - No matter how short it is.

541
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,760
They must be so nervous.

542
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,530
(One afternoon by the lake with sunshine)

543
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,310
I was absolutely certain that it was Hyeon U.

544
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,910
I was slightly worried that we might be bored...

545
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,420
as we'd have to spend quite a lot of time together.

546
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,620
It's been so long since I last spent time alone with a man.

547
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,790
I was so anxious.

548
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:55,260
(The man in a black coat approaches Yun Jeong.)

549
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:01,040
Yun Jeong.

550
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,540
- Oh, hi! - Hi.

551
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,370
- I didn't know it was you. - Me neither.

552
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,710
- It's awkward, right? - So awkward.

553
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,210
He wasn't the one I was expecting.

554
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,550
I thought it'd be Hyeon U.

555
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,849
Seriously. Until I turned around,

556
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:20,619
I was expecting to see Hyeon U's face.

557
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,860
(Yun Jeong)

558
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,290
It was someone I wasn't expecting at all.

559
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,099
I was a bit nervous because I was trying to keep a poker face.

560
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,330
I wasn't interested in him at all.

561
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:35,299
I was hoping it would be Yu Gyeong...

562
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,800
or Yu Ra.

563
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:40,740
It seemed that Yun Jeong wasn't expecting...

564
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,509
to see me either.

565
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,910
So it was a bit awkward.

566
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,620
(Distant)

567
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,049
Oh, right. I was the only one who didn't know.

568
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,160
What do you mean?

569
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,090
The personal belongings.

570
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,589
I see. You guys chose your dates...

571
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,830
- based on personal belongings? - Yes.

572
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,030
What were you thinking when you chose mine?

573
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,129
Well, I had no idea.

574
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,240
I didn't know anyone except for one person.

575
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,739
So I was hoping to find out who it would be.

576
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,270
Did you just pick the one you were drawn to?

577
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:13,770
(The distance between them doesn't seem to be narrowing.)

578
00:29:13,771 --> 00:29:15,280
There weren't a lot of choices left by my turn.

579
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,249
(The two of them...)

580
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,620
(still feel awkward around each other.)

581
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,759
(Surprised)

582
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,420
Your outfit looks great today.

583
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,790
Yours too.

584
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,330
(They compliment each other as they feel awkward.)

585
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,000
- We're wearing similar outfits. - That's right.

586
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,969
and dress shoes.

587
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,000
Right.

588
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,740
- And a black coat. - A coat.

589
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,240
(They try to find common ground with their outfits.)

590
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,480
(Then another silent moment comes.)

591
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,349
You didn't have breakfast, right?

592
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,819
- Shall we go and have some food? - Sounds good. Let's go.

593
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,920
(Pick Your Fate Date: Kim Yun Jeong and Jang Ho Am)

594
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,360
- Today's weather is nice. - Yes.

595
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,129
- It was cold yesterday. - Yes.

596
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,329
(A date with an unexpected partner)

597
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,790
(Will the date bring changes to their feelings?)

598
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,370
I came up with the plan for today's date.

599
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,529
Really? I'm looking forward to it.

600
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,570
Look forward to it.

601
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,439
(The first spot for the date prepared by Ho Am)

602
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,970
- You can sit here. - I see.

603
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,280
(Feeling awkward)

604
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,850
(Awkward)

605
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,460
I'm hungry.

606
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:40,389
I didn't know what kind of conversation we would have.

607
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,600
I talked more than he did.

608
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,830
- Right. - Yes.

609
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,269
- Yes. Can I take this out? - Yes?

610
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,340
What is it?

611
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,240
I got one of your belongings.

612
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,039
- Right, you said you chose one. - Yes.

613
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,280
- This medal belongs to a fencer. - That's right.

614
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,310
- Were you a fencer? - Yes. I used to be a fencer.

615
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,480
How long have you played it?

616
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,150
- For about 2 years. - For about 2 years?

617
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,390
Was it recent?

618
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,959
I fenced up until four years ago.

619
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,630
- Up until four years ago? - That was the last time I played.

620
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,999
- It was so unexpected. - When...

621
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,329
- It was unexpected? - Yes.

622
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,270
But I can see that the sport suits you now.

623
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,800
- You like unique things. - Right.

624
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,609
I started playing when I was in high school.

625
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,239
I think I played for two years.

626
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,280
I did sabre fencing.

627
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,549
You must take an active role in the game.

628
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,850
Whoever strikes the opponent first wins the game.

629
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,849
Sabre fencing was compatible with my personality too.

630
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,619
I also competed in national competitions.

631
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,090
I won a bronze medal too.

632
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,259
Now that we've heard his story, the sport...

633
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,100
- suits Ho Am. - Right. It suits him well.

634
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,230
It suits him.

635
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,929
He's suddenly becoming more likeable.

636
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:54,170
Same here.

637
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,070
He's so cool.

638
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,069
I hate forcing myself to do something.

639
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,580
I think I did everything I wanted to do, growing up.

640
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,709
And I followed my heart...

641
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,880
and lived without lying to myself.

642
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,919
I used to do unique sports,

643
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,789
like fencing and horse riding.

644
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,120
The sports people didn't play a lot.

645
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,960
I'm a bit curious about horse riding.

646
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,329
I want to try out...

647
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,029
horse riding one day.

648
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,129
It's on my wish list.

649
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,230
- Horse riding? - Yes.

650
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,530
And I'm also from Jeju Island.

651
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,270
Right.

652
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,040
I want to go and ride horses.

653
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,410
You should definitely learn it.

654
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,910
It's so much fun.

655
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,310
You did a lot of fun stuff.

656
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,879
What about you?

657
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,409
Do you like unique things?

658
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,650
- Novel things? - Me?

659
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:45,020
I do like unique and different things.

660
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,860
- What do you usually do? - So...

661
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,159
Was it two years ago? I learned traditional Korean dance.

662
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,559
- Traditional Korean dance? Gosh. - Yes.

663
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,660
I took classes for that.

664
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,830
I started taking dance classes out of the blue.

665
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,299
Then I learned Rumba.

666
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,329
- Come again? - Rumba.

667
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,629
- What's Rumba? - I...

668
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,800
I've never heard of that.

669
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,940
It's a type of dancesport.

670
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,209
Is it the kind of dance I would see...

671
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,610
- on "Backpack Travels?" - No, nothing like that.

672
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,919
(Yun Jeong from her Rumba class)

673
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,350
(Yun Jeong from her Rumba class)

674
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,290
- My gosh, she looks beautiful. - Oh, my.

675
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,990
She likes to dance.

676
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,230
It's an intense dancesport.

677
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,730
- She looks gorgeous. - Indeed.

678
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,239
Anyway, I like unique stuff.

679
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240
(Both of them like unique things like fencing and Rumba.)

680
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:38,370
You're right. You learned a unique type of dance.

681
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,940
That's so funny.

682
00:33:40,941 --> 00:33:43,040
(They found something in common.)

683
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,950
(Munching)

684
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,519
Now that we're out of the house, things are more natural.

685
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,719
So it's nice.

686
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,350
- Right? It feels comfortable... - Yes.

687
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,990
to be out.

688
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,060
It's been a while since I've been to a place like this.

689
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,229
- Is that so? - A nice restaurant like this.

690
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,600
- A restaurant with good ambiance. - I see.

691
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:03,730
- Have you been busy? - A long time ago...

692
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,129
- I mostly stay at home. - I see.

693
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,740
Or I usually go to restaurants in my neighbourhood.

694
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,940
- Same here. - For some reason...

695
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,209
It's been a long time...

696
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,139
since I came to a restaurant for dates.

697
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,110
Same here.

698
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,680
You know, this is how it is for everyone.

699
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,780
- Going on dates like this? - Yes.

700
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,319
Right. That's true.

701
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,589
Going to good restaurants and spending time together...

702
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,660
- are ordinary dates. - Right.

703
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:34,200
At some point, this kind of date became special.

704
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,899
It might be just me.

705
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,400
But working in this fortune-telling industry...

706
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,770
could lead to numerous moments of feeling empty inside.

707
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,840
- That's how I feel. - I see.

708
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,379
When the energy is overwhelming,

709
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,980
I help others with it.

710
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,749
Then when it becomes quiet and there's nothing around me,

711
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,850
I often feel empty inside.

712
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,249
What about you?

713
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,689
Have you felt something similar in this line of work?

714
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,790
Feeling a sense of emptiness?

715
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,560
For me, it's not the sense of emptiness.

716
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,729
There are moments when I feel utterly lonely.

717
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,770
It's like...

718
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,940
- I can't tell anyone about this. - Right.

719
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,009
It's something I have to deal with on my own.

720
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,680
- In those moments, - I see.

721
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,840
I feel like...

722
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,350
I'm standing on the edge of a cliff for some reason.

723
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,450
That's when...

724
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:35,290
I feel utterly lonely. It happens once in a while.

725
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,960
When I feel that, I take a deep breath.

726
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,330
I try to overcome that.

727
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,900
I'm sure people outside our world struggle too.

728
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,139
But they could have their own community...

729
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,840
- or a sense of belonging. - Right.

730
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,969
- Like working in a regular office. - Right. A regular office.

731
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,580
- Right. - The office and sense of belonging.

732
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,909
When they take responsibility, they can do it as a team.

733
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,210
That's common for them.

734
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,550
But it's not like that in our line of work. We're on our own.

735
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,050
If I have a weak moment, that's it. It's over.

736
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,060
That's why I'm more cautious and this job is more demanding.

737
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:16,099
- The pressure that we must be... - Right.

738
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,330
on our toes all the time.

739
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,500
- It's tough. - Right?

740
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,740
There were things I found out...

741
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,379
about Yun Jeong.

742
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,409
And there were things I had assumed about her that I was wrong about.

743
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:33,509
When we talked, Yun Jeong...

744
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,519
looked me in the eye the whole time.

745
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,049
When she gave me her complete attention,

746
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,819
it made her seem quite authentic.

747
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,389
I didn't have...

748
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:44,220
this kind of chance to reveal my thoughts with other people.

749
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,489
I realized that talking to him felt easy...

750
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,499
and that he made me feel comfortable.

751
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,170
I had never bonded with someone...

752
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,469
this quickly before.

753
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,970
Today's date taught me that things like this could happen.

754
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,739
Having deep conversations like this...

755
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,309
- Right. - can be a great catalyst...

756
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,840
- to bring them closer. - Yes.

757
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,739
I think he's capable of encouraging people...

758
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,879
to dig deep during conversations while helping them feel comfortable.

759
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,719
I don't remember him...

760
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,719
- being that talkative. - Right.

761
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,649
- But when he was with Yun Jeong, - Yes.

762
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,920
- it seemed so natural. - Right.

763
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,220
- People in our line of work... - Yes?

764
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,559
don't have anyone to seek advice from.

765
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,730
- Right. - I see.

766
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:22,259
People ask us questions, and we only give our advice.

767
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,030
That's why they ended up having a more meaningful conversation.

768
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:28,239
- That sounds about right. - Yes.

769
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,400
We don't have anyone we can seek advice from.

770
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,009
You can ask me anything.

771
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,310
What is it? Just ask me.

772
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,479
My gosh, that didn't cross my mind.

773
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,509
We always went to him...

774
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,549
- during breaks. - Yes.

775
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,050
- We only asked him questions. - Yes.

776
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,450
(Oh, no.)

777
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,290
I'll seek advice from time to time.

778
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:54,830
(The two of them begin to open up gradually through this deep talk.)

779
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,070
Is our next spot close to here?

780
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,030
- It is. - It is?

781
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,369
- On foot? - We'll be there soon. Yes, on foot.

782
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,569
We can get there on foot?

783
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,240
- It'll take 3 to 4 minutes on foot. - What? Only 3 to 4 minutes?

784
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,650
Digesting some of the food before we go sounds nice too.

785
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,079
Right. Shall we walk a bit first?

786
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,050
- What do you say? I like that idea. - The path seemed pretty too.

787
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,950
Sounds good.

788
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,190
I want to walk a bit before we go.

789
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,029
(Glancing)

790
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,060
Right?

791
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,959
If we spot a photo studio during our walk later,

792
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,060
- Yes? - do you want to take a picture?

793
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,800
- What kind of picture? - The photo booth.

794
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,370
The photo booth?

795
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,139
- It's over there. - Nice.

796
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,869
- There is one? - That's...

797
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,309
When did you spot that?

798
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,470
I can see it from here.

799
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,139
- Did you spot that from here? - Yes.

800
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,910
Nice. You have a sharp eye.

801
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,710
I like that.

802
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,749
Yes. This will be fun.

803
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:50,850
(They make an unexpected stop, thanks to his sharp eye.)

804
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,419
It's not like this on Jeju Island.

805
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,519
(The two of them head over to the photo studio while chatting.)

806
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,820
Maybe, I just don't know.

807
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,860
- No. Seriously. It's not obvious. - Maybe, we both don't know.

808
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,059
- That's possible. - Others might all know.

809
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,430
They might be like, "That can't be the standard Korean."

810
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,400
My gosh. Look at the clouds.

811
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,969
Right. I was going to point it out too.

812
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,939
- Look at that too. - I want to take a picture of this.

813
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,070
- Take a picture of that too. - Wait.

814
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,939
(They take pictures of the clouds side by side.)

815
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,740
- My gosh. Right? - They look great in the pictures.

816
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,250
(Photographed by Yun Jeong, Photographed by Ho Am)

817
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,850
Thank you.

818
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,420
- It's been a while, right? - Yes.

819
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,030
It's been ages.

820
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,299
This must be it, right?

821
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,400
Yes, it is.

822
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:43,400
Thank you.

823
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,770
- Did you think about the poses? - No.

824
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,109
What's popular these days?

825
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,109
Let's not do trendy poses.

826
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,549
Okay. Should we just strike poses we want?

827
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,710
Let's make it unique.

828
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,120
Is it set? Yes, it's set.

829
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,450
"It will start soon."

830
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,020
I like that.

831
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,320
- My gosh. What? - The frame is tight.

832
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,889
- Gosh. - Should I step forward?

833
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:07,960
- Yes. - Making a V?

834
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,500
(Excited)

835
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,840
- What a heart-fluttering moment. - My gosh. Seriously.

836
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,769
I see. The frame is tight.

837
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,970
- They have to get close like that. - They have to.

838
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,380
What kind of poses do people make?

839
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,440
- Like this. - This?

840
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,750
(Getting butterflies just from watching them together)

841
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,090
So that's how I looked.

842
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,220
- You look cute. You look good. - I didn't know.

843
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:39,990
Should we cross our arms?

844
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,100
- Again. - Next.

845
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:47,830
The space was tight, and we had to stand close to each other.

846
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,499
I was quite nervous.

847
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,110
I hadn't been on a date for a very long time.

848
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,280
It'd been a while since I spent time like this with a lady.

849
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,750
So I had a good time. That's all I can think of.

850
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:04,520
(Their poses look more natural.)

851
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:06,990
Next.

852
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,830
Then...

853
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,940
Could you move forward a bit?

854
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,179
- Yes. Good job. - My gosh, Ho Am. He went for it.

855
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,540
He put his arm around her.

856
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,520
- in the pictures. - My gosh.

857
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,850
- They make such a good couple. - Yes.

858
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,650
My gosh. The two of them make a good couple.

859
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,069
- This one came out well. - Yes.

860
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,329
- The shoulders... Right? - That came out well.

861
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,330
- Another one? - Sure.

862
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,510
That's when it felt like I was taking a picture with a man.

863
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,810
I suddenly felt shy.

864
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,850
Ho Am asked me in advance if he could put his arm around me...

865
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:13,020
before we got to the photo booth.

866
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,489
- It's... - Can I put my arm around you...

867
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,559
in the booth?

868
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,619
Sure.

869
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,790
I was like, "My gosh, look at this guy."

870
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,460
"Oh, my." I thought that...

871
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,560
he could be bold when he wanted to.

872
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,040
So that was unexpected.

873
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,040
- My gosh. This... - Goodness.

874
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,439
It's just like she said.

875
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,879
- The date had a bold moment. - Right.

876
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,439
When he was with other people in the house,

877
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,509
he reminded me of an herbivore.

878
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,949
- Right. - But not on this date.

879
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,520
We thought he was a deer. But when he came out,

880
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,919
he was a deer that ate meat.

881
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,589
- Blood was dripping from his mouth. - My goodness.

882
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,790
- He's going for the meat. - He's eating meat.

883
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,930
- That's a bit scary. - How gruesome.

884
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,129
I was just trying to say that he had an unexpected charm.

885
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:58,769
There were several moments when he showed his manly side.

886
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,830
(Ho Am's bold move was that unexpected.)

887
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,170
(Their pictures are done being printed.)

888
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,080
- I see. We look good. - I see. The pictures look great.

889
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,649
I like it.

890
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:13,749
- Let's go. - Oh, right.

891
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,779
- The pictures? - Yes.

892
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,919
We should take a picture of them.

893
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,850
- Like this. - Like this.

894
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,920
Look at this.

895
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,960
Well, I won't post it online.

896
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,019
I can't.

897
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,029
(Their special moment remains in the four pictures.)

898
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,130
Let's go.

899
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:38,210
What do I do?

900
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,780
It was my first date.

901
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,310
It was my first date after becoming a shaman.

902
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,219
I was extremely nervous.

903
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,949
But on the other hand, I wanted to clarify...

904
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,619
my feelings to see if I liked him or not.

905
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,120
So I was ready to go on a date with him.

906
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:03,330
(She's nervous before her first date.)

907
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:07,230
(A car approaches Ra Yun at that moment.)

908
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,500
What?

909
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,200
(Surprised)

910
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:12,510
My gosh.

911
00:44:16,252 --> 00:44:17,991
- My gosh. - I knew it would be you.

912
00:44:17,992 --> 00:44:20,191
(I knew it would be you.)

913
00:44:20,192 --> 00:44:21,262
Get in now.

914
00:44:23,732 --> 00:44:24,932
That's cute.

915
00:44:25,802 --> 00:44:27,861
They're the only couple...

916
00:44:27,862 --> 00:44:29,801
- that chose each other. - Right.

917
00:44:29,802 --> 00:44:31,601
- Even on Day One too. - Right.

918
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,042
- Now, they'll go on a date. - Yes.

919
00:44:33,142 --> 00:44:35,111
- I'm curious about their date. - I bet...

920
00:44:35,112 --> 00:44:36,672
- their energy level will be high. - Yes.

921
00:44:36,812 --> 00:44:38,682
- They're both shamans. - Yes, they're both shamans.

922
00:44:38,982 --> 00:44:40,242
Both of them are intense.

923
00:44:40,342 --> 00:44:41,381
Intense shamans.

924
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:42,512
(How will the date between the two intense shamans turn out?)

925
00:44:43,452 --> 00:44:44,512
Get in now.

926
00:44:46,482 --> 00:44:47,952
I was really surprised.

927
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,752
He rolled down the window.

928
00:44:49,952 --> 00:44:52,622
He said, "I knew it'd be you."

929
00:44:53,192 --> 00:44:55,462
I was like, "That's the first thing he's going to say to me?"

930
00:44:56,292 --> 00:44:57,561
That crossed my mind.

931
00:44:57,562 --> 00:45:00,362
But at the same time, I thought it was totally like him.

932
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:02,971
Actually, even before I saw my date today,

933
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:05,101
I knew it'd be Ra Yun. It had to be her no matter what.

934
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,772
I was certain.

935
00:45:07,802 --> 00:45:10,571
I thought, "Granny, why are you helping me?"

936
00:45:10,572 --> 00:45:12,312
"It seems to be going well. What is this?"

937
00:45:13,212 --> 00:45:15,411
- What is this? Can I get in? - Get in. It's cold out.

938
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:16,452
(The date of the two shamans began.)

939
00:45:17,052 --> 00:45:18,981
- Put on your seat belt. - Okay.

940
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,822
(Pick Your Fate Date: Lee Ra Yun and Lee Gang Won)

941
00:45:23,092 --> 00:45:24,351
I knew you'd come.

942
00:45:24,352 --> 00:45:25,762
- Really? What? - Yes.

943
00:45:25,822 --> 00:45:26,892
How did you know?

944
00:45:26,992 --> 00:45:28,332
I had a feeling you would come.

945
00:45:30,192 --> 00:45:31,862
Right. On our way there...

946
00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:33,101
Yes?

947
00:45:33,102 --> 00:45:34,401
- Just in case. - Yes?

948
00:45:34,402 --> 00:45:35,471
We have some time...

949
00:45:35,472 --> 00:45:37,671
until our meal. It won't be anytime soon.

950
00:45:37,672 --> 00:45:39,372
- What's this? - If you want anything, go ahead.

951
00:45:41,302 --> 00:45:42,371
No way.

952
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,542
(He prepared some snacks to eat during the drive.)

953
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:46,142
- What's this? - You like that this much?

954
00:45:46,612 --> 00:45:47,682
What's this?

955
00:45:47,782 --> 00:45:49,212
Please have whatever you want from the bag.

956
00:45:49,682 --> 00:45:51,622
What? When did you prepare all this?

957
00:45:52,552 --> 00:45:53,951
I've never prepared a bag of food like this.

958
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:55,591
My gosh, you're making me blush.

959
00:45:55,592 --> 00:45:57,322
This is crazy. I don't know what to do.

960
00:45:57,552 --> 00:45:58,792
I feel like I'm in high school again.

961
00:45:59,822 --> 00:46:01,662
(Embarrassed)

962
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:03,362
Do you want some candy?

963
00:46:03,692 --> 00:46:04,802
Just one, please.

964
00:46:06,632 --> 00:46:07,831
- So... - Here.

965
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:08,932
Thank you.

966
00:46:10,502 --> 00:46:13,972
(They start off the date on a good note with the candy.)

967
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,312
- Do you like the sea? - Yes.

968
00:46:16,912 --> 00:46:18,582
You don't know where we're going, right?

969
00:46:19,242 --> 00:46:21,042
- What? Where are we going? - You don't know, right?

970
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,282
- No, I don't. - Right.

971
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,482
We're going to the ocean now.

972
00:46:26,952 --> 00:46:28,082
- Really? - Yes.

973
00:46:29,522 --> 00:46:31,221
- We're going to the ocean? - Yes.

974
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:32,292
My gosh.

975
00:46:33,692 --> 00:46:34,892
- I like it. - I wanted to go to the ocean.

976
00:46:37,232 --> 00:46:40,131
- When you first arrived yesterday, - Yes?

977
00:46:40,132 --> 00:46:41,502
what crossed your mind?

978
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:43,132
The moment...

979
00:46:44,532 --> 00:46:46,242
I saw you, I was like,

980
00:46:47,802 --> 00:46:48,972
"He's like me."

981
00:46:51,172 --> 00:46:53,782
- I thought she said, "He's mine." - Same here. I thought so too.

982
00:46:53,882 --> 00:46:55,181
"He's mine."

983
00:46:55,182 --> 00:46:56,552
That's a bit too much.

984
00:46:59,382 --> 00:47:00,552
"He's like me."

985
00:47:03,652 --> 00:47:05,462
- Like you? - Like me.

986
00:47:06,192 --> 00:47:07,291
Yes.

987
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:08,661
I felt something similar when I saw you too.

988
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:10,231
"Why does it feel like I've known her for years?"

989
00:47:10,232 --> 00:47:12,532
- Right. - It felt like I already knew you.

990
00:47:13,102 --> 00:47:15,372
(Yesterday afternoon)

991
00:47:15,902 --> 00:47:18,202
- Please sprinkle it a little. - Why don't you put ketchup then?

992
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:19,772
I don't eat ketchup.

993
00:47:21,842 --> 00:47:23,142
Just because you don't eat it...

994
00:47:23,672 --> 00:47:25,242
That's why everyone should dip it...

995
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:26,642
to keep the peace.

996
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:28,382
Why do you not eat ketchup?

997
00:47:29,682 --> 00:47:30,682
I lied.

998
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:32,452
(Glaring)

999
00:47:34,322 --> 00:47:37,121
"I can hug and kiss my lover on the street."

1000
00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:38,122
Yes or no?

1001
00:47:38,892 --> 00:47:40,762
In the middle of the crosswalk at an intersection.

1002
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:43,932
You must do that in the middle of the crosswalk at the intersection.

1003
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:45,862
I don't think I can do it.

1004
00:47:47,402 --> 00:47:52,372
(They've been bickering and getting along well since the first day.)

1005
00:47:52,742 --> 00:47:55,211
When I joke around...

1006
00:47:55,212 --> 00:47:57,911
and talk about useless things, I become the happiest.

1007
00:47:57,912 --> 00:47:58,941
Me too.

1008
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,982
That's why I like people with a good sense of humour.

1009
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:04,052
Everyone has different charms,

1010
00:48:04,252 --> 00:48:07,282
but if you like a cheerful and fun guy,

1011
00:48:07,682 --> 00:48:09,052
I'm quite confident.

1012
00:48:09,452 --> 00:48:11,892
I'm confident in making people laugh.

1013
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:13,962
I like funny people.

1014
00:48:14,222 --> 00:48:15,932
When I find someone funny, I fall for him.

1015
00:48:19,102 --> 00:48:20,332
(Smug)

1016
00:48:24,302 --> 00:48:25,941
- By the way, - Yes?

1017
00:48:25,942 --> 00:48:28,742
you've met all the men and women.

1018
00:48:29,372 --> 00:48:32,642
Was there anyone who fit the type you were looking for...

1019
00:48:33,012 --> 00:48:34,912
- among the men? - Yes.

1020
00:48:36,282 --> 00:48:37,851
- Of course, there was. - Was there anyone...

1021
00:48:37,852 --> 00:48:39,982
that was exactly the person you were looking for?

1022
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,192
Yes. The wolf.

1023
00:48:46,192 --> 00:48:47,222
The wolf?

1024
00:48:49,062 --> 00:48:51,292
- He doesn't look like a wolf. - Okay.

1025
00:48:52,402 --> 00:48:55,072
But his face reminds me of a wolf.

1026
00:48:55,172 --> 00:48:57,102
He has eyes...

1027
00:48:57,672 --> 00:48:58,672
that remind me of a wolf's.

1028
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:03,772
- He has thick eyebrows. - Okay.

1029
00:49:04,712 --> 00:49:07,982
He acts grumpy and indifferent,

1030
00:49:08,082 --> 00:49:09,252
but he takes good care of me.

1031
00:49:10,152 --> 00:49:11,512
He's looking at his reflection.

1032
00:49:12,222 --> 00:49:14,322
- He checks if he looks like a wolf. - "Do I have the eyes of a wolf?"

1033
00:49:14,522 --> 00:49:15,692
That's cute.

1034
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:24,762
(Checking if he has the eyes of a wolf)

1035
00:49:25,102 --> 00:49:28,132
I was like, "It's him. I found my prey."

1036
00:49:29,572 --> 00:49:31,131
- Like saying, "It's you?" - "Oh, my."

1037
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:33,302
(Ra Yun picked the guy who looked like a wolf on the first day.)

1038
00:49:35,942 --> 00:49:37,172
We're going to see it soon.

1039
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:39,682
See what? The sea?

1040
00:49:39,782 --> 00:49:40,782
I think so.

1041
00:49:40,942 --> 00:49:42,412
- Really? - We're going to see it.

1042
00:49:42,812 --> 00:49:43,812
Is that the sea?

1043
00:49:46,822 --> 00:49:47,952
Oh, my. It's the sea.

1044
00:49:49,922 --> 00:49:52,321
It's the ocean. I love it.

1045
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,762
(The vast Gangjin ocean)

1046
00:49:54,462 --> 00:49:56,992
(A coastal road by Gangjin Bay)

1047
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:00,202
- The colour of the water is pretty. - Yes.

1048
00:50:01,662 --> 00:50:02,971
It's sparkling.

1049
00:50:02,972 --> 00:50:03,972
(Driving on the expansive coastal road)

1050
00:50:06,902 --> 00:50:09,442
I definitely want to be born as a starfish in my next life.

1051
00:50:09,912 --> 00:50:12,412
I'll raise you in a fishbowl.

1052
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:13,642
That's bad.

1053
00:50:18,452 --> 00:50:20,622
That's crazy.

1054
00:50:21,422 --> 00:50:24,552
(It's their unique way of having fun with each other.)

1055
00:50:27,422 --> 00:50:29,862
Nice. We're going to eat.

1056
00:50:32,002 --> 00:50:33,662
(Exclaiming)

1057
00:50:35,072 --> 00:50:36,232
Gosh, what's this?

1058
00:50:40,672 --> 00:50:41,872
Gosh, what's this?

1059
00:50:42,412 --> 00:50:43,412
Why do you like it so much?

1060
00:50:44,672 --> 00:50:46,112
Is it temple food?

1061
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,312
- It's... - Are we eating temple food?

1062
00:50:51,752 --> 00:50:53,321
(Flustered)

1063
00:50:53,322 --> 00:50:55,752
She likes temple food that much?

1064
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,052
I was surprised.

1065
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,691
- I thought there was a banner... - I know.

1066
00:50:58,692 --> 00:51:00,762
with her name on it or something like that.

1067
00:51:05,132 --> 00:51:06,201
I like it.

1068
00:51:06,202 --> 00:51:07,202
(The restaurant welcomes Ra Yun who is particularly excited.)

1069
00:51:07,203 --> 00:51:09,471
- We're going to eat temple food. - Do they have bibimbap?

1070
00:51:09,472 --> 00:51:10,632
They serve temple food.

1071
00:51:10,732 --> 00:51:12,572
- Do they have bibimbap? - I guess so.

1072
00:51:13,102 --> 00:51:14,172
Really?

1073
00:51:19,512 --> 00:51:20,642
Shall we begin?

1074
00:51:22,152 --> 00:51:23,352
Thank you for the food.

1075
00:51:24,252 --> 00:51:25,922
(Eating)

1076
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,992
(Shamans love Korean food, indeed.)

1077
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:35,662
It's good.

1078
00:51:36,992 --> 00:51:38,092
Gang Won.

1079
00:51:39,732 --> 00:51:41,162
Aren't you curious about how I picked you?

1080
00:51:41,972 --> 00:51:43,202
I'm really curious,

1081
00:51:43,702 --> 00:51:45,572
but I didn't ask because I thought it'd be embarrassing.

1082
00:51:46,242 --> 00:51:48,941
Did you choose the name plaque?

1083
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:49,942
Was it somewhere?

1084
00:51:50,112 --> 00:51:51,912
I picked a belonging.

1085
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:54,812
Let me tell you what it was.

1086
00:51:55,752 --> 00:51:58,312
You know the cat toy?

1087
00:51:58,682 --> 00:51:59,682
Yes.

1088
00:52:00,222 --> 00:52:01,582
- The skewer. - Yes.

1089
00:52:01,682 --> 00:52:02,952
It was a skewer.

1090
00:52:03,222 --> 00:52:04,322
Whose item did you think it was?

1091
00:52:06,592 --> 00:52:08,392
(You)

1092
00:52:09,532 --> 00:52:10,562
Me?

1093
00:52:11,832 --> 00:52:12,832
(Nodding)

1094
00:52:16,102 --> 00:52:17,231
She blinks...

1095
00:52:17,232 --> 00:52:18,702
- every time she nods. - Yes.

1096
00:52:19,242 --> 00:52:20,242
That's the point.

1097
00:52:20,243 --> 00:52:21,541
- That's a skill. - Not this.

1098
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:22,572
- Not this. - This.

1099
00:52:23,612 --> 00:52:25,241
With the dimple.

1100
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:26,281
Yes. With the dimple on one side.

1101
00:52:26,282 --> 00:52:27,282
(Using his eyes, nose, and lips)

1102
00:52:28,212 --> 00:52:31,012
(He looks like he's broken when he tries to flirt.)

1103
00:52:34,022 --> 00:52:36,052
(That's funny.)

1104
00:52:37,192 --> 00:52:39,262
So that's the point.

1105
00:52:40,792 --> 00:52:42,062
(Blinking)

1106
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,432
I was surprised when it turned out I was right.

1107
00:52:48,102 --> 00:52:50,572
I have two cats.

1108
00:52:50,802 --> 00:52:54,102
When I was walking down the street, I saw a cat strolling.

1109
00:52:54,602 --> 00:52:56,272
In one word, it was abandoned.

1110
00:52:56,372 --> 00:52:59,212
I took it home because I couldn't let it die.

1111
00:52:59,642 --> 00:53:01,742
I was looking for a new family to take care of it,

1112
00:53:02,282 --> 00:53:03,882
but it was so affectionate to me.

1113
00:53:04,082 --> 00:53:06,722
So I decided to take care of it until the end.

1114
00:53:07,122 --> 00:53:08,992
That's how I took it home.

1115
00:53:09,622 --> 00:53:12,692
The other cat was raised in a restaurant.

1116
00:53:12,892 --> 00:53:16,192
And they were about to abandon it.

1117
00:53:16,862 --> 00:53:18,492
I thought I should take care of it.

1118
00:53:18,602 --> 00:53:19,632
That's how I took it home.

1119
00:53:21,662 --> 00:53:25,171
On the first day, I could decide where I wanted to go.

1120
00:53:25,172 --> 00:53:27,041
So I wanted to go with the person I wanted.

1121
00:53:27,042 --> 00:53:29,012
And it worked out,

1122
00:53:30,312 --> 00:53:31,872
- which I was thankful for. - Why?

1123
00:53:32,412 --> 00:53:34,442
Because the person I wanted to see is right in front of me.

1124
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:36,652
That's why I was thankful.

1125
00:53:36,852 --> 00:53:38,082
Stop flirting with me.

1126
00:53:39,152 --> 00:53:40,152
Did you notice it?

1127
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:42,352
Stop flirting with me.

1128
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:44,422
So...

1129
00:53:45,152 --> 00:53:48,292
(The flirty people are eating together.)

1130
00:53:49,332 --> 00:53:50,862
(Glancing)

1131
00:53:53,762 --> 00:53:54,932
You're good at eating with chopsticks.

1132
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,372
- I'm good. - I'm good at it too.

1133
00:53:57,472 --> 00:53:59,642
Yes. I already checked earlier.

1134
00:54:02,212 --> 00:54:03,212
- You did? - Yes.

1135
00:54:03,342 --> 00:54:04,342
When did you see that?

1136
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,482
I could just see it.

1137
00:54:12,622 --> 00:54:14,182
What about me were you curious, by the way?

1138
00:54:14,522 --> 00:54:16,422
The type of women you like and the type you don't.

1139
00:54:17,092 --> 00:54:20,561
- Based on appearance? - Yes.

1140
00:54:20,562 --> 00:54:22,192
Talking about appearance, I like big eyes,

1141
00:54:23,432 --> 00:54:24,962
- light skin, - Okay.

1142
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:26,402
long straight hair, and...

1143
00:54:27,132 --> 00:54:29,332
Are you saying that because I'm in front of you?

1144
00:54:30,872 --> 00:54:33,842
(His ideal type is familiar somehow.)

1145
00:54:34,142 --> 00:54:35,971
Why are you so confident about yourself?

1146
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:37,272
Because I am.

1147
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:39,382
Okay then.

1148
00:54:39,612 --> 00:54:41,981
What do you like and don't like about a man's appearance?

1149
00:54:41,982 --> 00:54:42,982
(It's Ra Yun's turn now.)

1150
00:54:43,812 --> 00:54:45,522
His height or face doesn't matter.

1151
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:48,022
I like resilient people.

1152
00:54:48,522 --> 00:54:51,122
I think everyone experiences a failure in life at least once.

1153
00:54:51,852 --> 00:54:53,791
When that happens,

1154
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:56,492
I need someone who can eat ramyeon only and endure it with me.

1155
00:54:58,392 --> 00:55:00,262
Honestly, I could eat ramyeon only...

1156
00:55:00,462 --> 00:55:02,071
- for a couple of years with you. - Okay.

1157
00:55:02,072 --> 00:55:04,732
But I can't eat the same kind of ramyeon for years.

1158
00:55:05,742 --> 00:55:07,142
You can have different kinds.

1159
00:55:08,042 --> 00:55:09,042
That's enough then.

1160
00:55:11,512 --> 00:55:12,542
That's so random.

1161
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:15,611
(What are they talking about?)

1162
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,412
That was smooth.

1163
00:55:17,512 --> 00:55:18,752
She can let him eat different kinds of ramyeon.

1164
00:55:19,252 --> 00:55:21,651
- Their conversation... - This is...

1165
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,621
- flows so well. - Yes.

1166
00:55:23,622 --> 00:55:24,721
- Yes. - They're good.

1167
00:55:24,722 --> 00:55:25,722
(Their conversation is going smoothly.)

1168
00:55:29,832 --> 00:55:31,991
- But what if... No. - Yes?

1169
00:55:31,992 --> 00:55:33,031
If you could go out...

1170
00:55:33,032 --> 00:55:34,531
with someone else,

1171
00:55:34,532 --> 00:55:37,102
who is your second choice?

1172
00:55:38,872 --> 00:55:39,902
Who do you want to go out with?

1173
00:55:41,502 --> 00:55:43,112
- Go out with? - Yes.

1174
00:55:43,712 --> 00:55:44,712
There's no one else yet.

1175
00:55:45,412 --> 00:55:48,182
Among the other men,

1176
00:55:48,382 --> 00:55:50,252
do you think you could like someone?

1177
00:55:50,712 --> 00:55:52,052
I don't care about other people.

1178
00:55:52,752 --> 00:55:54,652
Just try thinking about it.

1179
00:55:56,222 --> 00:55:57,292
I can't think of anyone else yet.

1180
00:55:58,652 --> 00:56:00,321
No. I think you are interested,

1181
00:56:00,322 --> 00:56:01,861
but you can't make it obvious.

1182
00:56:01,862 --> 00:56:03,892
- Why do you think so? - That's just how I feel.

1183
00:56:06,632 --> 00:56:07,902
Do you think I'm interested in someone?

1184
00:56:08,102 --> 00:56:09,671
- Yes. - But I can't make it obvious?

1185
00:56:09,672 --> 00:56:10,832
- Yes. - Why?

1186
00:56:11,272 --> 00:56:12,302
That's just how I feel.

1187
00:56:14,102 --> 00:56:15,102
I think it might be possible.

1188
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:16,942
Why do you think so?

1189
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:21,182
To me, his words...

1190
00:56:21,282 --> 00:56:24,712
sounded ambiguous.

1191
00:56:25,352 --> 00:56:28,852
I was like, "What's going on? Is he being avoidant?"

1192
00:56:30,022 --> 00:56:32,322
What's your plan then?

1193
00:56:33,962 --> 00:56:35,092
I'm sure there's someone...

1194
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:37,962
who wants to talk with you.

1195
00:56:39,402 --> 00:56:41,561
Or there might be someone...

1196
00:56:41,562 --> 00:56:43,802
who wants to talk with me, even though I'm not sure about it.

1197
00:56:44,132 --> 00:56:46,902
So I think it's not bad to try talking with other people.

1198
00:56:47,672 --> 00:56:48,942
If we meet again...

1199
00:56:49,942 --> 00:56:51,312
even after that,

1200
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:53,942
then yes.

1201
00:56:55,652 --> 00:57:00,682
(Ra Yun doesn't look happy about what he said.)

1202
00:57:02,082 --> 00:57:04,691
I don't want to tell you not to talk with other people...

1203
00:57:04,692 --> 00:57:06,492
just because I like you.

1204
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:10,391
Even though I'm saying this,

1205
00:57:10,392 --> 00:57:11,791
if you go out with someone else,

1206
00:57:11,792 --> 00:57:13,502
I might get mad.

1207
00:57:15,772 --> 00:57:18,602
Still, I hope you can talk to other people before coming back to me.

1208
00:57:22,342 --> 00:57:23,742
"I'm going home."

1209
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,682
The atmosphere was good.

1210
00:57:27,242 --> 00:57:28,982
- It was great until now. - Yes.

1211
00:57:29,182 --> 00:57:31,452
The timing wasn't so good.

1212
00:57:34,182 --> 00:57:36,251
What I tried to say...

1213
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:37,952
was to take time.

1214
00:57:38,252 --> 00:57:39,961
"If you still like me..."

1215
00:57:39,962 --> 00:57:41,591
"after talking with other people,"

1216
00:57:41,592 --> 00:57:43,692
"please come to me." That's what I meant.

1217
00:57:44,532 --> 00:57:47,561
I think the difference is in our tendencies, not opinions.

1218
00:57:47,562 --> 00:57:51,172
I want to get to know her more.

1219
00:57:51,602 --> 00:57:53,942
It's true I'm very interested in her.

1220
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:56,211
But I needed confirmation.

1221
00:57:56,212 --> 00:57:58,842
I tend to make choices and confirm them quickly.

1222
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:02,752
He's more careful than I thought,

1223
00:58:03,082 --> 00:58:06,182
which frustrated and upset me a little.

1224
00:58:07,322 --> 00:58:11,422
(There's an awkward silence between them.)

1225
00:58:14,292 --> 00:58:15,532
Personally...

1226
00:58:15,962 --> 00:58:17,762
- No. Stop talking. - I mean...

1227
00:58:20,762 --> 00:58:21,932
The eggplant is delicious.

1228
00:58:24,002 --> 00:58:25,201
(Sighing)

1229
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:26,302
I mean it.

1230
00:58:26,742 --> 00:58:28,671
(His words make her laugh.)

1231
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,042
Try the eggplant.

1232
00:58:37,512 --> 00:58:38,811
He's good.

1233
00:58:38,812 --> 00:58:40,381
- They're compatible in this way. - Yes.

1234
00:58:40,382 --> 00:58:42,181
- He relieved the tension. - Yes. He was good.

1235
00:58:42,182 --> 00:58:43,822
(Oh, my goodness)

1236
00:58:44,792 --> 00:58:46,162
Let's eat two pieces each.

1237
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:47,622
They served it for us.

1238
00:58:48,762 --> 00:58:50,662
- I'm going to eat the eggplant. - Okay.

1239
00:58:51,092 --> 00:58:52,302
Why do you like it so much?

1240
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,262
Do you like eggplants a lot?

1241
00:58:57,232 --> 00:58:58,902
Let's go.

1242
00:59:01,185 --> 00:59:02,595
Do you hold grudges?

1243
00:59:02,755 --> 00:59:04,355
No, it actually eased my mind.

1244
00:59:04,495 --> 00:59:07,424
You might be frustrated and upset in a way.

1245
00:59:07,425 --> 00:59:10,295
No. I felt better after the conversation.

1246
00:59:14,565 --> 00:59:18,305
(Gangjin Bay Ecological Park)

1247
00:59:20,275 --> 00:59:22,045
Are we going to take a walk here?

1248
00:59:22,575 --> 00:59:23,645
Yes.

1249
00:59:25,275 --> 00:59:29,255
(The second spot he prepared)

1250
00:59:32,055 --> 00:59:33,485
It's a field of reeds!

1251
00:59:34,855 --> 00:59:36,955
- This place... - You're excited.

1252
00:59:37,295 --> 00:59:38,695
It's a field of reeds!

1253
00:59:39,295 --> 00:59:41,295
There are reeds everywhere.

1254
00:59:45,635 --> 00:59:46,804
There are so many ducks.

1255
00:59:46,805 --> 00:59:48,505
Ducks!

1256
00:59:50,275 --> 00:59:52,474
Don't they look peaceful?

1257
00:59:52,475 --> 00:59:53,475
Yes.

1258
00:59:53,945 --> 00:59:55,275
They're your friends.

1259
00:59:55,475 --> 00:59:56,975
My friends!

1260
00:59:57,975 --> 00:59:59,585
Hi, guys.

1261
01:00:00,185 --> 01:00:01,484
Why are you playing along with my joke?

1262
01:00:01,485 --> 01:00:04,285
Hi, guys. Where are you going?

1263
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:06,385
(Quacking)

1264
01:00:08,025 --> 01:00:09,654
Many of your friends must be living here.

1265
01:00:09,655 --> 01:00:10,825
Great blue-spotted mud skippers.

1266
01:00:10,925 --> 01:00:12,055
Great blue-spotted mud skippers?

1267
01:00:12,995 --> 01:00:14,195
- Where? - Here.

1268
01:00:14,565 --> 01:00:16,434
Many of your kind must be living here.

1269
01:00:16,435 --> 01:00:18,265
- Guys, you can come out now. - Great blue-spotted mud skippers.

1270
01:00:19,565 --> 01:00:21,634
- You can come out now. - They must be still sleeping.

1271
01:00:21,635 --> 01:00:23,305
(The duck and the great blue-spotted mud skipper in their own world)

1272
01:00:27,505 --> 01:00:30,314
Do you want to get married?

1273
01:00:30,315 --> 01:00:31,915
- Yes. - Why?

1274
01:00:33,585 --> 01:00:36,915
I wish to find a partner who can complement my weaknesses...

1275
01:00:37,485 --> 01:00:38,785
and vice versa.

1276
01:00:40,055 --> 01:00:42,924
I've never really thought...

1277
01:00:42,925 --> 01:00:45,455
about what kind of family I want to build,

1278
01:00:45,895 --> 01:00:47,824
whom I want to meet,

1279
01:00:47,825 --> 01:00:49,765
or what kind of house I want to live in.

1280
01:00:50,665 --> 01:00:53,134
I'm still not sure about it.

1281
01:00:53,135 --> 01:00:55,205
I don't know if there will be someone...

1282
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:56,874
who understands my job.

1283
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:59,944
Honestly, I came to the show...

1284
01:00:59,945 --> 01:01:02,775
because I wanted to have hope that there might be someone.

1285
01:01:03,745 --> 01:01:05,885
It sounds so sad somehow.

1286
01:01:06,045 --> 01:01:07,344
- Why? - You're not sure...

1287
01:01:07,345 --> 01:01:08,615
if there'd be someone who understands you.

1288
01:01:08,785 --> 01:01:10,484
I hope there's someone.

1289
01:01:10,485 --> 01:01:12,015
Someone tried setting me up with someone.

1290
01:01:12,215 --> 01:01:14,555
When he heard about my job,

1291
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:16,755
he didn't want to meet me.

1292
01:01:16,995 --> 01:01:19,465
He thought a ghost might follow him if we met.

1293
01:01:19,895 --> 01:01:21,565
That's what I heard.

1294
01:01:22,995 --> 01:01:24,735
I'm a shaman who exorcises ghosts.

1295
01:01:25,195 --> 01:01:27,505
I perform exorcisms. I don't practice black magic.

1296
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:32,775
At that time, I realized that...

1297
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:38,645
that's the prejudice I must face and overcome.

1298
01:01:40,385 --> 01:01:42,015
If I had a choice,

1299
01:01:42,215 --> 01:01:45,154
I wish I had met many people, had a lot of fun,

1300
01:01:45,155 --> 01:01:46,925
enjoyed my life,

1301
01:01:47,085 --> 01:01:48,685
and gotten married before I became a shaman.

1302
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,555
If I had a choice.

1303
01:01:50,825 --> 01:01:56,294
(Ra Yun sometimes dreams of having a normal life.)

1304
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,395
So...

1305
01:01:58,895 --> 01:02:01,204
I hope there's a nice person...

1306
01:02:01,205 --> 01:02:03,134
who can understand me.

1307
01:02:03,135 --> 01:02:05,905
Whether things work out well with him or not,

1308
01:02:07,005 --> 01:02:09,115
it'll give me courage for the future.

1309
01:02:09,215 --> 01:02:11,215
That's what I thought.

1310
01:02:20,285 --> 01:02:22,454
She mustered up her courage to appear in the show.

1311
01:02:22,455 --> 01:02:23,595
Right.

1312
01:02:25,865 --> 01:02:27,224
She must've been hurt.

1313
01:02:27,225 --> 01:02:28,394
(Ra Yun is facing the world after overcoming her pain.)

1314
01:02:28,395 --> 01:02:30,395
You can do it.

1315
01:02:31,265 --> 01:02:33,065
How? How can you prove it?

1316
01:02:33,465 --> 01:02:34,934
- Why do you think so? - Why do you...

1317
01:02:34,935 --> 01:02:36,974
- Why do you think so? Why? - Why do you...

1318
01:02:36,975 --> 01:02:38,275
I understand you, at least.

1319
01:02:38,475 --> 01:02:39,605
- Let's go. It's cold. - Yes.

1320
01:02:40,475 --> 01:02:41,605
Shall we go now?

1321
01:02:45,785 --> 01:02:48,645
What if I say I'm a tarot master?

1322
01:02:51,085 --> 01:02:52,855
It suits you.

1323
01:02:54,925 --> 01:02:57,055
What if I say I'm a saju reader?

1324
01:02:57,395 --> 01:02:59,594
I'd think I knew it.

1325
01:02:59,595 --> 01:03:00,825
- Really? - Yes.

1326
01:03:01,465 --> 01:03:03,164
What if I say I'm a shaman?

1327
01:03:03,165 --> 01:03:04,765
I'd say, "I wished it wasn't you."

1328
01:03:05,905 --> 01:03:08,134
- "Please." - Hey! No, I mean...

1329
01:03:08,135 --> 01:03:11,705
I mean... Why did you wish it wasn't me?

1330
01:03:12,035 --> 01:03:14,374
I think I'll feel hurt if you turn out to be a shaman.

1331
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:15,445
Why?

1332
01:03:16,245 --> 01:03:17,574
I want to tell you now...

1333
01:03:17,575 --> 01:03:19,685
before you get hurt.

1334
01:03:20,185 --> 01:03:21,785
But I can't.

1335
01:03:24,985 --> 01:03:26,754
Bye, everyone. I hope you have a happy life.

1336
01:03:26,755 --> 01:03:29,194
(The anxious, yet romantic feelings are growing.)

1337
01:03:29,195 --> 01:03:30,255
This is nice.

1338
01:03:31,825 --> 01:03:33,064
She was so cool.

1339
01:03:33,065 --> 01:03:35,225
She knows how to express herself.

1340
01:03:35,525 --> 01:03:36,735
She doesn't hold grudges.

1341
01:03:37,435 --> 01:03:39,034
I think she's the best...

1342
01:03:39,035 --> 01:03:40,805
in every way.

1343
01:03:41,105 --> 01:03:42,435
Should I say I'm drawn to her?

1344
01:03:43,705 --> 01:03:46,745
(After a long day, they're going back to the house.)

1345
01:03:48,745 --> 01:03:49,915
What's up with this road?

1346
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,544
You're a good driver.

1347
01:03:53,545 --> 01:03:54,915
- Who? Me? - Yes.

1348
01:03:55,245 --> 01:03:56,585
I'm just decent.

1349
01:03:58,455 --> 01:03:59,854
You're a really good driver.

1350
01:03:59,855 --> 01:04:02,155
He was a good driver. It surprised me.

1351
01:04:02,795 --> 01:04:05,495
When I saw how he drove,

1352
01:04:05,725 --> 01:04:07,265
I became sure about his occupation.

1353
01:04:08,025 --> 01:04:09,465
He must be a shaman.

1354
01:04:11,065 --> 01:04:14,165
Shamans drive in a particular way.

1355
01:04:14,805 --> 01:04:16,875
When people drive on a narrow road...

1356
01:04:17,235 --> 01:04:20,244
Like when I take a cab to go to a shrine or prayer site,

1357
01:04:20,245 --> 01:04:22,404
the drivers hesitate for a moment.

1358
01:04:22,405 --> 01:04:25,615
But shamans go to places like that very often.

1359
01:04:25,845 --> 01:04:28,484
So they just check the road once and speed up without hesitation.

1360
01:04:28,485 --> 01:04:30,385
That's how he drove.

1361
01:04:30,615 --> 01:04:32,155
So I thought...

1362
01:04:32,655 --> 01:04:33,855
he must be a shaman.

1363
01:04:34,155 --> 01:04:36,625
I was very sure.

1364
01:04:38,025 --> 01:04:39,195
He drove without hesitation.

1365
01:04:42,835 --> 01:04:44,734
Because they go to many prayer sites.

1366
01:04:44,735 --> 01:04:46,365
And the roads are usually narrow.

1367
01:04:47,335 --> 01:04:49,005
I didn't even think of that.

1368
01:04:50,575 --> 01:04:53,074
- I didn't think of that. - I know.

1369
01:04:53,075 --> 01:04:54,475
(It's something only shamans can notice.)

1370
01:04:55,575 --> 01:04:58,875
I was really curious about your job until yesterday.

1371
01:04:59,845 --> 01:05:02,384
Now, it doesn't matter.

1372
01:05:02,385 --> 01:05:03,415
Why?

1373
01:05:04,155 --> 01:05:05,315
It's just that...

1374
01:05:07,455 --> 01:05:09,355
I think I'll be fine, whatever it is.

1375
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:14,924
When we were talking about trivial things...

1376
01:05:14,925 --> 01:05:17,495
on our way to our date,

1377
01:05:17,795 --> 01:05:19,665
I was so happy.

1378
01:05:20,565 --> 01:05:22,005
I had fun today.

1379
01:05:23,705 --> 01:05:26,775
(Meanwhile, Yun Jeong and Ho Am visit a wine bar.)

1380
01:05:29,315 --> 01:05:30,815
It's so quiet here.

1381
01:05:32,445 --> 01:05:33,784
I can't hear a thing.

1382
01:05:33,785 --> 01:05:35,784
The atmosphere is different from earlier.

1383
01:05:35,785 --> 01:05:37,314
- I think it feels quieter... - Yes.

1384
01:05:37,315 --> 01:05:39,085
because it's a small place.

1385
01:05:40,285 --> 01:05:41,954
- May I ask who ordered this? - That's me.

1386
01:05:41,955 --> 01:05:45,754
(The wine they ordered is served in the mysterious atmosphere.)

1387
01:05:45,755 --> 01:05:47,064
- Thank you. - Enjoy it.

1388
01:05:47,065 --> 01:05:48,065
Okay.

1389
01:05:48,395 --> 01:05:51,965
(Will a glass of wine make them feel less awkward?)

1390
01:05:55,135 --> 01:05:56,235
Let's clink glasses.

1391
01:05:56,335 --> 01:05:57,475
(Clinking)

1392
01:06:07,315 --> 01:06:10,154
Our seats were too close.

1393
01:06:10,155 --> 01:06:13,325
The table was this small.

1394
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:15,154
I was used to having more space between us,

1395
01:06:15,155 --> 01:06:16,725
but the distance suddenly felt so much smaller.

1396
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:20,724
How should I put it?

1397
01:06:20,725 --> 01:06:23,195
It suddenly became romantic.

1398
01:06:25,495 --> 01:06:29,475
I think wine suits you today.

1399
01:06:30,775 --> 01:06:32,405
If we are to have a drink.

1400
01:06:32,975 --> 01:06:36,444
I like it. I did want to have wine.

1401
01:06:36,445 --> 01:06:37,674
Right? I feel like having wine.

1402
01:06:37,675 --> 01:06:38,715
It suits you.

1403
01:06:43,455 --> 01:06:44,515
How is the wine?

1404
01:06:44,955 --> 01:06:46,125
- The wine? - Is it good?

1405
01:06:48,285 --> 01:06:49,895
What was that?

1406
01:06:49,955 --> 01:06:53,325
(Ho Am spoke without honorifics.)

1407
01:06:53,825 --> 01:06:54,864
He made a big move...

1408
01:06:54,865 --> 01:06:56,094
- while being gentle. - Yes.

1409
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,565
- "Is it good?" - "Is it good?"

1410
01:06:58,565 --> 01:07:01,065
There's progress in their relationship.

1411
01:07:03,605 --> 01:07:05,605
(Is it good?)

1412
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:08,105
Hold on.

1413
01:07:08,475 --> 01:07:09,575
I forgot what I wanted to say.

1414
01:07:17,315 --> 01:07:18,385
What?

1415
01:07:21,085 --> 01:07:25,795
(Yun Jeong's eyes shift.)

1416
01:07:30,195 --> 01:07:32,935
(Laughing)

1417
01:07:36,505 --> 01:07:38,435
Why do I suddenly feel nervous now that I'm here?

1418
01:07:39,005 --> 01:07:40,374
- Over there... - It's...

1419
01:07:40,375 --> 01:07:43,475
Over there, I didn't feel nervous.

1420
01:07:45,985 --> 01:07:47,485
Is it because the place is decorated?

1421
01:07:47,645 --> 01:07:49,015
Is it because we're drinking wine?

1422
01:07:51,015 --> 01:07:52,485
You know,

1423
01:07:52,885 --> 01:07:55,154
I think I become awkward...

1424
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:56,355
when I begin to like someone.

1425
01:07:58,295 --> 01:08:01,824
I talk less and make less eye...

1426
01:08:01,825 --> 01:08:03,835
No, we did make eye contact.

1427
01:08:05,035 --> 01:08:06,665
But I was out of it.

1428
01:08:07,105 --> 01:08:10,535
There wasn't even music. It was so quiet. Seriously.

1429
01:08:11,575 --> 01:08:13,105
I could only hear our breaths.

1430
01:08:15,705 --> 01:08:17,874
- What? - I don't know.

1431
01:08:17,875 --> 01:08:19,745
(Her cheeks become red due to embarrassment.)

1432
01:08:28,285 --> 01:08:30,794
It has only been a day,

1433
01:08:30,795 --> 01:08:32,195
but how does it feel?

1434
01:08:33,225 --> 01:08:34,295
How does it feel?

1435
01:08:35,825 --> 01:08:38,195
Do you have the desire to date someone?

1436
01:08:39,465 --> 01:08:41,265
(Well...)

1437
01:08:46,105 --> 01:08:47,375
I think so.

1438
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,015
- Really? - Yes.

1439
01:08:56,955 --> 01:08:58,315
When I entered the room,

1440
01:09:00,585 --> 01:09:01,654
I hoped...

1441
01:09:01,655 --> 01:09:04,325
that there'd be someone for me.

1442
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:07,195
I had that desire even before the shoot began.

1443
01:09:07,995 --> 01:09:11,934
Right. Someone in this profession will understand me more.

1444
01:09:11,935 --> 01:09:14,135
Yes. That's right.

1445
01:09:15,465 --> 01:09:17,104
Shall I call it the same industry?

1446
01:09:17,105 --> 01:09:20,105
Have you dated someone in the same field?

1447
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:24,245
- No. - Then...

1448
01:09:24,615 --> 01:09:29,145
Then people you've dated were unrelated to this field.

1449
01:09:29,455 --> 01:09:30,585
- Yes. - How was it?

1450
01:09:31,385 --> 01:09:32,615
Wasn't it hard?

1451
01:09:34,955 --> 01:09:37,954
It was hard. There was no one I could sympathize with.

1452
01:09:37,955 --> 01:09:39,224
It's hard to bring up the topic.

1453
01:09:39,225 --> 01:09:41,164
That's right.

1454
01:09:41,165 --> 01:09:42,225
There was no one.

1455
01:09:43,535 --> 01:09:44,635
Yes.

1456
01:09:44,835 --> 01:09:47,365
There was no one I could talk to...

1457
01:09:47,665 --> 01:09:48,835
about this topic.

1458
01:09:51,205 --> 01:09:52,335
Not even one?

1459
01:09:55,805 --> 01:09:58,275
There was a woman I liked.

1460
01:10:01,745 --> 01:10:03,984
We went along when I came back after my military service.

1461
01:10:03,985 --> 01:10:07,125
We liked each other.

1462
01:10:07,355 --> 01:10:09,285
What we had was budding into a relationship.

1463
01:10:09,425 --> 01:10:11,524
Things continued that way.

1464
01:10:11,525 --> 01:10:13,825
But since I was going through self-loss,

1465
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:15,665
I couldn't do anything.

1466
01:10:16,495 --> 01:10:18,064
I couldn't date someone as I wanted.

1467
01:10:18,065 --> 01:10:20,605
Even if I liked someone, I couldn't confess my love.

1468
01:10:21,105 --> 01:10:22,804
(Ho Am in university)

1469
01:10:22,805 --> 01:10:25,005
To date someone,

1470
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:27,305
I needed to tell the truth.

1471
01:10:29,145 --> 01:10:32,545
I really liked her, but I couldn't tell her in the end.

1472
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:34,514
I couldn't tell her that I was experiencing self-loss...

1473
01:10:34,515 --> 01:10:36,355
and that I would soon become a shaman.

1474
01:10:38,855 --> 01:10:41,785
Back then, I thought, "Will I be single all my life?"

1475
01:10:41,885 --> 01:10:43,194
I had that thought.

1476
01:10:43,195 --> 01:10:44,325
I was disappointed.

1477
01:10:44,855 --> 01:10:47,125
"In any case, I'm a shaman."

1478
01:10:47,465 --> 01:10:50,135
"Will anyone be able to accept me?"

1479
01:10:50,335 --> 01:10:51,765
I had that thought.

1480
01:10:53,105 --> 01:10:56,504
Many acquaintances of mine don't know...

1481
01:10:56,505 --> 01:10:57,935
that I became a shaman.

1482
01:10:58,005 --> 01:11:00,205
Only 2 or 3 people know.

1483
01:11:00,375 --> 01:11:01,745
I thought about telling them,

1484
01:11:02,275 --> 01:11:04,445
but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

1485
01:11:05,145 --> 01:11:06,245
And...

1486
01:11:07,285 --> 01:11:08,985
I was just scared.

1487
01:11:09,215 --> 01:11:12,614
I was scared of the way people would look at me...

1488
01:11:12,615 --> 01:11:15,255
upon finding out about this.

1489
01:11:16,955 --> 01:11:19,965
As I talked to Yun Jeong,

1490
01:11:20,095 --> 01:11:21,225
I realized...

1491
01:11:21,525 --> 01:11:23,365
that it was my first time...

1492
01:11:23,795 --> 01:11:25,264
telling someone,

1493
01:11:25,265 --> 01:11:26,705
"Things have been tough."

1494
01:11:27,105 --> 01:11:29,035
I found that special.

1495
01:11:30,605 --> 01:11:33,045
How about you, Yun Jeong? Do you share your worries?

1496
01:11:33,245 --> 01:11:35,275
- Do you keep them to yourself? - As for me...

1497
01:11:37,745 --> 01:11:40,615
I used to share my worries.

1498
01:11:43,355 --> 01:11:45,315
But it's becoming hard.

1499
01:11:45,615 --> 01:11:48,424
Even when I tell people, they don't understand.

1500
01:11:48,425 --> 01:11:49,755
They never understand.

1501
01:11:50,355 --> 01:11:52,625
As time goes on, it becomes worse.

1502
01:11:53,025 --> 01:11:55,224
In the beginning,

1503
01:11:55,225 --> 01:11:57,165
people pretended to listen.

1504
01:11:57,935 --> 01:11:59,095
It doesn't work anymore.

1505
01:12:00,505 --> 01:12:02,934
So now, it feels awkward...

1506
01:12:02,935 --> 01:12:06,205
to share sincere stories about myself.

1507
01:12:08,345 --> 01:12:10,875
Spiritual stories and internal stories...

1508
01:12:12,015 --> 01:12:13,744
were things I really wanted to share.

1509
01:12:13,745 --> 01:12:14,915
I had so much desire...

1510
01:12:16,785 --> 01:12:20,425
to have such conversations with someone in my age group.

1511
01:12:21,225 --> 01:12:24,855
I was desperate throughout the time I studied astrology.

1512
01:12:26,365 --> 01:12:30,765
When Ho Am was next to me, I wondered,

1513
01:12:32,035 --> 01:12:33,964
"Can I be myself..."

1514
01:12:33,965 --> 01:12:37,475
"without making too much effort when I'm with him?"

1515
01:12:38,205 --> 01:12:40,875
That was what I liked.

1516
01:12:44,015 --> 01:12:46,885
- It must be hard. - I wonder how it feels.

1517
01:12:47,445 --> 01:12:49,184
They must be so lonely.

1518
01:12:49,185 --> 01:12:51,015
It's something all of them say.

1519
01:12:51,615 --> 01:12:54,825
They rarely meet people who are in the same profession.

1520
01:12:55,225 --> 01:12:57,055
That's something all of them agree on.

1521
01:12:57,555 --> 01:13:00,524
Regardless of the result, their date was...

1522
01:13:00,525 --> 01:13:03,535
- therapeutic to both of them. - That's right.

1523
01:13:07,605 --> 01:13:11,375
Now that I'm here,

1524
01:13:11,605 --> 01:13:13,445
I'm beginning to open up more.

1525
01:13:14,275 --> 01:13:17,174
- Everyone understands. - That's right.

1526
01:13:17,175 --> 01:13:18,744
- So little by little... - One word is enough...

1527
01:13:18,745 --> 01:13:19,944
- to make us understand. - Everyone knows...

1528
01:13:19,945 --> 01:13:21,015
what I'm talking about.

1529
01:13:23,255 --> 01:13:26,855
It's something I'm unfamiliar with.

1530
01:13:27,225 --> 01:13:29,255
"What? Why is this person so receptive?"

1531
01:13:30,055 --> 01:13:31,655
- It's like that. - That's right.

1532
01:13:33,965 --> 01:13:36,695
- I find it fascinating. - Yes.

1533
01:13:41,805 --> 01:13:43,075
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1534
01:13:46,545 --> 01:13:52,945
(For the first time, they met someone who understood them.)

1535
01:13:57,685 --> 01:13:58,915
I had no idea.

1536
01:14:04,725 --> 01:14:06,224
It's good to see you. Did you wait long?

1537
01:14:06,225 --> 01:14:07,595
- Yes. - I see.

1538
01:14:08,925 --> 01:14:10,495
- Let's go over there. - Okay.

1539
01:14:10,665 --> 01:14:12,634
(Pick Your Fate Date: Hong Yu Ra and Ha Byeong Yeol)

1540
01:14:12,635 --> 01:14:13,764
It was you, Yu Ra.

1541
01:14:13,765 --> 01:14:15,064
(Pick Your Fate Date: Hong Yu Ra and Ha Byeong Yeol)

1542
01:14:15,065 --> 01:14:16,975
- It was you, Byeong Yeol. - Yes.

1543
01:14:17,275 --> 01:14:20,045
- You picked the travel photos. - Yes.

1544
01:14:20,505 --> 01:14:21,874
Do you like to travel?

1545
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:24,045
- Yes, I like to travel. - I see.

1546
01:14:25,075 --> 01:14:26,484
I like nature a lot.

1547
01:14:26,485 --> 01:14:27,944
- You like nature. - Yes.

1548
01:14:27,945 --> 01:14:29,115
Where were these photos taken?

1549
01:14:29,315 --> 01:14:30,985
This is Ha Long Bay, Hanoi.

1550
01:14:31,985 --> 01:14:33,754
That's Hong Kong or Macau.

1551
01:14:33,755 --> 01:14:35,055
- Macau. - Yes.

1552
01:14:35,355 --> 01:14:36,355
You look cold.

1553
01:14:36,356 --> 01:14:38,154
- I'm okay. Yes. - Are you wearing something inside?

1554
01:14:38,155 --> 01:14:39,824
These are fleece-lined leggings.

1555
01:14:39,825 --> 01:14:40,965
Is that so?

1556
01:14:41,565 --> 01:14:42,765
How nice.

1557
01:14:45,335 --> 01:14:47,065
- Shall we go? - Okay.

1558
01:14:48,835 --> 01:14:50,574
I'm not trying to be cool or anything.

1559
01:14:50,575 --> 01:14:51,834
I have two hot packs.

1560
01:14:51,835 --> 01:14:53,175
- Please use one. - Thank you.

1561
01:14:55,445 --> 01:14:58,245
(Today's date Byeong Yeol prepared)

1562
01:15:03,255 --> 01:15:05,684
You'll choose the aroma that suits your tastes...

1563
01:15:05,685 --> 01:15:08,225
and make your own perfumed hand cream.

1564
01:15:09,655 --> 01:15:13,025
Write down the concept on the right.

1565
01:15:13,565 --> 01:15:16,434
People find the concept hard, so I prepared the keywords.

1566
01:15:16,435 --> 01:15:18,234
Do I choose the aroma...

1567
01:15:18,235 --> 01:15:20,535
that'll suit me or the other?

1568
01:15:21,365 --> 01:15:22,904
- How should we do it? - How...

1569
01:15:22,905 --> 01:15:25,034
Shall we make something that'll suit each other?

1570
01:15:25,035 --> 01:15:26,275
- Okay. - Okay.

1571
01:15:26,445 --> 01:15:28,204
(Hong Yu Ra, Ha Byeong Yeol)

1572
01:15:28,205 --> 01:15:32,515
(They make hand cream for each other.)

1573
01:15:35,645 --> 01:15:38,355
(Hesitant)

1574
01:15:38,855 --> 01:15:39,855
All right.

1575
01:15:39,856 --> 01:15:42,355
- I gave you the plaque. - Yes.

1576
01:15:42,855 --> 01:15:46,194
I did it after you exchanged it...

1577
01:15:46,195 --> 01:15:47,724
- with Ho Am. - Yes.

1578
01:15:47,725 --> 01:15:49,265
- Right. - I knew that I wouldn't get it.

1579
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,595
(First impression selection)

1580
01:15:53,265 --> 01:15:57,475
(Ho Am gave Yu Ra his name plaque.)

1581
01:15:59,905 --> 01:16:01,245
Here you go.

1582
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:04,415
(Yu Ra chose Ho Am as well.)

1583
01:16:04,975 --> 01:16:08,015
(This man was disappointed.)

1584
01:16:08,715 --> 01:16:10,484
Look at his facial expression. My goodness.

1585
01:16:10,485 --> 01:16:11,884
He was making that facial expression.

1586
01:16:11,885 --> 01:16:13,554
I see that it was obvious.

1587
01:16:13,555 --> 01:16:15,154
- We didn't know it back then. - That's right.

1588
01:16:15,155 --> 01:16:16,284
You're right.

1589
01:16:16,285 --> 01:16:17,295
(They now know how devastated Byeong Yeol felt.)

1590
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:24,235
(Despite that, Byeong Yeol gave his plaque to Yu Ra.)

1591
01:16:26,805 --> 01:16:30,905
She was the one I wanted to talk to,

1592
01:16:31,475 --> 01:16:33,875
so I was happy to see her.

1593
01:16:34,275 --> 01:16:35,804
Time by ourselves is precious.

1594
01:16:35,805 --> 01:16:37,815
And it was our first time on a date outside.

1595
01:16:38,075 --> 01:16:42,114
I really wanted to focus on her.

1596
01:16:42,115 --> 01:16:44,515
It was time to get to know her,

1597
01:16:44,755 --> 01:16:46,185
so my expectations went up.

1598
01:16:47,085 --> 01:16:49,754
"I want to talk to her."

1599
01:16:49,755 --> 01:16:50,825
I had that thought.

1600
01:16:52,855 --> 01:16:55,225
- And I showed up. - What? Yes.

1601
01:16:56,025 --> 01:16:57,465
Yes, you did.

1602
01:16:58,365 --> 01:16:59,964
At first,

1603
01:16:59,965 --> 01:17:01,964
you seemed to be very taciturn.

1604
01:17:01,965 --> 01:17:03,165
- Me? - Yes.

1605
01:17:04,575 --> 01:17:08,705
I think I'm like that when I'm not close to someone.

1606
01:17:08,945 --> 01:17:11,075
Once I become close to someone,

1607
01:17:12,775 --> 01:17:15,885
I became chatty. I'm on the flippant side.

1608
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:19,014
- I also like being flippant. - Really?

1609
01:17:19,015 --> 01:17:20,454
- Yes. - That's nice.

1610
01:17:20,455 --> 01:17:22,455
In that case... How should I put it?

1611
01:17:22,955 --> 01:17:25,225
If you're okay with it,

1612
01:17:25,625 --> 01:17:27,764
- we can treat each other... - Let's do that.

1613
01:17:27,765 --> 01:17:29,095
- more comfortably. - Yes.

1614
01:17:29,695 --> 01:17:31,034
I like to pull pranks.

1615
01:17:31,035 --> 01:17:32,535
Is that so? What kind of pranks?

1616
01:17:32,765 --> 01:17:34,205
Useless pranks.

1617
01:17:34,565 --> 01:17:36,974
I pull annoying pranks.

1618
01:17:36,975 --> 01:17:37,975
- What was that? - Annoying pranks.

1619
01:17:37,976 --> 01:17:39,474
- You pull annoying pranks? - Yes.

1620
01:17:39,475 --> 01:17:40,904
Then you should take a beating.

1621
01:17:40,905 --> 01:17:42,375
(My goodness)

1622
01:17:47,715 --> 01:17:48,945
(Working hard)

1623
01:17:51,185 --> 01:17:52,215
(Glancing over)

1624
01:17:53,425 --> 01:17:54,425
Don't look.

1625
01:17:55,225 --> 01:17:56,225
Okay.

1626
01:17:57,095 --> 01:17:58,425
You can look.

1627
01:18:01,565 --> 01:18:02,994
(They're curious about the scent the other person chose.)

1628
01:18:02,995 --> 01:18:04,034
I...

1629
01:18:04,035 --> 01:18:06,195
- don't know if you'll like it. - Do we write it here?

1630
01:18:06,835 --> 01:18:10,435
This is your vibe in my opinion.

1631
01:18:10,975 --> 01:18:12,775
- "Winter." - I wrote it down.

1632
01:18:14,045 --> 01:18:15,345
Do I suit winter?

1633
01:18:16,545 --> 01:18:19,275
How should I put it? The scent of glass.

1634
01:18:20,345 --> 01:18:22,044
I think it suits you.

1635
01:18:22,045 --> 01:18:23,045
Glass?

1636
01:18:23,855 --> 01:18:26,554
You just...

1637
01:18:26,555 --> 01:18:28,955
(She resembles the clear glass.)

1638
01:18:29,225 --> 01:18:32,095
How should I put it? You're pure.

1639
01:18:32,795 --> 01:18:35,564
A big window is atmospheric.

1640
01:18:35,565 --> 01:18:36,695
- It's nice. - Yes.

1641
01:18:38,195 --> 01:18:39,764
(Yu Ra's idea of Byeong Yeol's vibe)

1642
01:18:39,765 --> 01:18:40,805
"Autumn forest?"

1643
01:18:43,435 --> 01:18:46,405
It's like the forest and grass.

1644
01:18:47,575 --> 01:18:49,905
Masculine. Autumn.

1645
01:18:51,445 --> 01:18:54,385
Byeong Yeol has an autumn vibe.

1646
01:18:54,515 --> 01:18:56,085
He's like the autumn man.

1647
01:18:57,415 --> 01:19:00,325
Because he was atmospheric,

1648
01:19:00,585 --> 01:19:03,595
I recommended the scent of grass and forest.

1649
01:19:05,855 --> 01:19:08,094
I just added my favourite scent.

1650
01:19:08,095 --> 01:19:09,195
Thank you.

1651
01:19:09,965 --> 01:19:12,094
- I don't think you like it. - I don't know the scents very well.

1652
01:19:12,095 --> 01:19:13,235
- Is that so? - Yes.

1653
01:19:14,505 --> 01:19:18,135
(It's time to add the scent and complete the hand cream.)

1654
01:19:19,475 --> 01:19:21,704
I feel like I'm in a lab.

1655
01:19:21,705 --> 01:19:22,705
That's right.

1656
01:19:23,975 --> 01:19:25,375
Although it's your first time,

1657
01:19:26,215 --> 01:19:28,685
you're making it very well.

1658
01:19:29,915 --> 01:19:30,915
Are you nearly done?

1659
01:19:31,415 --> 01:19:33,884
- I think so. - I'm nearly done too.

1660
01:19:33,885 --> 01:19:35,885
(The hand cream is nearly done.)

1661
01:19:35,985 --> 01:19:38,195
Please give a name to the hand cream...

1662
01:19:38,295 --> 01:19:40,825
that suits the scent.

1663
01:19:45,765 --> 01:19:46,805
What should I name it?

1664
01:19:47,835 --> 01:19:48,935
I wrote it down.

1665
01:19:49,265 --> 01:19:50,275
- Already? - Yes.

1666
01:19:50,575 --> 01:19:51,575
How did you do it so fast?

1667
01:19:51,576 --> 01:19:52,974
- I thought about it. - Did you do it halfheartedly?

1668
01:19:52,975 --> 01:19:54,205
No, I really didn't.

1669
01:19:54,405 --> 01:19:56,275
I need to think about it.

1670
01:19:57,575 --> 01:19:59,015
I put my effort into it.

1671
01:19:59,415 --> 01:20:01,415
I thought, "This is her vibe."

1672
01:20:01,885 --> 01:20:04,115
- I think you'll like it. - Really?

1673
01:20:04,655 --> 01:20:07,224
I'll show you, but you can't use a similar name.

1674
01:20:07,225 --> 01:20:08,225
- Will you be okay with that? - Yes.

1675
01:20:08,226 --> 01:20:10,094
I named it Yu Ra Malone.

1676
01:20:10,095 --> 01:20:11,254
(Yu Ra Malone)

1677
01:20:11,255 --> 01:20:12,255
Yu Ra Malone.

1678
01:20:13,665 --> 01:20:14,765
It's nice, right?

1679
01:20:15,665 --> 01:20:16,934
Like Jo Malone?

1680
01:20:16,935 --> 01:20:18,134
He's witty.

1681
01:20:18,135 --> 01:20:19,235
(The vibe of a familiar perfume brand)

1682
01:20:19,635 --> 01:20:21,664
- The famous perfume brand. - Yes.

1683
01:20:21,665 --> 01:20:23,705
It's a good idea. Yu Ra Number Five.

1684
01:20:26,175 --> 01:20:29,805
(Which name did Yu Ra give to Byeong Yeol's hand cream?)

1685
01:20:33,845 --> 01:20:34,845
May I take a look?

1686
01:20:37,085 --> 01:20:38,115
This is...

1687
01:20:38,985 --> 01:20:40,154
(Ha Likey Yeol)

1688
01:20:40,155 --> 01:20:41,224
- I like it. - Do you like it?

1689
01:20:41,225 --> 01:20:43,154
- I like it. - Thank you.

1690
01:20:43,155 --> 01:20:44,155
All right.

1691
01:20:44,156 --> 01:20:45,195
(He can't help but like the name.)

1692
01:20:46,225 --> 01:20:47,694
It smells nice.

1693
01:20:47,695 --> 01:20:48,964
It's cool.

1694
01:20:48,965 --> 01:20:50,434
I chose cool scents.

1695
01:20:50,435 --> 01:20:52,965
(They finished making their unique hand cream.)

1696
01:20:55,535 --> 01:20:56,605
It smells nice.

1697
01:20:57,505 --> 01:20:59,705
I'm satisfied. Seriously.

1698
01:21:00,905 --> 01:21:02,945
Hold on. If it isn't too much...

1699
01:21:05,615 --> 01:21:06,615
Okay.

1700
01:21:10,815 --> 01:21:12,115
- It's nice. - Yes.

1701
01:21:17,525 --> 01:21:19,595
(Surprised)

1702
01:21:20,865 --> 01:21:22,424
His nose touched her hand.

1703
01:21:22,425 --> 01:21:25,095
Byeong Yeol is pretty good at flirting.

1704
01:21:25,195 --> 01:21:27,334
- Really? - Really? How so?

1705
01:21:27,335 --> 01:21:29,535
Smelling someone's hand...

1706
01:21:29,665 --> 01:21:31,375
is a burdensome gesture.

1707
01:21:31,835 --> 01:21:33,204
It isn't something people do often.

1708
01:21:33,205 --> 01:21:34,205
Like this.

1709
01:21:34,605 --> 01:21:35,704
This is acceptable.

1710
01:21:35,705 --> 01:21:38,415
But you shouldn't do this out of the blue.

1711
01:21:38,615 --> 01:21:40,584
You shouldn't do this.

1712
01:21:40,585 --> 01:21:43,245
It's burdensome.

1713
01:21:43,515 --> 01:21:45,955
Men should remember that.

1714
01:21:46,055 --> 01:21:47,525
He does it naturally.

1715
01:21:50,255 --> 01:21:51,625
- It's nice. - Yes.

1716
01:21:55,925 --> 01:21:58,334
Isn't the scent too strong? Is it okay?

1717
01:21:58,335 --> 01:22:00,365
Yes. It's just right.

1718
01:22:02,205 --> 01:22:03,975
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1719
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:07,145
Thank you so much for spending time with me. I mean it.

1720
01:22:10,075 --> 01:22:12,815
When I talk to you,

1721
01:22:13,585 --> 01:22:16,745
I can tell that we have many things...

1722
01:22:17,715 --> 01:22:18,715
in common.

1723
01:22:18,716 --> 01:22:21,285
You seem to be quite cautious.

1724
01:22:22,425 --> 01:22:25,295
You seem to have your own world.

1725
01:22:26,925 --> 01:22:29,794
I'm rational...

1726
01:22:29,795 --> 01:22:32,035
and sentimental at the same time.

1727
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,364
That's right. You're rational...

1728
01:22:34,365 --> 01:22:35,365
- and sentimental. - Yes.

1729
01:22:35,465 --> 01:22:38,675
I think you and I are similar...

1730
01:22:39,205 --> 01:22:42,605
in those three aspects.

1731
01:22:44,615 --> 01:22:47,015
I think a comfortable relationship like that...

1732
01:22:47,815 --> 01:22:51,155
gives you stability.

1733
01:22:51,955 --> 01:22:56,185
I expected that from Byeong Yeol.

1734
01:22:57,155 --> 01:22:59,955
(Preselection)

1735
01:23:04,635 --> 01:23:08,764
(I'll be drawn to the Black Cow,)

1736
01:23:08,765 --> 01:23:09,864
(in my opinion.)

1737
01:23:09,865 --> 01:23:13,174
(I like men with Water Energy.)

1738
01:23:13,175 --> 01:23:16,944
(He and I might think alike.)

1739
01:23:16,945 --> 01:23:18,544
(Black Cow)

1740
01:23:18,545 --> 01:23:19,945
(Based on his background,)

1741
01:23:20,545 --> 01:23:23,084
(we'll be on the same page when we talk.)

1742
01:23:23,085 --> 01:23:24,254
(Black Cow)

1743
01:23:24,255 --> 01:23:26,185
(He's trustworthy.)

1744
01:23:26,715 --> 01:23:29,985
(He has a lot of self-regulating energy.)

1745
01:23:30,495 --> 01:23:32,225
(I think he'll be nice.)

1746
01:23:32,595 --> 01:23:34,894
(The destined partner Yu Ra picked...)

1747
01:23:34,895 --> 01:23:36,265
(was the Black Cow.)

1748
01:23:39,465 --> 01:23:42,735
(Cows have deep and emotional eyes.)

1749
01:23:43,705 --> 01:23:47,505
(I think he'll have pretty eyes.)

1750
01:23:49,445 --> 01:23:54,885
(Is Byeong Yeol Black Cow as Yu Ra predicted?)

1751
01:24:00,825 --> 01:24:03,695
(Yu Gyeong waits for her date.)

1752
01:24:06,025 --> 01:24:08,995
It has been over three years since I went on a date.

1753
01:24:09,325 --> 01:24:11,095
It has almost been four years.

1754
01:24:12,795 --> 01:24:17,135
It's fascinating because I'm excited.

1755
01:24:17,235 --> 01:24:18,635
I'm curious about my date.

1756
01:24:20,345 --> 01:24:22,275
How will it be when I go on a date?

1757
01:24:24,545 --> 01:24:26,645
It might be unexpectedly fun.

1758
01:24:27,685 --> 01:24:29,945
(Someone approaches Yu Gyeong.)

1759
01:24:32,285 --> 01:24:36,055
- Hello. - Hello.

1760
01:24:36,325 --> 01:24:38,654
Hello. Today...

1761
01:24:38,655 --> 01:24:39,955
Gosh, you startled me.

1762
01:24:41,065 --> 01:24:44,894
I did think that I would've been happier...

1763
01:24:44,895 --> 01:24:46,865
to see Yun Jeong.

1764
01:24:47,335 --> 01:24:52,235
I was a bit surprised to see Yu Gyeong.

1765
01:24:54,005 --> 01:24:57,775
I didn't think that I'd start with Yu Gyeong.

1766
01:24:58,415 --> 01:25:02,014
It was an unexpected combination.

1767
01:25:02,015 --> 01:25:05,284
He was one of the people...

1768
01:25:05,285 --> 01:25:07,385
I haven't talked to.

1769
01:25:07,785 --> 01:25:09,955
So I thought, "Will this date be fun?"

1770
01:25:10,255 --> 01:25:13,154
"It's an unexpected chemistry. Will the conversation go well?"

1771
01:25:13,155 --> 01:25:14,695
I had many worries.

1772
01:25:15,495 --> 01:25:18,565
(The first meeting brings more worries.)

1773
01:25:19,295 --> 01:25:21,335
Do you like making things with your hands?

1774
01:25:21,435 --> 01:25:22,635
Yes, I do.

1775
01:25:23,065 --> 01:25:24,075
I'm glad to hear that.

1776
01:25:25,505 --> 01:25:27,975
What will it be? What will we do? I'm curious.

1777
01:25:29,045 --> 01:25:30,674
- I think you'll enjoy it. - Really?

1778
01:25:30,675 --> 01:25:33,274
It's something I haven't done before.

1779
01:25:33,275 --> 01:25:34,685
- Really? - It'll be fun to do it together.

1780
01:25:35,745 --> 01:25:37,085
- It'll be fun. - I can't wait.

1781
01:25:38,055 --> 01:25:39,184
(Staring)

1782
01:25:39,185 --> 01:25:40,185
Is it the sun?

1783
01:25:41,685 --> 01:25:42,725
Thank you.

1784
01:25:42,885 --> 01:25:45,624
You can do that since you're tall.

1785
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:46,654
Thank you.

1786
01:25:46,655 --> 01:25:47,865
Many people have used this feature.

1787
01:25:49,295 --> 01:25:50,295
My goodness.

1788
01:25:50,296 --> 01:25:52,165
(They ended up closing their distance.)

1789
01:25:52,435 --> 01:25:53,695
I see.

1790
01:25:57,605 --> 01:25:58,835
What's this?

1791
01:26:00,135 --> 01:26:02,644
If a man stands in front of me like that,

1792
01:26:02,645 --> 01:26:04,315
I'll find it burdensome.

1793
01:26:04,845 --> 01:26:07,484
"I get it, so please step aside now."

1794
01:26:07,485 --> 01:26:10,855
Since he's so tall, she's staring at his solar plexus.

1795
01:26:11,585 --> 01:26:12,585
"I'll do it."

1796
01:26:12,585 --> 01:26:13,585
(Between a good feeling and a burden)

1797
01:26:13,586 --> 01:26:15,254
You need to consider that.

1798
01:26:15,255 --> 01:26:16,954
- Yes. - It's hard.

1799
01:26:16,955 --> 01:26:19,254
(The world of flirting isn't easy.)

1800
01:26:19,255 --> 01:26:20,424
(Bakery workshop)

1801
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:23,725
(Bakery workshop is full of a sweet smell.)

1802
01:26:24,135 --> 01:26:27,664
(Pick Your Fate Date: Chae Yu Gyeong and Jung Hyeon U)

1803
01:26:27,665 --> 01:26:28,665
This way.

1804
01:26:29,265 --> 01:26:30,434
I think we can sit down.

1805
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:31,774
- Hello. - Hello.

1806
01:26:31,775 --> 01:26:32,775
Hello.

1807
01:26:35,245 --> 01:26:37,175
Today, the two of you...

1808
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:39,615
will make one dough.

1809
01:26:39,975 --> 01:26:42,514
So teamwork is required.

1810
01:26:42,515 --> 01:26:44,115
(Good teamwork is required for breadmaking.)

1811
01:26:44,955 --> 01:26:46,155
Is it your first time baking?

1812
01:26:46,915 --> 01:26:47,925
Yes.

1813
01:26:49,185 --> 01:26:50,355
What have you made?

1814
01:26:50,855 --> 01:26:53,595
I've made pizza bread and such.

1815
01:26:54,865 --> 01:26:56,595
I've also made a birthday cake.

1816
01:26:57,435 --> 01:26:59,334
A cake? Whose birthday was it?

1817
01:26:59,335 --> 01:27:00,805
It was my friend's birthday.

1818
01:27:02,035 --> 01:27:05,405
I've never baked for a woman.

1819
01:27:07,775 --> 01:27:11,715
You should just ignore such white lies.

1820
01:27:14,415 --> 01:27:17,354
He was asked whom he made the cake for,

1821
01:27:17,355 --> 01:27:20,354
and he said he made it for a guy.

1822
01:27:20,355 --> 01:27:21,525
That sounds weirder.

1823
01:27:21,855 --> 01:27:24,095
He must've learned how to bake at first because of a girl.

1824
01:27:24,525 --> 01:27:27,195
(Hyeon U got caught by Almighty Dong Yeob.)

1825
01:27:29,295 --> 01:27:30,495
Do you want to try and sift it?

1826
01:27:30,935 --> 01:27:32,035
- No. - Give it a try.

1827
01:27:33,035 --> 01:27:34,035
I'm curious.

1828
01:27:35,005 --> 01:27:36,005
I wonder...

1829
01:27:36,765 --> 01:27:37,975
- How much I won't spill? - Right.

1830
01:27:39,735 --> 01:27:42,005
(Shaking)

1831
01:27:43,505 --> 01:27:44,615
What? You're good at this.

1832
01:27:45,745 --> 01:27:47,715
(Feeling nervous)

1833
01:27:51,115 --> 01:27:52,155
I can do this much.

1834
01:27:52,315 --> 01:27:53,785
(Impressed)

1835
01:27:54,585 --> 01:27:56,685
Do you want to give it a try, stirring it to see how it feels?

1836
01:27:57,155 --> 01:27:58,295
It's your first time baking.

1837
01:27:59,855 --> 01:28:01,965
It looks like the goblin's magic club.

1838
01:28:04,595 --> 01:28:06,365
- It's becoming really thick. - Right.

1839
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:08,865
This is the batter, right?

1840
01:28:09,005 --> 01:28:10,035
Yes.

1841
01:28:10,205 --> 01:28:12,204
This will be poured into the mold.

1842
01:28:12,205 --> 01:28:13,975
(Looking intently)

1843
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:17,415
- It's tiring, right? - Yes.

1844
01:28:18,515 --> 01:28:20,045
- It's tiring, right? - Yes.

1845
01:28:20,745 --> 01:28:22,145
- It's tiring, right? - Yes.

1846
01:28:22,815 --> 01:28:23,845
My arm hurts.

1847
01:28:24,015 --> 01:28:25,984
- That's what I think. - Really?

1848
01:28:25,985 --> 01:28:27,014
(They feel comfortable being with each other.)

1849
01:28:27,015 --> 01:28:28,925
That was unexpected.

1850
01:28:28,985 --> 01:28:33,595
He carefully asked me if I wanted to try different things.

1851
01:28:33,895 --> 01:28:36,024
It made me think that he was...

1852
01:28:36,025 --> 01:28:38,195
even more warmhearted than expected.

1853
01:28:40,095 --> 01:28:41,504
I had that thought,

1854
01:28:41,505 --> 01:28:43,905
and most importantly, it felt really comfortable.

1855
01:28:44,675 --> 01:28:45,734
It's pretty, isn't it?

1856
01:28:45,735 --> 01:28:46,735
(While the cake they made together are being baked)

1857
01:28:46,736 --> 01:28:47,944
- It's really pretty. - It looks great.

1858
01:28:47,945 --> 01:28:48,975
Right.

1859
01:28:49,975 --> 01:28:51,675
- This is cute. - Right.

1860
01:28:52,945 --> 01:28:53,945
Gosh.

1861
01:28:54,685 --> 01:28:56,114
While it's being baked,

1862
01:28:56,115 --> 01:28:58,184
many of them write in the guest book.

1863
01:28:58,185 --> 01:28:59,515
- I see. - The guest book?

1864
01:29:01,455 --> 01:29:03,885
This one is cute. They must be a family.

1865
01:29:07,025 --> 01:29:10,024
(Getting the stickers that will be used to decorate it)

1866
01:29:10,025 --> 01:29:11,035
They're cute.

1867
01:29:12,095 --> 01:29:14,635
- The ones that look like us? - Shall we look for those?

1868
01:29:16,965 --> 01:29:18,674
I should find a colour that suits you as well.

1869
01:29:18,675 --> 01:29:19,834
Because you're bright.

1870
01:29:19,835 --> 01:29:22,174
(Hyeon U chose the yellow smiley face.)

1871
01:29:22,175 --> 01:29:23,205
Great.

1872
01:29:23,345 --> 01:29:24,615
- Because you're bright. - Great.

1873
01:29:25,215 --> 01:29:26,744
(The smiley that looks like bright Yu Gyeong)

1874
01:29:26,745 --> 01:29:27,815
I'll choose...

1875
01:29:28,445 --> 01:29:29,615
(Looking intently)

1876
01:29:30,145 --> 01:29:32,585
Your smile... Let me see your face.

1877
01:29:34,685 --> 01:29:35,685
Let me see your face.

1878
01:29:37,085 --> 01:29:39,255
- Show me your smile. - I'm not good at these things.

1879
01:29:39,495 --> 01:29:41,364
- Show me your smile. - I feel embarrassed.

1880
01:29:41,365 --> 01:29:42,424
You feel embarrassed?

1881
01:29:42,425 --> 01:29:43,994
(Hyeon U feels shy about looking each other in the eye.)

1882
01:29:43,995 --> 01:29:45,135
My face becomes like this.

1883
01:29:45,435 --> 01:29:46,565
Let me see.

1884
01:29:48,705 --> 01:29:50,465
- If you look at me... - Your face turned red.

1885
01:29:53,235 --> 01:29:54,405
I'll go with this one.

1886
01:29:55,705 --> 01:29:56,805
Like this?

1887
01:29:57,475 --> 01:29:58,744
Yes. You're like this.

1888
01:29:58,745 --> 01:29:59,745
(The smiley couple is put together.)

1889
01:29:59,745 --> 01:30:00,745
It does look like me.

1890
01:30:00,746 --> 01:30:02,785
Does it look like you? Why do I have such a twisted smile?

1891
01:30:02,885 --> 01:30:04,615
How is that a twisted smile?

1892
01:30:04,685 --> 01:30:06,085
My mouth is crooked.

1893
01:30:06,755 --> 01:30:10,794
- That's how big your smile is. - Really? Got it.

1894
01:30:10,795 --> 01:30:14,665
I really like talking with someone while looking in their eyes.

1895
01:30:14,865 --> 01:30:18,165
I think I really enjoyed those moments with her.

1896
01:30:18,435 --> 01:30:22,235
I don't know what Yu Gyeong would have felt,

1897
01:30:22,365 --> 01:30:25,575
but I felt really nervous, to be honest.

1898
01:30:27,905 --> 01:30:29,575
Why do they all look great with each other?

1899
01:30:30,745 --> 01:30:32,875
- He turned red. - He's really shy.

1900
01:30:33,515 --> 01:30:37,354
Originally, Hyeon U and Yu Gyeong...

1901
01:30:37,355 --> 01:30:39,054
- weren't interested in each other. - Right.

1902
01:30:39,055 --> 01:30:43,285
I think there will be a change between them after the date.

1903
01:30:43,655 --> 01:30:46,195
I think that Hyeon U...

1904
01:30:46,455 --> 01:30:49,365
- has developed feelings for her. - You're right.

1905
01:30:52,795 --> 01:30:54,865
Is there a profession you wish to avoid when meeting someone?

1906
01:30:55,105 --> 01:30:56,435
You might want to avoid it...

1907
01:30:56,535 --> 01:30:58,375
or be scared of it.

1908
01:30:59,135 --> 01:31:01,205
There isn't a profession I'm scared of.

1909
01:31:01,845 --> 01:31:04,814
But if our life patterns...

1910
01:31:04,815 --> 01:31:06,075
are too different,

1911
01:31:07,015 --> 01:31:08,215
I think I would...

1912
01:31:08,915 --> 01:31:11,785
put it into consideration before dating that person.

1913
01:31:13,855 --> 01:31:15,655
I was in the room alone...

1914
01:31:16,025 --> 01:31:17,255
and was confused about you.

1915
01:31:18,295 --> 01:31:20,295
Why couldn't I imagine what you could be?

1916
01:31:20,965 --> 01:31:22,895
This is how you get curious about people.

1917
01:31:23,995 --> 01:31:25,194
Who did you feel most certain about?

1918
01:31:25,195 --> 01:31:26,464
(The profession deduction of the two shamans begins.)

1919
01:31:26,465 --> 01:31:27,705
Ra Yun?

1920
01:31:29,505 --> 01:31:30,564
What do you expect her to be?

1921
01:31:30,565 --> 01:31:33,205
I think...

1922
01:31:33,375 --> 01:31:35,005
- she's a shaman. - Really?

1923
01:31:35,505 --> 01:31:37,545
It's her eyes.

1924
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:40,115
They really mesmerize you.

1925
01:31:46,715 --> 01:31:48,654
Ra Yun? I'm certain about Gang Won.

1926
01:31:48,655 --> 01:31:51,254
Gang Won? I think the same way about him.

1927
01:31:51,255 --> 01:31:52,725
- It's obvious. - Right.

1928
01:31:58,065 --> 01:32:01,235
(Shaman detector with 100 percent accuracy)

1929
01:32:01,805 --> 01:32:03,035
I almost fell for it.

1930
01:32:03,535 --> 01:32:05,635
- Right. - You two are shamans too.

1931
01:32:08,245 --> 01:32:09,345
But what if...

1932
01:32:10,175 --> 01:32:14,285
the gentlest person has the most overwhelming profession?

1933
01:32:16,015 --> 01:32:18,255
They would be serving the spirit of a general.

1934
01:32:19,455 --> 01:32:21,324
I think I'll be curious about them if there's a huge twist.

1935
01:32:21,325 --> 01:32:24,455
I wish for our professions to be revealed soon.

1936
01:32:25,355 --> 01:32:26,995
I wish for us to feel comfortable around each other.

1937
01:32:28,365 --> 01:32:30,165
I'm curious about that too.

1938
01:32:30,665 --> 01:32:33,295
There are people who read their own fortunes.

1939
01:32:34,135 --> 01:32:36,605
I want to stay next to them when they do that.

1940
01:32:37,205 --> 01:32:38,275
I want to see how it's done.

1941
01:32:38,635 --> 01:32:40,005
- "I want to see it too." - Right.

1942
01:32:40,075 --> 01:32:41,704
- There are different professions. - Right.

1943
01:32:41,705 --> 01:32:43,475
That is why I'm curious about...

1944
01:32:43,745 --> 01:32:45,445
their own methods.

1945
01:32:46,915 --> 01:32:49,984
It isn't easy to find people at our age...

1946
01:32:49,985 --> 01:32:51,614
- with these sorts of professions. - Right.

1947
01:32:51,615 --> 01:32:54,555
Gathering with people around our age with these professions?

1948
01:32:54,955 --> 01:32:56,385
- That can never happen. - Right.

1949
01:32:58,195 --> 01:33:00,124
I'm the most curious about that.

1950
01:33:00,125 --> 01:33:01,425
It isn't easy to ask and look for people like us.

1951
01:33:01,995 --> 01:33:02,995
Right.

1952
01:33:06,165 --> 01:33:08,234
How would others see us?

1953
01:33:08,235 --> 01:33:09,235
Right.

1954
01:33:10,265 --> 01:33:12,634
Should we ask the owner to guess our professions?

1955
01:33:12,635 --> 01:33:15,575
- Sure. - Try to guess our professions.

1956
01:33:18,175 --> 01:33:20,915
What do you think? Can you feel something from us?

1957
01:33:21,985 --> 01:33:24,584
I just have to guess your professions?

1958
01:33:24,585 --> 01:33:25,585
Yes.

1959
01:33:26,315 --> 01:33:29,785
(The owner starts deducing their professions as well.)

1960
01:33:30,555 --> 01:33:32,025
I think you're a nurse.

1961
01:33:32,395 --> 01:33:33,995
That really suits you.

1962
01:33:34,495 --> 01:33:36,095
- Really? - That really suits you.

1963
01:33:36,595 --> 01:33:39,694
A pretty nurse at a big hospital.

1964
01:33:39,695 --> 01:33:40,935
Really?

1965
01:33:41,265 --> 01:33:42,365
And you look like a doctor.

1966
01:33:42,435 --> 01:33:44,605
(Doctor, Nurse)

1967
01:33:44,975 --> 01:33:47,574
I think she was just trying to say something nice to us.

1968
01:33:47,575 --> 01:33:49,704
I've seen a lot of doctors these days.

1969
01:33:49,705 --> 01:33:51,374
- Really? - They looked just like him.

1970
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:54,075
- She just lost her credibility. - Weren't you a doctor?

1971
01:33:54,175 --> 01:33:55,785
- Credibility... - Gosh.

1972
01:33:56,285 --> 01:33:59,355
It must be because we are involved with matters of life and death.

1973
01:34:00,455 --> 01:34:01,455
I guess so.

1974
01:34:02,325 --> 01:34:03,754
- They are related. - What?

1975
01:34:03,755 --> 01:34:04,894
- Really? - They are life-saving professions.

1976
01:34:04,895 --> 01:34:06,894
Professions that heal the bodies and minds of others are...

1977
01:34:06,895 --> 01:34:08,164
- called life-saving professions. - Right.

1978
01:34:08,165 --> 01:34:10,894
Doctors, nurses, shamans,

1979
01:34:10,895 --> 01:34:13,134
and consultants are specified in the same category.

1980
01:34:13,135 --> 01:34:14,764
I see.

1981
01:34:14,765 --> 01:34:17,675
- She got it somewhat right then. - Right.

1982
01:34:19,935 --> 01:34:21,804
Do you have that kind of profession?

1983
01:34:21,805 --> 01:34:23,404
You are involved with life and death matters?

1984
01:34:23,405 --> 01:34:24,875
Well,

1985
01:34:26,115 --> 01:34:27,315
we are.

1986
01:34:28,815 --> 01:34:29,884
We are.

1987
01:34:29,885 --> 01:34:31,015
(Shocked)

1988
01:34:33,215 --> 01:34:34,325
Do I...

1989
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:41,640
Do I die?

1990
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:44,140
How can you ask that?

1991
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:46,610
- Won't we all die at some point? - Right.

1992
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:53,320
(The colourful cakes are ready.)

1993
01:34:54,850 --> 01:34:55,850
Click!

1994
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:00,320
- It's pretty, isn't it? - Yes.

1995
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:04,400
Thank you.

1996
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:07,970
All right.

1997
01:35:08,130 --> 01:35:09,629
Should we take a picture here in front of the mirror?

1998
01:35:09,630 --> 01:35:10,730
- The mirror? - Yes.

1999
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,100
Are you good at taking photos?

2000
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:15,469
- No. Are you? - Same here.

2001
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:16,540
I'm bad at taking photos too.

2002
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:20,010
In 1, 2, 3.

2003
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:28,890
(Hyeon U and Yu Gyeong's baking date was sweet and thrilling.)

2004
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:31,560
I love the atmosphere here.

2005
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,490
Do you like tea?

2006
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:36,460
Yes. I do.

2007
01:35:36,830 --> 01:35:37,999
Rooibos.

2008
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,330
- Rooibos. - Right.

2009
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:41,300
What's your favourite tea?

2010
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:44,000
I like chamomile tea...

2011
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,999
or similar types of tea.

2012
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,670
The ones that help you calm down.

2013
01:35:47,870 --> 01:35:49,740
You want those types of tea.

2014
01:35:50,170 --> 01:35:51,210
I need them.

2015
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:52,809
Of course.

2016
01:35:52,810 --> 01:35:54,339
- We need them. - Right.

2017
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:55,949
We really need them.

2018
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:57,409
Definitely.

2019
01:35:57,410 --> 01:35:59,779
Our profession is based on...

2020
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:01,720
consulting others.

2021
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:04,559
We hear about a lot of struggles.

2022
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:07,759
There's a sense of emptiness that can be felt after that.

2023
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:11,260
There definitely is this feeling of emptiness.

2024
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:12,800
How do you overcome that?

2025
01:36:16,830 --> 01:36:18,100
I have to move on to the next person.

2026
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:20,340
(Flustered)

2027
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:23,539
What if that was the last session of the day?

2028
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:25,840
If it was the last session of the day,

2029
01:36:27,610 --> 01:36:30,809
I think melting it away with something warm...

2030
01:36:30,810 --> 01:36:32,120
is the best thing to do these days.

2031
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:36,719
I've been taking baths in hot water...

2032
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:37,919
for a while these days.

2033
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:39,120
Do you usually wash up with cold water?

2034
01:36:41,330 --> 01:36:42,889
Well, I was talking about...

2035
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:44,700
hot water that makes you feel like you're melting.

2036
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:52,199
It's great to add in scents in the hot water.

2037
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:53,870
Scents? What kinds of scents?

2038
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:55,869
That ones that make bubbles. What were they called again?

2039
01:36:55,870 --> 01:36:57,370
Gosh, I was surprised.

2040
01:36:59,010 --> 01:37:00,079
What were you thinking?

2041
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,210
I thought you were talking about incense.

2042
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:03,650
- "What?" - No way!

2043
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:06,520
"Incense added to the water?"

2044
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:08,720
"That will definitely purify you." This was what I thought.

2045
01:37:10,150 --> 01:37:12,060
I was so surprised.

2046
01:37:13,660 --> 01:37:15,260
- She thought it was incense. - Incense?

2047
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:17,560
These two shamans are going back and forth.

2048
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:19,299
"Are you a shaman or not?"

2049
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:21,230
It feels like they are asking this to each other.

2050
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:23,400
- It isn't an ordinary date. - Right.

2051
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:26,270
- Scents that feel pleasant? - Right.

2052
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:30,910
This is funny just for us.

2053
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:38,550
(Where will their odd conversation lead them to?)

2054
01:37:39,550 --> 01:37:42,420
I prepared this for us.

2055
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:44,320
Gosh.

2056
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:46,890
- You got this yourself? - Yes.

2057
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:50,190
How is it?

2058
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,029
- What is it? - It's pretty, isn't it?

2059
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:54,360
Tiramisu? Gosh!

2060
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:57,530
Ta-da! Gosh!

2061
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:00,140
- I'm going to take another picture. - Sure.

2062
01:38:01,270 --> 01:38:02,470
I must take a picture of this.

2063
01:38:04,910 --> 01:38:08,179
(Ho Am's sweet surprise gift)

2064
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:09,710
- Gosh! - It's pretty, isn't it?

2065
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:10,980
Yes.

2066
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:13,519
Something was written on it.

2067
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:14,650
You're right.

2068
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:18,490
- Here. - "Have a heart-pounding time."

2069
01:38:19,820 --> 01:38:21,929
- Okay. - "Have a heart-pounding time."

2070
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:22,960
Okay.

2071
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:25,399
Shall we try it? I was told that we had to break into it.

2072
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:26,460
What?

2073
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
(Poking)

2074
01:38:28,001 --> 01:38:29,100
Is it frozen?

2075
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:30,870
- It has to be broken up. - Gosh.

2076
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,169
- Gosh. - The cream cheese is thick.

2077
01:38:33,170 --> 01:38:34,870
Right. It's thick.

2078
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:37,670
(Taking a bite)

2079
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,310
(Taking a bite)

2080
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,350
- Gosh, it's good. - It's chocolate.

2081
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:51,790
Usually, it doesn't have chocolate on top...

2082
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:53,859
and just has the powder sprinkled on top.

2083
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:54,930
Right.

2084
01:38:57,830 --> 01:39:00,099
This would really go well with Valentine's Day.

2085
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:01,200
- Right. - Right?

2086
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:03,670
It could work as a birthday cake too.

2087
01:39:04,030 --> 01:39:05,200
Right.

2088
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:09,239
Finding out about each other more through a date like this...

2089
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,379
before going back to the House is really nice.

2090
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:12,380
Right.

2091
01:39:12,381 --> 01:39:14,280
I feel much closer to you.

2092
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:18,650
Did you enjoy it?

2093
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:19,850
I did.

2094
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:26,690
It felt like an actual date after a long time.

2095
01:39:28,290 --> 01:39:29,459
It was great today.

2096
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:32,600
(It was great today.)

2097
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:36,030
My face didn't turn red, did it?

2098
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:37,570
- Just a little? - A little?

2099
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:40,770
You don't get drunk easily.

2100
01:39:41,270 --> 01:39:43,610
- Me? - You drank faster than me.

2101
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:53,120
(Peeking)

2102
01:39:53,121 --> 01:39:54,620
But why...

2103
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:56,750
What's wrong with me today?

2104
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:00,590
Are you drunk?

2105
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:02,729
No. I'm fine.

2106
01:40:02,730 --> 01:40:03,790
What was that?

2107
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:07,299
A girl saying, "What's wrong with me today?"

2108
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:08,670
Isn't this an act of flirting?

2109
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,729
- Is there a meaning behind that? - Right.

2110
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:11,769
- "What's wrong with me?" - Right.

2111
01:40:11,770 --> 01:40:14,300
- This is totally flirting. - "What's wrong with me today?"

2112
01:40:14,770 --> 01:40:16,610
Totally!

2113
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:17,979
- Really? - Yes!

2114
01:40:17,980 --> 01:40:19,879
- Totally! - Totally!

2115
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:21,780
Get yourself together, Seon Ho.

2116
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:23,049
That's definitely flirting.

2117
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:24,279
Let's say a girl says, "What's wrong with me today?"

2118
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:25,780
You can't say, "What's wrong with her?"

2119
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:27,420
- You can't react like that. - Right.

2120
01:40:27,550 --> 01:40:29,989
I thought she was talking about being possessed by a spirit.

2121
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:31,120
Oh, come on.

2122
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:35,360
It could be because it has been a while since you drank.

2123
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,300
(Fiddling)

2124
01:40:49,870 --> 01:40:51,380
Let's drink these.

2125
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:54,610
(Ho Am bought hangover drinks for Yun Jeong.)

2126
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:01,280
(He even opens it for her.)

2127
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:05,560
- Here. - Thank you.

2128
01:41:08,060 --> 01:41:09,930
Do I just drink it like this?

2129
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:13,000
- Just like this? - I think so.

2130
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:33,250
(Smiling)

2131
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:39,760
I think it's fun to be outside.

2132
01:41:40,290 --> 01:41:41,360
Right.

2133
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:43,390
After being inside.

2134
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:48,100
Everything would feel nice in that atmosphere.

2135
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:49,999
- It feels so sweet. - Right.

2136
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,369
They won't be away from each other after that.

2137
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:53,500
- They're heading back together. - Right.

2138
01:41:55,110 --> 01:41:57,409
(Feeling the tingles)

2139
01:41:57,410 --> 01:41:59,710
But the Gold Dragon is coming.

2140
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:01,709
- You're right. - The Gold Dragon is coming.

2141
01:42:01,710 --> 01:42:02,810
Don't come!

2142
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:04,179
You're right.

2143
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:05,980
- Don't come! - Don't come!

2144
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,949
While following their hearts at first,

2145
01:42:07,950 --> 01:42:11,220
is there be a possibility that their hearts could change...

2146
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:13,560
after hearing about their sajus?

2147
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,330
I think their hearts could be shaken from that.

2148
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:18,760
- That's unbelievable to me. - It's because...

2149
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:21,329
they are people who believe fated relationships...

2150
01:42:21,330 --> 01:42:23,599
- to be very precious. - Right.

2151
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,099
- Right. - That could shake them up again.

2152
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:26,939
- No! That can't happen. - No! Ho Am!

2153
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:28,039
But it's the Gold Dragon!

2154
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:29,639
- I like how things are now. - Me too.

2155
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:31,409
Oh, no, Ho Am!

2156
01:42:31,410 --> 01:42:33,139
I like Ho Am and Yun Jeong together.

2157
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:35,450
Ho Am is in big trouble. Gosh.

2158
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:38,220
We'll all feel anxious...

2159
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:40,420
- before that person appears. - Right.

2160
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:41,689
Right.

2161
01:42:41,690 --> 01:42:44,290
(How will the Gold Dragon become a game changer?)

2162
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:54,630
(The two have returned to the House.)

2163
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:00,000
- What is that? - What is that?

2164
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:01,869
- What is that? - What is that?

2165
01:43:01,870 --> 01:43:02,970
There are mugus!

2166
01:43:03,170 --> 01:43:04,309
It has begun.

2167
01:43:07,136 --> 01:43:09,036
- Awesome. - Oh, no!

2168
01:43:09,536 --> 01:43:10,806
We're starting right away today.

2169
01:43:12,746 --> 01:43:16,716
(Boxes filled with each of their fortune-telling tools)

2170
01:43:17,646 --> 01:43:22,355
(Tonight, the professions of the 8 members will be revealed.)

2171
01:43:22,356 --> 01:43:23,555
("These are the 'introduction boxes' to help understand each other.")

2172
01:43:23,556 --> 01:43:24,556
("Open them once everyone has gathered.")

2173
01:43:24,557 --> 01:43:26,126
They must be opened once everyone has gathered.

2174
01:43:27,426 --> 01:43:28,555
Mugus?

2175
01:43:28,556 --> 01:43:30,925
- It's time to reveal themselves. - It's time to reveal themselves.

2176
01:43:30,926 --> 01:43:31,926
(The time to open the introduction boxes has come.)

2177
01:43:31,927 --> 01:43:33,566
Right. It will happen today.

2178
01:43:37,096 --> 01:43:39,365
- Hello. - Hello.

2179
01:43:39,366 --> 01:43:40,366
I'm back.

2180
01:43:40,367 --> 01:43:41,405
- What? - You're back.

2181
01:43:41,406 --> 01:43:43,205
- Awesome, isn't it? - What is all this?

2182
01:43:43,206 --> 01:43:44,576
Go and take a look.

2183
01:43:47,476 --> 01:43:49,576
- What? What's wrong? - Hurry.

2184
01:43:49,946 --> 01:43:51,015
Gosh!

2185
01:43:51,016 --> 01:43:52,146
Is it money or what?

2186
01:43:53,346 --> 01:43:54,986
- What is all this? - Hurry.

2187
01:43:57,986 --> 01:43:59,026
Awesome.

2188
01:43:59,326 --> 01:44:00,456
Do you think you can tell?

2189
01:44:00,956 --> 01:44:02,126
Time for deduction.

2190
01:44:02,726 --> 01:44:03,926
I have no idea.

2191
01:44:04,556 --> 01:44:06,326
- Guess. - You're not sure?

2192
01:44:06,726 --> 01:44:08,796
(Plopping down)

2193
01:44:09,166 --> 01:44:11,566
They all have different reactions.

2194
01:44:13,566 --> 01:44:14,865
(Yu Ra and Byeong Yeol return from their date.)

2195
01:44:14,866 --> 01:44:16,676
- I see the shoes. - I think we're the first ones.

2196
01:44:16,806 --> 01:44:17,876
Are we the first ones to arrive?

2197
01:44:19,076 --> 01:44:21,615
(Peeking)

2198
01:44:21,616 --> 01:44:22,746
Oh, hey.

2199
01:44:23,876 --> 01:44:25,146
Hurry!

2200
01:44:25,346 --> 01:44:26,585
- What? - Hurry over!

2201
01:44:26,586 --> 01:44:28,016
- What's wrong? - Hurry!

2202
01:44:28,756 --> 01:44:29,915
- Hurry! - What is it?

2203
01:44:29,916 --> 01:44:31,516
- Hello. - Hurry!

2204
01:44:32,186 --> 01:44:33,286
What is all this?

2205
01:44:34,026 --> 01:44:35,896
So we're doing this now.

2206
01:44:36,126 --> 01:44:37,426
Right away?

2207
01:44:38,156 --> 01:44:39,465
Before we open them,

2208
01:44:39,466 --> 01:44:42,135
I should wash my hands with a reverent heart.

2209
01:44:42,136 --> 01:44:43,596
I should wash my hands too.

2210
01:45:00,316 --> 01:45:04,016
(And at this moment,)

2211
01:45:04,986 --> 01:45:08,326
(there is a man who is watching them.)

2212
01:45:08,796 --> 01:45:10,996
- What? - What?

2213
01:45:11,156 --> 01:45:12,266
- What? - What?

2214
01:45:12,366 --> 01:45:13,366
Is he watching?

2215
01:45:13,367 --> 01:45:15,996
What? Who's watching? Why?

2216
01:45:16,666 --> 01:45:17,995
Blue Dragon! No.

2217
01:45:17,996 --> 01:45:19,505
- Gold Dragon. - Gold Dragon. Leo.

2218
01:45:19,506 --> 01:45:21,135
(A Leo, Gold Dragon, has appeared.)

2219
01:45:21,136 --> 01:45:23,606
- What? Why is he watching? - How is he watching them?

2220
01:45:24,576 --> 01:45:26,746
He must be watching everyone.

2221
01:45:27,646 --> 01:45:29,016
- That's incredible. - My goodness.

2222
01:45:29,346 --> 01:45:30,876
That's incredible.

2223
01:45:57,306 --> 01:45:58,775
(Lee Ra Yun)

2224
01:45:58,776 --> 01:45:59,875
(Hong Yu Ra)

2225
01:45:59,876 --> 01:46:02,446
(Kim Yun Jeong)

2226
01:46:02,776 --> 01:46:05,715
(His eyes are...)

2227
01:46:05,716 --> 01:46:08,986
(on Yun Jeong's name plaque.)

2228
01:46:50,956 --> 01:46:52,426
It's something I'm curious about.

2229
01:46:53,166 --> 01:46:55,135
Who's this person?

2230
01:46:55,136 --> 01:46:56,136
The one who'll join later?

2231
01:46:56,137 --> 01:46:57,965
When I get hung up on an idea,

2232
01:46:57,966 --> 01:46:59,336
- there's no way out. - Really?

2233
01:46:59,436 --> 01:47:02,176
I have to solve that puzzle no matter what.

2234
01:47:04,606 --> 01:47:05,606
Who could he be?

2235
01:47:09,246 --> 01:47:11,046
Why did they put this man so close?

2236
01:47:11,576 --> 01:47:15,986
But making someone join belatedly would be too...

2237
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:21,226
If it happens,

2238
01:47:22,026 --> 01:47:24,026
the balance will be ruined.

2239
01:47:24,326 --> 01:47:26,426
So he must be someone everyone knows.

2240
01:47:27,596 --> 01:47:28,596
I had that thought.

2241
01:47:28,666 --> 01:47:30,236
Why would someone everyone knows...

2242
01:47:30,766 --> 01:47:31,806
come here?

2243
01:47:33,306 --> 01:47:34,536
That's the mystery.

2244
01:47:39,306 --> 01:47:42,445
(Possessed Love S2)

2245
01:47:42,446 --> 01:47:44,645
(The possessed men and women's...)

2246
01:47:44,646 --> 01:47:47,185
(mugus are revealed!)

2247
01:47:47,186 --> 01:47:48,315
(She was a shaman!)

2248
01:47:48,316 --> 01:47:49,985
(The unexpected professions...)

2249
01:47:49,986 --> 01:47:52,785
(are shocking.)

2250
01:47:52,786 --> 01:47:54,485
(Amid the confusion,)

2251
01:47:54,486 --> 01:47:55,496
(Gold Dragon appears.)

2252
01:47:57,096 --> 01:47:59,565
(Really? Hold on.)

2253
01:47:59,566 --> 01:48:02,366
(He was more handsome than I expected.)

2254
01:48:02,466 --> 01:48:03,496
My goodness.

2255
01:48:03,596 --> 01:48:04,596
(I think...)

2256
01:48:04,597 --> 01:48:06,436
(he'll change the dynamics.)

2257
01:48:06,666 --> 01:48:09,236
(Amid the strange atmosphere)

2258
01:48:09,706 --> 01:48:11,305
(The time has finally come.)

2259
01:48:11,306 --> 01:48:12,945
(I just wanted to leave the House.)

2260
01:48:12,946 --> 01:48:14,145
(With the goal in mind,)

2261
01:48:14,146 --> 01:48:15,715
(I'm advancing forward.)

2262
01:48:15,716 --> 01:48:17,115
(Today, do you want to go on a date...)

2263
01:48:17,116 --> 01:48:18,146
(with me?)

2264
01:48:19,255 --> 01:48:21,646
(Possessed Love S2)
