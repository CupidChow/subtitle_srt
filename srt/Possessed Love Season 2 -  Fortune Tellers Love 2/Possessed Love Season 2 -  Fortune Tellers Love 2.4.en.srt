1
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:26,906
(All statements related to shamanism and fortune-telling...)

2
00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:28,665
(made by the cast in this program...)

3
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,036
(are purely personal opinions.)

4
00:00:34,506 --> 00:00:35,945
- My heart is beating too fast. - What?

5
00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:37,275
My heart is beating too fast.

6
00:00:37,276 --> 00:00:38,615
- Your what? - My heart.

7
00:00:38,616 --> 00:00:40,186
- Your heart? - It's beating too fast.

8
00:00:43,116 --> 00:00:45,816
I can't really hear you as you're on my left.

9
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:48,186
I'll talk loudly.

10
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:52,156
I'm always going,

11
00:00:52,696 --> 00:00:54,166
"What?"

12
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:56,036
You look pretty.

13
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:57,866
You look pretty.

14
00:01:05,336 --> 00:01:08,776
(Possessed Love S2)

15
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:12,985
(The participants' jobs have been revealed.)

16
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:14,145
- I'm getting goosebumps. - He was a shaman!

17
00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:15,615
It'd be insane if it was a blade.

18
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:17,085
What if he's not a shaman?

19
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:18,855
I tried to hide it.

20
00:01:18,856 --> 00:01:20,255
(The big reveal was good news for some...)

21
00:01:20,256 --> 00:01:21,785
(and bad news for others.)

22
00:01:21,786 --> 00:01:23,725
- There are lots of shamans. - That's a load off my chest.

23
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:25,596
(They're more confused after the job reveal.)

24
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:27,965
(And finally,)

25
00:01:27,966 --> 00:01:30,265
(Sang Hyeok, the Gold Dragon, has appeared.)

26
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:31,795
I thought, "Is he a celebrity?"

27
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:34,606
The men seemed pretty nervous.

28
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:37,476
Things might change.

29
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:41,475
(The First Come First Date began out of nowhere.)

30
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,115
Yu Gyeong, can we talk for a minute?

31
00:01:43,116 --> 00:01:46,016
They grew closer in such a short time.

32
00:01:46,446 --> 00:01:49,356
I'm a bit flustered. I'm not sure anymore.

33
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:51,585
If I get a chance to pick someone,

34
00:01:51,586 --> 00:01:53,326
I'll do my best to seize the opportunity.

35
00:01:53,486 --> 00:01:55,856
Do you want to go on a date with me today?

36
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:58,926
(How will the new man's appearance impact the picture?)

37
00:01:59,426 --> 00:02:02,065
(Creator Ralral)

38
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:03,766
(Actress Yoo In Na)

39
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:06,365
Last week was so intriguing, right?

40
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:07,765
- It was so entertaining. - Indeed.

41
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:09,936
All their jobs have been revealed now.

42
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:12,105
It seems that the ones with the same job...

43
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:13,975
- feel some type of bond. - Yes.

44
00:02:13,976 --> 00:02:15,676
- Except for Byeong Yeol. - Exactly.

45
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:18,815
- He's practically lying there. - Yes.

46
00:02:18,816 --> 00:02:20,786
He's like, "This is unbelievable."

47
00:02:20,986 --> 00:02:22,856
And the new male participant, also known as the Gold Dragon.

48
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:25,255
Yun Sang Hyeok has joined them,

49
00:02:25,256 --> 00:02:27,155
- Right. - and it got way more interesting.

50
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:29,955
There are 5 men and 4 women at the moment.

51
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:32,895
- One man will be left at home. - He'll be left alone.

52
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:34,865
(Feeling bad)

53
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:37,595
Who will be left alone?

54
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:40,605
Or more than one person might be left alone.

55
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:41,606
(How will the date requests turn out?)

56
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:43,206
This is so exciting.

57
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:44,836
I can't wait to watch it!

58
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:50,716
- Like, "What?" - It caught on fire, right?

59
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:53,816
- Right? - I wasn't so sure.

60
00:02:54,316 --> 00:02:55,716
I just stood there.

61
00:02:57,616 --> 00:03:00,286
Do you want to go on a date with me today?

62
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:02,256
Do you...

63
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:04,125
(Do you want to go on a date with me today?)

64
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:05,356
- Me? - Yes.

65
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:07,866
- Will you? - Yes.

66
00:03:10,436 --> 00:03:12,835
It was so sudden. He didn't exactly...

67
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:14,465
show his interest before.

68
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:17,576
I felt that he was curious about me, though.

69
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:20,475
I glanced at him as I thought he was asking a question,

70
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:21,976
but he asked me out.

71
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:24,546
I was flustered.

72
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:26,116
Maybe he saw something in me.

73
00:03:27,286 --> 00:03:29,245
- Do you know where we're going? - Pardon?

74
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:30,486
Yes, I do.

75
00:03:31,286 --> 00:03:33,886
- I'll look forward to it. - You can get your hopes up.

76
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:36,856
(Sighing)

77
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:40,526
You must feel at ease.

78
00:03:41,196 --> 00:03:43,266
- Why? - Because you already have one.

79
00:03:43,736 --> 00:03:45,436
(Embarrassed)

80
00:03:50,476 --> 00:03:52,475
I thought...

81
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:56,446
it might be better to go on a date with Yun Jeong.

82
00:03:58,316 --> 00:04:00,016
But...

83
00:04:02,346 --> 00:04:03,956
the situation wasn't...

84
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:08,356
exactly going in the way I was hoping.

85
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:21,066
(Hyeon U is feeling thirsty for some reason.)

86
00:04:22,206 --> 00:04:23,476
(Glancing)

87
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:33,746
- These two? - Yes.

88
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:38,056
Please be white and red.

89
00:04:42,656 --> 00:04:45,596
(He got a blue flag and a green flag.)

90
00:04:45,926 --> 00:04:47,195
It wasn't a good answer.

91
00:04:47,196 --> 00:04:49,666
"You might feel at ease, but she won't be the date you want."

92
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:03,746
(Hyeon U quickly heads upstairs.)

93
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,446
Really?

94
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:10,116
- Can I pick one more time? - Sure.

95
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:11,286
Really?

96
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:12,955
Sit here.

97
00:05:12,956 --> 00:05:15,126
(He sat next to Ra Yun.)

98
00:05:15,586 --> 00:05:17,126
- What? - Oh, my gosh!

99
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:18,795
(Interested)

100
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:20,126
I think he's going to ask her out.

101
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:25,696
- Oh, no. Poor Gang Won. - Gang Won should have gone sooner.

102
00:05:26,936 --> 00:05:28,336
(Glaring)

103
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:31,776
Do you want to go out with me today?

104
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:35,446
Are you asking me out?

105
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:37,446
Can I announce it?

106
00:05:37,646 --> 00:05:39,346
- I don't mind. - Oh, thanks.

107
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:42,746
- Guys, he just asked me out. - Congratulations.

108
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:46,115
- Do you want to go on a date? - Yes.

109
00:05:46,116 --> 00:05:47,126
Let's do that.

110
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:48,586
Good.

111
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,696
Maybe I should...

112
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:52,966
(Exclaiming)

113
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:55,865
She meant to let Gang Won hear it.

114
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:56,936
Yes!

115
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:01,605
He recommended that she talk to other people,

116
00:06:01,606 --> 00:06:02,935
and it actually happened.

117
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:04,376
She's going, "Are you happy now?"

118
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:09,546
(During yesterday's date)

119
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,116
There will certainly be...

120
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,845
other men who wish to talk to you.

121
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:16,216
And there will be women who wish to talk to me.

122
00:06:16,516 --> 00:06:19,256
I still want you to give them a chance.

123
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:22,056
(Thinking)

124
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:26,595
Guys, he just asked me out.

125
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:27,796
Congratulations.

126
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:30,035
- Do you want to go on a date? - Yes.

127
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:31,166
Let's do that.

128
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:33,565
Maybe I should...

129
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:34,806
I'm not sure.

130
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:42,506
It felt like all my nerves were severed.

131
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:44,846
I guess I simply wanted to deny it.

132
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:47,446
So... Yes, I honestly regretted it.

133
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,256
I thought, "I should have asked her first."

134
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:52,555
"Have I always been this low?"

135
00:06:52,556 --> 00:06:56,426
"Have I been this bad?"

136
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:57,955
"Why couldn't I have been more honest?"

137
00:06:57,956 --> 00:07:00,696
I regretted it, to be frank.

138
00:07:00,966 --> 00:07:03,295
He said so himself. He suggested that we talk...

139
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:05,296
to other participants if we wanted.

140
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:07,736
I should keep my word.

141
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:11,506
I accepted his opinion and took my stance.

142
00:07:12,076 --> 00:07:13,245
So, I'm going to keep an open mind.

143
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:14,806
He should have been nicer to me.

144
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:17,515
Do you want to go on a date?

145
00:07:17,516 --> 00:07:18,676
- Yes. - Let's do that.

146
00:07:19,316 --> 00:07:22,246
Did everyone have a date?

147
00:07:23,956 --> 00:07:25,116
No.

148
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:27,486
I'm not sure about anything now.

149
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:30,526
(Put on a spot)

150
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:35,666
Oh, dear.

151
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:38,436
We still have some time, so...

152
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:44,876
(No one has asked Yu Ra out yet.)

153
00:07:45,606 --> 00:07:48,846
(Gang Won is hesitant,)

154
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:52,646
(and Byeong Yeol won't make a move.)

155
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:59,856
(Who will make the first move?)

156
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:02,256
The situation is...

157
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:04,295
It's a war of nerves between the two now.

158
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:08,096
But Byeong Yeol has gone on a date with Yu Ra.

159
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:10,865
- He has. - He said they weren't compatible.

160
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,896
- He said so. - Right.

161
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:15,606
- Yu Ra must be so frustrated. - I know. I can only imagine.

162
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:19,176
- Poor Yu Ra. - Yu Ra!

163
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:28,786
(Getting up)

164
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:33,086
I went to Byeong Yeol...

165
00:08:33,286 --> 00:08:35,756
and asked him to have a chat.

166
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:39,196
He wanted to talk to me in private,

167
00:08:39,356 --> 00:08:41,426
so we went downstairs and talked.

168
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:43,296
As a man to another man,

169
00:08:43,466 --> 00:08:45,896
- I have to tell you something. - Okay. I like that.

170
00:08:46,336 --> 00:08:48,436
Actually,

171
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:50,635
the woman I wanted...

172
00:08:50,636 --> 00:08:51,936
- You have one? - is already gone.

173
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:55,805
Yes, she's already gone.

174
00:08:55,806 --> 00:08:58,275
- Someone asked her out? - Yes, someone already did.

175
00:08:58,276 --> 00:08:59,646
To be frank,

176
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:05,315
if I'm not going on a date with Ra Yun,

177
00:09:05,316 --> 00:09:06,985
I don't mind staying here by myself.

178
00:09:06,986 --> 00:09:08,986
Maybe I can go with a new participant.

179
00:09:10,726 --> 00:09:12,796
So, I want to know what you want to do.

180
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:14,566
I actually...

181
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:16,966
Well...

182
00:09:18,136 --> 00:09:20,366
I did want to talk to Yun Jeong,

183
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,366
but someone already asked her out.

184
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:23,936
You and I are in the same boat.

185
00:09:24,036 --> 00:09:26,006
Yes, you're right.

186
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:30,775
But Yu Ra is the only one left.

187
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:31,916
Right.

188
00:09:33,246 --> 00:09:35,986
About Yu Ra,

189
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:38,485
I liked the date yesterday...

190
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:39,615
She went out with me yesterday.

191
00:09:39,616 --> 00:09:40,726
I enjoyed it,

192
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:43,325
but I don't really feel the need...

193
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:45,696
to talk to her more and get to know her better...

194
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:47,326
in a new place.

195
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:49,696
Yes.

196
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:53,336
I guess that's how I felt about Yu Ra.

197
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:56,306
I found her difficult.

198
00:09:57,206 --> 00:09:59,036
Oh, I'm the only one left.

199
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:12,656
(There are only three people left in the living room.)

200
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:15,086
This is so suffocating.

201
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:17,856
It won't be so easy for Gang Won to step forward.

202
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:20,526
He's already on Ra Yun's bad side.

203
00:10:22,826 --> 00:10:26,636
(Ra Yun and Hyeon U came down to the kitchen.)

204
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:30,536
- I think these are the bagels. - Are they?

205
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:31,806
Isn't it these?

206
00:10:32,436 --> 00:10:33,945
No, these are the ones we made yesterday.

207
00:10:33,946 --> 00:10:35,375
Oh, really?

208
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:37,046
- You got something on your face. - Where?

209
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,675
You need to check the mirror.

210
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:40,546
- There's a thick chocolate stain. - Is there?

211
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:42,185
- I'll be back. - Or is it a mole?

212
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:43,556
No, I don't have a mole on my face.

213
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:47,086
Wipe it for me.

214
00:10:49,726 --> 00:10:50,726
- What? - What?

215
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:52,096
That's...

216
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:53,296
No.

217
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:55,366
"Wipe it for me?"

218
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:57,436
"Wipe it for me?"

219
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,266
"Wipe it for me?"

220
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,505
They're so intimate, even before the date?

221
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:03,806
What is going on now?

222
00:11:05,406 --> 00:11:07,246
(Puzzled)

223
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:08,776
Wipe it for me.

224
00:11:13,346 --> 00:11:15,186
It's a thick chocolate stain.

225
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:16,856
(Laughing)

226
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:17,986
It looks like a mole.

227
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:19,716
I actually thought it was a mole.

228
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:21,355
It can't be.

229
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:23,296
Right? You certainly didn't have that before.

230
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:25,055
I thought, "Did she cover it up with her makeup before?"

231
00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:26,126
No!

232
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:28,595
Anything else?

233
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:30,036
- These too. - No, I mean...

234
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,236
- Is it clean now? - Yes.

235
00:11:33,436 --> 00:11:34,636
Thank you.

236
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:37,435
We need to heat these up?

237
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:39,336
- Oh, the oven! - We need a bread knife.

238
00:11:46,446 --> 00:11:48,146
- Do you want to go out with me? - Yes.

239
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:50,356
I feel bad that I have to leave him alone.

240
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:53,185
It's fine.

241
00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:55,225
Should I get ready now?

242
00:11:55,226 --> 00:11:56,455
The whole situation...

243
00:11:56,456 --> 00:11:59,326
I thought, "Maybe he doesn't like me,"

244
00:11:59,656 --> 00:12:03,395
or "He has too many things to care."

245
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:04,595
That was on my mind.

246
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:06,096
I think the priority...

247
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,505
should be sticking to what I can do...

248
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:11,236
without minding him.

249
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:15,076
- Who are you going with? - Gang Won.

250
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:17,215
- You said you were curious. - I did.

251
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:18,276
That's good.

252
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:21,586
Do you want me to pick out your clothes?

253
00:12:22,646 --> 00:12:24,516
- I think... - Yes.

254
00:12:26,056 --> 00:12:29,325
he feels that it's too much to wear a skirt...

255
00:12:29,326 --> 00:12:30,626
that's too feminine.

256
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:32,125
He thinks it's too much?

257
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,395
- Gang Won does? - That's my opinion.

258
00:12:33,396 --> 00:12:34,825
I had a feeling that he did.

259
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:37,635
He seems to prefer women wearing sporty clothes.

260
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:39,695
He said that he walked for a long time...

261
00:12:39,696 --> 00:12:41,136
along the beach yesterday.

262
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:42,406
So...

263
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:46,036
But it might look better to go for an unexpected look.

264
00:12:51,716 --> 00:12:54,246
You're dressed nicely.

265
00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:56,616
I just wore what I grabbed.

266
00:12:57,116 --> 00:12:59,356
- Have fun on the date. - Have fun.

267
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:01,086
I'm leaving at 50 minutes.

268
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:03,296
Bye. Have fun.

269
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:08,266
(Turning)

270
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:10,836
(Yu Ra heard their conversation.)

271
00:13:13,636 --> 00:13:15,336
(Oh, no)

272
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:16,936
I bet she hates going on that date.

273
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:19,406
(Sulky)

274
00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:21,876
(She can relate.)

275
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:24,476
Oh, my head.

276
00:13:27,716 --> 00:13:29,046
(Taking a look)

277
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:35,626
(Meanwhile, Ho Am is getting ready for his date.)

278
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,196
(Taking something out)

279
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:49,636
(He puts a small talisman in his pocket.)

280
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:52,306
I brought a love talisman.

281
00:13:52,636 --> 00:13:54,605
It's to win the favour...

282
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:57,476
of my date or someone I'm into.

283
00:13:57,816 --> 00:14:01,186
It's a talisman that helps you find love.

284
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,856
(Checking it again)

285
00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:11,526
(Putting it in)

286
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:18,566
(How will today's date go after all the twists and turns?)

287
00:14:19,836 --> 00:14:20,936
Shall we go?

288
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:22,365
- Let's go. - Are you ready to go?

289
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:23,476
Yes.

290
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:29,306
(First Come First Date for men, Yun Sang Hyeok and Kim Yun Jeong)

291
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:34,146
The weather's better than I expected.

292
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:35,416
Yes, it is.

293
00:14:35,716 --> 00:14:38,356
- It was raining earlier. - It's warm in the afternoon.

294
00:14:38,716 --> 00:14:41,326
- For our date, the weather is... - It's helping us.

295
00:14:42,326 --> 00:14:44,425
- This way. - Okay. Thanks.

296
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:45,526
The car is pretty big, right?

297
00:14:46,296 --> 00:14:48,066
- Is it your car? - Yes.

298
00:14:53,236 --> 00:14:55,506
All right. Let's go.

299
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:03,206
(Sang Hyeok takes something from the backseat.)

300
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:07,386
- Here you go. - Thank you.

301
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:13,985
I wonder where we're going.

302
00:15:13,986 --> 00:15:15,156
You'll see.

303
00:15:16,056 --> 00:15:17,196
Do you want me to pull the seat back?

304
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:18,696
Yes, just a bit.

305
00:15:18,926 --> 00:15:20,266
- Good? - Yes.

306
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:21,966
Thanks.

307
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:24,466
- Warm your seat? - Warm my seat.

308
00:15:24,996 --> 00:15:26,096
Seat warmer.

309
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:33,676
(What's the date that Sang Hyeok has planned?)

310
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:37,176
- By the way... - Yes.

311
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:41,216
Never mind.

312
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,156
- Gosh. What was that? - No, I mean...

313
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,256
- I'll tell you. - You were torn about choosing?

314
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:47,525
No, that's not what I mean.

315
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:49,685
When I decided to talk to you,

316
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:51,555
I got nervous before I knew it.

317
00:15:51,556 --> 00:15:53,355
Of course. So, I was...

318
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:54,726
Yes, you're right.

319
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:56,025
But you were so smooth with it.

320
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:57,366
- Was I? - Yes.

321
00:15:57,836 --> 00:15:59,966
Did you think I've been here for a while?

322
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:03,676
I thought you were courageous.

323
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:05,536
You need courage.

324
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:07,946
(Admiring)

325
00:16:08,546 --> 00:16:12,015
(Courageous Sang Hyeok's first date)

326
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:13,516
Did you have a dream before coming here?

327
00:16:14,046 --> 00:16:15,715
No, never.

328
00:16:15,716 --> 00:16:17,856
- Wait. I did! - What kind of dream?

329
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:20,356
- I kept having good dreams. - Good dreams?

330
00:16:20,456 --> 00:16:22,356
Yes, it was a positive dream.

331
00:16:24,426 --> 00:16:26,655
(Contemplating)

332
00:16:26,656 --> 00:16:29,466
I saw a beautiful rainbow.

333
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:31,136
- A rainbow? - Yes.

334
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:33,396
That's a great dream.

335
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:34,506
- Right. - It's obvious.

336
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:35,566
There's no need to interpret it differently.

337
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:37,206
So, I just...

338
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:40,806
thought that something good would happen,

339
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:42,506
and I believed in that.

340
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:48,185
Isn't the sunlight raining down like a holy light...

341
00:16:48,186 --> 00:16:49,816
- through the clouds? - You're right.

342
00:16:51,086 --> 00:16:52,515
- See? - Yes.

343
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:55,256
(The dazzling sunlight shines through the clouds.)

344
00:16:55,986 --> 00:16:57,155
I feel like something will descend.

345
00:16:57,156 --> 00:16:58,396
Yes, someone might descend.

346
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:08,266
(The weather is beautiful, and they're excited.)

347
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:11,176
Check out the view. It's stunning.

348
00:17:12,776 --> 00:17:13,945
- Can I roll it down a bit? - Yes.

349
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:16,446
Feel free to do so.

350
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:18,576
This is amazing. It's gorgeous.

351
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:20,416
I'll drive slowly. Take pictures.

352
00:17:20,846 --> 00:17:22,616
Just a second. I'll do as I was taught.

353
00:17:24,986 --> 00:17:26,316
I want to take a video.

354
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:27,686
Do you want to take a video?

355
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:29,156
I need a video of a view like this.

356
00:17:32,356 --> 00:17:34,196
When you're driving,

357
00:17:34,426 --> 00:17:36,526
you don't get to do this stuff.

358
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:37,696
But you're taking the video for me.

359
00:17:39,336 --> 00:17:40,406
Right. The one in the passenger seat.

360
00:17:43,506 --> 00:17:44,906
Hold on to your phone.

361
00:17:45,336 --> 00:17:46,606
You might drop it.

362
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:48,706
This is very risky.

363
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:51,876
He's that thoughtful?

364
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:55,886
Every word he says is so affectionate.

365
00:17:56,146 --> 00:17:58,386
Is that what you think?

366
00:17:58,856 --> 00:18:01,226
I was thinking, "Why does he talk so much while driving?"

367
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:03,656
- Men and women are different. - Mister!

368
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:05,755
Mister!

369
00:18:05,756 --> 00:18:07,326
I was like, "Why does he talk so much when he's driving?"

370
00:18:07,426 --> 00:18:08,765
Oh, gosh.

371
00:18:08,766 --> 00:18:10,366
(He's impossible.)

372
00:18:11,436 --> 00:18:13,906
The weather is perfect today.

373
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:19,135
I've always wanted to be at a place like this.

374
00:18:19,136 --> 00:18:21,276
I never thought I would.

375
00:18:21,746 --> 00:18:22,906
I never thought I'd get to come here.

376
00:18:25,516 --> 00:18:26,516
It's beautiful.

377
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:27,946
It is beautiful.

378
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:30,716
Drive slowly here.

379
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,226
(A red tree-lined road)

380
00:18:34,726 --> 00:18:35,726
Will I get nervous?

381
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:38,225
I don't think you will. I'm not sure, though.

382
00:18:38,226 --> 00:18:40,866
It's not so bad to be nervous once in a while.

383
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:42,695
- It's nice. - I wonder what kind...

384
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:43,736
of nervousness it will be.

385
00:18:49,306 --> 00:18:51,336
I think your height is...

386
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:54,406
in the low 160cm range. Maybe 162cm.

387
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,615
- I'm taller than that. - You are?

388
00:18:57,616 --> 00:19:00,045
Perhaps it's because I'm waddling...

389
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:02,246
- in these heels. - I see.

390
00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:03,346
I might seem shorter.

391
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:05,215
- Right. - I'm about 164cm tall.

392
00:19:05,216 --> 00:19:06,556
You're 164cm tall? You're tall.

393
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:08,826
Are you 173cm tall?

394
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:11,595
I'm sorry.

395
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:12,596
Or 174cm.

396
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:14,196
You said you were...

397
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:16,526
- I'm 186cm tall. - You're 186cm tall, right?

398
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:18,896
- Your bangs are looking... - Oh, right.

399
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:21,136
Good. It's pretty now.

400
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:23,105
I was going to fix them.

401
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:25,606
(Giggling)

402
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:28,906
Is this the place?

403
00:19:28,907 --> 00:19:30,316
- This is it. - Let's find out.

404
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:35,316
Good. I like places like this.

405
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,586
It's beautiful.

406
00:19:41,526 --> 00:19:42,856
Should we take a look around?

407
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:45,325
- It's pretty cute. - It looks...

408
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:46,326
(Helping her)

409
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,426
(Amazed)

410
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:54,606
(They look for photo zones everywhere.)

411
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:57,406
This spot is incredible. With the tree and everything.

412
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:01,606
Should we take one here?

413
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:02,676
- How about a photo of you? - Sure.

414
00:20:03,506 --> 00:20:04,746
Give me the hand warmer.

415
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,286
If the photo doesn't turn out so well,

416
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:11,315
- No, take them well. - don't resent me so much.

417
00:20:11,316 --> 00:20:12,956
Take good photos.

418
00:20:13,456 --> 00:20:15,026
This is awesome.

419
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:17,225
- Did you say, "Long?" - No, a moody photo.

420
00:20:17,226 --> 00:20:18,456
- Okay. - A moody photo.

421
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:21,695
You look gorgeous.

422
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:22,995
I'm not sure if this is right, but you look so pretty.

423
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:24,836
(You look so pretty.)

424
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:26,535
This is so funny.

425
00:20:26,536 --> 00:20:27,736
(Feeling shy)

426
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:29,066
Are you embarrassed?

427
00:20:29,806 --> 00:20:30,936
But you actually look beautiful.

428
00:20:33,476 --> 00:20:35,506
- Do you want to check it out? - Yes.

429
00:20:35,606 --> 00:20:37,775
Sorry. This isn't the one.

430
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:40,316
Show me a good one. I like the one when I'm smiling.

431
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,216
(Laughing)

432
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:43,856
Can you take a photo of me too?

433
00:20:45,186 --> 00:20:47,685
(It's time for Yun Jeong to take the photos.)

434
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:49,455
Oh, you look different.

435
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,926
- Here? - You definitely look different.

436
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:54,866
- Do I look okay? - You look so nice and tall.

437
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,695
I feel awkward every time I take a photo.

438
00:20:57,696 --> 00:20:58,735
But you've done this a lot.

439
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:00,136
- Haven't you? - No, it's awkward.

440
00:21:00,236 --> 00:21:02,166
This is unbelievable.

441
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:06,936
You look far better than me.

442
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:09,906
Maybe I should stand to the side.

443
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:12,046
I'll get you a photo of your lifetime.

444
00:21:12,816 --> 00:21:16,015
I think you'll look better if you move naturally.

445
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:17,016
Naturally?

446
00:21:19,116 --> 00:21:20,686
Gosh. As expected.

447
00:21:22,456 --> 00:21:24,956
- Your proportions are exceptional. - You also have good proportions.

448
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,366
Thank you for the photo.

449
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,725
- This looks nice. - I find it too awkward.

450
00:21:29,726 --> 00:21:31,096
- This is cute. - Is it?

451
00:21:31,196 --> 00:21:32,296
This one looks great.

452
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:39,336
- Goodness. - He is tall.

453
00:21:39,436 --> 00:21:42,245
He really is.

454
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:43,945
- I like that. - He's so...

455
00:21:43,946 --> 00:21:45,976
They got photos of a lifetime on their first date.

456
00:21:47,386 --> 00:21:49,546
(Pleased)

457
00:21:51,286 --> 00:21:56,785
(They took photos of their lifetime on their first date.)

458
00:21:56,786 --> 00:21:58,326
- Do you like it? - Send it to me.

459
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:06,196
- Should we sit here? - Just a second.

460
00:22:09,736 --> 00:22:10,736
(Putting a cushion down)

461
00:22:12,406 --> 00:22:13,706
Thank you.

462
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:19,016
Here.

463
00:22:20,446 --> 00:22:21,786
- Does it feel all right? - Yes.

464
00:22:22,116 --> 00:22:23,116
You're not cold?

465
00:22:23,116 --> 00:22:24,116
(Nodding)

466
00:22:24,656 --> 00:22:26,286
- It's perfect. - That's good.

467
00:22:27,326 --> 00:22:28,326
This is great.

468
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:30,026
(Boink)

469
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:32,296
Why do you keep saying that when you're 186cm tall?

470
00:22:33,326 --> 00:22:34,696
It's still high for a guy who's 186cm tall.

471
00:22:35,626 --> 00:22:37,566
I'm 164cm tall, and I just sat without trying.

472
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:43,066
I'm a Buddhist, so when I go to a temple,

473
00:22:43,766 --> 00:22:46,036
I often drink ssanghwa tea.

474
00:22:47,006 --> 00:22:48,106
Do you put a raw egg on top?

475
00:22:48,546 --> 00:22:50,005
No, not many places serve them with raw eggs now.

476
00:22:50,006 --> 00:22:52,116
Don't they give you one at the teahouse if you ask?

477
00:22:52,946 --> 00:22:54,046
I've never been to a teahouse before.

478
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:57,256
Have you tried it with eggs?

479
00:22:57,456 --> 00:22:59,955
No. I can't eat raw eggs.

480
00:22:59,956 --> 00:23:02,186
I think you're talking about what you saw in movies.

481
00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:06,455
These look gorgeous.

482
00:23:06,456 --> 00:23:09,266
They're so pretty. And tiny.

483
00:23:09,466 --> 00:23:10,466
That's amazing.

484
00:23:12,136 --> 00:23:13,936
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

485
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:18,306
Let's eat. This is great.

486
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:21,046
- Is this coffee? - No, it's a deadly poison.

487
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:22,476
(Joking)

488
00:23:24,776 --> 00:23:25,776
(Slurping)

489
00:23:29,846 --> 00:23:30,856
Is it a honey rice cake?

490
00:23:37,226 --> 00:23:38,856
- Do you like this stuff? - It's good.

491
00:23:40,056 --> 00:23:42,496
- Traditional food? - I'm not picky about food.

492
00:23:43,126 --> 00:23:44,396
- Can I try it? - Go ahead.

493
00:23:45,636 --> 00:23:46,636
You can use your hands.

494
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:48,466
I'll use my hands, then.

495
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:51,335
- No, I'll use this. - Go ahead.

496
00:23:51,336 --> 00:23:53,535
(Dropping)

497
00:23:53,536 --> 00:23:54,605
Oh, no.

498
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:55,606
(Laughing)

499
00:23:57,146 --> 00:23:58,316
(Nom)

500
00:23:58,946 --> 00:24:00,016
With your hand.

501
00:24:02,786 --> 00:24:03,786
Wait.

502
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:06,556
Let me take one photo. This is incredible.

503
00:24:07,486 --> 00:24:08,486
(Clicking)

504
00:24:09,556 --> 00:24:10,556
(Clicking)

505
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:13,026
One more.

506
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:15,266
Or I was wrong.

507
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:20,966
(Clicking)

508
00:24:20,966 --> 00:24:21,966
(Falling)

509
00:24:23,406 --> 00:24:24,536
What's happening?

510
00:24:38,516 --> 00:24:40,785
Pearl... Let me give it a try.

511
00:24:40,786 --> 00:24:41,786
Sure.

512
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:45,626
I don't think you can spear it. Scoop it up.

513
00:24:46,226 --> 00:24:47,326
- With my hand? - I'll get it.

514
00:24:50,426 --> 00:24:52,966
(Concentrating)

515
00:24:54,806 --> 00:24:55,806
Hold on.

516
00:24:57,376 --> 00:24:58,536
- This is... - Hey.

517
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:00,336
Try it.

518
00:25:01,776 --> 00:25:02,806
Try it.

519
00:25:03,576 --> 00:25:05,676
You might not be able to chew it. Spit it out if it's too tough.

520
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:08,546
It tastes like sugar candy.

521
00:25:09,946 --> 00:25:15,626
(They grow closer as time goes by.)

522
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:21,325
(Exclaiming)

523
00:25:21,326 --> 00:25:22,326
Goodness.

524
00:25:22,327 --> 00:25:23,725
(Her heart flutters.)

525
00:25:23,726 --> 00:25:26,166
I didn't know you could make traditional sweets that romantic.

526
00:25:27,096 --> 00:25:28,965
They didn't talk about anything significant.

527
00:25:28,966 --> 00:25:29,966
I know, right?

528
00:25:30,366 --> 00:25:32,675
Ho Am won't even be on her mind now.

529
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:33,906
I know.

530
00:25:36,606 --> 00:25:37,676
What do you do to relax?

531
00:25:39,076 --> 00:25:40,076
To relax?

532
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:43,046
I exercise. I do yoga when I'm free.

533
00:25:43,386 --> 00:25:44,756
- Yoga? - Yes, I go to yoga classes.

534
00:25:45,756 --> 00:25:47,886
I heard that yoga was a type of meditation.

535
00:25:47,986 --> 00:25:49,155
You meditate as well.

536
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:51,326
- I heard. - It's a physical discipline.

537
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:53,656
Do you meditate every morning?

538
00:25:53,996 --> 00:25:55,396
I try to.

539
00:25:55,796 --> 00:26:00,066
When your breathing is on point, your hands and feet feel numb.

540
00:26:00,836 --> 00:26:02,466
I've never reached that point before.

541
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:06,135
You know, we breathe deeply on top of mountains.

542
00:26:06,136 --> 00:26:08,846
Then, even your hands feel numb. It's something like that.

543
00:26:09,706 --> 00:26:11,146
Because the energy courses through your whole body?

544
00:26:11,246 --> 00:26:13,476
You feel the breath come deeply within you.

545
00:26:14,646 --> 00:26:18,055
It's kind of like letting it go.

546
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:19,586
You know, you let it take your body.

547
00:26:20,016 --> 00:26:21,256
"Let it take your body."

548
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:24,256
Right. I get tense without realizing it.

549
00:26:30,896 --> 00:26:35,936
(Yun Jeong closes her eyes as if she was meditating.)

550
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:44,876
I suddenly started meditating.

551
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:56,826
I think I should keep doing this.

552
00:26:57,496 --> 00:26:58,696
It's relaxing.

553
00:27:05,036 --> 00:27:07,236
This place suits meditation.

554
00:27:14,106 --> 00:27:17,406
(Meanwhile in the house)

555
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:22,716
(Everyone went outside, and Byeong Yeol is left alone.)

556
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:25,916
Gosh, I'm so bored.

557
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:30,426
(Picking up)

558
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:36,695
Let me see.

559
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,736
(Slipping)

560
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:43,036
(Byeong Yeol is so funny.)

561
00:27:43,506 --> 00:27:44,675
He's exhausted when he's with other people,

562
00:27:44,676 --> 00:27:45,806
but he's bored when he's alone.

563
00:27:46,876 --> 00:27:48,146
- What should he do? - What should he do?

564
00:27:48,346 --> 00:27:49,506
He's so funny.

565
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:52,746
Let me see.

566
00:27:53,276 --> 00:27:54,286
(Oh, my gosh)

567
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:55,916
My gosh.

568
00:27:57,656 --> 00:28:02,326
(He flips through the saju notebook.)

569
00:28:03,326 --> 00:28:04,326
Black Horse.

570
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:08,126
Black Horse.

571
00:28:10,396 --> 00:28:16,266
(Will he be able to get through the day well?)

572
00:28:16,536 --> 00:28:17,636
Okay.

573
00:28:19,036 --> 00:28:20,536
Hello.

574
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:22,405
Oh, my.

575
00:28:22,406 --> 00:28:23,505
(First Come First Date for men, Jang Ho Am and Chae Yu Gyeong)

576
00:28:23,506 --> 00:28:24,646
It's so cool.

577
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,775
Is this what we're going to do today?

578
00:28:26,776 --> 00:28:28,386
Yes. This is what we're going to do today.

579
00:28:29,046 --> 00:28:31,015
I'm excited.

580
00:28:31,016 --> 00:28:32,016
(Ho Am planned a date at a painting workshop.)

581
00:28:32,256 --> 00:28:34,426
- Do you want me to choose for you? - Let's pick one for each other.

582
00:28:35,826 --> 00:28:36,856
Okay.

583
00:28:37,356 --> 00:28:39,356
Oh, my. Thank you.

584
00:28:45,366 --> 00:28:46,796
Put your arms here.

585
00:28:47,396 --> 00:28:48,736
Is this for an arm? Gosh.

586
00:28:50,536 --> 00:28:51,536
Here.

587
00:28:54,176 --> 00:28:55,446
I didn't know it was for an arm.

588
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:58,216
The strap is here.

589
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:03,246
Just a second.

590
00:29:04,986 --> 00:29:09,656
(Yu Gyeong ties his apron.)

591
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,156
- Done. - Thank you.

592
00:29:13,226 --> 00:29:14,996
- Can you tie it for me too? - Sure.

593
00:29:17,896 --> 00:29:19,435
The strap is too short.

594
00:29:19,436 --> 00:29:20,466
The strap?

595
00:29:22,436 --> 00:29:23,905
(Chuckling)

596
00:29:23,906 --> 00:29:25,306
Tie it tightly, please.

597
00:29:27,776 --> 00:29:29,346
It feels like I'm helping you wear the Red Skirt.

598
00:29:29,806 --> 00:29:31,015
Only we'll find it funny.

599
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:32,615
"Tie it tightly, please."

600
00:29:32,616 --> 00:29:33,746
- The Red Skirt. - Yes.

601
00:29:33,846 --> 00:29:35,446
Shamans wear...

602
00:29:35,646 --> 00:29:38,615
the Spirit Robe over hanbok.

603
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:41,455
They say shamans take the spirit into their body...

604
00:29:41,456 --> 00:29:44,126
one by one.

605
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:47,155
Shamans wear the Spirit Robe while playing around.

606
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:48,496
It felt just like that.

607
00:29:49,126 --> 00:29:53,336
It felt like he was tying the strips of my skirt.

608
00:29:54,766 --> 00:29:56,306
We're indeed shamans.

609
00:29:56,766 --> 00:29:59,775
Since we're shamans, we don't have to explain.

610
00:29:59,776 --> 00:30:01,806
Even if we say one word, we all understand.

611
00:30:02,546 --> 00:30:04,976
That's when I started to feel very comfortable.

612
00:30:06,616 --> 00:30:08,685
Let's paint the Bearbrick.

613
00:30:08,686 --> 00:30:10,085
Sounds good. It's going to be fun.

614
00:30:10,086 --> 00:30:11,916
(They'll paint Bearbricks on today's date.)

615
00:30:12,756 --> 00:30:15,056
Let's begin. It's going to be fun.

616
00:30:15,256 --> 00:30:16,526
Where should I paint?

617
00:30:18,696 --> 00:30:20,496
I really wanted to do this...

618
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:24,335
with a shaman, not necessarily you.

619
00:30:24,336 --> 00:30:25,736
- Really? Why? - Yes.

620
00:30:26,736 --> 00:30:28,136
Is it because of the princesses?

621
00:30:30,336 --> 00:30:32,806
The princesses? Did you want to share the hobby?

622
00:30:33,336 --> 00:30:34,476
I understand.

623
00:30:35,046 --> 00:30:36,376
I understand.

624
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:39,546
I'm glad I came with you.

625
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:42,686
Really?

626
00:30:43,446 --> 00:30:44,516
That's sweet.

627
00:30:49,826 --> 00:30:50,926
Thank you.

628
00:30:54,526 --> 00:30:56,296
How is it going? Can you paint it?

629
00:30:56,426 --> 00:30:57,596
Yes. It feels so good.

630
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:00,666
It's fun.

631
00:31:01,466 --> 00:31:02,566
I'm having fun.

632
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:06,676
We could bring this after we paint it.

633
00:31:07,076 --> 00:31:08,676
Yes. I'll show it off.

634
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:10,476
I'm going to put it on the table.

635
00:31:10,776 --> 00:31:11,776
Me too.

636
00:31:12,446 --> 00:31:13,876
It's like, "I did it."

637
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:18,016
(She likes the date he planned.)

638
00:31:18,816 --> 00:31:20,156
Will you put this?

639
00:31:20,886 --> 00:31:21,926
On the table?

640
00:31:22,356 --> 00:31:23,386
No.

641
00:31:23,726 --> 00:31:24,826
- In the shrine? - Yes.

642
00:31:25,126 --> 00:31:26,156
I should.

643
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,625
Can I say this?

644
00:31:28,626 --> 00:31:29,896
I hate the ones with eyes.

645
00:31:31,996 --> 00:31:33,436
- Me too. - Yes.

646
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:36,236
- I know what you mean. - I hate the ones with eyes.

647
00:31:36,366 --> 00:31:37,805
- Right. I can't put something... - I'd rather...

648
00:31:37,806 --> 00:31:38,835
that has limbs.

649
00:31:38,836 --> 00:31:40,406
I'd rather put plushies...

650
00:31:40,676 --> 00:31:41,706
without eyes.

651
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:45,515
- Like stuffed animals? Me too. - Yes.

652
00:31:45,516 --> 00:31:46,746
(The shamans' taste is a little spooky somehow.)

653
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:49,116
I don't like it.

654
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:55,056
I feel like...

655
00:31:55,226 --> 00:31:57,656
you and I...

656
00:31:59,496 --> 00:32:00,856
are more compatible than the others.

657
00:32:01,226 --> 00:32:02,326
As a shaman as well.

658
00:32:03,426 --> 00:32:05,136
- I feel the same way. - You do?

659
00:32:05,536 --> 00:32:06,666
- I think so. - Yes.

660
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:09,206
- I don't know about the others. - Right.

661
00:32:09,336 --> 00:32:12,006
I don't know about the others, but...

662
00:32:14,106 --> 00:32:15,646
I guess we're similar.

663
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:18,045
When a shaman meets another shaman,

664
00:32:18,046 --> 00:32:20,375
it's important to have permission from the divine spirit.

665
00:32:20,376 --> 00:32:22,046
You need their permission.

666
00:32:22,886 --> 00:32:24,615
When a shaman is with another shaman,

667
00:32:24,616 --> 00:32:26,316
they often have a headache...

668
00:32:26,586 --> 00:32:29,656
or feel negative energy.

669
00:32:29,686 --> 00:32:31,456
But it was comfortable when I was with her.

670
00:32:32,056 --> 00:32:36,196
I felt our spirits were very compatible.

671
00:32:36,326 --> 00:32:38,966
I thought the spirits would show a positive response...

672
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:41,666
if I meet him.

673
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:45,775
(The divine spirits gave them permission to date.)

674
00:32:45,776 --> 00:32:48,146
- It's a thing? - This is so...

675
00:32:48,646 --> 00:32:49,806
I guess they gave them permission.

676
00:32:50,246 --> 00:32:52,076
When you're little,

677
00:32:52,116 --> 00:32:54,785
you want to hang out with your friend until late,

678
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:56,315
but you need your mom's permission.

679
00:32:56,316 --> 00:32:59,385
- When our mothers are close, - Right.

680
00:32:59,386 --> 00:33:02,985
- they hang out together. - That's a good analogy.

681
00:33:02,986 --> 00:33:04,355
- Then we can hang out... - Right.

682
00:33:04,356 --> 00:33:05,696
- until late at night. - That's so true.

683
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,755
- That's true. - I've done it many times.

684
00:33:07,756 --> 00:33:11,365
It makes sense. If the divine spirits are compatible...

685
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:13,236
(Anticipating)

686
00:33:15,866 --> 00:33:19,436
"What if I could have a serious relationship with a shaman?"

687
00:33:19,776 --> 00:33:21,546
Have you ever thought about it?

688
00:33:22,106 --> 00:33:23,576
When it comes to dating a shaman,

689
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:27,776
I think the divine spirit's opinion would matter more than mine.

690
00:33:30,046 --> 00:33:32,616
- Right. - I think I'll have feelings...

691
00:33:32,716 --> 00:33:35,686
only when the divine spirits agree.

692
00:33:40,826 --> 00:33:44,196
If we can find the one here,

693
00:33:44,936 --> 00:33:46,736
- it must be destiny. - Right.

694
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:52,576
(They relate to each other.)

695
00:33:54,846 --> 00:33:57,075
Among the four women in the house,

696
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,676
do you think there's one for you?

697
00:34:01,616 --> 00:34:03,715
- Yes, I do. - Really?

698
00:34:03,716 --> 00:34:04,716
There's one?

699
00:34:04,717 --> 00:34:06,885
I think we're compatible.

700
00:34:06,886 --> 00:34:08,326
I've been interested in her.

701
00:34:11,256 --> 00:34:13,356
- Really? Who would that be? - Yes.

702
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:18,066
That made me curious.

703
00:34:18,936 --> 00:34:21,606
Did you know when you saw her at first?

704
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:28,876
I think I had feelings from the beginning.

705
00:34:30,446 --> 00:34:32,316
I couldn't do much.

706
00:34:33,116 --> 00:34:35,486
But I didn't want to rush it.

707
00:34:35,786 --> 00:34:39,856
I wanted to take time.

708
00:34:42,156 --> 00:34:44,695
- You're serious about it. - Yes.

709
00:34:44,696 --> 00:34:46,256
- Of course, I am. Yes. - Really?

710
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:51,066
Why did you laugh?

711
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:54,066
Why did you laugh?

712
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:55,206
I think it'd be nice.

713
00:34:55,706 --> 00:35:00,576
I want to meet her even after leaving here.

714
00:35:04,506 --> 00:35:06,546
Did you hear what he said?

715
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:07,916
Ho Am.

716
00:35:08,586 --> 00:35:10,716
- He's straightforward this time. - Yes.

717
00:35:12,656 --> 00:35:13,656
I like that.

718
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:15,026
"I like that."

719
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:18,125
I...

720
00:35:18,126 --> 00:35:20,296
(I want to meet her even after leaving here.)

721
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:22,626
That's the best compliment.

722
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:32,576
I didn't try to figure out who I'm destined to be with.

723
00:35:33,206 --> 00:35:34,746
While I'm here,

724
00:35:35,106 --> 00:35:38,246
I don't want to use my energy to figure out who it is...

725
00:35:38,676 --> 00:35:40,446
even though I can't help it when someone draws my attention.

726
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:43,046
You want to let it happen naturally.

727
00:35:45,516 --> 00:35:46,756
I think that's nice too.

728
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:49,926
Did you try to figure it out?

729
00:35:51,956 --> 00:35:53,156
I did at first.

730
00:35:54,426 --> 00:35:55,696
But then...

731
00:35:56,426 --> 00:35:59,366
I thought it'd be better to just relax.

732
00:35:59,636 --> 00:36:01,406
So I just follow my heart now.

733
00:36:04,436 --> 00:36:07,236
- You acted as your heart desired. - Yes.

734
00:36:09,446 --> 00:36:15,046
That's why I asked you out today.

735
00:36:15,616 --> 00:36:16,816
(Surprised)

736
00:36:18,586 --> 00:36:20,056
Look at him.

737
00:36:20,616 --> 00:36:21,656
He doesn't miss a chance.

738
00:36:22,426 --> 00:36:23,756
He got the five-element flags.

739
00:36:24,856 --> 00:36:26,926
- Sudden Ho Am. - Ho Am Sudden.

740
00:36:27,756 --> 00:36:29,726
(In sync)

741
00:36:30,196 --> 00:36:31,736
You can't say something like that out of nowhere.

742
00:36:33,536 --> 00:36:36,236
I might be honest with Yu Gyeong because she's a shaman.

743
00:36:36,636 --> 00:36:38,675
Or I might be honest because I want to.

744
00:36:38,676 --> 00:36:41,276
I just become honest with her.

745
00:36:41,606 --> 00:36:44,975
It usually takes some time for me to have feelings for someone.

746
00:36:44,976 --> 00:36:48,416
Once I have feelings, I like to make a move.

747
00:36:49,286 --> 00:36:52,386
(When he asked her out for the First Come First Date)

748
00:36:53,456 --> 00:36:54,615
Yu Gyeong,

749
00:36:54,616 --> 00:36:56,625
- can we talk for a moment? - Sure.

750
00:36:56,626 --> 00:36:57,655
(Ho Am is the first one who called Yu Gyeong.)

751
00:36:57,656 --> 00:36:59,325
I get nervous...

752
00:36:59,326 --> 00:37:00,996
- when a shaman calls me. - There's no need to.

753
00:37:01,126 --> 00:37:02,326
My goodness.

754
00:37:03,196 --> 00:37:05,736
I took you downstairs.

755
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:07,266
Oh, right.

756
00:37:08,236 --> 00:37:10,536
That's because I didn't want someone else to ask you out.

757
00:37:12,136 --> 00:37:13,275
Really?

758
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:14,876
- Why did you do that? - So I took you out quickly.

759
00:37:15,176 --> 00:37:16,376
You're giving me butterflies.

760
00:37:17,906 --> 00:37:20,676
Yu Gyeong, do you mind if I ask you out?

761
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:22,985
(Ho Am went straight to Yu Gyeong without hesitation.)

762
00:37:22,986 --> 00:37:24,085
I don't.

763
00:37:24,086 --> 00:37:26,056
(Ho Am went straight to Yu Gyeong without hesitation.)

764
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,656
(Her heart is fluttering.)

765
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:30,226
It feels like I'm broken.

766
00:37:31,856 --> 00:37:33,726
How can you say something like that...

767
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:37,366
as if it was nothing?

768
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,396
It feels like I'm the only one...

769
00:37:41,766 --> 00:37:45,176
(She's not used to his straightforward remarks.)

770
00:37:45,906 --> 00:37:47,136
(Shy)

771
00:37:49,206 --> 00:37:50,776
I think I'm done.

772
00:37:51,006 --> 00:37:52,116
You did well.

773
00:37:53,476 --> 00:37:54,616
What's that?

774
00:37:55,746 --> 00:37:56,846
It's cute.

775
00:37:58,356 --> 00:37:59,516
Does it remind you of anything?

776
00:38:04,426 --> 00:38:06,596
My gosh. No way.

777
00:38:07,096 --> 00:38:08,432
Seriously?

778
00:38:10,362 --> 00:38:14,362
A yellow jacket and a red skirt.

779
00:38:15,772 --> 00:38:17,072
- Great Divine Grandmother? - Yes.

780
00:38:18,272 --> 00:38:19,841
(Ho Am brought Great Divine Grandmother.)

781
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:21,542
The string is so detailed.

782
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,942
(Bursting into laughter)

783
00:38:25,242 --> 00:38:28,082
I guess Ho Am really wanted to talk about things like that.

784
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:29,752
Who would he talk about it with?

785
00:38:30,012 --> 00:38:32,852
It makes them laugh and continue to talk.

786
00:38:33,182 --> 00:38:35,622
He could really put that in the shrine.

787
00:38:38,992 --> 00:38:40,192
Of course, you know.

788
00:38:41,832 --> 00:38:44,202
I had no idea. I was wondering what you were doing.

789
00:38:45,442 --> 00:38:47,171
- I'm satisfied with this. - Me too.

790
00:38:47,172 --> 00:38:48,211
(The shamans painted the Bearbricks based on their taste.)

791
00:38:48,212 --> 00:38:49,342
It's cute.

792
00:38:50,612 --> 00:38:53,042
Gosh, I love the interior.

793
00:38:54,142 --> 00:38:55,282
Thank you.

794
00:38:58,452 --> 00:38:59,581
This place is so cool.

795
00:38:59,582 --> 00:39:00,922
(The restaurant Ho Am picked)

796
00:39:01,252 --> 00:39:02,752
- Shall we sit here? - Yes.

797
00:39:04,452 --> 00:39:06,362
What do they have?

798
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:10,532
I wanted to have Korean food so badly.

799
00:39:12,032 --> 00:39:14,202
Actually, me too.

800
00:39:14,332 --> 00:39:16,632
We always have Korean food in the shrine.

801
00:39:17,872 --> 00:39:18,972
Right.

802
00:39:19,372 --> 00:39:20,571
- It tastes so good. - Yes.

803
00:39:20,572 --> 00:39:23,072
(A perfect menu for shamans)

804
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:27,482
Today's date is perfect for shamans.

805
00:39:28,212 --> 00:39:30,652
- Right? - Yes.

806
00:39:31,652 --> 00:39:32,751
Interesting.

807
00:39:32,752 --> 00:39:35,022
It's like it's planned for us.

808
00:39:37,192 --> 00:39:38,392
- Why are you being like this? - It feels like it.

809
00:39:38,992 --> 00:39:40,122
My gosh.

810
00:39:42,462 --> 00:39:44,462
- I'm so glad we ordered this. - Oh, my.

811
00:39:44,732 --> 00:39:45,932
It looks amazing.

812
00:39:47,002 --> 00:39:49,032
- It's the smell we go crazy for. - It looks good.

813
00:39:50,202 --> 00:39:51,402
Mix it.

814
00:39:53,502 --> 00:39:55,272
(Looking intently)

815
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:58,582
- Thank you. - Enjoy it.

816
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,852
- I'll enjoy the food. - I'll enjoy the food.

817
00:40:07,222 --> 00:40:08,322
It's so good.

818
00:40:10,592 --> 00:40:12,022
(Eating)

819
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,132
- Is it good? - It's amazing.

820
00:40:18,532 --> 00:40:19,732
It's mind-blowing.

821
00:40:20,262 --> 00:40:21,402
It tastes so good.

822
00:40:22,372 --> 00:40:25,002
How did you think of bringing me to a place like this?

823
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:28,371
How did I end up being here?

824
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:29,472
I'm happy.

825
00:40:31,812 --> 00:40:33,942
I liked everything I did today.

826
00:40:35,782 --> 00:40:38,152
What was your favourite?

827
00:40:38,952 --> 00:40:41,822
My favourite is our date.

828
00:40:43,392 --> 00:40:44,522
What?

829
00:40:44,752 --> 00:40:47,362
(Ho Am speaks frankly.)

830
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:49,031
What?

831
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:50,032
(Shy)

832
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:53,661
Painting the Bearbrick was fun too.

833
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:54,802
The food is also good.

834
00:40:58,202 --> 00:40:59,442
The date makes me feel so happy.

835
00:41:03,872 --> 00:41:06,582
I've never seen you enjoy food this much since you came to the house.

836
00:41:07,082 --> 00:41:09,582
- You're right. - You must really like Korean food.

837
00:41:10,152 --> 00:41:12,052
I think I'm enjoying it more today.

838
00:41:14,122 --> 00:41:15,652
(Glancing)

839
00:41:16,992 --> 00:41:18,092
Because you're with me?

840
00:41:18,962 --> 00:41:20,092
Because you're with me?

841
00:41:20,492 --> 00:41:24,362
(It's her turn to be straightforward now.)

842
00:41:26,362 --> 00:41:27,662
Neither of us is shy about this.

843
00:41:28,202 --> 00:41:29,302
You know what I mean, right?

844
00:41:33,302 --> 00:41:34,872
But your ears are so red.

845
00:41:35,942 --> 00:41:38,842
- I can't hide my ears. - Right. They're so red.

846
00:41:40,212 --> 00:41:41,682
(Blushing)

847
00:41:41,912 --> 00:41:44,812
(Ho Am's ears are burning.)

848
00:41:46,122 --> 00:41:47,351
They're really red.

849
00:41:47,352 --> 00:41:49,792
- They're redder than mine. - Oh, my.

850
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:52,222
He didn't even drink.

851
00:41:52,362 --> 00:41:53,691
His ears are about to burst.

852
00:41:53,692 --> 00:41:55,791
I know because my ears also become red sometimes.

853
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:59,262
It's so hard because I can't see my ears.

854
00:41:59,362 --> 00:42:00,702
- That's true. - It's so hard.

855
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:02,171
That's true.

856
00:42:02,172 --> 00:42:03,732
I can't see if they're red or not.

857
00:42:11,742 --> 00:42:14,642
By the way, it's very different from your first impression.

858
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,352
- Now? - Yes. You're different.

859
00:42:16,782 --> 00:42:17,852
Yes.

860
00:42:18,822 --> 00:42:21,551
I feel it now, and I also felt that...

861
00:42:21,552 --> 00:42:23,792
when we spent time in the house before the date.

862
00:42:23,922 --> 00:42:25,392
You're very different from your first impression.

863
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:28,192
How did it change?

864
00:42:30,362 --> 00:42:31,732
As we spent time together,

865
00:42:32,532 --> 00:42:34,802
I realized you're a much better talker than I had thought.

866
00:42:35,772 --> 00:42:37,032
After revealing my job?

867
00:42:39,872 --> 00:42:42,842
Your first impression wasn't bad,

868
00:42:43,012 --> 00:42:44,472
but it's much better now.

869
00:42:48,342 --> 00:42:49,581
Do you have an ideal type?

870
00:42:49,582 --> 00:42:51,612
(Do you have an ideal type?)

871
00:42:52,252 --> 00:42:53,382
- An ideal type? - Yes.

872
00:42:53,952 --> 00:42:55,721
- An ideal type? - Appearance-wise.

873
00:42:55,722 --> 00:42:56,922
- Appearance? - Yes.

874
00:42:58,052 --> 00:42:59,622
I like pretty people, which is obvious.

875
00:43:03,462 --> 00:43:07,031
Someone with big eyes and a small face.

876
00:43:07,032 --> 00:43:08,132
Are you talking about yourself?

877
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:10,432
Is it like, "Love yourself?"

878
00:43:10,772 --> 00:43:13,042
That'd be my ideal type based on appearance.

879
00:43:13,142 --> 00:43:14,772
A small face and big eyes.

880
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:20,142
When it comes to the inner self, I like strong-minded people...

881
00:43:20,942 --> 00:43:22,312
who don't waver easily.

882
00:43:27,622 --> 00:43:29,452
People with strong opinions.

883
00:43:30,922 --> 00:43:32,662
Honest people.

884
00:43:35,862 --> 00:43:39,262
(Who did he think of?)

885
00:43:40,432 --> 00:43:41,662
- Shall we eat the dessert? - Yes.

886
00:43:42,432 --> 00:43:43,771
Do you like cheesecakes?

887
00:43:43,772 --> 00:43:45,302
Yes, I do.

888
00:43:45,972 --> 00:43:47,072
One, two.

889
00:43:50,442 --> 00:43:52,441
Is the cake for celebrating the first day of their relationship?

890
00:43:52,442 --> 00:43:53,581
(Reasonable suspicion)

891
00:43:53,582 --> 00:43:55,311
- You're right. - They blew it together.

892
00:43:55,312 --> 00:43:57,252
Do people usually put a candle on their dessert?

893
00:43:58,922 --> 00:44:00,651
- It's over for them. - Gosh.

894
00:44:00,652 --> 00:44:02,392
It looks like the first day of their relationship.

895
00:44:09,162 --> 00:44:10,292
(Eating)

896
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:15,332
(They taste the celebratory cake.)

897
00:44:15,872 --> 00:44:16,972
It's good.

898
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:21,742
- Is it salt? - Yes. It's salt.

899
00:44:22,272 --> 00:44:23,912
Oh, my. There's salt here.

900
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,581
- It tastes better with salt. - What?

901
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,582
- It tastes better with salt. - With salt?

902
00:44:31,112 --> 00:44:32,882
I think I've never had a cake with salt.

903
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:34,522
Why did you laugh?

904
00:44:34,582 --> 00:44:35,652
I heard it wrong.

905
00:44:38,352 --> 00:44:39,992
I think I hear what I want to.

906
00:44:40,092 --> 00:44:41,662
- What did you think you heard? - I heard it wrong.

907
00:44:42,862 --> 00:44:44,692
(Curious)

908
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:46,102
I'll tell you next time.

909
00:44:50,532 --> 00:44:51,732
What did you hear?

910
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:53,572
I...

911
00:44:53,742 --> 00:44:55,912
thought you said, "It tastes better with Ho Am."

912
00:44:57,372 --> 00:44:59,542
- That's what you wanted to hear. - It was "with salt."

913
00:45:01,242 --> 00:45:04,952
(Oh, boy)

914
00:45:06,022 --> 00:45:08,282
- He really heard it like that. - Right.

915
00:45:09,752 --> 00:45:12,192
I wondered if he heard it like that.

916
00:45:12,322 --> 00:45:14,721
But "salt" and "Ho Am" are so different, aren't they?

917
00:45:14,722 --> 00:45:16,692
- They have nothing in common. - I know.

918
00:45:16,832 --> 00:45:18,802
That's nonsense.

919
00:45:19,932 --> 00:45:21,102
Oh, dear.

920
00:45:24,732 --> 00:45:25,841
That's why you didn't say anything.

921
00:45:25,842 --> 00:45:26,842
I interpreted it how I wanted.

922
00:45:26,843 --> 00:45:28,302
(He heard it the way he wanted.)

923
00:45:29,742 --> 00:45:32,742
Of course, it's tastier because I'm having it with you.

924
00:45:33,382 --> 00:45:35,282
(Embarrassed)

925
00:45:36,852 --> 00:45:37,982
What could it be?

926
00:45:38,452 --> 00:45:40,082
Where are we going? What is it?

927
00:45:40,982 --> 00:45:42,551
Wait. What's here? I must check it out quickly.

928
00:45:42,552 --> 00:45:44,292
(First Come First Date for men, Jung Hyeon U and Lee Ra Yun)

929
00:45:45,722 --> 00:45:47,561
- Are we going to dance? - No.

930
00:45:47,562 --> 00:45:49,191
- No, right? - No.

931
00:45:49,192 --> 00:45:50,192
- No, right? - No.

932
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:53,002
No way. Is it the escape room?

933
00:45:53,202 --> 00:45:54,202
That's right.

934
00:45:54,402 --> 00:45:56,272
Really? I love these things!

935
00:45:56,932 --> 00:45:58,401
I love them.

936
00:45:58,402 --> 00:45:59,601
I haven't done a lot of these.

937
00:45:59,602 --> 00:46:00,701
- So I'm looking forward to it. - Really?

938
00:46:00,702 --> 00:46:01,702
Yes.

939
00:46:03,072 --> 00:46:04,112
How do you think it will be?

940
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:08,612
- How do I think it will be? - Yes.

941
00:46:09,052 --> 00:46:11,352
I'll be happy if I don't run out because I'm scared.

942
00:46:11,882 --> 00:46:13,452
Do you easily get scared?

943
00:46:13,822 --> 00:46:15,422
Of course, I get scared.

944
00:46:15,892 --> 00:46:17,291
I'm more scared that...

945
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:18,922
I might see things in there than how it's set up.

946
00:46:20,492 --> 00:46:21,561
(Real ghosts scare her more than the horror themed room.)

947
00:46:21,562 --> 00:46:22,661
I sounded like a typical shaman, right?

948
00:46:22,662 --> 00:46:23,662
I have nothing to say to that.

949
00:46:24,062 --> 00:46:26,302
"This kind of theme doesn't scare me."

950
00:46:26,732 --> 00:46:28,002
I say that now. But what if...

951
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:32,242
But it'd be quite funny. Both of us have gwimungwansal.

952
00:46:32,442 --> 00:46:34,242
That could happen.

953
00:46:34,842 --> 00:46:36,641
What? Gwimungwansal?

954
00:46:36,642 --> 00:46:37,642
- Is it about spirits? - That's...

955
00:46:37,972 --> 00:46:39,612
Let me explain what it is.

956
00:46:39,712 --> 00:46:42,881
Their gate connected to spirits can easily be opened.

957
00:46:42,882 --> 00:46:45,481
It refers to the path spirits can walk back and forth.

958
00:46:45,482 --> 00:46:48,352
Gwimungwansal is a type of spiritual energy in saju.

959
00:46:48,452 --> 00:46:50,222
Then isn't it better for them?

960
00:46:50,322 --> 00:46:51,351
It could be,

961
00:46:51,352 --> 00:46:53,122
but that's why they're saying they're scared.

962
00:46:54,362 --> 00:46:56,632
The meaning must be different to them.

963
00:46:57,362 --> 00:46:59,031
Then let me help you get inside.

964
00:46:59,032 --> 00:47:00,201
- Okay. - Come this way.

965
00:47:00,202 --> 00:47:02,272
(The two shamans will begin the scary escape room.)

966
00:47:07,442 --> 00:47:09,811
Only look at the floor. Don't look around.

967
00:47:09,812 --> 00:47:11,171
- Follow me, please. - Okay.

968
00:47:11,172 --> 00:47:13,311
Listen to the narration fully before you begin.

969
00:47:13,312 --> 00:47:14,811
Only then will you be able to continue.

970
00:47:14,812 --> 00:47:16,012
(Ra Yun and Hyeon U enter carefully.)

971
00:47:16,112 --> 00:47:19,451
(Dark)

972
00:47:19,452 --> 00:47:21,482
- Come inside. - Yes.

973
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:24,191
- Have fun. - Thank you.

974
00:47:24,192 --> 00:47:25,192
Thank you.

975
00:47:27,022 --> 00:47:28,462
Wait. Are we starting here?

976
00:47:29,262 --> 00:47:31,332
- We're starting here? - This is where we'll start?

977
00:47:31,792 --> 00:47:32,802
Oh, my.

978
00:47:32,862 --> 00:47:34,462
(Flustered)

979
00:47:34,862 --> 00:47:36,672
Four and two.

980
00:47:37,802 --> 00:47:39,072
Seven on the right.

981
00:47:39,842 --> 00:47:41,271
Six and two.

982
00:47:41,272 --> 00:47:42,342
- That startled me. - My goodness.

983
00:47:45,012 --> 00:47:48,142
(The bravery of the two shamans is concerning from the get-go.)

984
00:47:48,712 --> 00:47:50,482
Hey, we're such scaredy-cats.

985
00:47:51,312 --> 00:47:52,322
That's so funny.

986
00:47:53,282 --> 00:47:54,582
- Hey, check this out. - My gosh.

987
00:47:56,692 --> 00:47:58,322
(Looking around)

988
00:47:58,692 --> 00:48:01,222
(She spotted something the moment she comes in?)

989
00:48:01,592 --> 00:48:03,192
Hey, isn't this Gang Won?

990
00:48:06,032 --> 00:48:07,332
- Gang Won. Yes. - Right?

991
00:48:08,202 --> 00:48:11,472
(A man in the drawing is striking an odd pose.)

992
00:48:12,872 --> 00:48:15,072
(The pose looks familiar for some reason.)

993
00:48:15,772 --> 00:48:18,442
(It's Gang Won's signature pose.)

994
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:20,212
(I can see it.)

995
00:48:20,612 --> 00:48:21,711
How do I do that?

996
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:22,952
(Meanwhile, Gang Won is...)

997
00:48:23,552 --> 00:48:24,552
(First Come First Date for men, Lee Gang Won and Hong Yu Ra)

998
00:48:24,553 --> 00:48:28,252
(First Come First Date for men, Lee Gang Won and Hong Yu Ra)

999
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:30,722
- I'm so curious about their date. - Yes.

1000
00:48:30,822 --> 00:48:32,492
It's a combination I didn't even imagine.

1001
00:48:33,062 --> 00:48:34,991
Yu Ra said that she was curious...

1002
00:48:34,992 --> 00:48:36,731
- about Gang Won. - Yes.

1003
00:48:36,732 --> 00:48:37,732
- Right? - Yes.

1004
00:48:37,733 --> 00:48:39,262
This is exciting.

1005
00:48:39,962 --> 00:48:43,631
(They came to a cat cafe.)

1006
00:48:43,632 --> 00:48:47,142
I was looking for a place to go, and I missed my cats.

1007
00:48:47,242 --> 00:48:48,342
- Right. - That's why I brought you here.

1008
00:48:49,572 --> 00:48:50,972
Seeing them makes me miss them more.

1009
00:48:51,842 --> 00:48:53,941
(Both of them have cats.)

1010
00:48:53,942 --> 00:48:56,482
- Hello. What a beautiful cat. - Right.

1011
00:48:58,252 --> 00:48:59,882
How many cats did you say you had?

1012
00:49:00,782 --> 00:49:02,252
Do you want to guess?

1013
00:49:04,592 --> 00:49:05,592
Two?

1014
00:49:06,792 --> 00:49:08,591
- About six. - Really?

1015
00:49:08,592 --> 00:49:10,361
- No way. - You got me.

1016
00:49:10,362 --> 00:49:11,362
I do have two.

1017
00:49:11,362 --> 00:49:12,362
- Two cats. - Yes.

1018
00:49:16,132 --> 00:49:20,872
(There's an awkward silence afterward.)

1019
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,872
(Glancing)

1020
00:49:26,212 --> 00:49:28,282
(What are you guys doing?)

1021
00:49:32,822 --> 00:49:33,822
Thank you.

1022
00:49:33,822 --> 00:49:34,822
(The drinks are served in this awkward silence.)

1023
00:49:34,823 --> 00:49:36,291
Do you have wet wipes?

1024
00:49:36,292 --> 00:49:38,022
Enjoy it, although I didn't make it.

1025
00:49:39,762 --> 00:49:40,962
I'm sure I will.

1026
00:49:43,132 --> 00:49:45,902
The tiny one gets scared easily.

1027
00:49:46,062 --> 00:49:47,301
That's the cat's favourite snack.

1028
00:49:47,302 --> 00:49:48,332
- This one? - Yes.

1029
00:49:49,102 --> 00:49:51,232
- Why don't you try that? - I don't see any tiny cats.

1030
00:49:51,332 --> 00:49:52,341
Where did it go?

1031
00:49:52,342 --> 00:49:55,941
The only thing that's tiny here is you. I'm sorry.

1032
00:49:55,942 --> 00:49:57,012
- I'm sorry. - What?

1033
00:49:57,672 --> 00:49:59,512
(Gang Won's joke softens the awkward mood.)

1034
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:01,312
It was my bad. I was joking.

1035
00:50:01,812 --> 00:50:03,012
That came out of nowhere.

1036
00:50:07,222 --> 00:50:08,922
(Rustling)

1037
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:11,592
(Gang Won uses the snack to lure the cats.)

1038
00:50:11,952 --> 00:50:13,822
This one seems to like everything.

1039
00:50:14,562 --> 00:50:15,592
Right.

1040
00:50:16,832 --> 00:50:17,832
Where did it go?

1041
00:50:18,732 --> 00:50:20,761
(She looks for the tiny cat.)

1042
00:50:20,762 --> 00:50:22,501
- There it is. - Did it come out?

1043
00:50:22,502 --> 00:50:23,801
(The tiny cat shows up.)

1044
00:50:23,802 --> 00:50:25,172
I won't look at you either.

1045
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:27,942
- What? - It keeps running away.

1046
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:29,112
How cute.

1047
00:50:31,812 --> 00:50:37,311
(The two of them only stare at the cats.)

1048
00:50:37,312 --> 00:50:38,482
That's a cute facial expression.

1049
00:50:38,982 --> 00:50:40,621
(Oh, no)

1050
00:50:40,622 --> 00:50:42,322
Their date isn't going well. What should they do?

1051
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:45,922
If it's that awkward even with Gang Won...

1052
00:50:46,862 --> 00:50:48,362
My gosh. What should they do?

1053
00:50:49,692 --> 00:50:51,962
Gosh, I was like, "What should I do?"

1054
00:50:52,432 --> 00:50:53,802
I kept thinking that.

1055
00:50:53,902 --> 00:50:55,301
I didn't want to show it.

1056
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,732
So I tried to talk to her as much as I could.

1057
00:51:00,242 --> 00:51:01,242
Is it better for both spouses to work?

1058
00:51:01,243 --> 00:51:02,671
Or is it better for one spouse to work and cover all the expenses?

1059
00:51:02,672 --> 00:51:03,672
What do you think?

1060
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:05,471
- Both spouses should work. - You think so?

1061
00:51:05,472 --> 00:51:06,482
Yes.

1062
00:51:06,612 --> 00:51:07,982
(Chuckling)

1063
00:51:09,112 --> 00:51:10,112
- What? - What?

1064
00:51:10,113 --> 00:51:12,481
(What kind of conversation is that?)

1065
00:51:12,482 --> 00:51:13,881
(Shocked)

1066
00:51:13,882 --> 00:51:15,992
They're talking about single or dual income families?

1067
00:51:17,792 --> 00:51:19,361
Is it okay for them to ask each other's parents' names?

1068
00:51:19,362 --> 00:51:20,462
(It's like watching a dud date.)

1069
00:51:21,062 --> 00:51:25,262
(Afterward, it gets awkward again.)

1070
00:51:27,932 --> 00:51:29,332
Do you have any questions for me?

1071
00:51:30,932 --> 00:51:33,642
(A desperate gaze)

1072
00:51:36,012 --> 00:51:41,012
Then are Japanese spirits different?

1073
00:51:41,982 --> 00:51:43,982
I haven't met them. But there should, right?

1074
00:51:44,912 --> 00:51:47,982
From what I hear, Japanese spirits are scarier.

1075
00:51:51,222 --> 00:51:52,722
No, I think you're scarier.

1076
00:51:52,922 --> 00:51:54,122
- Really? - Yes.

1077
00:51:54,322 --> 00:51:55,731
I get scared very easily.

1078
00:51:55,732 --> 00:51:57,562
(This date scares Gang Won.)

1079
00:52:02,902 --> 00:52:04,072
Well...

1080
00:52:04,572 --> 00:52:07,942
(They run out of things to talk about.)

1081
00:52:08,742 --> 00:52:11,412
(The cat is on the move again to break the silence.)

1082
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:12,712
Can I feed it to the cat?

1083
00:52:16,752 --> 00:52:20,182
We need a being that can break our silence.

1084
00:52:21,082 --> 00:52:23,092
It must be tough for you to do all the talking.

1085
00:52:24,192 --> 00:52:26,692
(Eating)

1086
00:52:28,892 --> 00:52:31,062
Thank you. What's your name?

1087
00:52:31,592 --> 00:52:32,602
What do you need?

1088
00:52:35,262 --> 00:52:38,472
I'll try to talk more in the evening.

1089
00:52:40,142 --> 00:52:41,272
Yes, be brave.

1090
00:52:44,742 --> 00:52:46,042
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1091
00:52:47,142 --> 00:52:48,712
We have to say goodbye to them now.

1092
00:52:49,452 --> 00:52:50,452
Bye.

1093
00:52:51,182 --> 00:52:54,082
We'll meet again, right? Let's meet again.

1094
00:52:55,892 --> 00:52:56,951
How sad.

1095
00:52:56,952 --> 00:52:58,522
(Are you already leaving?)

1096
00:52:59,322 --> 00:53:00,522
Do you want me to hold your bag?

1097
00:53:01,122 --> 00:53:02,161
Don't you have to put on your jacket?

1098
00:53:02,162 --> 00:53:04,262
It's okay. I don't think it will be cold out.

1099
00:53:04,462 --> 00:53:05,491
And it might be cold.

1100
00:53:05,492 --> 00:53:07,001
- Bye. - Thank you.

1101
00:53:07,002 --> 00:53:09,572
(Will they be able to get close today?)

1102
00:53:10,572 --> 00:53:12,102
Right now...

1103
00:53:13,472 --> 00:53:14,501
I mean, having a meal...

1104
00:53:14,502 --> 00:53:15,542
- would be good too. - Okay.

1105
00:53:15,642 --> 00:53:17,612
But there's something I want to see.

1106
00:53:17,712 --> 00:53:20,342
- Come again? I see. - There's something I want to see.

1107
00:53:22,042 --> 00:53:23,812
- What is it? - It's a secret.

1108
00:53:25,512 --> 00:53:28,482
(The two of them arrive...)

1109
00:53:28,922 --> 00:53:29,952
It's a college.

1110
00:53:30,922 --> 00:53:32,522
You wanted to come to a college, right?

1111
00:53:32,962 --> 00:53:34,122
Right? That's it.

1112
00:53:35,662 --> 00:53:36,662
It's beautiful.

1113
00:53:38,562 --> 00:53:39,732
I see college students.

1114
00:53:41,902 --> 00:53:43,532
I feel like I'm a freshman.

1115
00:53:44,432 --> 00:53:45,672
Why am I getting excited?

1116
00:53:46,802 --> 00:53:47,971
(The mood of the campus excites him for some reason.)

1117
00:53:47,972 --> 00:53:49,942
It's exciting. What's going on?

1118
00:53:56,282 --> 00:53:57,352
Gosh, the air is so fresh.

1119
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,182
- Which way should we go? - How about this way?

1120
00:54:01,282 --> 00:54:02,352
Okay.

1121
00:54:03,492 --> 00:54:05,252
When I was in school,

1122
00:54:05,862 --> 00:54:08,992
I really liked playing dodge ball and kickball.

1123
00:54:10,132 --> 00:54:11,791
- I bet you were good. You got grit. - Yes.

1124
00:54:11,792 --> 00:54:13,931
- Right. - I bet you get competitive.

1125
00:54:13,932 --> 00:54:16,072
I'm quite competitive. So when I played sports...

1126
00:54:21,202 --> 00:54:22,472
Do you like soccer?

1127
00:54:23,612 --> 00:54:25,342
Do you think I'll be good at soccer or not?

1128
00:54:26,482 --> 00:54:28,442
- I bet you're good. - How did you know?

1129
00:54:29,382 --> 00:54:31,681
I thought I'd be good at soccer like the cartoon characters...

1130
00:54:31,682 --> 00:54:33,622
or athletes like Park Ji Sung or Son Heung Min.

1131
00:54:34,282 --> 00:54:35,282
But that didn't happen.

1132
00:54:35,752 --> 00:54:37,292
I don't think I can play soccer now. It's too much.

1133
00:54:39,562 --> 00:54:40,792
But you were good when you were a kid?

1134
00:54:41,262 --> 00:54:42,262
I used to play a lot.

1135
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:44,492
The wind.

1136
00:54:45,462 --> 00:54:47,002
I have to block it. Ta-da.

1137
00:54:49,332 --> 00:54:50,732
(Getting excited)

1138
00:54:51,332 --> 00:54:53,071
Gang Won is good at leading the date.

1139
00:54:53,072 --> 00:54:54,772
- Yes. He's leading the date well. - Seriously.

1140
00:54:55,172 --> 00:54:56,811
The two of them look great...

1141
00:54:56,812 --> 00:54:58,042
- looks-wise. - Right. They look great.

1142
00:55:01,442 --> 00:55:03,052
A walk like this is nice from time to time.

1143
00:55:04,052 --> 00:55:05,151
(The walk...)

1144
00:55:05,152 --> 00:55:07,322
(makes them feel comfortable around each other a bit.)

1145
00:55:08,052 --> 00:55:11,621
I liked that she listened to me very calmly.

1146
00:55:11,622 --> 00:55:14,191
She acted in the big sisterly kind of way.

1147
00:55:14,192 --> 00:55:16,462
I thought that she would reliable and a good person.

1148
00:55:16,892 --> 00:55:19,502
The awkwardness was gone. I knew that she was a good person.

1149
00:55:19,602 --> 00:55:20,702
Once we started walking,

1150
00:55:20,762 --> 00:55:22,902
it lifted my mood.

1151
00:55:23,132 --> 00:55:25,172
The air was really fresh.

1152
00:55:26,002 --> 00:55:28,301
I told him that I felt good.

1153
00:55:28,302 --> 00:55:30,912
I think I'll be able to talk to him more comfortably...

1154
00:55:31,012 --> 00:55:32,142
from now on.

1155
00:55:36,252 --> 00:55:37,482
It didn't break, right?

1156
00:55:41,222 --> 00:55:42,222
(Surprised)

1157
00:55:43,352 --> 00:55:46,291
(A cosy Korean bar...)

1158
00:55:46,292 --> 00:55:47,961
This is nice. The ambiance is cool.

1159
00:55:47,962 --> 00:55:49,632
(embracing traces of a long history)

1160
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:52,532
I feel comfortable now.

1161
00:55:54,132 --> 00:55:55,162
What makes you feel most comfortable?

1162
00:55:55,732 --> 00:55:58,272
You talking a lot.

1163
00:55:59,132 --> 00:56:00,202
That's a good thing, right?

1164
00:56:02,002 --> 00:56:04,942
(The atmosphere between them is comfortable thanks to Gang Won.)

1165
00:56:05,442 --> 00:56:06,681
Yes.

1166
00:56:06,682 --> 00:56:09,452
(Meanwhile, the food they ordered is served.)

1167
00:56:09,952 --> 00:56:11,012
That looks tasty.

1168
00:56:11,912 --> 00:56:13,482
- I see a lot of squids. - Yes.

1169
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:16,592
- You said you liked kimchi jeon. - Right.

1170
00:56:17,592 --> 00:56:18,592
(Gang Won serves Yu Ra first.)

1171
00:56:18,593 --> 00:56:19,662
Is that for me?

1172
00:56:22,162 --> 00:56:24,062
- Instead of just going there... - A heart.

1173
00:56:27,432 --> 00:56:29,132
(No way!)

1174
00:56:30,672 --> 00:56:32,472
For Yu Ra,

1175
00:56:32,602 --> 00:56:34,502
that must have required a lot of courage.

1176
00:56:34,802 --> 00:56:37,041
The mood seems different now.

1177
00:56:37,042 --> 00:56:38,611
Gang Won seems calmer...

1178
00:56:38,612 --> 00:56:40,182
- than when he was with Ra Yun. - Yes.

1179
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:41,842
- He seems relaxed. - Yes.

1180
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,882
I don't know how they feel now.

1181
00:56:45,712 --> 00:56:48,022
(A heart)

1182
00:56:49,082 --> 00:56:50,122
Right.

1183
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:52,862
(Placing it down)

1184
00:56:53,062 --> 00:56:54,162
I thought you were going to give that to me.

1185
00:56:56,132 --> 00:56:57,661
Forget it. I won't take it.

1186
00:56:57,662 --> 00:57:00,262
(Yu Ra is goofing around with him now.)

1187
00:57:02,732 --> 00:57:03,802
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1188
00:57:11,342 --> 00:57:12,542
That's nice.

1189
00:57:13,882 --> 00:57:15,612
You sounded like a middle-aged man.

1190
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:16,712
What did you say?

1191
00:57:17,252 --> 00:57:19,012
- You sounded like an old man. - That hit the spot.

1192
00:57:21,582 --> 00:57:23,792
I don't want to go back to the house now.

1193
00:57:25,152 --> 00:57:26,192
Why is that?

1194
00:57:27,192 --> 00:57:30,031
I try not to show it, but I can't help it anyway.

1195
00:57:30,032 --> 00:57:31,462
I'm the only one from Gyeongsang Province.

1196
00:57:32,092 --> 00:57:34,162
Everyone is from Gyeonggi Province.

1197
00:57:34,802 --> 00:57:37,672
I couldn't help but think more realistically about this.

1198
00:57:38,902 --> 00:57:40,942
I don't mind long-distance relationships.

1199
00:57:43,772 --> 00:57:45,011
(Chuckling)

1200
00:57:45,012 --> 00:57:46,042
What?

1201
00:57:46,182 --> 00:57:47,612
What's the maximum distance you'd be okay with?

1202
00:57:47,842 --> 00:57:50,412
I've once dated a guy from Busan.

1203
00:57:53,552 --> 00:57:54,621
You went on a date...

1204
00:57:54,622 --> 00:57:55,681
- with Ra Yun yesterday. - Yes.

1205
00:57:55,682 --> 00:57:56,952
I wonder what you two talked about.

1206
00:57:59,892 --> 00:58:01,822
- It was fun and we clicked well. - Yes.

1207
00:58:01,992 --> 00:58:03,492
I could see you guys clicked.

1208
00:58:03,862 --> 00:58:06,132
We clicked and it was fun.

1209
00:58:06,862 --> 00:58:08,902
But we wouldn't be compatible in some ways.

1210
00:58:09,132 --> 00:58:10,402
It would be hit-or-miss.

1211
00:58:10,632 --> 00:58:12,801
If we argue, things are going to get ugly.

1212
00:58:12,802 --> 00:58:15,101
It would be quite intense like that.

1213
00:58:15,102 --> 00:58:16,142
It's killing me.

1214
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:23,381
I believe that connections made easily can be broken easily.

1215
00:58:23,382 --> 00:58:24,712
That made me feel anxious, to be honest.

1216
00:58:25,712 --> 00:58:27,482
Easy connections can be broken easily?

1217
00:58:27,822 --> 00:58:29,422
For some reason, I believe that.

1218
00:58:31,092 --> 00:58:33,692
On this show, I can't completely be myself.

1219
00:58:34,122 --> 00:58:36,632
After arriving here, I started to talk, "What am I like?"

1220
00:58:36,792 --> 00:58:38,562
I've been thinking about that.

1221
00:58:38,792 --> 00:58:40,401
I don't feel charming here.

1222
00:58:40,402 --> 00:58:42,431
To be honest, my self-esteem has gone down after coming here.

1223
00:58:42,432 --> 00:58:43,531
- Why? - What?

1224
00:58:43,532 --> 00:58:44,632
You're charming.

1225
00:58:46,202 --> 00:58:47,702
(Startled)

1226
00:58:48,672 --> 00:58:52,542
(Yu Ra's comments surprise Gang Won.)

1227
00:58:53,482 --> 00:58:54,682
Yu Ra is surprising him with these comments.

1228
00:58:56,352 --> 00:58:57,482
This is making me blush.

1229
00:58:58,582 --> 00:58:59,681
The mood changed a lot...

1230
00:58:59,682 --> 00:59:00,822
- with some beer. - Yes.

1231
00:59:00,982 --> 00:59:02,382
- Beer. - They definitely needed it.

1232
00:59:03,092 --> 00:59:04,852
- Why? You're charming. - What?

1233
00:59:06,092 --> 00:59:08,022
Well, people think differently.

1234
00:59:12,292 --> 00:59:14,002
No, you're doing well here.

1235
00:59:17,102 --> 00:59:20,772
(He wets his whistle.)

1236
00:59:23,772 --> 00:59:25,371
- You said that you were curious... - Yes.

1237
00:59:25,372 --> 00:59:27,311
- about someone in the house. - Yes.

1238
00:59:27,312 --> 00:59:29,142
Can I ask you who it is?

1239
00:59:29,382 --> 00:59:32,882
At first, there were two people I was curious about.

1240
00:59:34,952 --> 00:59:36,652
Were they Byeong Yeol and Gang Won?

1241
00:59:36,792 --> 00:59:38,392
Gang Won? Did you just call yourself that?

1242
00:59:38,822 --> 00:59:40,162
Oh, yes. I guess I did.

1243
00:59:40,392 --> 00:59:42,162
It was smooth, so I didn't think you'd notice.

1244
00:59:43,362 --> 00:59:44,962
I went on a date with him yesterday.

1245
00:59:46,102 --> 00:59:47,232
I satisfied my curiosity.

1246
00:59:48,102 --> 00:59:50,272
Did you satisfy your curiosity about me too?

1247
00:59:50,572 --> 00:59:51,971
I think I know you a bit,

1248
00:59:51,972 --> 00:59:53,342
- Okay. - but it's still fun.

1249
00:59:54,402 --> 00:59:55,672
- You're fun. - Okay.

1250
00:59:56,242 --> 00:59:58,072
- So... - Okay. Let's stop there.

1251
01:00:00,242 --> 01:00:02,012
I don't want to get hurt either.

1252
01:00:06,552 --> 01:00:09,852
(The night deepens as they get to know each other.)

1253
01:00:10,622 --> 01:00:12,622
- I'm quite loyal. - Okay.

1254
01:00:13,522 --> 01:00:15,992
I'm a loving person, so I get hurt so often.

1255
01:00:16,232 --> 01:00:17,992
How badly have you been hurt?

1256
01:00:18,662 --> 01:00:21,362
Well, I'm sure it's been as bad as what others went through.

1257
01:00:22,972 --> 01:00:25,272
Gosh, I didn't tell anyone about this.

1258
01:00:31,072 --> 01:00:32,072
I thought...

1259
01:00:32,882 --> 01:00:34,942
my life was a constant cycle...

1260
01:00:36,212 --> 01:00:38,112
of difficult times.

1261
01:00:41,152 --> 01:00:43,492
Every shaman experiences self-loss differently.

1262
01:00:43,792 --> 01:00:45,692
In the end, as a result of self-loss,

1263
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,392
my mother passed away.

1264
01:00:49,962 --> 01:00:52,562
I'm grateful and feel sorry to my mom...

1265
01:00:52,792 --> 01:00:56,002
because after she passed away, my life changed a lot.

1266
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:58,472
I was so lost. I did everything I wanted.

1267
01:00:58,532 --> 01:01:01,742
But after she passed away,

1268
01:01:02,642 --> 01:01:04,372
my survival instincts kicked in.

1269
01:01:05,212 --> 01:01:06,642
As an individual,

1270
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:11,451
I thought about what I was good at and life experiences I had.

1271
01:01:11,452 --> 01:01:13,021
I thought to myself,

1272
01:01:13,022 --> 01:01:15,022
"What could I do well for the others?"

1273
01:01:15,652 --> 01:01:18,091
After she passed away, I spent time looking for myself...

1274
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:19,092
and ended up here.

1275
01:01:19,093 --> 01:01:20,262
(Yu Ra quietly listens to his story.)

1276
01:01:24,532 --> 01:01:25,562
I'm proud of you.

1277
01:01:31,602 --> 01:01:33,272
I hope you won't get hurt.

1278
01:01:34,972 --> 01:01:37,112
I'm not saying I'll hurt you or anything.

1279
01:01:37,612 --> 01:01:40,482
I hope no one hurts you.

1280
01:01:41,982 --> 01:01:46,352
(She tells Gang Won a heartwarming wish.)

1281
01:01:49,592 --> 01:01:50,991
When I'm in a relationship,

1282
01:01:50,992 --> 01:01:52,822
I'm not the type to take care of my significant other.

1283
01:01:53,322 --> 01:01:56,531
But observing Gang Won's personality...

1284
01:01:56,532 --> 01:01:58,492
and listening to his upbringing,

1285
01:01:58,932 --> 01:02:01,032
I learned that he had been hurt a lot.

1286
01:02:01,702 --> 01:02:04,032
Gang Won was on my mind quite a bit.

1287
01:02:04,532 --> 01:02:07,472
Things were quite complex.

1288
01:02:08,242 --> 01:02:10,311
When we talked to each other about our innermost feelings,

1289
01:02:10,312 --> 01:02:14,382
we talked about sad, upsetting, and heartbreaking things.

1290
01:02:15,842 --> 01:02:17,652
- When you said... - Yes.

1291
01:02:18,352 --> 01:02:21,381
the hearing in one of your ears was failing...

1292
01:02:21,382 --> 01:02:23,291
and that you had tinnitus,

1293
01:02:23,292 --> 01:02:24,952
that broke my heart.

1294
01:02:28,562 --> 01:02:32,261
(He heard about Yu Ra's struggle in passing.)

1295
01:02:32,262 --> 01:02:36,872
(But Gang Won remembered that.)

1296
01:02:38,872 --> 01:02:40,742
How did you feel when it first happened?

1297
01:02:43,412 --> 01:02:46,382
I had a drink, so I don't think I should talk about it.

1298
01:02:47,512 --> 01:02:49,582
- Okay. - I'm already tearing up.

1299
01:02:49,982 --> 01:02:53,082
- No. Don't talk about it. - Is there tissue?

1300
01:02:53,382 --> 01:02:54,682
No, I'll try to hold it back.

1301
01:02:55,082 --> 01:02:56,252
- I'm sure I have it here. - Okay.

1302
01:03:05,492 --> 01:03:07,962
I don't talk about a lot of things when I know.

1303
01:03:13,942 --> 01:03:15,342
- Oh, no. - I'm sorry. What?

1304
01:03:16,372 --> 01:03:18,072
I ended up crying.

1305
01:03:18,112 --> 01:03:19,842
- I'm sorry to have asked that. - Gosh.

1306
01:03:20,682 --> 01:03:22,212
Right. Why did you ask me that?

1307
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:28,822
I'm sorry. I won't ask you that now.

1308
01:03:31,792 --> 01:03:32,792
It's okay.

1309
01:03:32,952 --> 01:03:35,592
- Well, I'm crying and everything. - Yes.

1310
01:03:36,092 --> 01:03:37,292
But I'm not that sad about it.

1311
01:03:41,162 --> 01:03:44,431
It's weird. When I'm having a hard time, I can't seem to cry.

1312
01:03:44,432 --> 01:03:46,502
But other people's struggles make me so sad.

1313
01:03:49,302 --> 01:03:50,812
All of a sudden,

1314
01:03:51,212 --> 01:03:53,312
I started to hear the sound of a vacuum cleaner.

1315
01:03:54,282 --> 01:03:56,781
All kinds of sounds came to me because of tinnitus.

1316
01:03:56,782 --> 01:03:59,312
And they sounded so loud too.

1317
01:04:00,052 --> 01:04:01,822
I didn't know what was happening.

1318
01:04:02,852 --> 01:04:05,552
I thought things would improve with some time.

1319
01:04:05,652 --> 01:04:08,162
But the sounds didn't go away the next day.

1320
01:04:08,622 --> 01:04:10,791
I went to a hospital.

1321
01:04:10,792 --> 01:04:13,732
The doctor told me to go to a big hospital.

1322
01:04:13,802 --> 01:04:17,072
The doctor checked my condition...

1323
01:04:18,832 --> 01:04:20,401
and said I missed my golden hour.

1324
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:22,602
I was told I should have come sooner.

1325
01:04:22,702 --> 01:04:25,142
I was very close to losing my hearing.

1326
01:04:25,572 --> 01:04:29,441
When someone talks to me from my left side,

1327
01:04:29,442 --> 01:04:32,812
I only hear mumbling.

1328
01:04:33,382 --> 01:04:34,781
Going there in spring is great.

1329
01:04:34,782 --> 01:04:36,182
That's how it is with new beginnings.

1330
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:37,991
What did you say? That's what?

1331
01:04:37,992 --> 01:04:39,861
- I don't know. - What did you say?

1332
01:04:39,862 --> 01:04:41,661
It will be better to go there in spring.

1333
01:04:41,662 --> 01:04:43,661
But there's something I want to see.

1334
01:04:43,662 --> 01:04:46,402
- Come again? I see. - There's something I want to see.

1335
01:04:47,732 --> 01:04:50,171
It looks like the castle at the amusement park.

1336
01:04:50,172 --> 01:04:51,202
- Yes. - Yes.

1337
01:04:52,302 --> 01:04:53,941
- Like in the Aesop's Fables. - What?

1338
01:04:53,942 --> 01:04:55,042
The Aesop's Fables.

1339
01:04:55,472 --> 01:04:56,541
- Who? - It reminds me of a scene...

1340
01:04:56,542 --> 01:04:57,571
in the Aesop's Fables.

1341
01:04:57,572 --> 01:04:58,912
- The Aesop's Fables. - Yes.

1342
01:05:01,812 --> 01:05:03,581
I see. That's why.

1343
01:05:03,582 --> 01:05:05,582
(Yu Ra was secretly struggling while talking to him.)

1344
01:05:06,352 --> 01:05:08,182
She couldn't hear it well when he was on her left side.

1345
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:12,021
That's why she couldn't be as interactive as she wanted.

1346
01:05:12,022 --> 01:05:14,862
Even if she heard it, she couldn't be sure.

1347
01:05:15,462 --> 01:05:17,291
I didn't know she was going through that.

1348
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:19,662
- It must've been so tough for her. - Right.

1349
01:05:21,132 --> 01:05:23,632
I'm seriously in tears.

1350
01:05:24,732 --> 01:05:28,072
I didn't know. My heart aches so much.

1351
01:05:30,042 --> 01:05:31,142
It's okay.

1352
01:05:39,012 --> 01:05:40,552
- However, - Yes?

1353
01:05:41,522 --> 01:05:44,552
it isn't so difficult anymore.

1354
01:05:50,492 --> 01:05:52,491
- Yu Ra. - Yes?

1355
01:05:52,492 --> 01:05:53,662
Don't say something strange.

1356
01:05:54,002 --> 01:05:56,932
I wasn't going to say something strange.

1357
01:05:57,102 --> 01:05:58,972
I was going to ask you something I was curious about.

1358
01:05:59,102 --> 01:06:02,702
Can't you read someone's saju without his name and date of birth?

1359
01:06:02,972 --> 01:06:04,512
I don't need to know his name.

1360
01:06:04,872 --> 01:06:07,581
Just his date and time of birth.

1361
01:06:07,582 --> 01:06:09,241
The time of birth isn't a must,

1362
01:06:09,242 --> 01:06:10,512
but it'll make the reading more accurate.

1363
01:06:10,812 --> 01:06:14,281
In a sense, aren't you the most frustrated?

1364
01:06:14,282 --> 01:06:15,382
Not at all.

1365
01:06:15,982 --> 01:06:17,752
I had that benefit.

1366
01:06:18,152 --> 01:06:20,461
On the first day, I could check...

1367
01:06:20,462 --> 01:06:23,392
the day of the animal for one person I was curious about.

1368
01:06:24,062 --> 01:06:26,902
How did it feel to check it?

1369
01:06:27,162 --> 01:06:28,232
Was it nice?

1370
01:06:29,132 --> 01:06:32,432
"I see why I chose this person."

1371
01:06:32,732 --> 01:06:35,402
I could see that right away from his saju.

1372
01:06:37,012 --> 01:06:38,772
I had that thought...

1373
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:41,282
when I saw the day he was born.

1374
01:06:41,782 --> 01:06:44,752
(First day selection at the Hall of Sacred Spirits)

1375
01:06:47,682 --> 01:06:50,322
(Lee Gang Won)

1376
01:06:50,592 --> 01:06:55,962
(Yu Ra checked Gang Won's fate plaque.)

1377
01:06:57,892 --> 01:06:59,232
- Gang Won. - Gang Won.

1378
01:06:59,492 --> 01:07:01,932
(Everyone had forgotten about it.)

1379
01:07:02,362 --> 01:07:03,531
(Surprised)

1380
01:07:03,532 --> 01:07:06,902
- That's right. That was it. - That was it.

1381
01:07:07,502 --> 01:07:11,342
Since she was chosen by two people,

1382
01:07:12,012 --> 01:07:13,812
- she became... - That's right.

1383
01:07:13,982 --> 01:07:15,782
the only person...

1384
01:07:15,982 --> 01:07:18,181
- That's right. - to receive the benefit...

1385
01:07:18,182 --> 01:07:21,081
of checking one person's day of the animal.

1386
01:07:21,082 --> 01:07:22,781
- She had that benefit. - That's right.

1387
01:07:22,782 --> 01:07:24,822
- I totally forgot about that. - She checked Gang Won's plaque.

1388
01:07:25,452 --> 01:07:27,792
- It's like an event from a drama. - Seriously.

1389
01:07:33,062 --> 01:07:34,161
Yu Ra.

1390
01:07:34,162 --> 01:07:35,331
(Smiling)

1391
01:07:35,332 --> 01:07:37,732
- Why... - Whenever you call my name,

1392
01:07:37,972 --> 01:07:40,102
my heart flutters.

1393
01:07:40,302 --> 01:07:42,902
Yu Ra, I won't say anything strange until we return to the house.

1394
01:07:43,042 --> 01:07:45,771
But I'm good at drawing attention to myself.

1395
01:07:45,772 --> 01:07:47,142
- I can see that. - Please be understanding.

1396
01:07:48,082 --> 01:07:49,512
I'm good at giving attention.

1397
01:07:50,112 --> 01:07:51,282
That's right.

1398
01:08:03,222 --> 01:08:04,862
I have a question.

1399
01:08:05,392 --> 01:08:07,002
It might be random.

1400
01:08:07,932 --> 01:08:09,062
Why did you pick me?

1401
01:08:09,662 --> 01:08:12,972
- You? - Yes. If I remember correctly,

1402
01:08:13,442 --> 01:08:17,642
you exchanged the name plaques with Yun Jeong.

1403
01:08:18,412 --> 01:08:20,042
So why did you suddenly choose me?

1404
01:08:23,452 --> 01:08:24,512
To be honest...

1405
01:08:25,482 --> 01:08:27,352
- Is it okay to say this? - What is it?

1406
01:08:28,082 --> 01:08:29,622
From your vibe alone...

1407
01:08:30,352 --> 01:08:31,692
- Did you think, "We're similar?" - Yes.

1408
01:08:33,562 --> 01:08:35,421
I had the same thought when I saw you.

1409
01:08:35,422 --> 01:08:36,632
"He's similar to me."

1410
01:08:36,792 --> 01:08:40,162
How did you feel when I asked you out on a date today?

1411
01:08:40,432 --> 01:08:41,761
To be honest, I expected it.

1412
01:08:41,762 --> 01:08:42,902
- Did you expect it? - Yes.

1413
01:08:45,572 --> 01:08:46,741
Come here.

1414
01:08:46,742 --> 01:08:48,772
(During the First Come First Date request)

1415
01:08:49,402 --> 01:08:51,742
Would you spend time with me today?

1416
01:08:52,442 --> 01:08:54,042
Are you asking me out on a date?

1417
01:08:54,482 --> 01:08:56,082
Is it okay to say it out loud?

1418
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,852
What? You asked me.

1419
01:08:58,982 --> 01:09:00,551
This is embarrassing.

1420
01:09:00,552 --> 01:09:03,052
- You asked me. - That's right.

1421
01:09:04,522 --> 01:09:05,752
I expected it.

1422
01:09:06,962 --> 01:09:09,292
I felt like someone would ask you out.

1423
01:09:09,422 --> 01:09:10,662
Really?

1424
01:09:10,932 --> 01:09:13,062
I thought I wasn't popular.

1425
01:09:15,702 --> 01:09:17,972
I thought, "What if there's no one?"

1426
01:09:18,172 --> 01:09:19,772
When you sat next to me,

1427
01:09:20,202 --> 01:09:21,302
I thought, "Thank goodness."

1428
01:09:28,612 --> 01:09:30,382
Thank you.

1429
01:09:31,212 --> 01:09:32,781
Do you take photos?

1430
01:09:32,782 --> 01:09:34,551
- Shall I? - I don't take photos.

1431
01:09:34,552 --> 01:09:35,721
I'll take them.

1432
01:09:35,722 --> 01:09:38,252
I usually don't take them because I'm busy eating.

1433
01:09:41,662 --> 01:09:43,991
(Hyeon U still takes photos...)

1434
01:09:43,992 --> 01:09:45,961
(and Ra Yun helps him nevertheless.)

1435
01:09:45,962 --> 01:09:47,062
All done.

1436
01:09:47,832 --> 01:09:48,902
Is it yin?

1437
01:09:50,832 --> 01:09:52,132
(Touching)

1438
01:09:52,602 --> 01:09:53,842
- What? - Is it yin?

1439
01:09:53,972 --> 01:09:55,501
What did you say? Sea urchin?

1440
01:09:55,502 --> 01:09:57,112
- It's okay. - I didn't hear you.

1441
01:09:57,242 --> 01:09:58,312
It's nothing.

1442
01:10:00,512 --> 01:10:02,082
It's hard.

1443
01:10:02,182 --> 01:10:03,681
What did you say?

1444
01:10:03,682 --> 01:10:04,852
- By yourself... - I was talking to myself.

1445
01:10:06,382 --> 01:10:08,222
Before coming here,

1446
01:10:08,622 --> 01:10:10,451
I had to finish work.

1447
01:10:10,452 --> 01:10:11,722
I came the next day.

1448
01:10:12,152 --> 01:10:14,561
I read someone's fortune right before coming here.

1449
01:10:14,562 --> 01:10:15,592
Really?

1450
01:10:16,222 --> 01:10:17,532
I had a ritual.

1451
01:10:18,662 --> 01:10:19,931
I had a ritual the day before.

1452
01:10:19,932 --> 01:10:21,662
(A fierce match of the shaman's schedules)

1453
01:10:22,232 --> 01:10:23,362
I'm busy.

1454
01:10:25,572 --> 01:10:28,042
(Talking about the shaman things makes him laugh.)

1455
01:10:28,472 --> 01:10:29,742
I know.

1456
01:10:31,172 --> 01:10:33,742
I know that I'm funny. Stop laughing.

1457
01:10:34,882 --> 01:10:36,311
The time I mistook handwash...

1458
01:10:36,312 --> 01:10:37,552
- for dish soap? - Yes.

1459
01:10:37,852 --> 01:10:39,652
Wasn't there another incident?

1460
01:10:39,752 --> 01:10:41,282
(Breaking)

1461
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:51,162
(What's going on?)

1462
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:53,532
- Did his fork break? - Is it possible to break a fork?

1463
01:10:53,762 --> 01:10:55,961
- A fork? - Is it possible to break a fork?

1464
01:10:55,962 --> 01:10:57,471
- It's my first time seeing it. - Same here.

1465
01:10:57,472 --> 01:10:58,771
It's so funny.

1466
01:10:58,772 --> 01:11:00,772
- Do the spirits don't get along? - Is there a problem?

1467
01:11:02,702 --> 01:11:05,172
I'm suddenly scared. I laughed at first.

1468
01:11:05,512 --> 01:11:06,711
I'm scared.

1469
01:11:06,712 --> 01:11:09,042
(They don't know whether to laugh or cry about the strange incident.)

1470
01:11:09,942 --> 01:11:11,012
(Breaking)

1471
01:11:13,252 --> 01:11:14,951
(A fork broke.)

1472
01:11:14,952 --> 01:11:16,051
What's going on?

1473
01:11:16,052 --> 01:11:17,192
(A fork broke.)

1474
01:11:18,652 --> 01:11:19,691
Did it break?

1475
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,022
(In pieces)

1476
01:11:21,392 --> 01:11:24,062
My granny must've become upset since you teased me.

1477
01:11:26,362 --> 01:11:27,602
We need a fork.

1478
01:11:28,032 --> 01:11:29,462
Our fork broke.

1479
01:11:30,272 --> 01:11:33,272
(They still can't believe it.)

1480
01:11:33,742 --> 01:11:37,312
(The two shamans are in tears.)

1481
01:11:38,312 --> 01:11:39,672
I can't believe it.

1482
01:11:39,912 --> 01:11:41,142
What's this?

1483
01:11:44,212 --> 01:11:46,612
- Did a spirit come? - I don't know.

1484
01:11:46,882 --> 01:11:48,422
I guess General used his strength.

1485
01:11:51,952 --> 01:11:54,221
I can't eat because it's so funny.

1486
01:11:54,222 --> 01:11:55,592
(The shaman joke suits Ra Yun's taste.)

1487
01:11:55,692 --> 01:11:57,032
I love such clumsy charms.

1488
01:11:57,332 --> 01:12:00,532
I don't know if this conversation is suitable for a date.

1489
01:12:01,232 --> 01:12:02,362
But it's eccentric and nice.

1490
01:12:03,462 --> 01:12:06,732
Despite everything, this is a date.

1491
01:12:07,972 --> 01:12:10,442
I can't believe I'm eating with a male shaman.

1492
01:12:11,772 --> 01:12:14,112
(She suddenly finds it funny.)

1493
01:12:16,042 --> 01:12:17,552
The one you met only a few days ago.

1494
01:12:22,582 --> 01:12:24,152
Why are you here?

1495
01:12:26,322 --> 01:12:27,562
The one from Taebaek.

1496
01:12:30,732 --> 01:12:32,862
(Meanwhile)

1497
01:12:42,602 --> 01:12:43,842
(Eating)

1498
01:12:46,642 --> 01:12:48,142
(Impressed)

1499
01:12:49,682 --> 01:12:50,682
(Impressed)

1500
01:12:51,512 --> 01:12:53,552
- I'll eat this one. - Please eat a lot.

1501
01:12:55,582 --> 01:12:57,592
- Should I cut it? - It's tasty. Yes.

1502
01:12:57,892 --> 01:12:59,122
- Don't you want me to cut it? - No.

1503
01:12:59,492 --> 01:13:01,162
- I'll cut it. - I'll cut it.

1504
01:13:02,062 --> 01:13:04,691
(Sang Hyeok cuts the steak.)

1505
01:13:04,692 --> 01:13:05,792
Thank goodness.

1506
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:07,762
It's tasty.

1507
01:13:09,732 --> 01:13:11,402
- It's tastier than I expected. - Nice.

1508
01:13:11,702 --> 01:13:12,902
I guess it suits your taste.

1509
01:13:18,612 --> 01:13:22,142
What made you decide to choose me?

1510
01:13:22,782 --> 01:13:25,582
"Let's not hesitate to choose someone..."

1511
01:13:25,812 --> 01:13:27,522
"my heart goes out to."

1512
01:13:27,852 --> 01:13:29,622
I had that thought.

1513
01:13:29,952 --> 01:13:33,052
Since we're only human,

1514
01:13:33,322 --> 01:13:35,721
we fear telling someone we've just met...

1515
01:13:35,722 --> 01:13:37,461
that we like them.

1516
01:13:37,462 --> 01:13:38,991
- That's right. - That's right.

1517
01:13:38,992 --> 01:13:41,562
It's hard to speak our minds.

1518
01:13:41,902 --> 01:13:44,501
But when I came here, I told myself...

1519
01:13:44,502 --> 01:13:46,802
that I'd have courage...

1520
01:13:47,202 --> 01:13:48,602
and follow my heart.

1521
01:13:54,982 --> 01:13:57,482
I liked you the best.

1522
01:13:57,812 --> 01:14:01,122
That was why I chose you.

1523
01:14:04,352 --> 01:14:07,662
Your hairstyle suited you.

1524
01:14:08,222 --> 01:14:09,792
I thought you looked very pretty.

1525
01:14:12,732 --> 01:14:14,762
I'm only human.

1526
01:14:15,762 --> 01:14:18,032
Since we had just met,

1527
01:14:18,172 --> 01:14:19,632
asking you out on a date...

1528
01:14:20,202 --> 01:14:22,172
was honestly nerve-racking.

1529
01:14:23,472 --> 01:14:26,772
I thought you were coming over to ask me something.

1530
01:14:27,012 --> 01:14:29,381
When you asked me out on a date, I was like, "What?"

1531
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:31,512
- You were flustered. - Yes, I was. I was surprised.

1532
01:14:36,482 --> 01:14:37,791
You picked a fate plaque...

1533
01:14:37,792 --> 01:14:39,922
at the Hall of Sacred Spirits on the first day.

1534
01:14:40,962 --> 01:14:43,732
You must've picked a plaque then.

1535
01:14:44,262 --> 01:14:46,432
Can you guess who he is?

1536
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:48,962
Can I guess?

1537
01:14:49,562 --> 01:14:51,802
(Thinking)

1538
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:54,942
(Nervous)

1539
01:14:55,572 --> 01:14:57,911
My guess changes every day.

1540
01:14:57,912 --> 01:14:59,772
- "Is it him?" - Yes.

1541
01:15:01,712 --> 01:15:03,242
I'd have certainty one day.

1542
01:15:03,982 --> 01:15:09,282
As time goes on, I gather more clues.

1543
01:15:10,522 --> 01:15:11,822
Then my guess changes again.

1544
01:15:13,622 --> 01:15:16,022
It's confusing. That's where I'm at right now.

1545
01:15:16,522 --> 01:15:17,631
Destiny...

1546
01:15:17,632 --> 01:15:21,102
(Yun Jeong's destined pair is right before her eyes.)

1547
01:15:21,802 --> 01:15:22,802
It's confusing.

1548
01:15:25,102 --> 01:15:26,802
- So you aren't certain yet. - No.

1549
01:15:32,142 --> 01:15:34,181
The man who is Leo and Gold Dragon...

1550
01:15:34,182 --> 01:15:37,351
is right before her eyes.

1551
01:15:37,352 --> 01:15:38,951
Gold Dragon...

1552
01:15:38,952 --> 01:15:40,652
she was so curious about...

1553
01:15:40,752 --> 01:15:42,281
and searched for all this time is right before her eyes.

1554
01:15:42,282 --> 01:15:44,422
- But she doesn't know. - She doesn't know.

1555
01:15:44,692 --> 01:15:45,752
Does she really not know?

1556
01:15:46,752 --> 01:15:49,092
It must be very confusing for Yun Jeong.

1557
01:15:54,402 --> 01:15:55,531
Did you see...

1558
01:15:55,532 --> 01:15:57,432
who would suit you more?

1559
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:02,601
Did you have an astrology reading?

1560
01:16:02,602 --> 01:16:05,242
As for that... I was worried about that.

1561
01:16:08,142 --> 01:16:09,441
I studied the standards.

1562
01:16:09,442 --> 01:16:11,382
I studied the standards through an astrology reading.

1563
01:16:11,812 --> 01:16:13,012
I studied the appearances.

1564
01:16:14,882 --> 01:16:15,882
What about the appearances?

1565
01:16:15,883 --> 01:16:18,221
You can get an idea through an astrology reading.

1566
01:16:18,222 --> 01:16:19,421
The appearance that suits you more?

1567
01:16:19,422 --> 01:16:21,122
The appearance that's my type.

1568
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:23,662
Your type.

1569
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:25,432
(Flustered)

1570
01:16:27,862 --> 01:16:29,602
You chose by appearance. That's incredible.

1571
01:16:29,962 --> 01:16:31,502
That's how the final decision should be.

1572
01:16:32,832 --> 01:16:33,942
That's incredible.

1573
01:16:34,042 --> 01:16:35,202
It's more certain.

1574
01:16:36,302 --> 01:16:38,372
Did you get your answer at the Hall of Sacred Spirits?

1575
01:16:39,272 --> 01:16:41,312
- Did you get a sense of things? - Yes.

1576
01:16:42,712 --> 01:16:45,312
I got the answer for my decision.

1577
01:16:45,412 --> 01:16:48,452
I thought, "I should take this path."

1578
01:16:48,782 --> 01:16:50,052
There's a path I'm drawn to.

1579
01:16:50,992 --> 01:16:52,391
- But... - What was the criterion?

1580
01:16:52,392 --> 01:16:54,122
What made you more drawn to it?

1581
01:16:56,562 --> 01:16:57,562
I chose...

1582
01:16:57,662 --> 01:16:59,592
(Hesitant)

1583
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:02,461
- It must be difficult to say. - No, it isn't difficult.

1584
01:17:02,462 --> 01:17:06,002
I chose someone who would make my flutter more.

1585
01:17:06,832 --> 01:17:07,842
Someone...

1586
01:17:09,572 --> 01:17:14,312
I could like more deeply.

1587
01:17:21,922 --> 01:17:25,452
Our conversation continued on without stopping.

1588
01:17:25,852 --> 01:17:29,922
I could feel that he was being considerate.

1589
01:17:30,022 --> 01:17:31,862
It was the first date,

1590
01:17:34,062 --> 01:17:37,031
so I became curious about...

1591
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:40,032
how I appeared in his eyes.

1592
01:17:41,102 --> 01:17:45,271
"I'm thankful that he looks kindly upon me."

1593
01:17:45,272 --> 01:17:46,742
I had that thought.

1594
01:17:47,182 --> 01:17:48,282
With Yun Jeong,

1595
01:17:52,012 --> 01:17:53,482
I want to go drinking.

1596
01:17:55,982 --> 01:17:58,822
Once Yun Jeong gets more comfortable around me,

1597
01:17:59,492 --> 01:18:01,392
she'll tell me her stories...

1598
01:18:01,492 --> 01:18:04,762
and show me her tendencies. I'm curious about them.

1599
01:18:05,262 --> 01:18:08,832
That way, she'll treat me with more ease.

1600
01:18:09,762 --> 01:18:11,202
That's what I think.

1601
01:18:12,632 --> 01:18:14,371
- I talk too much, right? - No.

1602
01:18:14,372 --> 01:18:15,471
(What kind of time...)

1603
01:18:15,472 --> 01:18:17,171
- I could relate to it. - Really?

1604
01:18:17,172 --> 01:18:20,312
(will they build together from now on?)

1605
01:18:24,352 --> 01:18:27,282
I think we're already at the halfway point.

1606
01:18:28,752 --> 01:18:30,182
- Seven days. - Tomorrow is the fourth day.

1607
01:18:31,792 --> 01:18:33,052
Tomorrow will be the halfway point.

1608
01:18:34,762 --> 01:18:35,861
- It really is the halfway point. - No way.

1609
01:18:35,862 --> 01:18:37,632
- Why does time fly so fast? - It flies so fast.

1610
01:18:37,832 --> 01:18:39,192
Time is the most diligent.

1611
01:18:41,062 --> 01:18:42,202
- Seriously. - Yes.

1612
01:18:42,302 --> 01:18:43,632
Time flies so fast.

1613
01:18:46,432 --> 01:18:48,672
Do you think you'll be able to make up your mind?

1614
01:18:51,572 --> 01:18:53,112
Before the final decision?

1615
01:18:53,672 --> 01:18:54,712
Before that.

1616
01:18:57,182 --> 01:18:58,182
Yes.

1617
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:01,322
I think I'll be able to do that.

1618
01:19:04,892 --> 01:19:06,752
(Grinning)

1619
01:19:16,062 --> 01:19:17,132
What did you talk about yesterday?

1620
01:19:20,272 --> 01:19:21,342
- During the date? - Yes.

1621
01:19:22,402 --> 01:19:23,502
During the date?

1622
01:19:30,312 --> 01:19:31,681
Yesterday, it was just...

1623
01:19:31,682 --> 01:19:32,682
Did you talk about similar things?

1624
01:19:32,683 --> 01:19:35,122
We asked about each other's hobbies.

1625
01:19:36,722 --> 01:19:37,792
Also...

1626
01:19:41,222 --> 01:19:44,932
Are some people already drawn to the others?

1627
01:19:46,232 --> 01:19:48,362
I'm sure everyone developed some interest.

1628
01:19:53,102 --> 01:19:56,702
(Yun Jeong's answer makes Sang Hyeok thoughtful.)

1629
01:19:58,772 --> 01:20:00,372
Thank you for spending time with me.

1630
01:20:00,812 --> 01:20:01,812
Don't mention it.

1631
01:20:04,012 --> 01:20:05,182
I'm thankful too.

1632
01:20:06,452 --> 01:20:09,182
- Why? - It was fun.

1633
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:11,422
What am I, an entertainer?

1634
01:20:11,792 --> 01:20:14,092
I didn't mean it like that.

1635
01:20:16,962 --> 01:20:18,092
I felt at ease.

1636
01:20:18,932 --> 01:20:21,462
Time flew the fastest.

1637
01:20:21,802 --> 01:20:23,262
- When you were with me? - Yes.

1638
01:20:25,972 --> 01:20:27,171
- Yu Ra. - Yes?

1639
01:20:27,172 --> 01:20:28,342
Will you agree to hang out with me again?

1640
01:20:28,772 --> 01:20:30,471
- Of course. - Really?

1641
01:20:30,472 --> 01:20:31,512
- Yes. - I'm glad.

1642
01:20:33,942 --> 01:20:35,182
There'll be no reason to say no.

1643
01:20:39,582 --> 01:20:41,451
What will we do if there's a new female participant?

1644
01:20:41,452 --> 01:20:42,452
- What? - What will we do...

1645
01:20:42,453 --> 01:20:44,022
if there's a new female participant?

1646
01:20:45,752 --> 01:20:46,852
It doesn't matter, does it?

1647
01:20:47,922 --> 01:20:49,092
What if she's pretty?

1648
01:20:50,862 --> 01:20:51,932
It doesn't matter, does it?

1649
01:20:53,062 --> 01:20:55,332
Of course, it matters.

1650
01:20:57,832 --> 01:21:01,602
(Between excitement and anxiety, the second date ends.)

1651
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:09,311
In real life, it's really hard...

1652
01:21:09,312 --> 01:21:11,352
for two people to become a couple.

1653
01:21:11,452 --> 01:21:13,251
All four pairs went on a date...

1654
01:21:13,252 --> 01:21:16,082
- and gained certainty. - All of them became couples.

1655
01:21:16,352 --> 01:21:18,122
What will become of Byeong Yeol?

1656
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,552
For how many hours did Byeong Yeol sleep?

1657
01:21:21,822 --> 01:21:25,461
What will happen once they return to the house?

1658
01:21:25,462 --> 01:21:26,992
I can't wait.

1659
01:21:27,802 --> 01:21:30,602
I'm curious about what changes will come at night...

1660
01:21:30,702 --> 01:21:32,132
when everyone is in the house.

1661
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:36,272
I'm so curious. I have to keep watching.

1662
01:21:41,842 --> 01:21:43,542
(Ripping)

1663
01:21:45,312 --> 01:21:50,282
(A strange sound can be heard from the men's room.)

1664
01:21:58,765 --> 01:21:59,905
(A fork ghost)

1665
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:02,375
(A spoon ghost)

1666
01:22:03,605 --> 01:22:08,675
(Hyeon U shakes off the evil once he returns from the date.)

1667
01:22:12,615 --> 01:22:13,615
Go.

1668
01:22:14,455 --> 01:22:17,455
(A newbie shaman's nightly routine)

1669
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:20,124
- Would you like some ramyeon? - You're back.

1670
01:22:20,125 --> 01:22:21,125
Yes.

1671
01:22:21,695 --> 01:22:23,225
(Squeezing out)

1672
01:22:24,965 --> 01:22:26,365
It smells spicy.

1673
01:22:26,895 --> 01:22:28,064
It smells strongly of squid.

1674
01:22:28,065 --> 01:22:29,495
- It smells spicy. - Spicy.

1675
01:22:30,435 --> 01:22:31,834
Thank you.

1676
01:22:31,835 --> 01:22:32,904
- It's hot. - Thank you.

1677
01:22:32,905 --> 01:22:35,134
All right. What did you do today?

1678
01:22:35,135 --> 01:22:36,174
I'm so curious.

1679
01:22:36,175 --> 01:22:37,804
- Hurry up and sit down. - Well...

1680
01:22:37,805 --> 01:22:38,975
I was lonely.

1681
01:22:40,245 --> 01:22:41,675
I'll stay home tomorrow.

1682
01:22:41,715 --> 01:22:42,774
- Go out tomorrow. - Tomorrow?

1683
01:22:42,775 --> 01:22:43,775
We don't know what will happen tomorrow.

1684
01:22:46,485 --> 01:22:47,915
(Slurping)

1685
01:22:48,555 --> 01:22:49,985
(Slurping)

1686
01:22:50,415 --> 01:22:51,655
There's a lot of squid.

1687
01:22:52,625 --> 01:22:54,225
There's squid inside.

1688
01:22:54,725 --> 01:22:57,425
Gosh, it's spicy and refreshing.

1689
01:22:57,525 --> 01:22:59,365
The soup is so refreshing.

1690
01:22:59,595 --> 01:23:00,725
I'm sweating because it's hot.

1691
01:23:02,835 --> 01:23:03,835
Endure it.

1692
01:23:04,905 --> 01:23:06,004
(Rules of Possessed Love: Express your feelings truthfully...)

1693
01:23:06,005 --> 01:23:07,104
(and look for your destined partner.)

1694
01:23:07,105 --> 01:23:08,204
(Your date of birth and saju will remain a secret.)

1695
01:23:08,205 --> 01:23:09,304
(Don't reveal your profession on the first day.)

1696
01:23:09,305 --> 01:23:10,534
(Don't share your social media account or number.)

1697
01:23:10,535 --> 01:23:12,475
The door of the Hall of Sacred Spirits has opened.

1698
01:23:13,305 --> 01:23:14,945
Please move in order.

1699
01:23:21,185 --> 01:23:27,695
(Yu Ra leaves the house first.)

1700
01:23:31,265 --> 01:23:35,195
(There are five name plaques at the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1701
01:23:43,535 --> 01:23:47,175
(Whom will Yu Ra choose tonight?)

1702
01:23:47,275 --> 01:23:50,984
(Lee Gang Won)

1703
01:23:50,985 --> 01:23:52,485
After the date,

1704
01:23:53,285 --> 01:23:56,685
I felt that he was an upright man...

1705
01:23:57,455 --> 01:24:00,125
with a deep and soft heart.

1706
01:24:00,885 --> 01:24:03,625
He was the first person I became interested in...

1707
01:24:04,725 --> 01:24:06,295
at the house.

1708
01:24:06,995 --> 01:24:08,495
So I chose Gang Won.

1709
01:24:10,035 --> 01:24:16,175
(Hong Yu Ra chose Lee Gang Won.)

1710
01:24:16,905 --> 01:24:22,215
(Yu Ra expressed her true heart for the first time today.)

1711
01:24:25,415 --> 01:24:26,845
The flower of Gang Won...

1712
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:28,885
bloomed inside of Yu Ra's heart.

1713
01:24:29,255 --> 01:24:31,854
Whether they end up together or not,

1714
01:24:31,855 --> 01:24:35,654
right at that moment when that feeling develops,

1715
01:24:35,655 --> 01:24:37,764
- you feel so happy. - You feel so happy.

1716
01:24:37,765 --> 01:24:38,895
- You feel really happy. - Right.

1717
01:24:38,925 --> 01:24:43,295
The spark that she didn't have yesterday has started.

1718
01:24:46,465 --> 01:24:49,575
(Gang Won heads to the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1719
01:24:51,245 --> 01:24:52,275
(Sighing)

1720
01:24:56,145 --> 01:25:00,245
(How does Gang Won feel after the date with Yu Ra?)

1721
01:25:02,215 --> 01:25:06,655
(Lee Ra Yun, Hong Yu Ra)

1722
01:25:07,585 --> 01:25:08,825
(Sighing)

1723
01:25:13,365 --> 01:25:17,935
(Gang Won feels even more torn.)

1724
01:25:20,235 --> 01:25:21,275
He's in anguish.

1725
01:25:22,805 --> 01:25:24,305
Gosh, I'm curious about Gang Won's heart.

1726
01:25:26,005 --> 01:25:27,845
I'm dying to know what he feels.

1727
01:25:28,145 --> 01:25:31,345
He must've talked with Ra Yun back at the House too.

1728
01:25:31,545 --> 01:25:34,145
Please pick Yu Ra today.

1729
01:25:35,215 --> 01:25:39,825
(Who will Gang Won's heart head toward?)

1730
01:25:42,825 --> 01:25:44,024
(A while ago)

1731
01:25:44,025 --> 01:25:46,425
We were chatting about what we did today.

1732
01:25:46,525 --> 01:25:47,665
Did you have fun?

1733
01:25:48,465 --> 01:25:49,465
Today?

1734
01:25:51,065 --> 01:25:53,335
It was fun, but I won't comment about it.

1735
01:25:54,805 --> 01:25:55,975
- What? - That's understandable.

1736
01:25:56,635 --> 01:25:57,845
I had fun.

1737
01:26:00,145 --> 01:26:02,415
I shared a similar energy with Hyeon U...

1738
01:26:02,715 --> 01:26:05,414
- more than I thought we would. - A similar energy?

1739
01:26:05,415 --> 01:26:06,415
It was great.

1740
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:07,784
The energy is important for shamans.

1741
01:26:07,785 --> 01:26:09,055
It's very important.

1742
01:26:09,515 --> 01:26:12,255
We understood each other even without having to explain things.

1743
01:26:12,655 --> 01:26:14,824
I cried in the car.

1744
01:26:14,825 --> 01:26:16,995
- Why? - We were just talking.

1745
01:26:17,555 --> 01:26:19,565
We were talking about our divine spirits and I kept crying.

1746
01:26:21,265 --> 01:26:23,494
- Gosh. - I was such a nuisance.

1747
01:26:23,495 --> 01:26:25,434
I didn't cry.

1748
01:26:25,435 --> 01:26:26,504
Seriously.

1749
01:26:26,505 --> 01:26:29,405
We both said it was great.

1750
01:26:29,535 --> 01:26:31,204
I would've cried too if I was there.

1751
01:26:31,205 --> 01:26:32,345
That might've happened.

1752
01:26:32,775 --> 01:26:36,545
The three of us would've been really emotional.

1753
01:26:37,575 --> 01:26:41,385
(Hyeon U naturally sits next to Ra Yun.)

1754
01:26:42,415 --> 01:26:44,314
I told them about me crying in the car.

1755
01:26:44,315 --> 01:26:46,525
- Really? - I talked about me being a crybaby.

1756
01:26:50,595 --> 01:26:53,365
(Gang Won is feeling frustrated.)

1757
01:26:55,535 --> 01:26:58,164
After the date, I returned to the House.

1758
01:26:58,165 --> 01:27:00,734
I saw Hyeon U and Ra Yun looking a lot closer.

1759
01:27:00,735 --> 01:27:03,905
I felt upset, angry, and bitter.

1760
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:05,904
I was desperate to hide my emotions...

1761
01:27:05,905 --> 01:27:07,675
and felt desperate emotionally.

1762
01:27:15,585 --> 01:27:20,225
(Lee Gang Won chooses Lee Ra Yun.)

1763
01:27:21,155 --> 01:27:22,655
I feel bad for Yu Ra,

1764
01:27:22,995 --> 01:27:24,595
but Ra Yun was the one I wanted.

1765
01:27:26,065 --> 01:27:29,795
(Very surprised)

1766
01:27:30,395 --> 01:27:33,965
(Gang Won's choice surprises everyone.)

1767
01:27:34,675 --> 01:27:35,975
You can't do that!

1768
01:27:36,935 --> 01:27:39,105
- What's wrong with you? - That upset me.

1769
01:27:40,105 --> 01:27:41,815
- That upset me too. - Gosh.

1770
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:44,345
This is insane.

1771
01:27:45,285 --> 01:27:48,785
(Gang Won's heart has not changed.)

1772
01:27:50,315 --> 01:27:51,625
Gosh, this is hard.

1773
01:27:56,095 --> 01:27:57,494
My gosh.

1774
01:27:57,495 --> 01:28:00,765
(Jung Hyeon U, Lee Gang Won)

1775
01:28:01,235 --> 01:28:02,435
(Sighing)

1776
01:28:03,765 --> 01:28:06,135
I don't usually get torn,

1777
01:28:06,535 --> 01:28:08,375
but I felt really torn today.

1778
01:28:10,335 --> 01:28:12,304
I told them about me crying in the car.

1779
01:28:12,305 --> 01:28:14,975
- Really? - I talked about me being a crybaby.

1780
01:28:17,315 --> 01:28:22,555
I saw Gang Won looking anxious...

1781
01:28:22,985 --> 01:28:25,325
and I couldn't avoid seeing that.

1782
01:28:32,065 --> 01:28:34,465
I already had feelings grown toward someone.

1783
01:28:35,135 --> 01:28:38,035
Choosing Hyeon U...

1784
01:28:38,135 --> 01:28:42,175
while still carrying those feelings...

1785
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:44,435
didn't feel respectful.

1786
01:28:45,745 --> 01:28:50,375
(Lee Ra Yun chooses Lee Gang Won.)

1787
01:28:50,715 --> 01:28:51,885
Whatever.

1788
01:28:53,485 --> 01:28:55,214
(Gang Won and Ra Yun chose each other again today.)

1789
01:28:55,215 --> 01:28:57,655
Things will suddenly blaze up for these two.

1790
01:28:58,785 --> 01:29:01,295
I'm going crazy.

1791
01:29:01,625 --> 01:29:03,324
I think this was a way for them...

1792
01:29:03,325 --> 01:29:05,025
- to strengthen their relationship. - Right.

1793
01:29:05,865 --> 01:29:07,065
What will happen?

1794
01:29:09,365 --> 01:29:13,704
(The two complete their choices with mixed feelings.)

1795
01:29:13,705 --> 01:29:16,905
(Jung Hyeon U)

1796
01:29:17,035 --> 01:29:21,045
(Hyeon U enters the Hall of Sacred Spirits next.)

1797
01:29:21,715 --> 01:29:25,785
Our points of laughter, points of connection,

1798
01:29:26,345 --> 01:29:27,715
and points of humour.

1799
01:29:27,785 --> 01:29:31,085
I think it was an exciting date because of these unusual things.

1800
01:29:31,215 --> 01:29:34,955
(Jung Hyeon U chooses Lee Ra Yun.)

1801
01:29:35,525 --> 01:29:39,395
(Byeong Yeol has arrived at the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1802
01:29:40,825 --> 01:29:41,865
Byeong Yeol!

1803
01:29:42,365 --> 01:29:44,665
It looks like he had a lot of sleep.

1804
01:29:45,805 --> 01:29:47,235
I'm the most curious about him.

1805
01:29:47,635 --> 01:29:49,404
(Feeling bad for him)

1806
01:29:49,405 --> 01:29:51,105
It's uncertain for him too.

1807
01:29:54,375 --> 01:29:58,045
There wasn't any progress made for my heart.

1808
01:29:58,145 --> 01:30:00,515
I was disappointed about that.

1809
01:30:00,785 --> 01:30:03,015
I thought I had to make myself more opportunities.

1810
01:30:07,725 --> 01:30:09,424
(Jang Ho Am)

1811
01:30:09,425 --> 01:30:11,125
I thought that we really clicked.

1812
01:30:12,165 --> 01:30:15,765
I thought that dating a shaman would be exciting too.

1813
01:30:15,835 --> 01:30:18,765
It can feel a lot more exciting and comfortable.

1814
01:30:19,835 --> 01:30:21,474
After today's date,

1815
01:30:21,475 --> 01:30:23,835
I decided that my relationship with him...

1816
01:30:24,075 --> 01:30:25,645
could develop.

1817
01:30:25,805 --> 01:30:28,075
I chose Yu Gyeong today.

1818
01:30:28,775 --> 01:30:30,444
(Chae Yu Gyeong)

1819
01:30:30,445 --> 01:30:33,845
I enjoyed today's date more than yesterday's date.

1820
01:30:34,615 --> 01:30:36,355
I chose Yu Gyeong without any hesitation.

1821
01:30:45,265 --> 01:30:50,395
(Jang Ho Am chooses Chae Yu Gyeong)

1822
01:30:50,495 --> 01:30:52,965
I don't know how things will change,

1823
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:55,075
but it's just Yu Gyeong for me now.

1824
01:30:57,775 --> 01:30:58,945
Gosh.

1825
01:30:59,775 --> 01:31:00,945
What about Yun Jeong?

1826
01:31:01,145 --> 01:31:05,144
Ho Am can't hide his feelings now.

1827
01:31:05,145 --> 01:31:07,014
But we weren't shown...

1828
01:31:07,015 --> 01:31:08,855
- who Yu Gyeong chose. - Right.

1829
01:31:09,755 --> 01:31:12,054
Gosh, how can I wait?

1830
01:31:12,055 --> 01:31:13,655
Can't you text us later?

1831
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:15,125
I'm so curious.

1832
01:31:15,295 --> 01:31:17,725
Yu Gyeong would feel the same way, right?

1833
01:31:20,525 --> 01:31:22,464
- It might be slightly different. - Right.

1834
01:31:22,465 --> 01:31:24,465
This will be something we will have to keep our eyes on.

1835
01:31:26,265 --> 01:31:29,735
(Sang Hyeok has visited the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1836
01:31:33,745 --> 01:31:37,145
(Kim Yun Jeong)

1837
01:31:37,545 --> 01:31:39,215
Yun Jeong.

1838
01:31:40,485 --> 01:31:44,385
I really thought that she was a great person.

1839
01:31:44,885 --> 01:31:45,924
Oh, you look different.

1840
01:31:45,925 --> 01:31:48,254
- Here? - You definitely look different.

1841
01:31:48,255 --> 01:31:49,394
(The two spent a good time together.)

1842
01:31:49,395 --> 01:31:51,125
- Do I look okay? - You look so nice and tall.

1843
01:31:53,095 --> 01:31:54,935
I really enjoyed it.

1844
01:31:55,035 --> 01:31:57,995
The weather was great and it looked lovely.

1845
01:31:58,635 --> 01:31:59,765
- This is... - Hey.

1846
01:32:02,735 --> 01:32:03,735
Try it.

1847
01:32:05,045 --> 01:32:06,244
I loved it today.

1848
01:32:06,245 --> 01:32:09,775
Even the view outside when we were having tea...

1849
01:32:10,075 --> 01:32:13,085
was beautiful with the sky and trees.

1850
01:32:14,315 --> 01:32:17,855
(I liked you the most.)

1851
01:32:19,385 --> 01:32:22,055
(That was why I chose you.)

1852
01:32:23,595 --> 01:32:26,795
Your hairstyle suited you.

1853
01:32:27,565 --> 01:32:29,065
I thought you looked very pretty.

1854
01:32:31,635 --> 01:32:33,135
I chose Yun Jeong.

1855
01:32:34,605 --> 01:32:36,175
Well, I haven't...

1856
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:38,874
talked with the others yet,

1857
01:32:38,875 --> 01:32:40,475
but I'm not interested in them.

1858
01:32:47,285 --> 01:32:53,855
(Yun Sang Hyeok chooses Kim Yun Jeong.)

1859
01:32:53,955 --> 01:32:56,195
This is really fascinating with the interview.

1860
01:32:56,825 --> 01:32:58,895
It makes me think about her more,

1861
01:32:58,965 --> 01:33:00,964
so it feels like I'm developing more feelings for her.

1862
01:33:00,965 --> 01:33:02,995
That's what is fascinating about the interview.

1863
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:06,705
Gosh.

1864
01:33:09,635 --> 01:33:11,845
Sang Hyeok looks like someone who is really direct too.

1865
01:33:11,945 --> 01:33:13,375
So Yun Jeong...

1866
01:33:13,645 --> 01:33:16,745
can figure out who the Gold Dragon is today.

1867
01:33:17,315 --> 01:33:18,484
If she gets just one message.

1868
01:33:18,485 --> 01:33:19,584
- Right. - Right.

1869
01:33:19,585 --> 01:33:20,714
I'm curious.

1870
01:33:20,715 --> 01:33:24,155
(Did Yun Jeong figure out the Gold Dragon today?)

1871
01:33:31,716 --> 01:33:35,416
(Does Yun Jeong feel the same way as Sang Hyeok?)

1872
01:33:38,716 --> 01:33:40,686
I knew it. They won't show you the ones you're curious about.

1873
01:33:41,016 --> 01:33:42,125
(Annoyed)

1874
01:33:42,126 --> 01:33:44,586
It won't end today without things being revealed today, right?

1875
01:33:44,726 --> 01:33:47,625
I have to know everything today. Seriously.

1876
01:33:47,626 --> 01:33:49,825
She came as a special MC.

1877
01:33:49,826 --> 01:33:51,265
That must be more tormenting.

1878
01:33:51,266 --> 01:33:54,366
- Right. - It's really annoying.

1879
01:33:54,636 --> 01:33:57,305
Guests usually say things were great at the end.

1880
01:33:57,306 --> 01:33:59,435
But it's really annoying...

1881
01:33:59,436 --> 01:34:00,805
and it feels unpleasant.

1882
01:34:00,806 --> 01:34:03,775
You have to show me everything before I go.

1883
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:06,376
What do we do with, Ralral?

1884
01:34:06,746 --> 01:34:08,645
Right. It's really upsetting.

1885
01:34:08,646 --> 01:34:09,716
(Really frustrated)

1886
01:34:10,986 --> 01:34:15,256
(The third selection of the men and women has ended.)

1887
01:34:18,596 --> 01:34:19,696
Lemon.

1888
01:34:22,566 --> 01:34:23,926
There are lemons.

1889
01:34:24,966 --> 01:34:26,495
(Sang Hyeok looks carefully through the kitchen for the first time.)

1890
01:34:26,496 --> 01:34:27,835
Lemon juice?

1891
01:34:27,836 --> 01:34:30,966
(Sang Hyeok looks carefully through the kitchen for the first time.)

1892
01:34:32,336 --> 01:34:33,506
(Sniffing)

1893
01:34:38,776 --> 01:34:39,876
(Slicing)

1894
01:34:41,616 --> 01:34:42,886
(Squeezing)

1895
01:34:44,316 --> 01:34:46,016
(Squeezing)

1896
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:49,586
(Making lemon tea with care)

1897
01:34:51,286 --> 01:34:52,396
(Slurping)

1898
01:34:53,496 --> 01:34:58,736
(Sang Hyeok heads somewhere with the lemon tea.)

1899
01:35:00,136 --> 01:35:01,295
Have a cup of this.

1900
01:35:01,296 --> 01:35:02,936
You said you had a cold.

1901
01:35:03,466 --> 01:35:04,536
Have a cup of this.

1902
01:35:04,636 --> 01:35:06,306
- You said you had a cold. - Thank you.

1903
01:35:07,276 --> 01:35:09,075
- What is this? - I added half a lemon.

1904
01:35:09,076 --> 01:35:10,706
- Thank you. - Be careful.

1905
01:35:13,576 --> 01:35:15,915
He's so sweet!

1906
01:35:15,916 --> 01:35:18,686
He took care of just her when everyone else is there.

1907
01:35:18,816 --> 01:35:20,786
- He made it so obvious. - That sort of favouritism.

1908
01:35:21,116 --> 01:35:22,186
Is that good?

1909
01:35:22,326 --> 01:35:24,956
That would be great from someone you are interested in.

1910
01:35:25,726 --> 01:35:27,296
(Keeping that in mind)

1911
01:35:27,626 --> 01:35:29,326
(During the date)

1912
01:35:31,296 --> 01:35:33,235
(Yun Jeong wasn't in good condition due to her cold.)

1913
01:35:33,236 --> 01:35:34,936
Are you okay? Do you have a fever?

1914
01:35:35,466 --> 01:35:37,836
I don't have a fever yet.

1915
01:35:38,506 --> 01:35:40,176
What's wrong? Is your body aching?

1916
01:35:40,636 --> 01:35:42,805
- I'm in bad condition overall. - Did you...

1917
01:35:42,806 --> 01:35:45,045
- have some medicine? - I did, but...

1918
01:35:45,046 --> 01:35:46,376
Did you catch a cold?

1919
01:35:47,376 --> 01:35:51,856
(Sang Hyeok was worried about Yun Jeong who didn't feel good.)

1920
01:35:52,416 --> 01:35:56,626
Yun Jeong was in bad condition.

1921
01:35:57,026 --> 01:36:00,896
I felt grateful as I could tell she made an effort to be with me.

1922
01:36:01,866 --> 01:36:03,066
Have a cup of this.

1923
01:36:03,126 --> 01:36:04,866
You said you had a cold.

1924
01:36:05,636 --> 01:36:07,495
- What is this? - I added half a lemon.

1925
01:36:07,496 --> 01:36:08,905
- Thank you. - Be careful.

1926
01:36:08,906 --> 01:36:09,966
Okay.

1927
01:36:12,906 --> 01:36:14,036
(Slurping)

1928
01:36:49,346 --> 01:36:53,676
(Tonight, no one chose you in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1929
01:36:54,376 --> 01:36:56,446
(Shocked)

1930
01:36:56,786 --> 01:36:59,315
(No one expected this for Sang Hyeok.)

1931
01:36:59,316 --> 01:37:02,086
Oh, my gosh!

1932
01:37:02,956 --> 01:37:04,686
(Surprised)

1933
01:37:04,996 --> 01:37:06,726
Look at that.

1934
01:37:06,926 --> 01:37:07,995
She chose Ho Am.

1935
01:37:07,996 --> 01:37:09,996
I knew this was going to happen.

1936
01:37:10,096 --> 01:37:11,836
Right after he gave her the lemon tea?

1937
01:37:13,336 --> 01:37:14,735
(Feeling dizzy)

1938
01:37:14,736 --> 01:37:16,166
Check out the timing.

1939
01:37:16,506 --> 01:37:18,636
Gosh, how did things end up like this?

1940
01:37:23,506 --> 01:37:24,576
What?

1941
01:37:33,486 --> 01:37:34,616
This is crazy.

1942
01:37:35,426 --> 01:37:37,086
No one chose me.

1943
01:37:39,726 --> 01:37:40,956
No one chose me.

1944
01:37:48,236 --> 01:37:52,406
(Yun Jeong did not choose Sang Hyeok tonight.)

1945
01:37:55,906 --> 01:38:00,176
(He checks the message again.)

1946
01:38:12,356 --> 01:38:13,955
Gosh.

1947
01:38:13,956 --> 01:38:16,326
(Eyes fixed)

1948
01:38:21,536 --> 01:38:23,266
This guy has such a nice body.

1949
01:38:35,346 --> 01:38:38,146
(Possessed Love S2)

1950
01:38:38,356 --> 01:38:39,756
(The Pavilion of Connections is open.)

1951
01:38:39,986 --> 01:38:41,316
(The fortune telling of your connection and heart...)

1952
01:38:41,416 --> 01:38:42,726
(will begin.)

1953
01:38:42,826 --> 01:38:43,986
(Is there someone's heart you are curious about?)

1954
01:38:44,226 --> 01:38:45,356
(The heart is pounding.)

1955
01:38:45,456 --> 01:38:46,696
(That's perfectly true.)

1956
01:38:46,826 --> 01:38:48,126
(The courage is gone.)

1957
01:38:50,196 --> 01:38:51,965
(There's something I'm curious about.)

1958
01:38:51,966 --> 01:38:54,066
(It's flowing as things were told.)

1959
01:38:54,266 --> 01:38:55,866
(- Are you not ready yet? - I need just a moment.)

1960
01:38:56,106 --> 01:38:58,575
(The group date begins through the chaos.)

1961
01:38:58,576 --> 01:38:59,676
(My heart did waver.)

1962
01:38:59,776 --> 01:39:01,876
(My nerves are focused on Gang Won.)

1963
01:39:02,046 --> 01:39:03,176
(Is there someone you like, Yu Ra?)

1964
01:39:03,276 --> 01:39:04,276
(I'm just watching.)

1965
01:39:04,546 --> 01:39:06,045
(The skein of fate...)

1966
01:39:06,046 --> 01:39:08,015
(starts getting tangled.)

1967
01:39:08,016 --> 01:39:10,446
(It wasn't a pleasant facial expression.)

1968
01:39:10,516 --> 01:39:12,086
(That happened throughout the whole group date.)

1969
01:39:12,216 --> 01:39:15,086
(I kept getting a feeling of wanting to talk with Byeong Yeol.)

1970
01:39:15,626 --> 01:39:18,528
(Possessed Love S2)
