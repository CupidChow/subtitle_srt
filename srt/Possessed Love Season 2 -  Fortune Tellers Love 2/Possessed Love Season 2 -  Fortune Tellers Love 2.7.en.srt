1
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:27,948
(All statements related to shamanism and fortune-telling...)

2
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:29,118
(made by the cast in this program...)

3
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,288
(are purely personal opinions.)

4
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:32,289
- But...
- That's true.

5
00:00:32,906 --> 00:00:34,835
- Hey.
- You're here.

6
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:36,235
- Hi.
- Is she here?

7
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,676
- Yes.
- Really? Come on out!

8
00:00:39,076 --> 00:00:41,176
- We have a new participant.
- Hello.

9
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:42,946
Hello.

10
00:00:43,116 --> 00:00:44,475
Should we help her bring the bags upstairs?

11
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:45,816
Let's help her.

12
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:48,746
- Should we help her?
- Let's help her.

13
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,466
My bags are pretty heavy, though.

14
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:10,676
The patients can stay here.

15
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:13,946
Three men are going to help her out already.

16
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:21,515
(Possessed Love S2)

17
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:24,085
(Will the conversations we've had so far...)

18
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:25,515
(affect your decision?)

19
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:26,556
(I'd like to go on a date with you.)

20
00:01:27,026 --> 00:01:30,496
(The love triangle begins.)

21
00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:32,526
(Is there anyone you want to go on a date with?)

22
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:38,063
(Their feelings are intertwined.)

23
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,064
(Sang Hyeok.)

24
00:01:39,364 --> 00:01:41,194
(Come to the Pavilion of Connections discreetly without telling anyone.)

25
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:45,303
(A new woman emerges to shake up their fate.)

26
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:46,803
(Why me, of all people?)

27
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:48,404
(I get to talk to everyone.)

28
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:50,174
(Surprise!)

29
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:51,473
(Nice to meet you.)

30
00:01:51,474 --> 00:01:52,543
(You're stunning.)

31
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:55,074
(- You seem a bit nervous. - Yes, I'm probably more nervous.)

32
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:57,113
(When is the new girl coming?)

33
00:01:57,114 --> 00:01:58,914
(Is she secretly going on dates with the men?)

34
00:01:58,984 --> 00:02:01,913
(The Red Rabbit brought confusion upon them.)

35
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:02,983
(That's brutal.)

36
00:02:02,984 --> 00:02:04,384
(It's so cruel.)

37
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:08,354
(They're attracted to new participants.)

38
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:15,433
(How will the story end with the altered dynamics?)

39
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:17,263
(Actress Yoo In Na)

40
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:21,773
The Possessed House is in chaos now.

41
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,943
There were many unpredictable events...

42
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,374
- last week.
- Right.

43
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,743
The women got to pick their dates,

44
00:02:29,744 --> 00:02:32,653
and I wondered if Yu Gyeong would pick...

45
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:34,313
- Ho Am.
- Right.

46
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:36,684
In the end, she picked Byeong Yeol.

47
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,623
Their date was...

48
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:41,754
incredibly heart-fluttering and sweet.

49
00:02:41,854 --> 00:02:44,193
It looked like Byeong Yeol was...

50
00:02:44,194 --> 00:02:46,193
- opening up to Yu Gyeong that day.
- Right.

51
00:02:46,194 --> 00:02:47,863
- He did open up. That's my opinion.
- Yes.

52
00:02:47,864 --> 00:02:49,703
- What will we do about Ho Am?
- Poor Ho Am.

53
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:51,363
The way he flirted with her with his five-element flags...

54
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:52,433
- went on air, - Yes.

55
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:55,134
and I honestly rewatched that part like ten times.

56
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:56,973
It was just so cool.

57
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:59,513
It was so cool that I had to keep repeating it.

58
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:01,743
- So, it breaks my heart even more.
- Yes.

59
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:05,483
I wonder how the others are feeling as well.

60
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:07,353
Let's find out how it goes.

61
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,754
(How will they change their minds?)

62
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:11,253
(Scratchcard Date: Lee Ra Yun and Lee Gang Won)

63
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:13,094
The weather's amazing today.

64
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:16,493
This is a violation of publicity rights.

65
00:03:16,494 --> 00:03:18,924
I'm telling you. You came in when I was taking it.

66
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:23,534
(Opening the door without looking)

67
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,034
That's so funny.

68
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:30,204
Opening the door for her nonchalantly.

69
00:03:31,274 --> 00:03:32,914
Seriously.

70
00:03:36,414 --> 00:03:38,613
(Looking cool)

71
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:39,954
What's the hold up? Get in.

72
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,884
You're so charming.

73
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:47,523
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

74
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:49,123
(Ra Yun picked the spots for today's date.)

75
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:50,524
I'll close my eyes and get my hopes up.

76
00:03:50,794 --> 00:03:52,224
How are you going to drive with your eyes closed?

77
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:53,734
Can you do it?

78
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,534
- Shall we?
- Yes.

79
00:03:56,664 --> 00:03:58,234
I wonder where we're going. I'm excited.

80
00:03:58,664 --> 00:03:59,734
Oh, my.

81
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,974
- Aren't you cold?
- No.

82
00:04:04,404 --> 00:04:05,474
Good.

83
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:08,173
- What's your concept today?
- What?

84
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:10,013
- You picked a horrible concept.
- Why?

85
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:12,784
What's the image you're going for? A macho man?

86
00:04:14,814 --> 00:04:17,284
(The car stops at a red light.)

87
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:20,754
I am...

88
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:23,224
("I am?")

89
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:27,734
(Green light)

90
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,464
- The green light.
- Thanks.

91
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:34,304
- I am the green light.
- Great timing.

92
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:36,274
I love that you're the green light, Rara Yun.

93
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:39,414
Why do you call me Rara Yun?

94
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:42,143
- It has a nice ring to it.
- Right?

95
00:04:42,144 --> 00:04:44,344
All my friends call me Rara Yun.

96
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,084
Like, "Rara Yun!"

97
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,154
We're here.

98
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:51,383
Can I keep my eyes closed?

99
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:52,524
I can't wait to find out.

100
00:04:53,054 --> 00:04:54,953
- What?
- No? Okay.

101
00:04:54,954 --> 00:04:56,823
(Where did Ra Yun take him?)

102
00:04:56,824 --> 00:04:58,664
I can't live up to that expectation.

103
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,704
Hello.

104
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:08,774
(There's a CD player on the table.)

105
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:11,104
You want to listen to it?

106
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:13,414
(Nodding)

107
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:16,113
(Their first dating spot is a vintage music cafe.)

108
00:05:16,114 --> 00:05:19,814
It's like a retro music cafe.

109
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,623
That's unexpected. Do you like listening to music?

110
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,383
- Yes.
- Really?

111
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:26,824
I love music.

112
00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:30,464
You'll get to know about me today.

113
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,933
That's a huge plot twist.

114
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:34,833
- Why?
- It's good that I'm here today.

115
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,404
Why do you say that? Do you like music?

116
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:39,164
I love listening to music.

117
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:40,734
I knew it.

118
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,574
- You're the second Beenzino.
- That's right.

119
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:47,474
(What types of music do the two shamans like?)

120
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:51,944
Don't tell me it's "Undead Blossom Ending."

121
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:54,284
What? Is there such a song?

122
00:05:54,414 --> 00:05:55,614
No, I meant, "Cherry Blossom Ending."

123
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:58,124
The song keeps playing when it's spring.

124
00:05:58,424 --> 00:05:59,524
That's true.

125
00:06:03,924 --> 00:06:05,424
I have a feeling you're a good singer.

126
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:06,694
Me? Why?

127
00:06:07,194 --> 00:06:08,764
From the way I scream?

128
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:11,764
Yes, I can tell that you know how to use your voice.

129
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,074
- How did you know?
- I can just tell.

130
00:06:18,174 --> 00:06:19,514
Oh, it's Autumn Vacation.

131
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:21,514
Autumn Vacation.

132
00:06:23,084 --> 00:06:24,714
I want to listen to this one.

133
00:06:25,444 --> 00:06:27,383
I'll pick one first.

134
00:06:27,384 --> 00:06:28,954
(Ra Yun picked a song first.)

135
00:06:29,684 --> 00:06:30,823
Really?

136
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,694
I always listen to their songs when they release an album.

137
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:35,453
Hey, the song is playing!

138
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:36,523
- Listen.
- "Hey?"

139
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:38,724
- I might be older than you.
- My bad.

140
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:40,634
Awesome!

141
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:44,964
I love it.

142
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:51,404
This is so nice.

143
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:52,744
It's unbelievable.

144
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:58,684
(They quietly listen to the music.)

145
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:04,724
(Ever since you were little)

146
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,623
(You said that you never got)

147
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:10,524
(What you liked in your life)

148
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:15,734
(When you really liked something)

149
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:19,063
(You said you had to let go)

150
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,903
(Of something you cherished even more)

151
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:25,104
(You said you had to leave)

152
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:28,814
How do the lyrics match my situation so well?

153
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:31,514
I know, right?

154
00:07:35,714 --> 00:07:36,924
I feel like crying.

155
00:07:44,394 --> 00:07:45,724
(Peeking)

156
00:07:51,064 --> 00:07:54,304
(He hands over tissues without a word.)

157
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:06,014
Should we change the song?

158
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:09,014
- Let's listen to a hopeful song.
- Put on a trot song.

159
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:11,484
What trot song?

160
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:13,354
What made you upset?

161
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:17,724
The lyrics were about our jobs.

162
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:25,064
What made you start liking music?

163
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:29,804
I started listening to music...

164
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:35,374
to block out people's words.

165
00:08:37,444 --> 00:08:39,714
- It was like a hideout.
- Yes.

166
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:44,424
When you're frustrated or depressed,

167
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:47,954
you gradually start keeping it to yourself...

168
00:08:48,324 --> 00:08:50,394
- as you get older...
- Yes.

169
00:08:50,524 --> 00:08:52,664
- because everyone suffers.
- Yes.

170
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:56,064
I tend to ease that by listening to music.

171
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:57,564
So,

172
00:08:58,134 --> 00:09:00,274
- the lyrics just now...
- Yes.

173
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,704
The lyrics were...

174
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:07,773
Our job isn't that ordinary,

175
00:09:07,774 --> 00:09:10,984
and this song played, so I felt...

176
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:17,424
I don't want to separate what's ordinary and what's not.

177
00:09:17,884 --> 00:09:21,624
But still, in our society,

178
00:09:22,254 --> 00:09:24,424
I feel hesitant...

179
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:27,764
- when I have to reveal my job.
- We're careful about it. Yes.

180
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:33,004
I act like I'm unaffected, but I'm actually afraid.

181
00:09:35,204 --> 00:09:37,144
My parents haven't told...

182
00:09:37,874 --> 00:09:40,314
their acquaintances yet.

183
00:09:40,774 --> 00:09:41,844
I'm the same.

184
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:43,784
Even my younger sibling doesn't know.

185
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:47,714
- Right.
- I'm in trouble.

186
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:52,354
When I listen to such lyrics,

187
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:54,894
it makes my heart ache.

188
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:59,294
I mean, we need to let go of who we are...

189
00:10:00,464 --> 00:10:02,764
to call out to the spirits more easily.

190
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:07,204
The process of emptying our egos for the divine spirits...

191
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,504
to use our bodies freely is arduous.

192
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:15,444
I had a strong ego,

193
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:19,044
so that part of the job made me sad.

194
00:10:19,814 --> 00:10:21,013
I had that thought.

195
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:22,053
(Ra Yun has emptied her life, just like the lyrics.)

196
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,983
But that's me as a shaman.

197
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:25,423
I'm here to find myself...

198
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,793
- as a person.
- Right.

199
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:28,524
So, I've been so happy here.

200
00:10:29,354 --> 00:10:31,294
I thought the same thing today.

201
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:35,164
It's true that I'm here to find who I am as a person.

202
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,864
But I feel like myself as a person...

203
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:40,334
that I tried so hard to get rid of...

204
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,444
keeps holding its head up.

205
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:47,714
She had emptied her ego.

206
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,613
I think they can talk more and cry more easily...

207
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:53,054
as they have the same job.

208
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:55,014
Because they can relate,

209
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,384
- which is rare.
- They had a deep conversation.

210
00:10:57,854 --> 00:11:00,094
They must find each other so comforting.

211
00:11:00,754 --> 00:11:01,853
I know, right?

212
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:03,264
(They can understand each other as they're both shamans.)

213
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,633
- But...
- Stop crying. I didn't hit you.

214
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:08,334
(He tries to console her with a joke.)

215
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:11,504
Can we get some more napkins?

216
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:16,474
How did we get here while talking about music?

217
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:25,314
What are the chances that I'm older than you?

218
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:31,124
The chances of you being older than me?

219
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:32,484
Yes.

220
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:35,324
I'd say it's zero.

221
00:11:35,424 --> 00:11:37,094
- You thought it was zero percent?
- Yes.

222
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,494
- Actually...
- Yes?

223
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:44,064
What is it?

224
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:47,674
- Wait. Did you think I was younger?
- I actually...

225
00:11:48,304 --> 00:11:51,244
You'll find out anyway, so let me be honest.

226
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,314
I thought you'd be older than me.

227
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,344
- Why? Because of my face?
- At first, I mean.

228
00:11:56,074 --> 00:11:57,944
Of course.

229
00:11:58,344 --> 00:12:00,013
- Your face...
- That's so wrong!

230
00:12:00,014 --> 00:12:02,454
- I mean...
- That's so wrong.

231
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:05,124
Do you know how sensitive women are about their age?

232
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,353
Listen to me. Solely judging by my face,

233
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:09,124
I don't look that old, do I?

234
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,064
What?

235
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:15,094
What?

236
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:16,734
- What?
- What?

237
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:17,734
(Neither of them understand each other.)

238
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:20,903
- Do you not own any mirrors?
- Hang on.

239
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:22,803
- You said you were self-aware.
- What?

240
00:12:22,804 --> 00:12:24,903
Didn't you say you had a strong sense of self-awareness?

241
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:26,914
I've looked like this since middle school.

242
00:12:28,574 --> 00:12:30,644
Isn't that also a problem?

243
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,183
- It's a problem now?
- No.

244
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:35,154
I'm sorry. That's not what I mean.

245
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:37,853
(Covering his mouth)

246
00:12:37,854 --> 00:12:38,854
- That's not what I mean.
- Okay.

247
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,153
You can't talk that disrespectfully to an older guy.

248
00:12:41,154 --> 00:12:43,764
How dare you talk like that to an older woman?

249
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,434
How rude.

250
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:49,934
We'll find out soon enough. We'll talk then.

251
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:52,033
- When they reveal our ages, - Yes?

252
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:53,803
- and you're older than me, - Yes?

253
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:55,874
I'll kneel in the yard.

254
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:57,904
- Seriously?
- I'm serious.

255
00:12:58,174 --> 00:12:59,203
I'll kneel and beg for your forgiveness.

256
00:12:59,204 --> 00:13:00,874
(They don't stop bickering.)

257
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:03,584
- I'm hungry.
- So am I.

258
00:13:03,844 --> 00:13:05,214
- Should we go and eat?
- Sure.

259
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:09,113
Thank you. Have a good day.

260
00:13:09,114 --> 00:13:10,224
(Dropping)

261
00:13:11,454 --> 00:13:12,484
Rara Yun.

262
00:13:12,954 --> 00:13:13,994
Sorry.

263
00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:18,324
- Did that make you that angry?
- Yes.

264
00:13:18,824 --> 00:13:20,094
I got angry because you said you were older.

265
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:24,304
Where did we come from?

266
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:26,004
Was it over there?

267
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,204
Yes, it's that way.

268
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:31,573
I thought I knew this neighbourhood.

269
00:13:31,574 --> 00:13:34,213
Follow me. I'll take the lead.

270
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,214
Will you?

271
00:13:37,614 --> 00:13:42,154
(Next, they move to an atmospheric wine bar.)

272
00:13:43,354 --> 00:13:45,054
Can I ask you a question?

273
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:48,954
(The main event begins.)

274
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:52,164
- But we just came in.
- Yes.

275
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,294
We've gone on a few dates now.

276
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:57,034
How were they?

277
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:00,403
(Reading the room)

278
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:02,104
You're asking me that right away?

279
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:03,944
No warnings?

280
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,344
- She's curious.
- They need to get down to business.

281
00:14:08,444 --> 00:14:10,813
Yes, it won't be so easy to talk about that in private...

282
00:14:10,814 --> 00:14:12,444
- when they return.
- That's true.

283
00:14:14,214 --> 00:14:15,214
He's nervous.

284
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:22,124
(Ra Yun wonders what Gang Won really feels about her.)

285
00:14:23,694 --> 00:14:24,994
I've liked you since the beginning.

286
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:28,494
I got lost along the way, and things went wrong.

287
00:14:29,664 --> 00:14:31,764
- You got lost?
- Yes.

288
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,874
Well...

289
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:44,013
Why are you sitting so far away?

290
00:14:44,014 --> 00:14:46,014
- Right.
- Sit closer.

291
00:14:46,444 --> 00:14:49,113
- Do I scare you?
- No.

292
00:14:49,114 --> 00:14:50,154
Thank you.

293
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:52,723
- Is this arrabbiata?
- Yes.

294
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,594
- It looks so yummy!
- We're not here to fight, are we?

295
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,294
Of course not.

296
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,563
(A bowl of spicy pasta...)

297
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:01,764
(and a steak)

298
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:04,534
That's a lot of food.

299
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:07,204
Can we get some wine too?

300
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,044
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

301
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:11,444
Thank you.

302
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:12,544
And?

303
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,414
- Should we clink glasses first?
- Should we?

304
00:15:18,014 --> 00:15:19,014
(Clinking)

305
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:25,584
(Enjoying)

306
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:27,124
What do you think?

307
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,594
It's nice.

308
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:31,564
- Right?
- Yes.

309
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:33,164
I told you it'd be good.

310
00:15:35,694 --> 00:15:38,134
(Staring)

311
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:41,174
It's pretty hard to say it right away.

312
00:15:42,804 --> 00:15:45,604
If I missed the chance today,

313
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:47,743
I wouldn't have been able to ask you again...

314
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:49,614
as we didn't have that many days left.

315
00:15:51,214 --> 00:15:52,284
So,

316
00:15:53,414 --> 00:15:55,913
I just took the opportunity and asked you.

317
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:58,284
- Thanks.
- I don't want you to feel burdened.

318
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:02,724
Try this with wine. It's good.

319
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:07,594
(Eating)

320
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:11,934
It's good.

321
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:20,073
(The tension eases, thanks to the delicious food.)

322
00:16:20,074 --> 00:16:22,543
I've been singing that I wanted steak,

323
00:16:22,544 --> 00:16:23,544
and I finally got one.

324
00:16:29,514 --> 00:16:32,424
To be honest, I...

325
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,024
want to muster up the courage to tell you today.

326
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:40,034
I'm scared.

327
00:16:43,164 --> 00:16:45,734
In fact, ever since I entered the Possessed House,

328
00:16:46,564 --> 00:16:48,104
Granny showed me...

329
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:50,744
that we weren't a good match.

330
00:16:51,274 --> 00:16:52,674
So, she kept suggesting that I got to know others...

331
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:55,914
when I didn't feel the need to do so.

332
00:16:56,744 --> 00:17:00,653
But I decided to try getting to know others while I was here,

333
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:02,084
so I talked to Yu Ra.

334
00:17:03,114 --> 00:17:04,184
She was a good person.

335
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,824
- She's nice.
- She's so nice.

336
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:09,024
And she's pretty.

337
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:12,394
- But...
- Did you have to add that part?

338
00:17:13,194 --> 00:17:14,734
- Oh, no.
- What?

339
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,433
He did not have to add that.

340
00:17:16,434 --> 00:17:19,103
- He should have just...
- Gang Won tends to say things...

341
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,104
that are unnecessary.

342
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,773
Why did he feel the need to add,

343
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,203
- "And she's pretty?" - For no reason.

344
00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:24,244
"But you're prettier."

345
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:25,743
- No.
- No thanks.

346
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,573
Is that too late to add?

347
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:29,213
- It is too late.
- Okay.

348
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,943
He shouldn't have said that in the first place, right?

349
00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:32,484
- You bet!
- Obviously.

350
00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:35,013
- All right?
- I won't.

351
00:17:35,014 --> 00:17:37,653
What a bummer.

352
00:17:37,654 --> 00:17:39,284
- It is a bummer.
- Yes.

353
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:42,224
Did you have to add that part?

354
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:43,764
Put your knife down.

355
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:47,034
- But...
- I know Yu Ra is pretty.

356
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:49,033
- So?
- You're prettier.

357
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,034
But...

358
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:51,834
(Laughing)

359
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:52,834
You know,

360
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:55,934
I think being naturally compatible...

361
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,873
and working for each other in a relationship...

362
00:17:57,874 --> 00:17:59,204
are two different things.

363
00:17:59,474 --> 00:18:03,514
Who were you naturally compatible with?

364
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:06,854
You.

365
00:18:08,284 --> 00:18:10,054
(Grinning)

366
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:12,754
Honestly, I wasn't that worried...

367
00:18:12,984 --> 00:18:14,054
when you went on a date with Hyeon U.

368
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:15,724
I'll tell you why I wasn't worried.

369
00:18:17,194 --> 00:18:18,994
Because I never took him as a competitor.

370
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:20,734
Why not?

371
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:23,504
If I'm not wrong, you and Hyeon U...

372
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:27,073
just clicked and had fun together.

373
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:29,774
I doubted you were going to fall for him.

374
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:35,344
(Gang Won was certain about Ra Yun.)

375
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,424
When I'm in a relationship,

376
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:49,094
I only have eyes for him and put all my focus on him.

377
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:53,764
If I can't, I just end it as soon as possible.

378
00:18:54,164 --> 00:18:56,863
But when I came here,

379
00:18:56,864 --> 00:18:58,734
my intention wasn't...

380
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:01,534
to find someone tall and handsome.

381
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:06,204
I came here to find a man whom I am compatible with.

382
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:10,584
I was looking for the person of the fate plaque...

383
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,113
that I first picked,

384
00:19:13,114 --> 00:19:15,714
and I believed it was you.

385
00:19:17,384 --> 00:19:20,324
So, if it's not too much pressure...

386
00:19:22,224 --> 00:19:25,293
Have you decided on how you want things to go from here?

387
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:27,164
We don't have that much time left.

388
00:19:32,064 --> 00:19:34,733
I think I expressed my feelings as much as I could.

389
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:36,174
Even when I went to pick a plaque,

390
00:19:37,174 --> 00:19:39,474
I never hesitated, nor will I hesitate in the future.

391
00:19:42,374 --> 00:19:43,374
You're my favourite.

392
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:47,884
(Smiling)

393
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:50,624
I was the same.

394
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:56,754
- I feel like crying.
- Let's drink.

395
00:19:58,294 --> 00:20:01,163
- Oh, sorry.
- Calm down. Stop.

396
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:02,194
Oh, my gosh.

397
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:10,404
(The two made their feelings for each other clear.)

398
00:20:11,204 --> 00:20:13,574
- They're a match now.
- They are.

399
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:16,883
It seems like he won over Ra Yun's heart, right?

400
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:20,013
That's right. He decided to go for her only,

401
00:20:20,014 --> 00:20:21,854
so I hope he becomes more straightforward.

402
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:24,453
I bet there will be many people returning as a couple.

403
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:25,454
- I know, right?
- Right.

404
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:26,683
They're coming back with a stamp on their register.

405
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,694
- Exactly.
- Yes.

406
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:33,224
I never planned on drinking wine with tears.

407
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:43,504
I thought it was about time,

408
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:46,344
so I asked him,

409
00:20:46,674 --> 00:20:49,214
and he told me about what he'd do from now on.

410
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:53,344
Now, I'm certain.

411
00:20:53,784 --> 00:20:54,784
I'm certain...

412
00:20:55,814 --> 00:20:57,224
that it's the end of my inner conflicts.

413
00:20:58,584 --> 00:21:01,654
You kept approaching me and talking to me.

414
00:21:02,824 --> 00:21:04,494
I was so thankful for that.

415
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:09,734
It was a valuable date.

416
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:11,634
I didn't want time to pass.

417
00:21:12,164 --> 00:21:13,903
I wished that time would stop.

418
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:16,033
I never tried to figure out why I liked someone,

419
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:17,504
so I want to spend the rest of my time here...

420
00:21:17,604 --> 00:21:19,874
on going on dates with Ra Yun.

421
00:21:21,544 --> 00:21:26,514
(The two of them expressed their feelings for each other.)

422
00:21:28,514 --> 00:21:30,324
I see. Is this the place?

423
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:32,124
It's so beautiful.

424
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:36,853
(Scratchcard Date: Kim Yun Jeong and Jung Hyeon U)

425
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:38,994
- I like this. It's a poetry book.
- There are cats.

426
00:21:39,694 --> 00:21:42,263
You're picking the one with cats. Am I a cat?

427
00:21:42,264 --> 00:21:43,803
"Hector and the Search for Happiness."

428
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,863
- Wasn't this a bestseller?
- This is... Right.

429
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:47,203
It was a philosophical book...

430
00:21:47,204 --> 00:21:48,574
- Yes.
- about the essence.

431
00:21:50,374 --> 00:21:52,974
So I started with this kind of book.

432
00:21:53,504 --> 00:21:54,773
- Really?
- I began studying stuff like this.

433
00:21:54,774 --> 00:21:55,943
Then I dove into psychology.

434
00:21:55,944 --> 00:21:57,384
And it led me all the way to astrology.

435
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59,413
- Your starting point was...
- Yes.

436
00:21:59,414 --> 00:22:00,783
- This was...
- pretty far.

437
00:22:00,784 --> 00:22:02,914
I became interested in these ideas from the mainstream sector.

438
00:22:05,084 --> 00:22:07,593
I was curious about where Yun Jeong stood.

439
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:10,823
I wondered how she felt. We didn't have much of a connection.

440
00:22:10,824 --> 00:22:13,063
Then all of a sudden, she mustered up a lot of courage...

441
00:22:13,064 --> 00:22:14,994
to invite me on a date, so I was curious.

442
00:22:16,164 --> 00:22:18,134
Was there anything you wanted to know about me?

443
00:22:20,534 --> 00:22:22,574
(Thinking)

444
00:22:23,534 --> 00:22:24,874
I wanted to ask you this.

445
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:26,673
It's about the first impression selection.

446
00:22:26,674 --> 00:22:29,413
Did you pick me based on my human traits?

447
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:32,044
Or was there a different reason?

448
00:22:32,544 --> 00:22:34,554
Like did you feel a connection?

449
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,454
Based on human traits.

450
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:39,384
You chose me based on human traits?

451
00:22:39,454 --> 00:22:41,653
It was the vibe I got from you.

452
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:43,224
I got this elegant vibe of actresses.

453
00:22:43,924 --> 00:22:45,163
That stood out for me.

454
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:47,794
I told the staff that I chose you because of that vibe.

455
00:22:49,164 --> 00:22:50,434
That's a huge compliment.

456
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,404
I'm in a great mood.

457
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:55,504
Then why did you pick me?

458
00:22:57,774 --> 00:22:59,603
Why did I pick you?

459
00:22:59,604 --> 00:23:02,074
When I met everyone for the first time,

460
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,484
you were the person I wanted to get to know the most.

461
00:23:05,914 --> 00:23:09,014
And on the first day, I told the staff that you were cute.

462
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:13,354
I said, "He's so cute."

463
00:23:14,954 --> 00:23:17,724
I said, "I'm probably older, so I should act like it."

464
00:23:18,194 --> 00:23:20,264
- "You little..." - Yes, I should've been more mature.

465
00:23:21,034 --> 00:23:22,463
But I couldn't be.

466
00:23:22,464 --> 00:23:24,464
(They talk about first impressions, not to feel awkward.)

467
00:23:25,664 --> 00:23:28,704
There were some difficult moments to keep the conversation going.

468
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:32,043
But Hyeon U and I felt that...

469
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:35,914
we were both trying our best.

470
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:39,584
Her face said that she felt quite awkward.

471
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:42,853
And she sounded awkward with the way she spoke.

472
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,454
When I noticed that, I wanted to take care of her.

473
00:23:45,684 --> 00:23:47,024
I wanted to take care of her.

474
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,254
In my eyes, you're becoming cuter.

475
00:23:51,194 --> 00:23:53,394
(Feeling awkward)

476
00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:56,064
- Do these compliments make you shy?
- What?

477
00:23:56,594 --> 00:23:58,403
- Yes. But I like them.
- But you like them.

478
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:00,574
I like them. I do,

479
00:24:00,704 --> 00:24:02,203
but I just act indifferent.

480
00:24:02,204 --> 00:24:03,334
Your facial expressions...

481
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:06,103
- I tend to hide.
- They're non existent.

482
00:24:06,104 --> 00:24:08,243
I tend to hide my expressions.

483
00:24:08,244 --> 00:24:09,373
(His honest expressions make her want to hide.)

484
00:24:09,374 --> 00:24:10,414
I tend to hide.

485
00:24:12,114 --> 00:24:13,344
You're going into hiding.

486
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:17,483
I tend to hide behind my poker face, but I do think that...

487
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:19,884
I want other people to notice me.

488
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:25,063
I tend to be shy before I date someone.

489
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:26,064
So the getting-to-know phase...

490
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,064
- is tough for you.
- Yes.

491
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:29,563
Then it must be hard for the guy to pick up on it.

492
00:24:29,564 --> 00:24:31,634
That's why dating has been tough on me.

493
00:24:32,864 --> 00:24:34,234
Even when you liked the guy?

494
00:24:36,304 --> 00:24:40,204
I could express myself better around the people I wasn't interested in.

495
00:24:40,874 --> 00:24:43,143
But I couldn't express myself to the guy I liked.

496
00:24:43,144 --> 00:24:44,444
So it could lead to misunderstandings.

497
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:47,314
Really?

498
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:50,114
She can't express herself?

499
00:24:50,414 --> 00:24:51,953
She's talking about Ho Am now.

500
00:24:51,954 --> 00:24:54,354
- Right. That's what I thought too.
- Yes.

501
00:24:54,624 --> 00:24:55,624
(Sighing)

502
00:24:56,124 --> 00:24:57,893
Actually, thinking back,

503
00:24:57,894 --> 00:25:01,433
she could've spent some 1-on-1 time with Ho Am too.

504
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:02,833
But I don't think she could muster up her courage...

505
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,034
- in the beginning.
- Right.

506
00:25:04,064 --> 00:25:06,104
I'm seeing that in her behaviour now.

507
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:08,173
Had she chosen Ho Am for this date,

508
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,803
they could have gone on a date for sure.

509
00:25:09,804 --> 00:25:11,073
- Right. That's a pity.
- Yes.

510
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:12,244
That's such a bummer.

511
00:25:12,404 --> 00:25:14,114
(Disappointed)

512
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:18,784
So it could lead to misunderstandings.

513
00:25:19,114 --> 00:25:20,284
Of course.

514
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:23,354
Right. Other people could get the wrong idea.

515
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:28,723
That's how I feel.

516
00:25:28,724 --> 00:25:32,224
(Can she express her feelings before it's too late?)

517
00:25:33,424 --> 00:25:39,134
("It's Late, But Not Too Late")

518
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:42,504
(At the same time,)

519
00:25:44,904 --> 00:25:49,443
(Ho Am and Yu Ra went to a nearby cafe.)

520
00:25:49,444 --> 00:25:51,813
- When you thought of shamans, - Yes?

521
00:25:51,814 --> 00:25:54,284
what kind of image came to your mind?

522
00:25:54,514 --> 00:25:56,713
- I just thought they were scary.
- Scary?

523
00:25:56,714 --> 00:26:00,024
I was even scared to go to get my fortune read by a shaman.

524
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:03,453
So does the occupation not matter to you?

525
00:26:03,454 --> 00:26:05,623
Let's say that you end up with a shaman.

526
00:26:05,624 --> 00:26:07,763
- If you were to date a shaman, - Okay.

527
00:26:07,764 --> 00:26:09,793
you wouldn't mind that he's a shaman?

528
00:26:09,794 --> 00:26:12,934
Right. I don't have prejudices.

529
00:26:14,104 --> 00:26:17,074
I have no prejudice about occupations.

530
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,943
It's the opposite for me.

531
00:26:20,944 --> 00:26:22,113
I mean, I'm a shaman.

532
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,714
- But I'm scared of other shamans.
- Yes.

533
00:26:24,284 --> 00:26:25,614
- I'm a shaman too.
- Right.

534
00:26:25,914 --> 00:26:28,284
But many shamans are quite scary.

535
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:30,824
Some people exude a scary vibe from their expressions.

536
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:33,893
So I didn't want to date a shaman.

537
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:35,954
I used to think like that.

538
00:26:36,924 --> 00:26:38,523
But now, I think it's different...

539
00:26:38,524 --> 00:26:40,124
- with everyone.
- I see.

540
00:26:44,234 --> 00:26:46,204
When was your last relationship?

541
00:26:46,664 --> 00:26:48,904
It was about four years ago.

542
00:26:51,274 --> 00:26:53,373
Do you think you can start a new relationship...

543
00:26:53,374 --> 00:26:55,074
with someone from the house?

544
00:26:57,614 --> 00:26:58,714
I want to.

545
00:27:03,214 --> 00:27:05,283
It's been so long since my last relationship.

546
00:27:05,284 --> 00:27:07,354
The truth is, I wanted to, but I just couldn't.

547
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:16,364
(Will Ho Am's wish come true?)

548
00:27:16,794 --> 00:27:21,034
(Scratchcard Date: Chae Yu Gyeong and Ha Byeong Yeol)

549
00:27:22,604 --> 00:27:24,574
My gosh, the chandelier is so beautiful.

550
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:30,784
(The second spot of Yu Gyeong and Byeong Yeol's date)

551
00:27:31,584 --> 00:27:33,213
The atmosphere on the second floor is so nice.

552
00:27:33,214 --> 00:27:34,984
- Right. It's so beautiful here.
- Yes.

553
00:27:36,184 --> 00:27:38,024
Have you often been to a place like this?

554
00:27:38,454 --> 00:27:41,254
No. This place feels like a palace.

555
00:27:42,424 --> 00:27:43,424
- A palace?
- Yes.

556
00:27:43,425 --> 00:27:46,264
Coming to places like this on a date would be nice.

557
00:27:47,594 --> 00:27:49,894
It's been so long since I last came to a place like this.

558
00:27:51,364 --> 00:27:53,003
- I think it's been four years.
- Really?

559
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,233
- Yes.
- Why?

560
00:27:54,234 --> 00:27:55,474
I didn't have anyone...

561
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:58,774
to come to places like this with. And I was busy too.

562
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:03,414
- Our food is here.
- Gosh, that looks good.

563
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:06,144
- Oh, my.
- This looks great.

564
00:28:07,614 --> 00:28:08,654
- This looks great.
- Yes.

565
00:28:10,454 --> 00:28:12,024
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

566
00:28:13,924 --> 00:28:15,454
(Slurping)

567
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,624
(Munching)

568
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:21,664
(Savouring the flavour with her face)

569
00:28:22,564 --> 00:28:24,464
(Finding her cute)

570
00:28:24,664 --> 00:28:25,734
This is so good.

571
00:28:26,964 --> 00:28:30,033
- By the way, I have a question.
- Yes. What is it?

572
00:28:30,034 --> 00:28:32,104
- It's about your ring.
- Yes.

573
00:28:33,274 --> 00:28:34,773
- My ring?
- You mentioned channelling energy...

574
00:28:34,774 --> 00:28:36,674
- into the ring when you made it.
- Yes.

575
00:28:37,614 --> 00:28:39,684
- Can I take a look at it?
- Yes, sure.

576
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:42,154
Do you want to try it on?

577
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:43,983
The energy might disappear.

578
00:28:43,984 --> 00:28:46,723
(He gives her the ring without hesitation.)

579
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:48,554
- I wanted to look at it.
- I see.

580
00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:51,824
(Staring)

581
00:28:53,694 --> 00:28:55,164
This is very big on me.

582
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:56,764
Right.

583
00:28:57,334 --> 00:28:59,264
How did you come to make a ring like this?

584
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:03,874
I wanted to strengthen the energy I felt I lacked.

585
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:06,244
I embodied that in the ring, so that's why I wear it.

586
00:29:07,514 --> 00:29:09,174
- For the energy.
- Yes.

587
00:29:09,344 --> 00:29:11,644
And since I made it,

588
00:29:11,844 --> 00:29:13,614
- there's only one ring like this.
- Yes.

589
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:14,984
And that...

590
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:17,214
- carries a beautiful meaning.
- Yes.

591
00:29:17,554 --> 00:29:18,583
(There's no other ring like this in the world.)

592
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:22,124
That's what I really liked about the ring.

593
00:29:23,724 --> 00:29:25,924
I would like to make one for you if I get a chance.

594
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:27,593
- Me? Really?
- Yes.

595
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:28,894
It'd be an honour.

596
00:29:29,864 --> 00:29:32,304
When I find out what kind of energy you're missing,

597
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,573
- I'd like to make one for that.
- I see.

598
00:29:34,574 --> 00:29:36,134
- For the energy I lack?
- Yes.

599
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:39,704
Will you wear it if I make it?

600
00:29:41,674 --> 00:29:43,844
I'd wear it with so much gratitude.

601
00:29:44,714 --> 00:29:47,283
- To shamans, rings are...
- Yes?

602
00:29:47,284 --> 00:29:48,914
like promises.

603
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,424
Promises? Could you elaborate?

604
00:29:51,484 --> 00:29:53,424
And why do rings represent promises?

605
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:56,253
To us...

606
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:59,624
- Well, in romantic relationships, - Yes?

607
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:02,564
- rings are promises of love.
- Like couples' rings.

608
00:30:02,964 --> 00:30:05,063
When you said you would make one for me,

609
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:06,804
it carried...

610
00:30:06,934 --> 00:30:09,304
a different meaning.

611
00:30:10,874 --> 00:30:13,874
Then to match the meaning it carried for you,

612
00:30:15,174 --> 00:30:17,313
I should make it with all my heart,

613
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:18,844
if I were to make one.

614
00:30:21,114 --> 00:30:22,414
(Surprised)

615
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:25,724
So he's going to channel love into it?

616
00:30:26,954 --> 00:30:28,324
- This is moving quite fast.
- What's going on?

617
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:30,354
- It's fast like a convertible.
- What's going on?

618
00:30:30,824 --> 00:30:33,523
I'm not interpreting this in the wrong way, right?

619
00:30:33,524 --> 00:30:34,893
- What's going on?
- This isn't the Byeong Yeol...

620
00:30:34,894 --> 00:30:36,264
we saw lying around in bed.

621
00:30:36,694 --> 00:30:38,163
- Right.
- Now...

622
00:30:38,164 --> 00:30:40,134
- That Byeong Yeol isn't here.
- It's not the same guy.

623
00:30:40,534 --> 00:30:41,903
He was like a paper doll.

624
00:30:41,904 --> 00:30:43,274
- But now, he's full of life.
- Right.

625
00:30:45,674 --> 00:30:47,514
(Fascinated)

626
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:49,814
- That would be lovely.
- Yes.

627
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:53,784
(Shy)

628
00:30:55,114 --> 00:31:00,524
(There's a special promise between just the two of them.)

629
00:31:01,254 --> 00:31:03,224
Is that silver?

630
00:31:06,024 --> 00:31:07,324
Is it possible to make it with jade?

631
00:31:07,424 --> 00:31:09,094
- It is.
- Then make it with jade, please.

632
00:31:09,164 --> 00:31:11,564
A jade ring would suit you.

633
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:16,073
Actually, I have the Fairies' Ring.

634
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,004
- Okay.
- But I don't have any jade rings.

635
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:20,543
- I see.
- So...

636
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:22,544
I really wanted to buy...

637
00:31:23,474 --> 00:31:24,583
a jade ring.

638
00:31:24,584 --> 00:31:27,654
Or if there was a chance I could make one, I wanted to.

639
00:31:28,214 --> 00:31:29,984
And if you could make one for me,

640
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,384
it would be an honour.

641
00:31:32,784 --> 00:31:34,424
I think I can.

642
00:31:36,324 --> 00:31:37,494
Thank you.

643
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,094
(Remembering her preference)

644
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:45,434
(What will be the finished form of their promise?)

645
00:31:48,304 --> 00:31:51,604
- Do you eat regularly?
- Yes.

646
00:31:53,374 --> 00:31:55,214
I try really hard to eat regularly.

647
00:31:57,814 --> 00:32:01,054
It seemed you weren't eating a lot in the house.

648
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:05,154
In the house? But I do cook sometimes.

649
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:08,324
I eat boiled eggs too.

650
00:32:08,724 --> 00:32:10,324
- Boiled eggs?
- Right.

651
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:11,894
Do they constitute a meal for you?

652
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:13,823
Well, for breakfast.

653
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,634
- I see.
- Just for breakfast.

654
00:32:16,264 --> 00:32:17,564
- But...
- Yes?

655
00:32:18,064 --> 00:32:21,374
it seemed you didn't eat a lot either.

656
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:22,603
- Me?
- Yes.

657
00:32:22,604 --> 00:32:25,444
I saw you eat cereal and stuff.

658
00:32:25,774 --> 00:32:28,473
To be honest, I want to eat rice more than cereal.

659
00:32:28,474 --> 00:32:29,544
I see. Rice.

660
00:32:29,944 --> 00:32:32,414
I'm really good at making rice.

661
00:32:33,214 --> 00:32:36,013
- We make rice as an offering.
- I see.

662
00:32:36,014 --> 00:32:38,284
- Like rice on ancestral altars.
- Yes.

663
00:32:38,784 --> 00:32:42,394
That's why I'm very good at making rice.

664
00:32:44,594 --> 00:32:46,723
- As for the rice offering, - Yes?

665
00:32:46,724 --> 00:32:48,794
do you make the rice soggy?

666
00:32:48,964 --> 00:32:50,434
Or do you make it firm? Does that vary?

667
00:32:51,034 --> 00:32:52,133
Does it matter?

668
00:32:52,134 --> 00:32:54,163
I think it might be different for everyone.

669
00:32:54,164 --> 00:32:57,274
We don't make it soggy or too firm.

670
00:32:58,504 --> 00:33:00,174
What's the meaning of the rice offering?

671
00:33:01,474 --> 00:33:03,174
(Surprised)

672
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:05,514
Oh, I just dropped the honorifics.

673
00:33:07,314 --> 00:33:08,383
You keep dropping them...

674
00:33:08,384 --> 00:33:09,814
- here and there.
- Yes.

675
00:33:09,984 --> 00:33:11,283
- Do you want to talk casually then?
- I...

676
00:33:11,284 --> 00:33:12,524
That sounds good.

677
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,823
I dropped the honorifics because I wanted us to bond more.

678
00:33:15,824 --> 00:33:17,324
- By dropping the honorifics?
- What?

679
00:33:18,094 --> 00:33:19,594
It just happened so naturally.

680
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:23,694
And I noticed that you were casual with other people in the house.

681
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:26,503
What about me?

682
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,734
(Why won't you drop the honorifics around me?)

683
00:33:29,004 --> 00:33:30,233
It's a bit hard with you.

684
00:33:30,234 --> 00:33:31,974
- Why was that hard?
- Well,

685
00:33:32,674 --> 00:33:34,614
we've gotten comfortable around each other today.

686
00:33:37,114 --> 00:33:38,984
Can I talk casually...

687
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:41,113
to you?

688
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:42,684
- Yes, sounds good.
- Can I call you...

689
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:44,683
Yeol?

690
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:46,854
(Can I call you Yeol?)

691
00:33:48,054 --> 00:33:50,093
- "Yeol." - "Yeol."

692
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,564
(Look at these two.)

693
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:53,324
"Yeol."

694
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:55,634
I feel dizzy because things are moving way too fast.

695
00:33:56,864 --> 00:33:58,104
- Gosh, why do I like them so much?
- Oh, my.

696
00:33:58,164 --> 00:33:59,334
What's going on with them?

697
00:34:00,464 --> 00:34:01,603
Yeol?

698
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:05,144
(Yu Gyeong surprises him by talking to him casually.)

699
00:34:05,804 --> 00:34:08,774
(I can do that, right?)

700
00:34:09,444 --> 00:34:12,114
(Shy)

701
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,854
- I didn't know I could...
- Yes?

702
00:34:15,584 --> 00:34:18,184
call you by your name.

703
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:23,954
Actually, once I became a disciple after the acceptance ritual,

704
00:34:24,824 --> 00:34:27,024
I rarely got called by my name.

705
00:34:27,194 --> 00:34:29,964
We have what's called a spiritual name.

706
00:34:30,164 --> 00:34:32,934
We're always around people from our spiritual world.

707
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,004
So I'm always called by my spiritual name.

708
00:34:35,804 --> 00:34:37,703
It's been several years...

709
00:34:37,704 --> 00:34:40,404
since anyone has called me by my name.

710
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:42,844
It'd be nice if you called me by my name.

711
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:47,144
Then let's call each other by our names.

712
00:34:47,284 --> 00:34:50,783
- Can I really call you Yeol?
- Yes?

713
00:34:50,784 --> 00:34:52,554
Sure. That sounds good.

714
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,424
It will be new and nice.

715
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,654
I can talk casually to you, right?

716
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:58,724
Let's do that.

717
00:35:00,024 --> 00:35:01,134
- Yes.
- Nice.

718
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:07,704
To be honest, my heart fluttered.

719
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:10,404
I think she's a very giving person...

720
00:35:10,534 --> 00:35:12,744
in terms of love and care.

721
00:35:13,274 --> 00:35:17,344
Such traits of hers were shown clearly on her face.

722
00:35:18,244 --> 00:35:20,684
So I thought she was so lovely and cute.

723
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,284
- My gosh. "Lovely?" - Oh, my.

724
00:35:25,984 --> 00:35:27,994
- Cute and lovely?
- Oh, my.

725
00:35:28,354 --> 00:35:30,193
- No one can stop them.
- Right.

726
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:31,294
Things are moving fast.

727
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,363
He doesn't look like the same guy...

728
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,364
- we've been watching.
- Right.

729
00:35:34,494 --> 00:35:36,033
- Exactly.
- Even his eyes look different.

730
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:37,264
Yeol, I like that.

731
00:35:37,964 --> 00:35:42,574
(Byeong Yeol's attitude has clearly changed.)

732
00:35:43,034 --> 00:35:46,003
(They're on their way back after the date.)

733
00:35:46,004 --> 00:35:47,873
Time flew by today for me.

734
00:35:47,874 --> 00:35:49,114
- Same here.
- Yes.

735
00:35:50,374 --> 00:35:51,613
- When we get back to the house...
- Yes?

736
00:35:51,614 --> 00:35:52,813
and start calling you Yeol,

737
00:35:52,814 --> 00:35:54,653
- Yeol?
- they'll be surprised.

738
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:56,184
- They'll be surprised.
- By the way,

739
00:35:57,284 --> 00:35:59,953
you sound cute when you call me that.

740
00:35:59,954 --> 00:36:02,224
But why do you want to call me Yeol?

741
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:03,923
I like calling people by their names.

742
00:36:03,924 --> 00:36:06,064
But why Yeol? Why only the last syllable?

743
00:36:06,194 --> 00:36:07,223
- The last syllable?
- Yes.

744
00:36:07,224 --> 00:36:08,463
That's what I said I would do earlier.

745
00:36:08,464 --> 00:36:09,894
- Right.
- Yes.

746
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:15,603
Why? Should I call you by your full name?

747
00:36:15,604 --> 00:36:16,903
No. I like that.

748
00:36:16,904 --> 00:36:18,374
"Hey, Ha Byeong Yeol." Like this?

749
00:36:20,574 --> 00:36:22,044
I like hearing you call me Yeol.

750
00:36:23,274 --> 00:36:25,444
Do you like discussing dating controversies?

751
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:28,114
Like the shrimp and perilla leaf controversies.

752
00:36:30,184 --> 00:36:31,684
Honestly, I'm not a huge follower of those controversies.

753
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:33,354
What's the one with the shrimp?

754
00:36:33,454 --> 00:36:34,994
So here's the one with the shrimp.

755
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:38,264
- So there's you, your girlfriend, - Okay.

756
00:36:38,494 --> 00:36:40,664
- and another woman.
- Okay.

757
00:36:41,234 --> 00:36:43,034
- And you guys are having a meal.
- Okay.

758
00:36:43,764 --> 00:36:44,933
Oh, right. It's a man.

759
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:46,904
- For you, it should be a man.
- Okay.

760
00:36:47,264 --> 00:36:50,434
- Your girlfriend peels a shrimp.
- Okay.

761
00:36:50,974 --> 00:36:52,544
- After peeling it...
- She puts it on his plate?

762
00:36:52,974 --> 00:36:55,013
It's more than that. She's taking care of him.

763
00:36:55,014 --> 00:36:56,414
- She peels it for him.
- She peels it.

764
00:36:56,644 --> 00:36:57,984
And she gives it to another man.

765
00:36:59,114 --> 00:37:00,413
Shrimps are too much.

766
00:37:00,414 --> 00:37:01,583
I would be okay with perilla leaves,

767
00:37:01,584 --> 00:37:02,914
- but not the shrimps.
- Why not?

768
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,623
(Sighing)

769
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:06,884
That's too sweet.

770
00:37:09,154 --> 00:37:10,394
- It's too sweet?
- Yes.

771
00:37:11,724 --> 00:37:13,264
What about you? Are you fine with that?

772
00:37:13,494 --> 00:37:15,493
- We can share the perilla leaves.
- Yes.

773
00:37:15,494 --> 00:37:16,793
If they're stuck, I can help him...

774
00:37:16,794 --> 00:37:18,533
- and eat one too.
- Yes. You can just hold them.

775
00:37:18,534 --> 00:37:20,534
But shrimps aren't supposed to be shared.

776
00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:22,773
- He can peel them himself.
- Right.

777
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,133
- He doesn't need my help.
- Right.

778
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:27,304
No one should peel shrimps for other people except for infants.

779
00:37:27,404 --> 00:37:28,814
(That's right.)

780
00:37:29,344 --> 00:37:31,174
- I'd be jealous if he did.
- Yes.

781
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,053
- Can I ask you now?
- Yes.

782
00:37:41,054 --> 00:37:43,494
- Ask me what?
- You said you'd answer me later.

783
00:37:43,654 --> 00:37:44,824
Oh, right.

784
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,024
(When they were heading to the restaurant)

785
00:37:47,294 --> 00:37:49,634
(How is it now?)

786
00:37:49,864 --> 00:37:51,864
(Are you getting closer to calling the two of us "we?")

787
00:37:52,634 --> 00:37:54,503
(Can I give you my answer...)

788
00:37:54,504 --> 00:37:57,504
(on our way back to the house?)

789
00:37:58,174 --> 00:38:02,444
(Yu Gyeong waits for Byeong Yeol's answer.)

790
00:38:02,644 --> 00:38:06,044
I wanted to express myself right away and make things clear.

791
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:09,914
I wanted to get to know him as fast as I could.

792
00:38:10,284 --> 00:38:11,684
My heart was racing.

793
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:14,624
Yes.

794
00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:16,294
To be honest,

795
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:19,893
I think we have gotten closer to that.

796
00:38:19,894 --> 00:38:21,964
(I think we have gotten closer to becoming "we.")

797
00:38:23,394 --> 00:38:25,434
Our date went well today...

798
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:27,974
- because I got to know you better.
- Yes.

799
00:38:28,804 --> 00:38:31,404
So I really enjoyed our date.

800
00:38:32,374 --> 00:38:35,273
I didn't want to seem hasty by speaking too soon.

801
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:36,544
That crossed my mind.

802
00:38:37,874 --> 00:38:39,083
That's all.

803
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:40,084
(Staring)

804
00:38:41,614 --> 00:38:43,284
- Is it a staring contest?
- No.

805
00:38:45,084 --> 00:38:46,523
You waited to tell me that?

806
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:47,924
What? Yes.

807
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:50,454
But you're right.

808
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:52,064
- Expressing myself...
- Yes.

809
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,734
- Right.
- When I need to express myself,

810
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,104
I...

811
00:38:59,764 --> 00:39:02,104
I find myself to be shy.

812
00:39:02,734 --> 00:39:05,904
But I do think you expressed yourself quite a lot.

813
00:39:06,974 --> 00:39:08,044
Right.

814
00:39:08,314 --> 00:39:11,114
- According to your standard.
- According to my standard. Yes.

815
00:39:11,414 --> 00:39:13,144
- I could see that.
- I see.

816
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,213
Thank you for expressing yourself.

817
00:39:15,214 --> 00:39:17,614
(Thank you for expressing yourself.)

818
00:39:19,854 --> 00:39:23,924
(Meanwhile, the two of them are tired of waiting.)

819
00:39:27,224 --> 00:39:28,894
Will they come back soon?

820
00:39:29,364 --> 00:39:30,594
I think they will.

821
00:39:35,904 --> 00:39:37,034
Now,

822
00:39:38,104 --> 00:39:39,604
aren't you starting to feel anxious?

823
00:39:40,604 --> 00:39:41,914
- A bit.
- Right?

824
00:39:43,544 --> 00:39:47,244
For some reason, I'm starting to feel anxious.

825
00:39:49,814 --> 00:39:50,913
Yes.

826
00:39:50,914 --> 00:39:54,254
(The two of them feel anxious at the end of their day.)

827
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:58,923
Have you given some thought...

828
00:39:58,924 --> 00:40:00,193
on what you'd do at the Hall of Sacred Spirits?

829
00:40:00,194 --> 00:40:03,294
No. I'm starting to feel the worry creeping in now.

830
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,594
What do I do?

831
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:07,634
What should I do?

832
00:40:12,074 --> 00:40:13,574
What should I do?

833
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:21,344
(They keep asking themselves the question that has no answer.)

834
00:40:23,084 --> 00:40:27,154
(At that time, a car pulls up in front of the house.)

835
00:40:27,684 --> 00:40:29,794
- We've got company now.
- Yes.

836
00:40:31,224 --> 00:40:32,724
Is that a new participant?

837
00:40:32,924 --> 00:40:34,023
Really?

838
00:40:34,024 --> 00:40:35,693
Don't you think so?

839
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:37,934
- My gosh. Oh, no.
- Goodness.

840
00:40:38,534 --> 00:40:40,303
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

841
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:41,304
(Yu Gyeong and Byeong Yeol are the first ones to come back.)

842
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,403
Are we really the first ones?

843
00:40:42,404 --> 00:40:44,034
(Yu Gyeong and Byeong Yeol are the first ones to come back.)

844
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:45,574
No one is in the living room.

845
00:40:46,004 --> 00:40:47,144
- Right?
- Yes.

846
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:54,583
- No. It's Yu Gyeong.
- It's Yu Gyeong.

847
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:56,184
(It's Yu Gyeong.)

848
00:40:56,284 --> 00:40:58,954
- What?
- They're sitting there together.

849
00:41:02,094 --> 00:41:04,154
- They saw us. I waved at them. Yes.
- Really?

850
00:41:05,994 --> 00:41:07,093
(Unlike the cheerful couple,)

851
00:41:07,094 --> 00:41:09,734
(the two of them feel utterly down.)

852
00:41:11,064 --> 00:41:12,634
- Thank you.
- Sure.

853
00:41:14,304 --> 00:41:15,404
All right.

854
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:21,674
I guess no one has come.

855
00:41:22,344 --> 00:41:23,813
- It's clean.
- We're the first ones.

856
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,284
- Let me get some water. The shoes.
- Yes.

857
00:41:26,814 --> 00:41:28,983
- Your feet must've been cold.
- A little.

858
00:41:28,984 --> 00:41:30,284
(Yu Gyeong goes straight to the kitchen.)

859
00:41:32,984 --> 00:41:36,154
Today is crazy. Everyone is coming late.

860
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:37,654
- Right?
- Yes.

861
00:41:38,564 --> 00:41:39,794
- It was fun.
- Yes.

862
00:41:43,264 --> 00:41:45,003
(Looking intently)

863
00:41:45,004 --> 00:41:47,734
(The remaining ingredients catch his eyes.)

864
00:41:52,174 --> 00:41:55,774
(Checking the fridge)

865
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,914
(Opening)

866
00:42:06,054 --> 00:42:07,653
Are you checking what they ate?

867
00:42:07,654 --> 00:42:08,654
Well...

868
00:42:08,655 --> 00:42:11,053
(The one who didn't go out last time checks the traces of the others.)

869
00:42:11,054 --> 00:42:12,124
There's some soup.

870
00:42:13,794 --> 00:42:16,564
(He discovered the traces of their cooking.)

871
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:20,104
I see. They cooked.

872
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:22,034
- What is it?
- Egg soup.

873
00:42:23,034 --> 00:42:24,104
(Sniffing)

874
00:42:24,404 --> 00:42:26,744
- I guess Yu Ra made it.
- I think they cooked together.

875
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:30,314
(The one with the same experience guesses quickly.)

876
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:34,614
- They cooked? That's amazing.
- What?

877
00:42:36,814 --> 00:42:39,384
(Hesitating)

878
00:42:40,654 --> 00:42:41,693
(Sighing)

879
00:42:41,694 --> 00:42:42,694
- Why?
- What?

880
00:42:43,054 --> 00:42:44,753
I just thought we were home.

881
00:42:44,754 --> 00:42:46,594
- Are you happy to come back home?
- Sorry?

882
00:42:48,464 --> 00:42:51,503
No. I wish I had come later.

883
00:42:51,504 --> 00:42:52,604
(Surprised)

884
00:42:55,374 --> 00:42:56,404
Wait for me.

885
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,474
- I don't want to go with you.
- Wait for me.

886
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:02,444
- I think they're on the 1st floor.
- The 1st floor.

887
00:43:04,274 --> 00:43:06,644
(Ho Am and Yu Ra go downstairs, following the sound.)

888
00:43:09,984 --> 00:43:10,984
What's gotten into you?

889
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,820
What's going on?

890
00:43:12,821 --> 00:43:15,927
(They bump into each other on the narrow stairs.)

891
00:43:15,952 --> 00:43:17,530
I guess we're the first ones who came back.

892
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,433
Yes. How did you know?

893
00:43:19,434 --> 00:43:20,474
(Looking at Ho Am,)

894
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,929
(Yu Gyeong stops.)

895
00:43:27,729 --> 00:43:29,398
Did you cook noodles?

896
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,298
- Can I eat it?
- If you want to.

897
00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:32,299
- Who wants it?
- Me.

898
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:35,938
(Anxious)

899
00:43:35,939 --> 00:43:38,609
- Ho Am is upset now.
- Oh, no.

900
00:43:39,509 --> 00:43:40,509
Oh, gosh.

901
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:43,009
How can you make eye contact there?

902
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:46,479
- The atmosphere is...
- I'm scared.

903
00:43:47,019 --> 00:43:48,119
Oh, no.

904
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:53,459
(Yu Gyeong tries to avoid making eye contact with Ho Am.)

905
00:43:54,459 --> 00:43:59,499
(She leaves the stairs without making eye contact with Ho Am.)

906
00:44:05,139 --> 00:44:06,139
Did you have fun?

907
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,339
Your face is saying you did.

908
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:11,679
Right. It was fun today.

909
00:44:18,479 --> 00:44:21,019
(Staring)

910
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,458
Gosh, I hung it here because I was in a rush.

911
00:44:26,459 --> 00:44:28,859
(They feel awkward around each other.)

912
00:44:32,929 --> 00:44:34,129
Where did you go on your date today?

913
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:38,669
Today, we made scented candles.

914
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:43,169
And we had Western food.

915
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:44,739
Like pasta.

916
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:47,839
- You had Western food?
- Yes.

917
00:44:56,089 --> 00:44:57,149
I had fun today.

918
00:45:07,129 --> 00:45:10,199
Going out with Yu Gyeong was a bit different from what I had thought.

919
00:45:11,769 --> 00:45:12,769
How?

920
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:13,899
Because...

921
00:45:17,409 --> 00:45:20,879
I just thought I wanted to go out with her once.

922
00:45:24,649 --> 00:45:27,819
I wasn't sure during the process.

923
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:32,489
But I think I had a good time.

924
00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:40,159
(He reveals his honest thoughts about their date.)

925
00:45:41,299 --> 00:45:42,898
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my gosh.

926
00:45:42,899 --> 00:45:44,498
Byeong Yeol is in an awkward situation.

927
00:45:44,499 --> 00:45:47,169
He can't say anything else in that atmosphere.

928
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:49,408
It's after Ho Am told her about his feelings,

929
00:45:49,409 --> 00:45:51,338
- which almost felt like a proposal.
- I know.

930
00:45:51,339 --> 00:45:53,678
- Right. That time...
- That's true.

931
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:56,109
Yes. It must be so uncomfortable.

932
00:45:56,509 --> 00:45:57,978
When he was lying down,

933
00:45:57,979 --> 00:45:59,478
his posture was...

934
00:45:59,479 --> 00:46:01,418
- I know.
- He looked arrogant.

935
00:46:01,419 --> 00:46:05,119
- The posture.
- It's the winner's posture.

936
00:46:05,659 --> 00:46:08,159
- When men see the posture...
- Right.

937
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:10,889
Oh, gosh. Ho Am.

938
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:17,569
When Byeong Yeol said he had a good time with Yu Gyeong,

939
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,069
it wavered my heart a little.

940
00:46:22,709 --> 00:46:24,469
If I keep getting tired like this,

941
00:46:25,979 --> 00:46:28,249
will I still be able to choose Yu Gyeong?

942
00:46:30,009 --> 00:46:33,319
(Meanwhile, Yu Gyeong looks concerned.)

943
00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:34,849
Why?

944
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:39,119
I actually wished we hadn't come back first.

945
00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:41,659
- First? You weren't.
- Yes. The first one to come back.

946
00:46:42,529 --> 00:46:43,789
We were the first ones who came back.

947
00:46:45,459 --> 00:46:46,459
Why?

948
00:46:47,899 --> 00:46:49,499
- Because of Ho Am.
- Ho Am?

949
00:46:52,299 --> 00:46:53,299
Does it bother you?

950
00:46:55,109 --> 00:46:57,339
- Of course, it does.
- Right.

951
00:46:58,309 --> 00:47:01,449
(She's worried about Ho Am who was waiting for her.)

952
00:47:01,879 --> 00:47:04,378
He said he had a good time...

953
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:05,719
with me today.

954
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:08,719
- I feel the same.
- You do?

955
00:47:08,919 --> 00:47:11,689
- Today, it was better to stay...
- That's a relief.

956
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:14,288
- than going out.
- It was also a date.

957
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,659
Yes. We said it was a date.

958
00:47:17,859 --> 00:47:21,428
In the big house,

959
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:24,299
it was just the two of us. It was quiet.

960
00:47:24,729 --> 00:47:26,999
And I like quiet places.

961
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:28,309
So how was it?

962
00:47:31,539 --> 00:47:32,709
We're very similar.

963
00:47:34,439 --> 00:47:35,478
Right?

964
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:37,878
You feel you're similar personality-wise.

965
00:47:37,879 --> 00:47:39,779
As for me, our spirits are compatible.

966
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:42,619
- That's interesting.
- Yes.

967
00:47:42,989 --> 00:47:44,149
I even wonder...

968
00:47:46,059 --> 00:47:48,059
if I'll ever meet a person like him again.

969
00:47:48,689 --> 00:47:50,628
Since I became a shaman,

970
00:47:50,629 --> 00:47:52,459
I've never seen someone so compatible with me.

971
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:55,768
I've met people compatible with me after putting in a lot of effort.

972
00:47:55,769 --> 00:47:58,699
But I've never met someone compatible from the beginning.

973
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:00,339
It was interesting.

974
00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:02,869
Right.

975
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:07,678
(Other possessed men and women come back later.)

976
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,948
Thank you.

977
00:48:08,949 --> 00:48:11,049
(Other possessed men and women come back later.)

978
00:48:12,949 --> 00:48:14,719
- Take a rest.
- Thank you.

979
00:48:22,989 --> 00:48:24,188
(Yun Jeong visits Yu Ra and Yu Gyeong's room.)

980
00:48:24,189 --> 00:48:25,928
So far...

981
00:48:25,929 --> 00:48:27,928
So I went there...

982
00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:29,129
and talked.

983
00:48:29,669 --> 00:48:31,268
"Is this what I think?"

984
00:48:31,269 --> 00:48:32,698
But it wasn't.

985
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:36,439
After staying in the house today, has anything changed?

986
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:39,608
- I see.
- Like what?

987
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:41,078
- Your thought.
- Me?

988
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:42,079
Yes.

989
00:48:42,649 --> 00:48:43,948
Was there anything?

990
00:48:43,949 --> 00:48:45,979
- Nothing?
- I didn't think at all.

991
00:48:46,349 --> 00:48:48,449
- You wanted to stay comfortable?
- Yes, I did.

992
00:48:48,849 --> 00:48:51,389
- That's good.
- We just had fun.

993
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,329
Yes. That's wise of you.

994
00:48:56,129 --> 00:48:59,058
I said this to Ho Am. "We had a great time today."

995
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:00,699
"It was fun."

996
00:49:00,799 --> 00:49:05,069
"But I'm getting worried as time goes by."

997
00:49:05,739 --> 00:49:07,439
I haven't sorted out my thoughts yet.

998
00:49:09,969 --> 00:49:14,339
(Yun Jeong has a lot on her mind after hearing that.)

999
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:16,049
My goodness.

1000
00:49:16,779 --> 00:49:17,779
(Upset)

1001
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,178
She can't ask him directly, so...

1002
00:49:19,179 --> 00:49:22,688
She didn't have time to talk to Ho Am.

1003
00:49:22,689 --> 00:49:24,348
He followed Byeong Yeol to the room as soon as he came.

1004
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:25,458
Right.

1005
00:49:25,459 --> 00:49:26,488
I wouldn't have been able to ask him either.

1006
00:49:26,489 --> 00:49:29,759
Everyone went to the person they had questions for...

1007
00:49:30,129 --> 00:49:31,289
- and talked.
- Right.

1008
00:49:31,999 --> 00:49:33,858
I hope Yun Jeong goes to Ho Am now before it's too late.

1009
00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:35,368
- Yes. If she talks to him now, - I hope she talks to him.

1010
00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:36,769
- you don't know what will happen.
- Right.

1011
00:49:37,169 --> 00:49:39,369
- I know.
- I agree.

1012
00:49:47,479 --> 00:49:49,079
Is everyone back yet?

1013
00:49:49,409 --> 00:49:50,549
No.

1014
00:49:50,909 --> 00:49:52,779
- Is everyone back yet?
- The new ones...

1015
00:49:53,649 --> 00:49:55,149
- The new couple hasn't come yet.
- The new couple.

1016
00:49:56,049 --> 00:49:58,619
Oh, my. The new one hasn't come.

1017
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,988
I'm fixing my makeup...

1018
00:50:01,989 --> 00:50:03,559
so that I don't look bad next to the new resident.

1019
00:50:04,789 --> 00:50:06,459
(Glancing)

1020
00:50:07,459 --> 00:50:09,429
Just jeans?

1021
00:50:10,399 --> 00:50:12,599
(They're checking their outfits before the new woman appears.)

1022
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:15,308
- Jeans with this.
- You have beautiful legs.

1023
00:50:15,309 --> 00:50:16,509
(The women are suddenly busy.)

1024
00:50:17,439 --> 00:50:19,578
- Shall we go inside?
- Yes.

1025
00:50:19,579 --> 00:50:21,438
- Do you want me to carry it?
- No, it's fine.

1026
00:50:21,463 --> 00:50:23,833
(The new ones are finally back.)

1027
00:50:24,549 --> 00:50:25,649
This is the accommodation.

1028
00:50:26,179 --> 00:50:27,279
I think...

1029
00:50:27,949 --> 00:50:29,749
everyone is somewhere.

1030
00:50:32,959 --> 00:50:35,888
(Escorted by Sang Hyeok)

1031
00:50:35,889 --> 00:50:37,029
Please go in.

1032
00:50:38,329 --> 00:50:41,299
Oh, my. It's so pretty.

1033
00:50:42,429 --> 00:50:44,469
- I should get changed now, right?
- Get changed right now.

1034
00:50:44,999 --> 00:50:47,539
(She picked a denim skirt after thinking hard.)

1035
00:50:48,099 --> 00:50:51,069
(Everyone is getting ready to welcome the new resident.)

1036
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,939
The women don't know we've met her already.

1037
00:50:54,339 --> 00:50:56,179
Do the men know?

1038
00:50:56,209 --> 00:50:57,349
We've all met her.

1039
00:50:59,379 --> 00:51:00,379
(It's ridiculous.)

1040
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,218
No. I didn't know.

1041
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:03,448
- I've met her, but...
- What?

1042
00:51:03,449 --> 00:51:04,918
- I've met her, but...
- Yes.

1043
00:51:04,919 --> 00:51:06,359
Don't say that.

1044
00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:09,429
(Anxious)

1045
00:51:10,089 --> 00:51:11,089
Don't say that.

1046
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:12,359
(Gang Won doesn't want them to know that he's met Kyung Eon.)

1047
00:51:13,759 --> 00:51:15,929
- Oh, you're here.
- You're here.

1048
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:18,269
Is she here?

1049
00:51:19,399 --> 00:51:21,399
(Anticipating)

1050
00:51:21,909 --> 00:51:23,209
- Is she here?
- Yes.

1051
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:29,378
- Hello.
- Hello.

1052
00:51:29,379 --> 00:51:30,449
Hello.

1053
00:51:30,579 --> 00:51:32,718
- Take a seat here.
- Okay.

1054
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:33,748
Wherever you feel comfortable.

1055
00:51:33,749 --> 00:51:35,249
Come out, guys.

1056
00:51:35,489 --> 00:51:39,089
The new resident is here.

1057
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,489
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my gosh.

1058
00:51:43,429 --> 00:51:44,429
Let me check how I look.

1059
00:51:44,759 --> 00:51:45,859
I can't lose.

1060
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:47,929
I can't lose.

1061
00:51:51,099 --> 00:51:53,768
Strangely, rather than when meeting a man,

1062
00:51:53,769 --> 00:51:55,769
I want to look pretty when meeting a woman.

1063
00:51:56,339 --> 00:51:58,778
- Rather than when meeting a man.
- Is that so?

1064
00:51:58,779 --> 00:52:00,138
- Yes.
- Is it because...

1065
00:52:00,139 --> 00:52:01,979
- you don't want to lose?
- That too.

1066
00:52:02,249 --> 00:52:04,778
I don't know. But they must feel more self-conscious...

1067
00:52:04,779 --> 00:52:06,119
- Right.
- when a new woman appears.

1068
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:07,749
That might be the case.

1069
00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:11,018
Hello.

1070
00:52:11,019 --> 00:52:12,519
Take a seat here.

1071
00:52:13,189 --> 00:52:14,589
Hello.

1072
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,029
(Smacking her lips)

1073
00:52:17,789 --> 00:52:19,658
- Hello.
- Hello.

1074
00:52:19,659 --> 00:52:22,099
(The women greet Kyung Eon.)

1075
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:24,629
Hello.

1076
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:26,399
Hello.

1077
00:52:27,969 --> 00:52:29,939
Hello. Oh, my. You're so pretty.

1078
00:52:30,709 --> 00:52:31,939
I fell in love.

1079
00:52:32,439 --> 00:52:34,839
I fell in love when our eyes met.

1080
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,148
Will you give it to me?

1081
00:52:37,149 --> 00:52:38,819
Oh, I'll do it.

1082
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:40,179
If that's more comfortable for you.

1083
00:52:41,279 --> 00:52:42,519
(Glancing)

1084
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:46,789
Somehow,

1085
00:52:47,719 --> 00:52:49,159
she looks comfortable.

1086
00:52:49,789 --> 00:52:51,089
You can sit here.

1087
00:52:51,289 --> 00:52:52,499
Is there a blanket?

1088
00:52:53,259 --> 00:52:54,428
(The atmosphere changes as Kyung Eon appears.)

1089
00:52:54,429 --> 00:52:55,529
A blanket.

1090
00:52:55,929 --> 00:52:57,329
Have you seen a blanket?

1091
00:52:59,139 --> 00:53:00,438
You could use a cushion instead for now.

1092
00:53:00,439 --> 00:53:02,439
Oh, yes. Thank you.

1093
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:07,009
Honestly speaking, I would feel competitive.

1094
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:09,179
It's a given.

1095
00:53:09,309 --> 00:53:11,779
Our eyes met like this many times.

1096
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:17,319
She was staring at me when our eyes met.

1097
00:53:18,219 --> 00:53:20,489
She had an intense energy.

1098
00:53:25,729 --> 00:53:28,769
(Yu Ra who got changed comes out later.)

1099
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:30,469
(Looking)

1100
00:53:31,999 --> 00:53:33,999
(Glancing)

1101
00:53:35,939 --> 00:53:37,069
Hello.

1102
00:53:39,179 --> 00:53:40,779
Hello.

1103
00:53:42,249 --> 00:53:45,418
I was like, "Oh, she's the one."

1104
00:53:45,419 --> 00:53:48,548
I know nothing about how things are going...

1105
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:51,989
between Sang Hyeok and her, which makes me worry a lot.

1106
00:53:54,619 --> 00:53:58,259
(The uncomfortable encounter with the new resident)

1107
00:54:02,329 --> 00:54:03,529
- Scoot over.
- Yes.

1108
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:05,369
Why is it so crowded over there?

1109
00:54:08,909 --> 00:54:11,939
(It feels awkward somehow.)

1110
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:15,478
Could you briefly introduce yourself to us?

1111
00:54:15,479 --> 00:54:17,608
(Sang Hyeok takes care of Kyung Eon first.)

1112
00:54:17,609 --> 00:54:19,179
Right. We should introduce ourselves first.

1113
00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:23,849
I'm Lee Kyung Eon.

1114
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,819
- Lee Kyung Eon?
- Lee Kyung Eon?

1115
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,088
(Clapping like a seal)

1116
00:54:29,089 --> 00:54:31,789
(Finally, 10 possessed men and women have gathered.)

1117
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:34,198
- Shall we guess her job?
- Congratulations.

1118
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:35,399
Guess her job?

1119
00:54:36,229 --> 00:54:38,199
(Looking intently)

1120
00:54:41,369 --> 00:54:43,109
Let me stare at you. I'm sorry.

1121
00:54:44,009 --> 00:54:45,509
It's my job.

1122
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:49,349
You remind me of Sana.

1123
00:54:50,009 --> 00:54:51,649
Sana? Who is that?

1124
00:54:51,779 --> 00:54:54,379
Right? I thought she looked familiar.

1125
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:56,649
- Is she an idol?
- TWICE.

1126
00:54:57,319 --> 00:54:58,788
She looks like Sana.

1127
00:54:58,789 --> 00:54:59,789
(Shy)

1128
00:54:59,789 --> 00:55:00,789
I see the resemblance.

1129
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,789
Would it feel like this if I saw Sana in real life?

1130
00:55:03,489 --> 00:55:04,688
I don't think so.

1131
00:55:04,689 --> 00:55:06,329
You have such a small face.

1132
00:55:06,629 --> 00:55:09,599
(She draws everyone's attention.)

1133
00:55:10,329 --> 00:55:11,468
She has a very small face.

1134
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:12,739
- What?
- Yes.

1135
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:14,769
She has a small face.

1136
00:55:15,769 --> 00:55:19,809
(The women's eyes are on Kyung Eon.)

1137
00:55:21,579 --> 00:55:24,449
Can you tell us what you do?

1138
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:28,079
Yes. I studied saju.

1139
00:55:29,249 --> 00:55:30,988
(Another saju reader is here.)

1140
00:55:30,989 --> 00:55:32,359
- I knew it.
- I got it wrong.

1141
00:55:32,589 --> 00:55:33,619
I'm excited.

1142
00:55:34,019 --> 00:55:36,328
She's a saju reader.

1143
00:55:36,329 --> 00:55:37,388
(Trying to keep a poker face)

1144
00:55:37,389 --> 00:55:39,829
It's interesting that many of us are saju readers.

1145
00:55:39,929 --> 00:55:40,999
You're right.

1146
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:44,228
I didn't want to study saju...

1147
00:55:44,229 --> 00:55:46,339
as if I were taking an exam.

1148
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:50,139
So I just started reading books about four years ago.

1149
00:55:54,139 --> 00:55:57,849
(They welcome her by clapping.)

1150
00:55:58,549 --> 00:56:00,378
Don't we have to show her the rooms?

1151
00:56:00,379 --> 00:56:02,048
Do you want to look around the house?

1152
00:56:02,049 --> 00:56:03,049
(Anticipating)

1153
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:04,119
Yes.

1154
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,589
- Could my room be the last one?
- Okay. You can take your time.

1155
00:56:09,329 --> 00:56:12,099
(She quickly goes to her room.)

1156
00:56:12,999 --> 00:56:14,759
I think I should go too.

1157
00:56:17,469 --> 00:56:19,268
(They panic as she will suddenly tour the house.)

1158
00:56:19,269 --> 00:56:20,499
We can't show her our room.

1159
00:56:23,439 --> 00:56:25,409
Don't you have to tidy up your room, guys?

1160
00:56:26,279 --> 00:56:27,379
Our room?

1161
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,678
It was a bit messy.

1162
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:30,979
(Thinking hard)

1163
00:56:31,509 --> 00:56:32,849
It was a bit messy.

1164
00:56:33,249 --> 00:56:35,748
Anyone want to look around the rooms with us? No one, right?

1165
00:56:35,749 --> 00:56:37,049
- Don't come.
- Let's go.

1166
00:56:38,049 --> 00:56:40,289
(She starts looking around the rooms without catching her breath.)

1167
00:56:40,419 --> 00:56:41,789
The socks.

1168
00:56:43,089 --> 00:56:44,889
(He remembers the socks he took off.)

1169
00:56:47,229 --> 00:56:50,929
(Sang Hyeok runs to his room.)

1170
00:56:56,739 --> 00:57:00,939
(He quickly starts tidying up the room.)

1171
00:57:02,149 --> 00:57:03,649
What are you going to do? Are you going to clean up?

1172
00:57:04,349 --> 00:57:05,719
It'll be fine.

1173
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:12,759
(It's not like what he said.)

1174
00:57:16,029 --> 00:57:18,489
Shall we raise the blinds so that it looks more spacious?

1175
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:21,029
The blinds? Yes. We should do that.

1176
00:57:22,329 --> 00:57:23,669
(Oh, my.)

1177
00:57:24,169 --> 00:57:26,239
Or the room will look too small.

1178
00:57:26,869 --> 00:57:29,309
- It looks bigger this way.
- Like this?

1179
00:57:30,139 --> 00:57:32,208
She might be too shy to visit the men's rooms.

1180
00:57:32,209 --> 00:57:33,679
(Their quick fix isn't looking very effective.)

1181
00:57:36,109 --> 00:57:37,748
This is the men's bathroom.

1182
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:39,949
Those on the second floor also use this bathroom.

1183
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:43,549
And this is the men's room on the first floor.

1184
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:46,419
Sang Hyeok you went out with today is using this room.

1185
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:49,159
(Ra Yun points at Sang Hyeok's bed.)

1186
00:57:49,729 --> 00:57:51,829
And if you come this way...

1187
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:55,428
- Was she Kyung Eon?
- Kyung Eon.

1188
00:57:55,429 --> 00:57:58,229
She looked very tall when she was sitting.

1189
00:57:59,239 --> 00:58:01,939
But she didn't look that tall when she stood up.

1190
00:58:03,109 --> 00:58:04,708
- She looked tall to me.
- She did?

1191
00:58:04,709 --> 00:58:06,239
- I thought she was rather short.
- She looked tall.

1192
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:08,979
- Is she tall?
- Being tall...

1193
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:12,118
is different for everyone.

1194
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:15,618
I think we should think about the exact number.

1195
00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:17,118
I think she's about 163cm.

1196
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,519
- She's 163cm?
- Yes.

1197
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:20,689
That's very detailed.

1198
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,259
I actually didn't see her when she was standing.

1199
00:58:23,689 --> 00:58:24,758
She's 163cm?

1200
00:58:24,759 --> 00:58:25,759
(The men are very interested.)

1201
00:58:27,229 --> 00:58:29,069
I think we'll get close quickly.

1202
00:58:30,469 --> 00:58:31,569
She's pretty.

1203
00:58:31,769 --> 00:58:32,839
I like her.

1204
00:58:33,669 --> 00:58:34,839
I've been waiting.

1205
00:58:38,839 --> 00:58:40,008
Where is she?

1206
00:58:40,009 --> 00:58:42,209
I think she's looking around the rooms.

1207
00:58:44,649 --> 00:58:45,679
(Glancing)

1208
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:49,889
(She keeps her eye on Byeong Yeol as Kyung Eon appears.)

1209
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:53,659
- Let's go and get some water.
- Shall we?

1210
00:58:57,959 --> 00:59:00,599
She looks neat somehow.

1211
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:02,968
She looks composed.

1212
00:59:02,969 --> 00:59:04,929
Byeong Yeol's ears have been red.

1213
00:59:05,399 --> 00:59:07,739
- Byeong Yeol?
- Since the new one came.

1214
00:59:07,999 --> 00:59:09,339
- You saw that?
- Yes.

1215
00:59:11,539 --> 00:59:12,738
Of course, it'd bother her.

1216
00:59:12,739 --> 00:59:13,878
The reaction...

1217
00:59:13,879 --> 00:59:15,578
- of the man you're interested in.
- Right.

1218
00:59:15,579 --> 00:59:17,478
- It'd bother you so much.
- It bothers you the most.

1219
00:59:17,479 --> 00:59:18,548
- Right?
- Yes.

1220
00:59:18,549 --> 00:59:20,718
At some point, Yu Gyeong...

1221
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:23,648
completely stopped mentioning Ho Am.

1222
00:59:23,649 --> 00:59:24,749
- Right.
- Yes.

1223
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:29,158
Yun Jeong might have an opportunity to approach Ho Am then.

1224
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:30,159
Right.

1225
00:59:33,029 --> 00:59:35,129
- Gosh. Yes.
- Shall we go and complain?

1226
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,629
"Hey, come out."

1227
00:59:38,129 --> 00:59:39,339
I don't have the courage.

1228
00:59:42,569 --> 00:59:43,638
How was the date?

1229
00:59:43,639 --> 00:59:46,038
I went out with Yu Gyeong.

1230
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:47,709
It was nice. I had fun.

1231
00:59:49,979 --> 00:59:51,079
Well...

1232
00:59:51,479 --> 00:59:53,919
We went to a workshop and made scented candles.

1233
00:59:54,579 --> 00:59:56,949
Then we had dinner before coming back.

1234
00:59:57,449 --> 00:59:59,459
I guess she wanted...

1235
01:00:00,019 --> 01:00:02,188
to go out with you.

1236
01:00:02,189 --> 01:00:04,829
I think so. I guess so.

1237
01:00:05,259 --> 01:00:07,399
She expressed her feelings too.

1238
01:00:08,499 --> 01:00:09,769
She expressed her feelings?

1239
01:00:10,699 --> 01:00:12,898
Indirectly.

1240
01:00:12,899 --> 01:00:15,608
- That's unexpected. You never know.
- Right.

1241
01:00:15,609 --> 01:00:18,439
I guess she has always had some interest in you.

1242
01:00:19,379 --> 01:00:22,549
Did you know about her interest or not?

1243
01:00:23,209 --> 01:00:25,848
- I did know about it.
- Really?

1244
01:00:25,849 --> 01:00:28,349
- This is so interesting.
- Right?

1245
01:00:29,049 --> 01:00:32,189
In any case,

1246
01:00:32,389 --> 01:00:36,559
Yu Gyeong went on a date with Ho Am before.

1247
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:40,159
- But she was interested in you.
- Yes.

1248
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:43,529
Today, things were positive.

1249
01:00:43,669 --> 01:00:45,229
But I don't know what will happen.

1250
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:47,799
Although I don't know...

1251
01:00:47,899 --> 01:00:50,439
Yu Gyeong very well,

1252
01:00:51,069 --> 01:00:55,579
she seemed very mature from the start.

1253
01:00:56,049 --> 01:00:58,379
I realized something upon coming here.

1254
01:00:59,849 --> 01:01:01,919
At first,

1255
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,989
I had a few thoughts about shamans.

1256
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:09,389
I had never lived with shamans before.

1257
01:01:10,229 --> 01:01:12,159
But now that I'm actually here,

1258
01:01:13,729 --> 01:01:16,029
I can compare them to regular people...

1259
01:01:16,429 --> 01:01:18,929
- of the same age group.
- Right.

1260
01:01:19,499 --> 01:01:21,298
And I think these shamans...

1261
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:23,869
are better, not worse.

1262
01:01:24,109 --> 01:01:25,369
(I see.)

1263
01:01:26,909 --> 01:01:30,379
Shamans must've gone through hardship...

1264
01:01:30,709 --> 01:01:32,749
- in their lives.
- Right.

1265
01:01:33,149 --> 01:01:35,579
So when I talk to them,

1266
01:01:36,819 --> 01:01:41,259
I can feel the depth of their lives.

1267
01:01:42,529 --> 01:01:45,289
That's why it's fun to communicate with them.

1268
01:01:47,629 --> 01:01:49,268
(Their thoughts about shamans are changing.)

1269
01:01:49,269 --> 01:01:50,428
It's like that for me.

1270
01:01:50,429 --> 01:01:52,469
(Their thoughts about shamans are changing.)

1271
01:01:54,839 --> 01:01:57,238
Kyung Eon, I heard that you had luggage at the entrance.

1272
01:01:57,239 --> 01:01:58,309
Yes.

1273
01:01:58,869 --> 01:02:00,379
- It needs to go upstairs, right?
- Yes.

1274
01:02:00,879 --> 01:02:02,848
Do you need help carrying it?

1275
01:02:02,849 --> 01:02:05,279
- Do you need help carrying it?
- Let's go and help.

1276
01:02:06,379 --> 01:02:08,018
- Do you need help carrying it?
- Let's go and help.

1277
01:02:08,019 --> 01:02:09,149
(Getting up)

1278
01:02:09,789 --> 01:02:11,088
Let's go and help.

1279
01:02:11,089 --> 01:02:13,419
(Byeong Yeol and Gang Won get up at the same time.)

1280
01:02:13,459 --> 01:02:15,588
(Coughing)

1281
01:02:15,589 --> 01:02:18,189
- The patients should stay seated.
- Okay.

1282
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,629
You're a patient. Three men are going.

1283
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:26,839
It's a facial expression I've never seen before.

1284
01:02:26,999 --> 01:02:29,369
Should a man help in that situation or not?

1285
01:02:29,869 --> 01:02:31,868
If it were an emergency, she would've understood.

1286
01:02:31,869 --> 01:02:33,778
- "There must be 1 or 2 suitcases." - That's right.

1287
01:02:33,779 --> 01:02:36,549
"Three men are going. Gang Won, you don't need to go."

1288
01:02:36,709 --> 01:02:38,349
- She must be thinking that.
- I see.

1289
01:02:38,949 --> 01:02:40,819
I find it uncomfortable.

1290
01:02:41,749 --> 01:02:43,918
You're a patient. Three men are going.

1291
01:02:43,919 --> 01:02:45,759
(Annoyed)

1292
01:02:46,689 --> 01:02:48,219
(Sniffling)

1293
01:02:50,529 --> 01:02:55,529
(The busy men make the women's heads turn.)

1294
01:02:56,069 --> 01:02:58,768
(The luggage-carrying trio: Sang Hyeok,)

1295
01:02:58,769 --> 01:03:00,368
(Byeong Yeol,)

1296
01:03:00,369 --> 01:03:02,039
(and Gang Won)

1297
01:03:03,339 --> 01:03:05,809
My bags are quite heavy.

1298
01:03:07,739 --> 01:03:12,279
(These three men chose Red Rabbit during the preselection.)

1299
01:03:13,379 --> 01:03:14,449
Hold on.

1300
01:03:14,619 --> 01:03:15,848
Let's see the bags.

1301
01:03:15,849 --> 01:03:16,849
(They follow Red Rabbit.)

1302
01:03:17,389 --> 01:03:19,789
- What? All 3 of them?
- Did all 3 choose Red Rabbit?

1303
01:03:21,819 --> 01:03:23,989
- That's scary.
- I can't believe it.

1304
01:03:24,459 --> 01:03:25,859
- Really?
- Yes.

1305
01:03:26,059 --> 01:03:27,358
What's this?

1306
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:29,168
- It's so fascinating.
- I guess there was a pull.

1307
01:03:29,169 --> 01:03:30,868
- I guess they were drawn to her.
- Yes.

1308
01:03:30,869 --> 01:03:32,769
(Were they drawn to Red Rabbit, their destined partner?)

1309
01:03:33,369 --> 01:03:34,498
They're here.

1310
01:03:34,499 --> 01:03:36,139
- Are the bags big?
- There aren't many bags.

1311
01:03:36,339 --> 01:03:38,209
- There aren't many bags.
- But they're a bit heavy.

1312
01:03:40,279 --> 01:03:41,509
- Let go.
- The two of us...

1313
01:03:41,879 --> 01:03:42,948
All right.

1314
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:44,779
(They're drawn by fate to move the luggage.)

1315
01:03:44,979 --> 01:03:46,248
They must be heavy.

1316
01:03:46,249 --> 01:03:47,979
- There aren't many bags.
- Are you okay? My goodness.

1317
01:03:48,949 --> 01:03:49,949
(1 bag per man)

1318
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,819
- My arms don't hurt.
- He's working despite his injury.

1319
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:54,258
He's working despite his injury.

1320
01:03:54,259 --> 01:03:56,088
Oh, no. Thank you.

1321
01:03:56,089 --> 01:03:57,458
(The fateful trio carries the bags together.)

1322
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:58,559
My goodness.

1323
01:03:59,259 --> 01:04:00,828
- My room...
- The women's room.

1324
01:04:00,829 --> 01:04:02,869
I'll carry them from here.

1325
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:05,098
(Crowded)

1326
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:06,139
All right.

1327
01:04:06,369 --> 01:04:10,439
(It's quite different from how things were on the first day.)

1328
01:04:13,309 --> 01:04:14,808
Since it's the women's room, I'll leave it outside the door.

1329
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,178
Okay. Thank you.

1330
01:04:16,179 --> 01:04:18,209
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1331
01:04:18,379 --> 01:04:19,579
- Thank you.
- All right.

1332
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:21,579
All right.

1333
01:04:23,419 --> 01:04:27,989
(Sang Hyeok opens the makgeolli he made with Kyung Eon.)

1334
01:04:29,689 --> 01:04:30,689
(Laughing)

1335
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:31,789
Party Party.

1336
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:35,928
Party Party.

1337
01:04:35,929 --> 01:04:39,099
(The name Kyung Eon gave to the makgeolli makes him laugh.)

1338
01:04:40,069 --> 01:04:45,509
(Kyung Eon came up with the name for Sang Hyeok.)

1339
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,079
It's too...

1340
01:04:51,049 --> 01:04:53,719
(It's precious.)

1341
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:57,389
(He looks after the makgeolli with care.)

1342
01:04:58,489 --> 01:05:01,359
(Working hard)

1343
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:06,398
(Party Party)

1344
01:05:06,399 --> 01:05:08,899
(Party Party)

1345
01:05:09,569 --> 01:05:13,438
(He made a precious memory with Kyung Eon.)

1346
01:05:13,439 --> 01:05:16,609
(Meanwhile, Kyung Eon is unpacking.)

1347
01:05:16,939 --> 01:05:19,739
(She finds something on the shelf.)

1348
01:05:20,209 --> 01:05:21,339
Fencing?

1349
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,079
Isn't it for a cat?

1350
01:05:28,849 --> 01:05:33,259
(The remnants of the last random date)

1351
01:05:34,419 --> 01:05:39,229
(Kyung Eon is very curious.)

1352
01:05:39,899 --> 01:05:41,458
Do you need help with unpacking?

1353
01:05:41,459 --> 01:05:44,128
- No, I don't have many things.
- Is it okay?

1354
01:05:44,129 --> 01:05:45,199
- Yes.
- I see.

1355
01:05:45,269 --> 01:05:46,338
(Women approach Kyung Eon, one at a time.)

1356
01:05:46,339 --> 01:05:48,999
- Hello.
- How cute.

1357
01:05:49,239 --> 01:05:50,468
She likes pretty women,

1358
01:05:50,469 --> 01:05:51,638
- so you got picked.
- Is that so?

1359
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:53,478
- Congratulations.
- She has never seen me act...

1360
01:05:53,479 --> 01:05:54,539
this way.

1361
01:05:54,709 --> 01:05:55,709
Really?

1362
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:58,009
- Right?
- You weren't so shy before.

1363
01:05:58,109 --> 01:05:59,179
What's your name?

1364
01:05:59,249 --> 01:06:00,979
I'm Lee Kyung Eon.

1365
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:02,889
- Kyung Eon?
- Yes.

1366
01:06:03,649 --> 01:06:07,559
Don't you feel a bit pressured since all attention is on you?

1367
01:06:07,719 --> 01:06:10,128
- I'm okay with it.
- My goodness.

1368
01:06:10,129 --> 01:06:12,189
- What's your MBTI?
- Mine?

1369
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:13,858
It's ISTJ.

1370
01:06:13,859 --> 01:06:15,729
- ISTJ?
- Yes.

1371
01:06:16,229 --> 01:06:17,799
She's an introvert.

1372
01:06:18,969 --> 01:06:22,039
(Yun Jeong heads over to the room upon hearing them.)

1373
01:06:23,169 --> 01:06:24,439
We waited for you eagerly.

1374
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:25,638
We thought, "Why isn't she coming?"

1375
01:06:25,639 --> 01:06:29,209
Everyone expected you to show up last night.

1376
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:31,679
You can listen to me as you unpack.

1377
01:06:33,079 --> 01:06:35,319
- You'll be here for four days.
- That's right.

1378
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:37,389
Can I ask you how things are now?

1379
01:06:37,689 --> 01:06:38,948
- How are things now?
- I see.

1380
01:06:38,949 --> 01:06:41,989
I wasn't too worried about adjusting to the situation.

1381
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:43,728
- Are you good at adjusting?
- Yes. But...

1382
01:06:43,729 --> 01:06:46,829
What? No. I thought that people would put me at ease.

1383
01:06:47,429 --> 01:06:50,469
- But I'm a bit disappointed.
- That's right.

1384
01:06:50,599 --> 01:06:51,729
Yes.

1385
01:06:54,199 --> 01:06:56,038
Everyone looks nice.

1386
01:06:56,039 --> 01:06:59,009
- Really?
- You heard that often, right?

1387
01:06:59,709 --> 01:07:04,709
(What will happen after Kyung Eon's appearance?)

1388
01:07:08,749 --> 01:07:10,819
The Hall of Sacred Spirits has opened.

1389
01:07:11,389 --> 01:07:13,119
Please move in turn.

1390
01:07:16,629 --> 01:07:22,129
(Kyung Eon enters the Hall of Sacred Spirits first.)

1391
01:07:26,439 --> 01:07:29,969
(Yun Sang Hyeok)

1392
01:07:30,309 --> 01:07:34,839
His beliefs were very similar to mine,

1393
01:07:35,109 --> 01:07:37,708
so I was a bit surprised and curious.

1394
01:07:37,709 --> 01:07:40,019
The conversation was very fun,

1395
01:07:40,649 --> 01:07:44,019
so I chose Sang Hyeok without hesitation.

1396
01:07:46,359 --> 01:07:50,459
(Kyung Eon makes a decision without hesitation.)

1397
01:07:51,459 --> 01:07:57,229
(Lee Kyung Eon chooses Yun Sang Hyeok.)

1398
01:07:59,769 --> 01:08:02,939
- Will Sang Hyeok's love begin?
- Seriously.

1399
01:08:03,269 --> 01:08:05,239
I wonder how it feels.

1400
01:08:10,709 --> 01:08:15,679
(Red Rabbit Kyung Eon's heart goes out to Sang Hyeok.)

1401
01:08:18,289 --> 01:08:21,759
(Afterward, Sang Hyeok enters the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1402
01:08:24,289 --> 01:08:29,159
(Yun Sang Hyeok chooses Lee Kyung Eon.)

1403
01:08:29,469 --> 01:08:30,598
That's it.

1404
01:08:30,599 --> 01:08:32,299
(They chose each other without hesitation.)

1405
01:08:33,369 --> 01:08:35,569
- Congratulations.
- The arrows of love.

1406
01:08:35,869 --> 01:08:37,738
They didn't choose among five people.

1407
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:39,578
Even if they had met in society,

1408
01:08:39,579 --> 01:08:40,878
they would've felt like...

1409
01:08:40,879 --> 01:08:42,209
- they found the one.
- That's how it feels.

1410
01:08:42,809 --> 01:08:44,178
- That's right.
- Yes.

1411
01:08:44,179 --> 01:08:45,209
(That's right.)

1412
01:08:45,509 --> 01:08:48,579
I went on a date with Kyung Eon by chance.

1413
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:51,089
It was very nice.

1414
01:08:51,219 --> 01:08:54,359
I think I'm drawn to her in a romantic way.

1415
01:08:54,759 --> 01:08:58,029
The desire to get to know Kyung Eon is greater.

1416
01:08:58,289 --> 01:09:00,829
Well, getting to know Kyung Eon is the only desire I have.

1417
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:04,669
(Embarrassed)

1418
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:12,339
(For the first time, there's someone he wants to know better.)

1419
01:09:13,339 --> 01:09:14,408
It's very cute.

1420
01:09:14,409 --> 01:09:17,749
Yun Jeong, do you know whom you'll pick today?

1421
01:09:18,249 --> 01:09:19,308
Me?

1422
01:09:19,309 --> 01:09:21,279
Do you need to think about it more?

1423
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:23,748
- It's a secret.
- Is it a secret?

1424
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:24,819
Of course.

1425
01:09:25,189 --> 01:09:26,459
You have many secrets.

1426
01:09:26,889 --> 01:09:29,359
As time goes on, I get more secrets.

1427
01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:32,488
What about you, Ho Am? How is it?

1428
01:09:32,489 --> 01:09:33,799
Do you need to think about it?

1429
01:09:35,899 --> 01:09:37,068
I thought about it...

1430
01:09:37,069 --> 01:09:38,599
- and made up my mind.
- I see.

1431
01:09:39,369 --> 01:09:41,199
Did you make up your mind? I see.

1432
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:47,209
(After much deliberation, Ho Am made up his mind.)

1433
01:09:49,109 --> 01:09:50,378
How is it for you, Yu Ra?

1434
01:09:50,379 --> 01:09:52,509
I don't know yet.

1435
01:09:52,849 --> 01:09:53,979
Are you still thinking?

1436
01:09:54,519 --> 01:09:57,519
(Yu Ra's mind is like a tangled ball of yarn.)

1437
01:09:58,649 --> 01:10:02,559
(Soon afterward, Yu Ra leaves the house.)

1438
01:10:06,629 --> 01:10:09,969
(She continues to think in front of the name plaques.)

1439
01:10:11,869 --> 01:10:14,839
For now, it's Sang Hyeok.

1440
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:18,309
Sang Hyeok and I still have...

1441
01:10:19,109 --> 01:10:20,509
a wall.

1442
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:23,549
I want to bring down that wall, but...

1443
01:10:23,809 --> 01:10:26,379
I thought I had that chance today.

1444
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:30,149
For now, I want to stay true to the present moment...

1445
01:10:30,349 --> 01:10:33,459
and do my absolute best.

1446
01:10:37,889 --> 01:10:41,429
(Hong Yu Ra chooses Yun Sang Hyeok.)

1447
01:10:43,969 --> 01:10:44,969
My goodness.

1448
01:10:48,969 --> 01:10:52,468
(The next ones to enter the Hall of Sacred Spirits...)

1449
01:10:52,469 --> 01:10:55,079
(are Ra Yun and Gang Won.)

1450
01:10:57,779 --> 01:11:01,379
(Lee Gang Won chooses Lee Ra Yun.)

1451
01:11:02,349 --> 01:11:06,519
(Lee Ra Yun chooses Lee Gang Won.)

1452
01:11:08,789 --> 01:11:09,789
All done.

1453
01:11:15,059 --> 01:11:21,139
(They chose each other without hesitation today as well.)

1454
01:11:22,669 --> 01:11:25,238
(After the selection, the two meet in the kitchen.)

1455
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,009
I'm really glad I came here.

1456
01:11:27,209 --> 01:11:28,209
Same here.

1457
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:30,109
Come to think of it, we should go on a date tomorrow.

1458
01:11:30,309 --> 01:11:31,949
- What?
- We should go on a date tomorrow.

1459
01:11:32,049 --> 01:11:33,719
- Why?
- We should do it tomorrow.

1460
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:35,049
Because the new member is here?

1461
01:11:36,389 --> 01:11:38,319
No. If we think about the remaining days...

1462
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:40,859
Do you want to go on dates on the remaining days?

1463
01:11:41,019 --> 01:11:42,388
No, I only thought that it'd be natural.

1464
01:11:42,389 --> 01:11:43,828
Are you asking me out on a date?

1465
01:11:43,829 --> 01:11:45,228
No. I only thought that it'd happen.

1466
01:11:45,229 --> 01:11:46,698
Why? Aren't you asking me out on a date?

1467
01:11:46,699 --> 01:11:48,659
- I only thought that it'd happen.
- You just asked me out on a date.

1468
01:11:49,699 --> 01:11:51,429
You asked me out on a date for tomorrow.

1469
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:52,869
- Are you happy?
- What?

1470
01:11:53,069 --> 01:11:54,439
- Are you happy?
- No.

1471
01:11:55,339 --> 01:11:57,868
"As we had a date today, we'll have it tomorrow..."

1472
01:11:57,869 --> 01:11:59,268
"and the day after too, right?"

1473
01:11:59,269 --> 01:12:00,778
That was what I was asking.

1474
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:02,279
No. We'll go home the day after.

1475
01:12:02,909 --> 01:12:06,418
No. We'll go home two days after.

1476
01:12:06,419 --> 01:12:07,679
- Why?
- You fool.

1477
01:12:08,019 --> 01:12:09,019
What? I'm listening.

1478
01:12:10,089 --> 01:12:12,549
- You're so stupid.
- Did you just call me stupid?

1479
01:12:13,559 --> 01:12:15,419
Just wait until our age gets revealed.

1480
01:12:15,759 --> 01:12:18,259
If you turn out to be younger than me...

1481
01:12:18,859 --> 01:12:20,899
Will you beat up a baby bird?

1482
01:12:20,999 --> 01:12:22,858
- Yes!
- I won't get beaten up.

1483
01:12:22,859 --> 01:12:23,869
(Being flippant)

1484
01:12:25,769 --> 01:12:27,299
(Sighing)

1485
01:12:27,899 --> 01:12:30,139
(Being flippant right back at him)

1486
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:33,139
Look at what you're doing.

1487
01:12:34,109 --> 01:12:36,378
- After this...
- There's no way you're older.

1488
01:12:36,379 --> 01:12:37,579
You're so annoying.

1489
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,819
You find me cute. Gosh, you aren't very honest.

1490
01:12:41,419 --> 01:12:43,719
I find you cute, okay?

1491
01:12:43,749 --> 01:12:44,749
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1492
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:47,059
- I didn't know that.
- I accept you...

1493
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:48,489
and let you win, okay?

1494
01:12:49,089 --> 01:12:50,089
Thank you.

1495
01:12:51,089 --> 01:12:52,159
Thank you.

1496
01:12:52,829 --> 01:12:54,758
(Staring)

1497
01:12:54,759 --> 01:12:55,759
Have a drink.

1498
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,929
Can I ask you a question you really can't answer?

1499
01:13:03,039 --> 01:13:04,039
Do you like me?

1500
01:13:06,209 --> 01:13:07,209
Yes.

1501
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:11,309
Gosh, why did you answer?

1502
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:13,949
- I have a question too.
- What is it?

1503
01:13:14,919 --> 01:13:15,919
To be honest...

1504
01:13:16,749 --> 01:13:17,949
I'm nervous. What is it?

1505
01:13:18,349 --> 01:13:19,818
I've always been curious.

1506
01:13:19,819 --> 01:13:20,819
What?

1507
01:13:21,519 --> 01:13:23,829
In what year were you born?

1508
01:13:25,329 --> 01:13:27,929
You didn't fall for it. You should've answered right away.

1509
01:13:28,329 --> 01:13:31,629
- Too bad.
- Stop egging me on.

1510
01:13:32,969 --> 01:13:35,499
- Are you already done?
- Yes. Why?

1511
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:38,109
Is it your mission to fill your stomach with alcohol?

1512
01:13:38,209 --> 01:13:39,979
- No.
- "Forgo food..."

1513
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:41,438
- I...
- "and fill your stomach with beer."

1514
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:43,009
I drink a lot.

1515
01:13:43,209 --> 01:13:45,209
(Sighing)

1516
01:13:47,019 --> 01:13:48,149
My head hurts.

1517
01:13:54,259 --> 01:13:56,218
Right. Hyeon U has a headache.

1518
01:13:56,219 --> 01:13:58,059
- That's right. Hyeon U too.
- Hyeon U has a headache too. Yes.

1519
01:13:58,529 --> 01:14:00,958
He went on a date with Yun Jeong, but...

1520
01:14:00,959 --> 01:14:02,229
What will happen?

1521
01:14:02,859 --> 01:14:04,798
- I'm curious.
- I'm so curious.

1522
01:14:04,799 --> 01:14:05,799
(Who is in Hyeon U's heart?)

1523
01:14:06,129 --> 01:14:09,598
(He faces the name plaques while feeling conflicted.)

1524
01:14:09,599 --> 01:14:10,868
(Kim Yun Jeong)

1525
01:14:10,869 --> 01:14:12,639
I was quite torn.

1526
01:14:13,139 --> 01:14:15,509
Since Yun Jeong and I went on a date today,

1527
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:20,219
should I send her a deeper message?

1528
01:14:20,879 --> 01:14:23,288
To be honest, today's date...

1529
01:14:23,289 --> 01:14:26,219
left me quite disappointed.

1530
01:14:26,619 --> 01:14:30,128
I feel like I still haven't seen...

1531
01:14:30,129 --> 01:14:31,289
her authentic self.

1532
01:14:31,829 --> 01:14:33,859
However,

1533
01:14:34,429 --> 01:14:36,599
I can't vote for Ra Yun.

1534
01:14:37,799 --> 01:14:39,799
In any case, I decided...

1535
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:43,139
to stop going straight toward her.

1536
01:14:44,169 --> 01:14:47,139
So I didn't want to complicate my emotions again today.

1537
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:54,579
(Until the end, Hyeon U is torn.)

1538
01:15:02,859 --> 01:15:07,529
(Jung Hyeon U chooses Kim Yun Jeong.)

1539
01:15:08,259 --> 01:15:12,369
(Yun Jeong enters the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1540
01:15:16,509 --> 01:15:21,079
(Yun Jeong looks conflicted.)

1541
01:15:23,509 --> 01:15:28,649
(Kim Yun Jeong chooses Jung Hyeon U.)

1542
01:15:29,419 --> 01:15:33,389
(After much deliberation, Yun Jeong chooses Hyeon U.)

1543
01:15:35,589 --> 01:15:37,728
Watching them makes my heart ache.

1544
01:15:37,729 --> 01:15:41,198
- Yes.
- She could go to Ho Am...

1545
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:42,998
and talk to him.

1546
01:15:42,999 --> 01:15:44,768
- Yes.
- But she lacks that courage now.

1547
01:15:44,769 --> 01:15:46,998
- That's right.
- It makes my heart ache.

1548
01:15:46,999 --> 01:15:50,739
Yes. I think she keeps hiding from her emotions.

1549
01:15:51,109 --> 01:15:52,709
- That's right.
- Oh, no.

1550
01:15:54,309 --> 01:15:58,209
(Yu Gyeong enters the Hall of Sacred Spirits next.)

1551
01:16:00,049 --> 01:16:01,049
(Ha Byeong Yeol)

1552
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:04,018
I feel like the one that was chosen by the divine spirit...

1553
01:16:04,019 --> 01:16:07,959
can become my partner with some effort.

1554
01:16:08,619 --> 01:16:10,088
I think Byeong Yeol is the Gold Dragon.

1555
01:16:10,089 --> 01:16:12,359
(I think Byeong Yeol is the Gold Dragon.)

1556
01:16:13,899 --> 01:16:16,129
I enjoyed eating with him.

1557
01:16:16,699 --> 01:16:18,799
I enjoyed being in a taxi with him.

1558
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:22,138
Throughout the date, my heart fluttered.

1559
01:16:22,139 --> 01:16:23,309
(My heart fluttered.)

1560
01:16:24,009 --> 01:16:27,609
(Chae Yu Gyeong chooses Ha Byeong Yeol.)

1561
01:16:31,309 --> 01:16:35,549
(Feeling certain, Yu Gyeong makes a choice.)

1562
01:16:36,219 --> 01:16:37,219
Really?

1563
01:16:37,649 --> 01:16:39,049
You're wrong.

1564
01:16:39,149 --> 01:16:41,158
- Oh, no.
- Gold Dragon.

1565
01:16:41,159 --> 01:16:42,588
Oh, no. I think...

1566
01:16:42,589 --> 01:16:44,488
she's more drawn to him because of that belief.

1567
01:16:44,489 --> 01:16:45,628
- That's right.
- What will happen...

1568
01:16:45,629 --> 01:16:46,629
once she finds out?

1569
01:16:46,799 --> 01:16:48,899
Gosh, there's an unexpected variable.

1570
01:16:49,629 --> 01:16:51,799
I hope she finds out soon.

1571
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:53,499
- Her feelings will deepen.
- I know.

1572
01:16:59,109 --> 01:17:04,289
(Tonight, what's inside Byeong Yeol's heart?)

1573
01:17:04,391 --> 01:17:08,560
(Chae Yu Gyeong)

1574
01:17:08,561 --> 01:17:10,401
For now,

1575
01:17:10,731 --> 01:17:13,401
my heart is going toward Yu Gyeong.

1576
01:17:14,031 --> 01:17:18,400
I'm thankful that Yu Gyeong plucked up her courage...

1577
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:20,041
and approached me.

1578
01:17:20,611 --> 01:17:22,810
She thawed...

1579
01:17:22,811 --> 01:17:25,141
my frozen heart a bit.

1580
01:17:25,981 --> 01:17:29,281
I'm thankful that she brought excitement to my life.

1581
01:17:29,881 --> 01:17:32,821
(Byeong Yeol's heart begins to move.)

1582
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:41,261
(Ha Byeong Yeol chooses Chae Yu Gyeong.)

1583
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:46,601
(He returns to the house with a light heart.)

1584
01:17:49,571 --> 01:17:51,841
(Sparkling)

1585
01:17:53,471 --> 01:17:55,210
(Look at her eyes.)

1586
01:17:55,211 --> 01:17:56,371
Her eyes...

1587
01:17:56,981 --> 01:17:58,681
(My goodness)

1588
01:17:58,741 --> 01:18:00,381
- Her eyes are full of love.
- I know.

1589
01:18:01,311 --> 01:18:03,621
- She likes him a lot.
- I know.

1590
01:18:03,981 --> 01:18:05,480
They're the eyes of a woman in love.

1591
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:06,481
Yes.

1592
01:18:07,691 --> 01:18:09,350
(Sparkling)

1593
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:10,361
Are you doing something?

1594
01:18:11,021 --> 01:18:12,561
- No, I just came here.
- Is that so?

1595
01:18:12,891 --> 01:18:14,330
Bye.

1596
01:18:14,331 --> 01:18:15,331
(She goes with Byeong Yeol right away.)

1597
01:18:15,661 --> 01:18:17,401
- Am I following you too readily?
- What?

1598
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:19,661
- Am I being too obvious?
- Yes.

1599
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:23,330
- Can I hang out in there?
- In our room?

1600
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:25,071
- Yes.
- No one is in the room.

1601
01:18:28,971 --> 01:18:30,211
It's just that...

1602
01:18:31,011 --> 01:18:32,111
- Yes?
- I wanted to be with you.

1603
01:18:32,881 --> 01:18:34,480
Right.

1604
01:18:34,481 --> 01:18:35,511
I wanted to be with you.

1605
01:18:37,021 --> 01:18:39,581
- Am I too honest?
- What? I mean...

1606
01:18:39,721 --> 01:18:40,851
Am I too honest?

1607
01:18:41,991 --> 01:18:43,051
That pillow is pretty.

1608
01:18:44,361 --> 01:18:46,621
- I see something.
- What?

1609
01:18:47,091 --> 01:18:49,161
That looks like Iron Man.

1610
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:51,330
The pillow. The leftmost one in the top row.

1611
01:18:51,331 --> 01:18:53,261
(The pillow looks especially pretty.)

1612
01:18:54,071 --> 01:18:55,071
I just wanted to say that.

1613
01:18:58,071 --> 01:18:59,371
(Grinning)

1614
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,511
- Gang Won is cute, right?
- Yes.

1615
01:19:02,141 --> 01:19:05,111
- Gang Won...
- You're cute too.

1616
01:19:05,611 --> 01:19:06,681
- Really?
- Yes.

1617
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:08,081
Thank you.

1618
01:19:08,082 --> 01:19:09,280
Don't you know, though?

1619
01:19:09,281 --> 01:19:10,451
- Me?
- Yes.

1620
01:19:10,721 --> 01:19:11,880
Well,

1621
01:19:11,881 --> 01:19:13,920
you're always found to be cute wherever you go.

1622
01:19:13,921 --> 01:19:16,051
Who was your divine spirit again?

1623
01:19:16,751 --> 01:19:17,761
Your...

1624
01:19:18,261 --> 01:19:19,991
- divine spirit. Yes.
- My shrine?

1625
01:19:20,191 --> 01:19:21,861
You must be adored by your divine spirit too.

1626
01:19:22,391 --> 01:19:24,331
You must receive a lot of love.

1627
01:19:25,661 --> 01:19:26,731
Right.

1628
01:19:27,901 --> 01:19:31,641
Love? I'm not sure if it's love.

1629
01:19:32,371 --> 01:19:33,971
We don't have set working hours.

1630
01:19:34,241 --> 01:19:35,241
Working hours?

1631
01:19:35,242 --> 01:19:36,470
- Nothing is set.
- Right.

1632
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:38,911
We start as soon as we wake up.

1633
01:19:39,111 --> 01:19:41,251
I just try to do my best each day.

1634
01:19:41,811 --> 01:19:45,251
Does your work flow under the same routine each day?

1635
01:19:46,551 --> 01:19:47,720
It's irregular.

1636
01:19:47,721 --> 01:19:49,690
- Really?
- It depends on the ritual,

1637
01:19:49,691 --> 01:19:51,121
and they are all done at different times.

1638
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:55,560
I'm curious.

1639
01:19:55,561 --> 01:19:56,790
I want to visit.

1640
01:19:56,791 --> 01:19:57,961
- Are you curious?
- Yes.

1641
01:19:58,161 --> 01:19:59,261
Come visit.

1642
01:20:01,901 --> 01:20:03,200
- Are you curious?
- Yes.

1643
01:20:03,201 --> 01:20:06,500
You can learn more about me.

1644
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:08,371
(Blinking)

1645
01:20:09,541 --> 01:20:12,781
- You're freezing again.
- That sounds good.

1646
01:20:14,711 --> 01:20:15,851
I think I'm too...

1647
01:20:16,751 --> 01:20:17,920
What's wrong?

1648
01:20:17,921 --> 01:20:19,580
You keep freezing.

1649
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:20,751
- Me?
- Yes.

1650
01:20:25,721 --> 01:20:27,731
- Should I cut it down?
- Cut what on down?

1651
01:20:28,631 --> 01:20:29,691
Should I cut it down?

1652
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,831
- Cut down on what?
- My thoughts.

1653
01:20:35,071 --> 01:20:36,971
Should I cut down on expressing myself like this?

1654
01:20:37,671 --> 01:20:39,270
It feels like I'm putting you under pressure.

1655
01:20:39,271 --> 01:20:40,611
Not at all.

1656
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:46,941
(Yu Gyeong cannot stop her heart drawn by her intuition.)

1657
01:20:48,281 --> 01:20:50,311
He was the one I picked at the Hall of Sacred Spirits.

1658
01:20:50,881 --> 01:20:52,181
I got attracted to him.

1659
01:20:52,351 --> 01:20:53,621
I felt nervous,

1660
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:56,151
and it had been a while since I felt that way.

1661
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:58,520
While feeling those emotions,

1662
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:00,730
I got excited to the point that...

1663
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:02,061
I had to question myself if it was true.

1664
01:21:02,431 --> 01:21:03,931
I wanted to know more about him.

1665
01:21:04,301 --> 01:21:05,861
I didn't want to hesitate.

1666
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:09,431
(Surprised)

1667
01:21:09,901 --> 01:21:11,971
Gosh, there you go.

1668
01:21:13,141 --> 01:21:15,540
(Yu Gyeong's honest rush with certainty)

1669
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:17,811
That's a woman who has fallen in love.

1670
01:21:18,011 --> 01:21:20,011
But he isn't the Gold Dragon.

1671
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:22,110
I don't think it'll matter if he's the Gold Dragon or not...

1672
01:21:22,111 --> 01:21:23,250
if she likes him that much.

1673
01:21:23,251 --> 01:21:24,881
- Of course.
- I think so too.

1674
01:21:25,021 --> 01:21:26,150
But she's certain it's him,

1675
01:21:26,151 --> 01:21:27,290
- and that is what is concerning.
- Right.

1676
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:29,751
- She's certain it's him.
- Right.

1677
01:21:32,091 --> 01:21:34,231
(At that moment,)

1678
01:21:36,531 --> 01:21:41,371
(Ho Am arrived at the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1679
01:21:46,471 --> 01:21:47,771
I felt...

1680
01:21:49,011 --> 01:21:50,511
shaken at that point.

1681
01:21:50,811 --> 01:21:56,451
But my heart still leaned toward Yu Gyeong more.

1682
01:21:58,351 --> 01:22:03,151
(Jang Ho Am chooses Chae Yu Gyeong.)

1683
01:22:05,261 --> 01:22:09,091
I wish for Yu Gyeong's heart to return to me.

1684
01:22:12,631 --> 01:22:14,600
- Gosh.
- Ho Am!

1685
01:22:14,601 --> 01:22:16,871
He wants her to come back.

1686
01:22:17,371 --> 01:22:19,340
I think it'll be hard for her to come back.

1687
01:22:19,341 --> 01:22:21,511
- It doesn't look easy.
- No.

1688
01:22:21,741 --> 01:22:24,180
Gosh, that's heartbreaking.

1689
01:22:24,181 --> 01:22:25,181
(Ho Am can only wait for her to come back.)

1690
01:22:25,182 --> 01:22:26,641
My gosh.

1691
01:22:31,051 --> 01:22:34,721
(The selection for the 5th day is over.)

1692
01:22:36,991 --> 01:22:38,020
With a lot of effort.

1693
01:22:38,021 --> 01:22:39,061
(Peeking)

1694
01:22:40,461 --> 01:22:43,260
- No.
- That was the hilarious part.

1695
01:22:43,261 --> 01:22:44,331
(The laughter of the two can be heard from Yu Gyeong's room.)

1696
01:22:44,961 --> 01:22:48,231
(Ho Am returned to his room.)

1697
01:22:48,731 --> 01:22:50,801
(Sighing)

1698
01:22:52,941 --> 01:22:54,971
(Sighing)

1699
01:23:05,221 --> 01:23:11,921
(Tonight, no one chose you in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1700
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:17,061
(Feeling upset)

1701
01:23:17,901 --> 01:23:19,330
(The Black Monkey has disappeared.)

1702
01:23:19,331 --> 01:23:22,570
The Black Monkey has disappeared! Oh, no!

1703
01:23:22,571 --> 01:23:24,040
- I feel like crying.
- Gosh.

1704
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:25,341
It feels like a drama.

1705
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:26,901
What kind of...

1706
01:23:27,341 --> 01:23:29,911
tragedy is this?

1707
01:23:31,081 --> 01:23:32,310
No matter how much you train,

1708
01:23:32,311 --> 01:23:34,250
you can't help but suffer in front of love.

1709
01:23:34,251 --> 01:23:36,151
- Right.
- I guess that's how it is.

1710
01:23:36,481 --> 01:23:38,180
It's really hard to understand people's hearts.

1711
01:23:38,181 --> 01:23:39,651
(A rather tough night for Ho Am)

1712
01:23:45,421 --> 01:23:51,961
(The Black Monkey didn't come back after a long day of waiting.)

1713
01:23:53,931 --> 01:23:56,501
Byeong Yeol and Yu Gyeong's date.

1714
01:23:56,701 --> 01:24:00,501
Byeong Yeol seemed to be interested in Yu Gyeong as well.

1715
01:24:00,811 --> 01:24:04,381
I think Yu Gyeong's heart was shaken...

1716
01:24:04,511 --> 01:24:07,551
by those moments.

1717
01:24:22,531 --> 01:24:27,270
(Tonight, the White Monkey chose you.)

1718
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:30,171
(Tonight, the White Monkey chose you.)

1719
01:24:35,811 --> 01:24:39,811
(Tonight, the Black Horse chose you.)

1720
01:24:40,651 --> 01:24:44,121
(The sent each other a message once again today.)

1721
01:24:45,121 --> 01:24:47,221
A song full of hope keeps playing whenever it's these two.

1722
01:24:47,551 --> 01:24:49,591
(The hopeful part)

1723
01:24:49,791 --> 01:24:51,721
- These two are full of hope.
- Right.

1724
01:24:52,191 --> 01:24:53,390
It feels great to see them.

1725
01:24:53,391 --> 01:24:54,960
The Black Horse is obvious.

1726
01:24:54,961 --> 01:24:56,630
- Right.
- The White Monkey is obvious too.

1727
01:24:56,631 --> 01:24:58,701
I think they can just text each other freely.

1728
01:25:07,911 --> 01:25:12,341
(Tonight, the Blue Chicken chose you.)

1729
01:25:20,481 --> 01:25:24,421
(Tonight, the White Dog chose you.)

1730
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:27,531
It did feel a bit strange.

1731
01:25:28,691 --> 01:25:33,401
I did feel flustered,

1732
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:37,340
but it was a sign of interest,

1733
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:40,271
so I did feel grateful about it.

1734
01:25:48,151 --> 01:25:50,380
(Tonight, the Blue Chicken chose you.)

1735
01:25:50,381 --> 01:25:57,361
(Tonight, the Red Rabbit chose you.)

1736
01:25:57,721 --> 01:25:59,420
(Impressed)

1737
01:25:59,421 --> 01:26:02,030
The day when Sang Hyeok gets two votes has finally come.

1738
01:26:02,031 --> 01:26:03,161
Right.

1739
01:26:03,361 --> 01:26:05,231
He didn't get any votes the day before, right?

1740
01:26:05,701 --> 01:26:07,600
He now will know that Kyung Eon...

1741
01:26:07,601 --> 01:26:09,031
- is the Red Rabbit.
- Right.

1742
01:26:12,871 --> 01:26:14,001
Red Rabbit?

1743
01:26:15,611 --> 01:26:17,311
Did I choose the right one?

1744
01:26:18,281 --> 01:26:22,581
The feeling and energy that she has...

1745
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,421
makes me think that Kyung Eon is the Red Rabbit.

1746
01:26:26,821 --> 01:26:29,551
(Red Rabbit, Lee Kyung Eon)

1747
01:26:29,921 --> 01:26:32,491
(During the preselection)

1748
01:26:34,491 --> 01:26:36,061
I should go with the Red Rabbit.

1749
01:26:37,131 --> 01:26:42,501
(Sang Hyeok chose the Red Rabbit as his destined partner.)

1750
01:26:44,471 --> 01:26:46,640
First of all,

1751
01:26:46,641 --> 01:26:49,010
I want to find out more about Kyung Eon.

1752
01:26:49,011 --> 01:26:50,271
For the first time,

1753
01:26:50,741 --> 01:26:53,641
my heart felt excited.

1754
01:26:54,351 --> 01:26:58,751
(His destined partner came to him with excitement.)

1755
01:26:59,451 --> 01:27:04,491
(Yu Ra is ready to sleep.)

1756
01:27:09,361 --> 01:27:13,461
(Tonight, no one chose you in the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

1757
01:27:15,101 --> 01:27:21,171
(The messages from the Gold Dragon and Black Cow have disappeared.)

1758
01:27:22,211 --> 01:27:25,240
Just as if I was on a rollercoaster,

1759
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:28,251
it felt like my emotions went up and down.

1760
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:32,180
I did expect it to happen, though.

1761
01:27:32,181 --> 01:27:34,221
Rather than being disappointed,

1762
01:27:34,851 --> 01:27:37,121
I just realized I couldn't do anything about it.

1763
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:42,031
(Feeling upset)

1764
01:27:42,391 --> 01:27:43,531
Oh, no!

1765
01:27:43,731 --> 01:27:45,300
My gosh.

1766
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:48,470
That's how important a single date is.

1767
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:50,370
Yu Ra got two votes at the start.

1768
01:27:50,371 --> 01:27:52,040
She then didn't get any votes for a couple of days.

1769
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:53,270
She got two votes after that.

1770
01:27:53,271 --> 01:27:54,670
She didn't get any votes again this time.

1771
01:27:54,671 --> 01:27:56,370
- That must be hard.
- It's just like a rollercoaster.

1772
01:27:56,371 --> 01:27:58,610
- Right.
- She couldn't even go on a date.

1773
01:27:58,611 --> 01:28:02,211
(Yu Ra's heart is always filled with concern.)

1774
01:28:04,251 --> 01:28:09,191
(She tries to calm herself down, but it isn't easy to do that.)

1775
01:28:11,221 --> 01:28:14,530
(Yu Gyeong comes into the room.)

1776
01:28:14,531 --> 01:28:16,961
- Are you going to bed?
- I feel like throwing up.

1777
01:28:17,261 --> 01:28:18,730
- What was that?
- I feel like throwing up.

1778
01:28:18,731 --> 01:28:19,901
Should I pat you on the back?

1779
01:28:21,401 --> 01:28:23,201
- Did you turn on the heating pad?
- No.

1780
01:28:23,371 --> 01:28:25,070
You have to turn this on if you feel sick.

1781
01:28:25,071 --> 01:28:26,740
I was going to but forgot.

1782
01:28:26,741 --> 01:28:27,871
I'll turn it on for you.

1783
01:28:29,811 --> 01:28:34,141
Why are you like this on your own when you're sick?

1784
01:28:37,081 --> 01:28:39,550
(She takes care of Yu Ra...)

1785
01:28:39,551 --> 01:28:41,720
(who must have gone through a tough day.)

1786
01:28:41,721 --> 01:28:43,651
It's heartbreaking to see you like this.

1787
01:28:47,891 --> 01:28:49,890
(Yu Ra sheds tears in the end.)

1788
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:51,131
I'll close the door.

1789
01:28:54,031 --> 01:28:55,801
Hold on.

1790
01:28:57,071 --> 01:28:58,671
I didn't turn on the light on purpose.

1791
01:29:02,971 --> 01:29:04,980
You had a lot to think about while being upset,

1792
01:29:04,981 --> 01:29:06,381
and now, you're sick on top of that.

1793
01:29:07,511 --> 01:29:09,411
My gosh.

1794
01:29:11,481 --> 01:29:18,161
(Yu Gyeong tries to comfort Yu Ra's sadness.)

1795
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:22,461
It's too much for you to handle.

1796
01:29:24,601 --> 01:29:28,501
(Patting)

1797
01:29:29,701 --> 01:29:30,901
Should I be with you?

1798
01:29:31,841 --> 01:29:33,601
Or should I give you some time alone?

1799
01:29:35,771 --> 01:29:38,111
- Be with me.
- Okay.

1800
01:29:42,781 --> 01:29:43,981
You should sit.

1801
01:29:46,651 --> 01:29:48,520
(Sighing)

1802
01:29:48,521 --> 01:29:50,391
I can feel your pain.

1803
01:29:52,491 --> 01:29:54,561
We can sense things through our bodies.

1804
01:29:57,701 --> 01:29:59,000
Should I massage your feet?

1805
01:29:59,001 --> 01:30:00,331
No. That's okay.

1806
01:30:07,471 --> 01:30:09,571
- Why massage my feet?
- What was that?

1807
01:30:09,771 --> 01:30:11,681
- Why massage my feet?
- I wanted to massage your feet.

1808
01:30:12,111 --> 01:30:13,740
- It will make you feel better.
- My feet are dirty.

1809
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:15,251
It's okay. My hands are dirtier.

1810
01:30:16,311 --> 01:30:18,251
- I walked around.
- It's okay.

1811
01:30:18,621 --> 01:30:19,721
Put them up here.

1812
01:30:21,551 --> 01:30:22,621
Put them up here.

1813
01:30:24,151 --> 01:30:26,820
(She quietly comforts Yu Ra...)

1814
01:30:26,821 --> 01:30:29,461
(who is physically and mentally exhausted.)

1815
01:30:30,291 --> 01:30:31,531
I don't put on my socks properly.

1816
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:33,131
I can tell.

1817
01:30:33,301 --> 01:30:35,001
How did you put them on?

1818
01:30:36,131 --> 01:30:37,270
Gosh.

1819
01:30:37,271 --> 01:30:42,071
(Yu Gyeong massages her feet while smiling.)

1820
01:30:43,111 --> 01:30:44,311
I'm okay now.

1821
01:30:44,841 --> 01:30:46,411
I just want to do it for you.

1822
01:30:47,981 --> 01:30:49,781
It makes you feel better, right?

1823
01:30:50,881 --> 01:30:53,281
I have the Grandfather of Healing inside of me.

1824
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:55,121
Grandfather of Healing? What is that?

1825
01:30:55,591 --> 01:30:58,161
Grandfather of Healing. I can relieve pain...

1826
01:30:58,261 --> 01:30:59,661
when I touch someone.

1827
01:31:01,891 --> 01:31:03,091
I wanted to relieve your pain.

1828
01:31:05,601 --> 01:31:07,461
I feel better now.

1829
01:31:07,601 --> 01:31:08,700
What was that?

1830
01:31:08,701 --> 01:31:10,931
I feel better thanks to you.

1831
01:31:11,971 --> 01:31:14,741
(Pressing)

1832
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:23,581
(Yu Gyeong comforted Yu Ra for quite a while.)

1833
01:31:25,521 --> 01:31:27,121
She massaged her feet.

1834
01:31:28,221 --> 01:31:30,690
- She's so nice.
- That's amazing of her.

1835
01:31:30,691 --> 01:31:31,890
She really knows how to comfort someone.

1836
01:31:31,891 --> 01:31:32,921
Right.

1837
01:31:33,991 --> 01:31:35,990
So that is how you comfort someone.

1838
01:31:35,991 --> 01:31:39,131
I should also massage someone's feet when they cry.

1839
01:31:39,461 --> 01:31:41,501
Me too. I'll say, "My hands are dirtier."

1840
01:31:51,341 --> 01:31:54,781
(Tonight, the Black Monkey chose you.)

1841
01:31:55,351 --> 01:31:56,451
It felt great.

1842
01:31:56,681 --> 01:31:59,221
It felt great as it seemed like Yu Gyeong picked me.

1843
01:31:59,481 --> 01:32:03,021
I was a bit hesitant and full of thoughts on my own.

1844
01:32:03,491 --> 01:32:06,991
I believe I have made up my mind now.

1845
01:32:07,291 --> 01:32:11,561
I was determined to do my best.

1846
01:32:12,931 --> 01:32:19,201
(Byeong Yeol made a firm decision for the first time.)

1847
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:21,541
(Getting up)

1848
01:32:22,811 --> 01:32:26,541
(Byeong Yeol suddenly leaves him room.)

1849
01:32:27,411 --> 01:32:29,310
May I pay a visit?

1850
01:32:29,311 --> 01:32:31,780
(He came back to Sang Hyeok's room.)

1851
01:32:31,781 --> 01:32:32,850
How was it?

1852
01:32:32,851 --> 01:32:34,151
Did you have a good date?

1853
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:36,350
Well...

1854
01:32:36,351 --> 01:32:39,291
Did things get cleared up for you?

1855
01:32:40,121 --> 01:32:41,961
But Yu Gyeong...

1856
01:32:43,361 --> 01:32:45,361
(Thinking)

1857
01:32:45,761 --> 01:32:46,761
Have you ever felt this way?

1858
01:32:46,762 --> 01:32:49,501
This is another thing that concerns me.

1859
01:32:53,601 --> 01:32:56,511
(Curious)

1860
01:32:57,881 --> 01:32:59,510
I really didn't say this to anyone.

1861
01:32:59,511 --> 01:33:01,481
Can you not tell anyone about this?

1862
01:33:02,651 --> 01:33:05,425
(Thinking)

1863
01:33:07,816 --> 01:33:09,915
I want things to go well.

1864
01:33:09,916 --> 01:33:11,846
Once I'm done with this show,

1865
01:33:13,186 --> 01:33:15,955
I want to be in a good relationship...

1866
01:33:15,956 --> 01:33:17,385
if we do decide to see each other.

1867
01:33:17,386 --> 01:33:19,686
I want to stop ending relationships now.

1868
01:33:21,105 --> 01:33:24,815
(Byeong Yeol's honest heart heard for the first time)

1869
01:33:25,615 --> 01:33:28,145
I've been having that thought for a while.

1870
01:33:31,485 --> 01:33:34,385
(Hesitating)

1871
01:33:35,085 --> 01:33:37,025
She's a shaman.

1872
01:33:39,355 --> 01:33:41,025
That is what concerns you?

1873
01:33:42,995 --> 01:33:44,225
I'm being really honest.

1874
01:33:44,665 --> 01:33:48,205
Right. That definitely would be a concern.

1875
01:33:49,205 --> 01:33:53,535
I've started to develop feelings for her.

1876
01:33:54,235 --> 01:33:57,975
I think I should go through those thoughts...

1877
01:33:58,875 --> 01:34:01,885
after expressing my heart to her first.

1878
01:34:04,815 --> 01:34:09,655
(His concern feels heavier as he develops deeper feelings.)

1879
01:34:11,655 --> 01:34:13,924
It isn't easy to make decisions...

1880
01:34:13,925 --> 01:34:16,194
with Byeong Yeol's character.

1881
01:34:16,195 --> 01:34:19,335
Saying that means he is really determined.

1882
01:34:20,495 --> 01:34:22,135
He looks a lot more lively all of a sudden.

1883
01:34:22,265 --> 01:34:23,765
But coincidentally,

1884
01:34:24,135 --> 01:34:27,374
he's sharing his heart with Sang Hyeok...

1885
01:34:27,375 --> 01:34:30,304
- who is the Gold Dragon.
- You're right.

1886
01:34:30,305 --> 01:34:31,915
That is what's coincidental.

1887
01:34:32,045 --> 01:34:35,245
Yu Gyeong strongly believes...

1888
01:34:35,715 --> 01:34:37,485
that Byeong Yeol is the Gold Dragon.

1889
01:34:37,785 --> 01:34:41,385
He's sharing his heart with the actual Gold Dragon.

1890
01:34:41,885 --> 01:34:46,855
(He shared his heart with Sang Hyeok who has the key of fate.)

1891
01:34:47,895 --> 01:34:49,195
Did you get a message?

1892
01:34:57,765 --> 01:34:59,734
(Tonight, the White Chicken chose you.)

1893
01:34:59,735 --> 01:35:04,344
(Tonight, the Black Cow chose you.)

1894
01:35:04,345 --> 01:35:05,415
No way.

1895
01:35:10,315 --> 01:35:11,855
Is it someone you didn't expect?

1896
01:35:23,465 --> 01:35:25,135
That really surprised me.

1897
01:35:27,595 --> 01:35:32,705
I thought that Byeong Yeol was the Gold Dragon.

1898
01:35:33,175 --> 01:35:34,644
He's the Black Cow?

1899
01:35:34,645 --> 01:35:37,045
That wasn't the animal I thought he was.

1900
01:35:37,575 --> 01:35:38,915
"That can't be true."

1901
01:35:39,275 --> 01:35:40,475
"What went wrong?"

1902
01:35:40,875 --> 01:35:43,285
(During the preselection)

1903
01:35:44,415 --> 01:35:48,284
(Her eyes were drawn...)

1904
01:35:48,285 --> 01:35:51,455
(to the fate plaque of the Gold Dragon.)

1905
01:35:51,825 --> 01:35:53,154
(Gold Dragon?)

1906
01:35:53,155 --> 01:35:54,394
(Interview on the 1st day)

1907
01:35:54,395 --> 01:35:57,825
(I think it's Byeong Yeol.)

1908
01:35:58,335 --> 01:36:00,464
(I think it's Byeong Yeol.)

1909
01:36:00,465 --> 01:36:02,264
(Byeong Yeol)

1910
01:36:02,265 --> 01:36:04,805
(He might be the Gold Dragon.)

1911
01:36:05,035 --> 01:36:06,605
(Byeong Yeol)

1912
01:36:07,405 --> 01:36:09,974
(The Black Cow is Sang Hyeok.)

1913
01:36:09,975 --> 01:36:13,644
(The Gold Dragon...)

1914
01:36:13,645 --> 01:36:15,145
(is Byeong Yeol.)

1915
01:36:15,815 --> 01:36:19,784
(Yu Gyeong's prediction was off.)

1916
01:36:19,785 --> 01:36:24,155
What attracted me to pick him?

1917
01:36:25,155 --> 01:36:26,455
I was curious about that.

1918
01:36:26,895 --> 01:36:29,125
It was a bit disappointing.

1919
01:36:29,795 --> 01:36:32,094
(Yu Gyeong's words sound significant.)

1920
01:36:32,095 --> 01:36:33,735
There was nothing wrong done to her,

1921
01:36:34,335 --> 01:36:35,904
but she was greatly disappointed.

1922
01:36:35,905 --> 01:36:37,305
She must've been disappointed in herself.

1923
01:36:37,665 --> 01:36:40,275
So that must be really important to her.

1924
01:36:40,505 --> 01:36:43,104
- She seemed greatly disappointed.
- Right.

1925
01:36:43,105 --> 01:36:44,545
I think things can change.

1926
01:36:45,345 --> 01:36:46,374
Don't you think so?

1927
01:36:46,375 --> 01:36:48,884
I didn't think that things could change.

1928
01:36:48,885 --> 01:36:50,284
I'm so curious about how things...

1929
01:36:50,285 --> 01:36:51,715
- will turn out.
- She can't break down from that.

1930
01:36:51,855 --> 01:36:54,014
- It's all based on fate.
- Fate.

1931
01:36:54,015 --> 01:36:58,755
She is someone who is greatly influenced by fate.

1932
01:36:59,095 --> 01:37:01,124
She might find it hard to open up her heart...

1933
01:37:01,125 --> 01:37:03,125
to a love that wasn't permitted by the divine spirit.

1934
01:37:03,725 --> 01:37:05,365
That would definitely concern her.

1935
01:37:05,735 --> 01:37:07,535
Gosh. How will things turn out?

1936
01:37:16,045 --> 01:37:20,145
(Tonight, the Gold Dragon chose you.)

1937
01:37:21,885 --> 01:37:25,015
It was someone I didn't expect at all.

1938
01:37:25,585 --> 01:37:26,985
- It was unexpected?
- Right.

1939
01:37:29,525 --> 01:37:30,984
- I'm having a mental breakdown.
- What?

1940
01:37:30,985 --> 01:37:32,155
I'm having a mental breakdown.

1941
01:37:34,295 --> 01:37:39,135
(Yu Gyeong finally realized the divine spirit's decision.)

1942
01:37:39,395 --> 01:37:42,605
(Byeong Yeol whom she is developing feelings for)

1943
01:37:42,835 --> 01:37:45,975
(Sang Hyeok whom the divine spirit chose)

1944
01:37:47,035 --> 01:37:52,675
(The Red Rabbit that is the destined partner of these two)

1945
01:37:53,015 --> 01:37:56,415
(The whirlwind of fate is starting to affect Yu Gyeong.)

1946
01:38:19,535 --> 01:38:21,205
(Sighing)

1947
01:38:24,275 --> 01:38:25,875
(Sighing)

1948
01:38:27,545 --> 01:38:29,085
(Sighing)

1949
01:38:35,855 --> 01:38:37,725
(Sighing)

1950
01:38:41,595 --> 01:38:45,095
(Possessed Love S2)

1951
01:38:45,295 --> 01:38:47,094
(The secret date request of the men)

1952
01:38:47,095 --> 01:38:48,934
(I have to make things happen.)

1953
01:38:48,935 --> 01:38:50,804
(The fortune tellers take away and get taken away.)

1954
01:38:50,805 --> 01:38:52,574
(I don't want to leave regrets or miss my chance.)

1955
01:38:52,575 --> 01:38:54,474
(The fate that pulls each other together...)

1956
01:38:54,475 --> 01:38:56,205
(and hearts that keep getting shaken)

1957
01:38:56,505 --> 01:38:58,144
(I want to focus on you.)

1958
01:38:58,145 --> 01:39:00,014
(The string of fate cannot be avoided.)

1959
01:39:00,015 --> 01:39:01,015
(- What did you do? - Guess what I did.)

1960
01:39:01,016 --> 01:39:02,714
(It's not something I feel pleasant about.)

1961
01:39:02,715 --> 01:39:03,814
(Do I have to guess?)

1962
01:39:03,815 --> 01:39:04,884
(Why are you following me?)

1963
01:39:04,885 --> 01:39:06,855
(I want to see Ho Am.)

1964
01:39:07,485 --> 01:39:10,154
(The owner of the fate plaque you chose will be revealed.)

1965
01:39:10,155 --> 01:39:11,155
(I don't want this to happen.)

1966
01:39:12,295 --> 01:39:15,859
(Possessed Love S2)
