1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,810
(All statements related
to shamanism and fortune-telling...)

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:03,980
(made by the cast
in this program...)

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,040
(are purely personal opinions.)

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,950
Is Yu Gyeong here?

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,650
- Yu Gyeong?
- I couldn't see her today.

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,850
- You couldn't?
- No.

7
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:17,720
Where did you lose her?

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,560
- Where did she go?
- "Where did you lose her?"

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,660
Where did Yu Gyeong go?

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,060
I guess more than one man chose her.

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,200
She said she was heading out
in the afternoon.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,670
- Really?
- Right.

13
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,600
She must've had a date
with one person in the morning...

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,340
and another date in the afternoon.

15
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,540
Is that possible?

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,350
(Fortune Tellers' Love 2)

17
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,050
(Comedian Shin Dong Yeob,
Actress Yoo In Na)

18
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,060
This is a type of situation...

19
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,830
that you'll never be able to find...

20
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,130
- in other dating shows.
- Right.

21
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,370
The owners of the fate plaques
will finally be revealed today.

22
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,600
They're fortune tellers,

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,940
so I have a feeling
there will be turmoil.

25
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,010
I'm especially curious
to find out...

26
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,180
how Yu Gyeong will change her mind.

27
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,450
So far, she's been doing well
with Byeong Yeol.

28
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,750
They're in a good place right now.

29
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,980
But at this moment,

30
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,120
the fate plaques will be revealed.

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,760
- Right.
- That's why Yu Gyeong said...

32
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,320
- that she'd rather not know.
- Exactly.

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,830
On the first day,
I clearly remember...

34
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,060
Yu Gyeong saying that
she wants to be matched...

35
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,430
with the person
picked by her divine spirit.

36
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,600
- Yes.
- She said that.

37
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,770
She was determined to do so.

38
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,040
They say that parents are powerless
against their children's wishes.

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,470
But now I realize...

40
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,410
that shamans are powerless
against their spirits' wishes.

41
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,610
So,

42
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,210
- That's true.
- she may choose the person...

43
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,410
chosen by her divine spirit.

44
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,880
Nobody knows how this will go.

45
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,080
This is getting very interesting.

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,420
Let's find out what will happen.

47
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,550
I wonder how it will go.

48
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,490
(The night
of the fate plaque reveal)

49
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,630
(Ra Yun is the first one to go
and check the fate plaque.)

50
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,170
(Sighing)

51
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,240
Oh, there's nothing.

52
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,140
(The name plaques are gone.)

53
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,040
There's nothing here. This is bad.

54
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,720
(Nervous)

55
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,260
It's time to check the owner
of your fate plaque.

56
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,960
Please insert the fate plaque
that you have chosen.

57
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,960
The time has come.

58
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,500
(White Monkey)

59
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:58,850
(It's time to see
who her destined partner is.)

60
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,820
(Who is the White Monkey?)

61
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,700
(Startled)

62
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,500
(Lee Ra Yun chose
Lee Gang Won's fate plaque.)

63
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,630
What is this?

64
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,700
I knew it!

65
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,350
(Hyeon U is
also at the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

66
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,230
(Blue Chicken)

67
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,170
(Who's the Blue Chicken
that his divine spirit chose?)

68
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,020
(Laughing)

69
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,120
(He burst out laughing
as soon as saw it.)

70
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,460
(Jung Hyeon U chose
Hong Yu Ra's fate plaque.)

71
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,400
(He did not expect her
to be his destined partner.)

72
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,100
- He's dumbfounded.
- Yes.

73
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,570
Wouldn't it feel different
after finding out who it is?

74
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,870
- Definitely.
- I bet it feels different.

75
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,010
(It's so funny.)

76
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,810
(Flustered)

77
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,250
It was someone whom I had
never gone on a date with.

78
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,320
Hong Yu Ra.

79
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,020
I actually...

80
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,660
talked to Yu Ra earlier.

81
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,190
I feel like I chose you.

82
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,790
I suddenly got a feeling.

83
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,990
You chose me?

84
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,800
(What?)

85
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,630
- You think you chose me?
- I feel like I did.

86
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,000
- Really? That'd be hilarious.
- It'd be so funny.

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,370
We've been looking at everyone
but each other.

88
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,940
(They joked about it
before checking the plaques.)

89
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,010
(Dumbfounded)

90
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,310
I hate this program so much
right now.

91
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,110
I'm so embarrassed.

92
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,720
(He returned in shock.)

93
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,190
(Trudging)

94
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,490
- Is it over?
- Yes.

95
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,830
Why do you get skinnier every day?

96
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,560
(Peeking)

97
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,130
It looks like
you were drained out there.

98
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,470
Someone must be stealing his energy.

99
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,540
Were you startled?

100
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,200
I'm so startled.

101
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,010
I hate this show.

102
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,170
(Giggling)

103
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,240
I wonder what happened.

104
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,580
(This is too harsh
for this rookie shaman.)

105
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,350
(Sniffling)

106
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,150
(Next, Yu Ra came
to the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

107
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,690
I actually...

108
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,760
kind of knew, even before I entered.

109
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,600
(Black Cow)

110
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,240
(Hong Yu Ra chose
Ha Byeong Yeol's fate plaque.)

111
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,820
I simply chose him
because I preferred men...

112
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,620
with the Day Master of water.

113
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,050
He had the saju information...

114
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,520
that I preferred.

115
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,630
I think it's a shame.

116
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,930
(Byeong Yeol also arrived
at the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

117
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,830
(Red Rabbit)

118
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:44,240
(He cautiously checks
who the plaque belongs to.)

119
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,780
(Nervous and anxious)

120
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:56,090
(Who is the Red Rabbit?)

121
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:07,200
(Ha Byeong Yeol chose
Lee Kyung Eon's fate plaque.)

122
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:12,170
(He's clearly flustered.)

123
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,770
Oh, no, Byeong Yeol.

124
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,840
He's very good at
telling people's saju...

125
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,440
- Right.
- from their faces.

126
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,210
- But he didn't know?
- Right.

127
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,950
He'll have to go
and lie down on the bed now.

128
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,380
I guess
he can't really read his saju.

129
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,380
(Fortune tellers can't tell
their own fate.)

130
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,720
He correctly guessed the Day Masters
of the entire production crew.

131
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
- I know!
- You're right.

132
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,090
(Flustered)

133
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,090
I never saw it coming.

134
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,700
I thought I correctly read the saju
and knew who it was.

135
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,570
I assumed that Ra Yun was...

136
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,300
the Red Rabbit.

137
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,110
I must have been overconfident.

138
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,040
That was what came to my mind.

139
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,880
But my feelings for Kyung Eon
hadn't changed...

140
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,350
even when I found out
who it belonged to.

141
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,790
(Exclaiming)

142
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,200
(He left the Hall of Sacred Spirits,
completely drained, once again.)

143
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:31,320
(Two men who chose the Red Rabbit)

144
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,950
(Nervous)

145
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,790
(Red Rabbit)

146
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,660
(At last, it's time to see
who his fated partner is.)

147
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,730
(Nervous)

148
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,070
(Lee Kyung Eon)

149
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,070
(Shaking his head)

150
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,610
(Lee Gang Won chose
Lee Kyung Eon's fate plaque.)

151
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,350
(Yun Sang Hyeok chose
Lee Kyung Eon's fate plaque.)

152
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,490
- He's so happy.
- I wonder what that feels like.

153
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,600
Right?

154
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,070
Things are going very smoothly
between Sang Hyeok and Kyung Eon.

155
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,170
If it were me, I would have been
convinced we were destined.

156
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,640
- Even more so.
- That's right.

157
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,140
- You'd confirm the love.
- Yes.

158
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,170
- Their fate and feelings matched.
- Yes.

159
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,370
I'm so happy for them.

160
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,680
(Excited)

161
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,710
Sure enough,

162
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,020
Kyung Eon turned out to be
the Red Rabbit.

163
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,320
My fate must have led me...

164
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,320
to her.

165
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,560
The cards have told me...

166
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,360
that it was her,

167
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
and it was actually going that way
in real life.

168
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,570
That was very fascinating.

169
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,840
(Kyung Eon arrived
at the Hall of Sacred Spirits.)

170
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,810
Should I call it my privilege?

171
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,880
The crew let me see it beforehand.

172
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,850
So, I knew who it was.

173
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,120
(Blue Chicken)

174
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,520
(Lee Kyung Eon chose
Jung Hyeon U's fate plaque.)

175
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,220
(Gold Dragon)

176
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,830
All right.

177
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,460
(Kim Yun Jeong chose
Yun Sang Hyeok's fate plaque.)

178
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,730
Oh, right.

179
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,430
(Kim Yun Jeong chose
Yun Sang Hyeok's fate plaque.)

180
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,800
(She finally realized
her destined partner...)

181
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,270
(that she's been looking
everywhere for.)

182
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,940
I don't think the plaque matters
at this point.

183
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,150
He wasn't the Leo I had in mind.

184
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,890
And I've set my mind on Ho Am,

185
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,620
so I think it's fair
that I keep going with it.

186
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,790
I think I'll follow my heart.

187
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,290
Yes, I'll follow my emotions.

188
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,500
There you go.

189
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,100
She's going straight to him.

190
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,500
- How admirable.
- Good choice.

191
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,830
She's right.

192
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,440
- That's pure love.
- Right.

193
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,170
(Meanwhile, Ho Am is
looking at something.)

194
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,840
(Concentrating)

195
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,480
(He's staring at the photos
that he took with Yu Gyeong.)

196
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,690
Every time, I honestly told
Yu Gyeong how I felt about her,

197
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,490
and I'd say I often expressed
my feelings.

198
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,490
I hope to build...

199
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,230
a good connection with her.

200
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,930
(He can check his connection
with Yu Gyeong now.)

201
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,670
(Black Monkey)

202
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,340
(Black Monkey, November 16, 1999)

203
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,080
I assumed it was her,

204
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,580
but I had a slight doubt in my mind.

205
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:58,920
(Even Ho Am, who was convinced,
is nervous at this moment.)

206
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,600
(Chae Yu Gyeong)

207
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,170
(Jang Ho Am chose
Chae Yu Gyeong's fate plaque.)

208
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,410
As expected, it was Yu Gyeong.

209
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,380
I thought, "I was right."

210
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,180
My feelings for her were
originally big, but they grew.

211
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,450
The fact...

212
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,350
that I was actually charmed
to the person...

213
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,090
who owned the fate plaque I chose...

214
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,420
made me hopeful
and my heart swell with excitement.

215
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,260
- Goodness.
- Oh, no.

216
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,900
- He was right.
- Oh, no.

217
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,400
I can't watch this!

218
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,230
"As expected, it was Yu Gyeong."

219
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,970
- He's going to be deeply scarred.
- Indeed.

220
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,140
- I know.
- Poor him.

221
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,240
I know!

222
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,470
He said his heart swelled
with excitement.

223
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,440
"Swelled."

224
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,940
(At that moment)

225
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,880
I should eat.

226
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,480
We have two days left.
Tomorrow and the day after that.

227
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,350
I'm starting to realize
that this is coming to an end.

228
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,420
What do you think we'll do tomorrow?

229
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,490
- I wonder.
- Right.

230
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,630
It will probably be the last date
tomorrow.

231
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,300
Will there be a date?

232
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,400
I believe so.

233
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,570
Because the date tomorrow
can be crucial.

234
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,610
We might be disappointed
without one.

235
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,610
But I want to know
how they'll make us choose.

236
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,150
What's your opinion?

237
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,520
Me? If I had to go
on a date with a new person?

238
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,490
Who's left?
You've been on so many dates.

239
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,420
- Do you only have one left?
- No.

240
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,220
I didn't go on that many dates.

241
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,390
You went with Hyeon U.

242
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,790
Didn't you go on a date
with Gang Won?

243
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,890
I don't want to.

244
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,500
- Gang Won...
- Gang Won and who else?

245
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,230
- Sang Hyeok?
- Yes.

246
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,600
He's handsome, though.

247
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,200
(Pondering)

248
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,940
I remember saying
that he and I are alike.

249
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,480
I think I'll ask him that...

250
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,350
if I go on a date with him.

251
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,680
"Did Yeol say anything else?"

252
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,490
"Is there anything
you want to tell me?"

253
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,590
(She subtly hinted that she'd go
on a date with Sang Hyeok.)

254
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,720
- Why?
- Why?

255
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,030
- What?
- Why?

256
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,290
Are you asking
why I'll ask him that?

257
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,960
What did you mean by "why?"

258
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,170
Nothing.

259
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,740
(Thinking)

260
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,670
But I don't think...

261
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,840
you two are close enough
to know that.

262
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,080
(Flustered)

263
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,250
The two of you, I mean.

264
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,020
- Gang Won and I are close.
- No, I mean you and Sang Hyeok.

265
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,090
- Sang Hyeok?
- Yes.

266
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,690
I find him neither uncomfortable
nor comfortable.

267
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,820
I'm being honest.

268
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,390
I can feel comfortable around him
like I am with Hyeon U.

269
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,760
But I don't think I can handle him.

270
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,800
- Who?
- I can't handle Gang Won.

271
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,030
Gang Won?

272
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,110
(He's deep in thought
after listening to her.)

273
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:11,220
(What's on Yu Gyeong's mind
at the moment?)

274
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,890
(Yu Gyeong is the last one to leave
to check the fate plaque.)

275
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,630
I'd rather not know who it is.

276
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,640
I honestly don't want to know
who it is.

277
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,810
(Gold Dragon)

278
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,250
(Nervous)

279
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,290
(Who's her fated partner
chosen by the divine spirit?)

280
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,770
(Shutting her eyes)

281
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,540
(Chae Yu Gyeong chose
Yun Sang Hyeok's fate plaque.)

282
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,980
I was quite disappointed...

283
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,020
because I was certainly drawn
to Byeong Yeol.

284
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,120
But I had chosen the Gold Dragon.

285
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,090
I wondered...

286
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,100
what fascinated me to pick him.

287
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,260
(During the preselection)

288
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,370
When I first went
to the Hall of Sacred Spirits,

289
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,270
I saw the Black Cow.

290
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,280
(She checked her connection
with the Black Cow, Byeong Yeol.)

291
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,080
We were completely incompatible.

292
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,710
I drew the flags multiple times,

293
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,980
but I was repeatedly faced
with a bad energy.

294
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,420
But in the Gold Dragon's case...

295
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,970
I kept getting good energy from him.

296
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,110
(She picked the Gold Dragon,
as her spirit wished.)

297
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,620
I told myself
that it was a clear connection...

298
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,290
chosen by the divine spirit.

299
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,630
Whether it was a spiritual message
or it came from my heart,

300
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,800
I ended up choosing the Gold Dragon,

301
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,430
so I had some questions.

302
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,870
This is getting complicated.

303
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,110
She's having a mental breakdown.

304
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,810
But Sang Hyeok and Kyung Eon are...

305
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,980
- Yes.
- hitting it off so well.

306
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,310
- Right. In the garden.
- That's true.

307
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,780
That's why they chose each other.

308
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,610
I find it hard to believe
that she can come between them.

309
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,820
That's true. But when you weren't
even interested in the man...

310
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,990
and things were going well for him
with another woman,

311
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,120
and you find out that he was
your husband in the previous life,

312
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,190
you'd start to see him
in a different light.

313
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,660
It must have made her want to
at least talk to him...

314
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,660
- before getting to the end.
- Exactly.

315
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,530
(Frustrated)

316
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,400
(All 10 fortune tellers have seen
who the fate plaques belonged to.)

317
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,270
She's back. Yu Gyeong!

318
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,570
Where have you been?

319
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,810
What?

320
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,010
Join us.

321
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,980
Yu Gyeong,
let's have a late-night meal.

322
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,950
(Peeking)

323
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,750
- What's wrong with you?
- I think I'm sick.

324
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,750
I see.

325
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,720
(Staring)

326
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,660
Can I just go upstairs
without eating?

327
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,390
What? I'm sorry?

328
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,330
- What did you say?
- Can I just go upstairs?

329
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,400
Of course.

330
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
(She leaves Byeong Yeol behind
in the kitchen.)

331
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,230
- Do you need some rest?
- Yes.

332
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,240
Okay.

333
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,070
(Worried)

334
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,970
Can I join you?

335
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,580
- Did you catch a cold?
- Yes.

336
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,980
- You checked the plaque, right?
- Yes.

337
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,780
- I like my outcome.
- Do you?

338
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,120
- Yes.
- Did you check yours?

339
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,880
- I did.
- Why are you smiling so much?

340
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,590
Was it someone you were expecting?

341
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,820
Yes, it was.

342
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,590
Really?

343
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,090
I was convinced.

344
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,190
I didn't know who it was,
but I knew I'd pick her in the end.

345
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,730
- What's wrong?
- Not me.

346
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,570
(Worried)

347
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,040
- Are you shocked?
- I'm not just shocked.

348
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,600
- It was someone I didn't want.
- You didn't want him?

349
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,910
No, I didn't.

350
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
I'm going upstairs.

351
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,950
You don't want the spicy noodles?

352
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,220
(Things have gotten complicated
since she checked the plaque.)

353
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,490
(They're in distress tonight
before their destiny.)

354
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,060
Do you want to play
with tarot cards with me?

355
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
Tarot cards?

356
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,870
I didn't know
you could shuffle them that way.

357
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,040
(Yu Gyeong comes to the living room
at that moment.)

358
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,810
(Byeong Yeol also takes a seat.)

359
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,240
You need to get rid of the cat hair.

360
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,280
- Right.
- If you want to...

361
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,350
(Glancing)

362
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,380
These are the cards.

363
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,780
I have a question.

364
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,050
About how tomorrow will go.

365
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,260
How you'll feel tomorrow?

366
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,120
(Yu Gyeong asks
how things will go tomorrow.)

367
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,300
This one.

368
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,800
The second card from the end.

369
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,070
(She discreetly picks her cards.)

370
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,100
What?

371
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:34,970
Hang on.

372
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,510
This looks...

373
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,280
like a man is...

374
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,080
approaching you.

375
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,780
(Looking)

376
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,920
But this one is a bit...

377
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,720
- It's a thief.
- Yes.

378
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,790
- A thief?
- It's a thief.

379
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,790
Yes.

380
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,500
This one tells me...

381
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,900
(What's the meaning
of the thief card?)

382
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,300
that you're looking back
as you're not certain...

383
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,330
about how you feel.

384
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,300
You're not that certain yet.

385
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:11,940
(Surprised)

386
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,010
(It sounds
like a meaningful reading.)

387
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,710
What's going to happen?

388
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,380
Will she be attracted
to the new man...

389
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,650
while she keeps looking back
at the previous man?

390
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,720
This is so...

391
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,450
How is Yu Ra so...

392
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,920
She's so good.

393
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,790
It put Byeong Yeol in a bad mood.

394
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,890
Oh, no.

395
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,700
(Yu Gyeong is no longer certain,)

396
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,630
(and Byeong Yeol is looking at her.)

397
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,800
I don't think...

398
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,710
it's 100 percent.

399
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,210
She looks like the type of person
who gets her ideas...

400
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,110
after considering
many different situations.

401
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,150
So, I'm a bit concerned,
to be frank.

402
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,450
I did my best not to show it...

403
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,750
and to act cool about it.

404
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,190
When I checked the fate plaque,

405
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,760
I found out it was Sang Hyeok.

406
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,160
I realized that I might be...

407
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,630
attracted to him
and have a change of heart...

408
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,970
if I had a deep conversation
with him.

409
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,670
So, I was constantly worried.

410
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,070
(He gets more anxious...)

411
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,910
(as he can't tell
what will happen tomorrow.)

412
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,110
How is everyone feeling?

413
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,320
Bad.

414
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,120
(Surprised)

415
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,450
Was I too blatant?

416
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,920
Don't you feel irritated today?

417
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,160
I'm constantly irritated.

418
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,930
I don't know why. I'm just angry.

419
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,260
- I get you.
- Right?

420
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,200
I enjoyed the date,

421
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,170
but looking at Byeong Yeol
makes me angry.

422
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,600
- Looking at Byeong Yeol?
- Yes.

423
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,700
In terms of divine spirits.
I don't know why I'm so annoyed.

424
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,140
(Yu Gyeong seems different
from usual.)

425
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,380
- Why is that?
- I don't know. It's just...

426
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,050
I feel like
I'm having a change of heart.

427
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,350
(Startled)

428
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,550
- What?
- What?

429
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,320
Yu Gyeong has never acted
that way before.

430
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,330
She doesn't look like Yu Gyeong.

431
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,090
- She's angry in terms of spirits?
- I wonder what she means.

432
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,230
It can be very different
from how normal people react.

433
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,800
When shamans sense a change
in the situation...

434
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,440
I mean, when they connect
with their divine spirits,

435
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,470
some of them tend to feel...

436
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,210
what their spirits are feeling
instead of what they feel.

437
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,210
That's what's making her miserable,

438
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,980
and there's a conflict in her heart.
There must be a lot on her mind.

439
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,780
That's so interesting.

440
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,980
(Yu Gyeong can't help but feel
her spirit's emotions.)

441
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,120
Oh, my gosh.

442
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:39,690
(The night continues
with their emotions in turmoil.)

443
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,630
(Moments later)

444
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:48,700
(The crew gathered
the fortune tellers.)

445
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,870
We have an announcement for you.

446
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,840
Gang Won violated one of our rules,

447
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,540
- so he's been kicked out.
- Gang Won?

448
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,410
Yes. He had reasons
preventing him from joining us.

449
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,110
We found out about it,

450
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,010
so he's been kicked out.

451
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:12,590
(Gang Won leaves the Possessed House
for breaching the rules.)

452
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,960
I must leave the program
for breaking a rule.

453
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,100
It's my fault that I'm leaving.

454
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,730
I apologize
for not telling you the truth.

455
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,840
I'd like to apologize...

456
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,070
to all the other participants...

457
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,470
and the production crew. I'm sorry.

458
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:40,850
(And Gang Won suddenly left
the house.)

459
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,820
- He's gone?
- Yes.

460
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,930
Ra Yun must be so sad.

461
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,770
She seemed sad when she just left.

462
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,210
(Sighing)

463
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,690
(Sighing)

464
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:24,090
(It's all too sudden for Ra Yun.)

465
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,940
Gang Won ended up
leaving the program,

466
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,170
so I was flustered.

467
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,940
Nonetheless,

468
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,550
I was drawn to him,

469
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,420
so it broke my heart.

470
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,520
I also cried a lot.

471
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,120
I'm sure I'll be fine with time.

472
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,830
One day, I'll look past it,
thinking, "That happened."

473
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,100
I'm quietly accepting
this whole situation.

474
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,070
(The confusing night passed,)

475
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,000
(and there's 1 day left
until the final selection.)

476
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,310
(Where do the fortune tellers
stand romantically?)

477
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:15,280
(Byeong Yeol is cooking
this morning.)

478
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,320
(Chopping)

479
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,990
- I was so surprised.
- Did you see that?

480
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,460
(Fascinated)

481
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,330
(Byeong Yeol shows off
his magical knife skills.)

482
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,130
- You're good at this.
- I'm trying to look cool.

483
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,800
The guys cooked for us.

484
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,230
- That looks good.
- What's that?

485
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,570
(Stopping)

486
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,800
(Making a peace sign)

487
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,580
(Hyeon U is taking pictures
with a camera.)

488
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,510
The film roll wasn't in it.

489
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,180
Nothing was in it.

490
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,450
- Did you run out of it?
- I took one, but nothing was in it.

491
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,550
- You two should take one together.
- Together?

492
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,260
(Shy)

493
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,030
Wait. I should have stepped back.

494
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,100
- Your face might be in trouble.
- Why?

495
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,700
His face is going to look so small
in the picture.

496
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,330
Right. Mine will look big like this.

497
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,170
Should I take
another picture of you?

498
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,200
Pretend to cook or something.

499
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,300
- I should pretend to cook?
- Yes.

500
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,240
I think you should put that down.

501
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,110
It's so obvious it's an act.

502
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,610
She said it was clearly an act.

503
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,980
(Ho Am is too focused on the act.)

504
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,250
You know what he did?
The cutting board was up in the air.

505
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,690
And he pretended to chop it. Who...

506
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,490
How I feel about Ho Am?

507
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,790
I'm really curious about him.

508
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,230
I think I want to stay by his side.

509
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,360
I want to keep staying by his side.

510
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,760
I'm happy when I'm next to him.

511
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,100
(Yun Jeong comes back to the room
by herself for a moment.)

512
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,440
(Staring)

513
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,210
(She looks at the picture
she took with Ho Am.)

514
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,240
(Cheering)

515
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,080
(A picture with Ho Am
puts her in a good mood.)

516
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,420
(Spotting)

517
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,790
I should put this on.

518
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,490
(She wears Ho Am's medal
from a fencing competition.)

519
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,300
(Stepping back)

520
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:22,070
(Yun Jeong's eyes are glued
to the mirror.)

521
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,670
(Finding her cute)

522
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,380
I can totally feel that...

523
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,080
- Yes. Totally. Oh, my.
- she really likes him.

524
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,010
Ho Am should walk in
and see that right now.

525
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,010
- Right.
- Yes.

526
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:34,920
She put on the medal
so many times already.

527
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,690
- Her feelings are serious, right?
- Definitely. Yes.

528
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:46,460
(Her heart is brimming
with romantic feelings for Ho Am.)

529
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,680
(Trembling)

530
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,610
(Nervous)

531
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,820
(Startled)

532
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,120
Today, you will go on
the Fate Plaque Date.

533
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,560
Ladies, get ready to go on a date
with the man whose fate plaque...

534
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,660
you chose.

535
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,700
(Smiling)

536
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,740
(The ladies will go on a date
with the man of the fate plaque.)

537
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,570
- This must be their last date then.
- My gosh.

538
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,840
- Yes. It's their last date.
- That's right.

539
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,910
But their last date will be
the Fate Plaque Date.

540
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,510
So Yu Gyeong must be having...

541
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,310
a lot of complicated feelings.

542
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,310
- Yu Gyeong is a shaman.
- Yes.

543
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,850
She's bound to place importance
on the man...

544
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,820
her divine spirit has chosen.

545
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,590
- I see.
- So today may be...

546
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,460
an important turning point for her.

547
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,630
I wonder what kind of result...

548
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,560
a date with her destined partner
will bring.

549
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,900
We might see an unexpected result
after this date.

550
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,500
Gosh, this will be interesting.

551
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,740
Gosh, it's the Fate Plaque Date.

552
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,840
Then their selections
could have overlapped.

553
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,870
- Right.
- Some of us might remain here.

554
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,540
Some people might go on two dates
like yesterday.

555
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,410
Right. That's possible.
Some might go on two dates.

556
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,480
What an eventful day it is.

557
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,820
(Sighing)

558
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:20,690
I was hoping to spend time
with Yu Gyeong once again.

559
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,560
I really wanted to
go on a date with her.

560
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,330
But I'm starting to think that...

561
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,730
Yu Gyeong might not have chosen
my fate plaque.

562
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,240
There's a high chance
that it wasn't mine.

563
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,370
So I'm quite disappointed
about that.

564
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,010
I was like, "At last, it's time."

565
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:43,280
"The day I wasn't looking forward to
has come."

566
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,580
After checking the fate plaque,

567
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,720
I didn't want to go on any date.

568
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,620
It was the date I wished to avoid.

569
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,860
It was also the conversation
I wished to avoid.

570
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,630
Honestly,
I was worried and quite scared.

571
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:04,800
(Yu Gyeong is confused
between her fate and her feelings.)

572
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,570
(As his feelings grow,
Byeong Yeol becomes more anxious.)

573
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,040
So it's the Fate Plaque Date.

574
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
This is no joke.

575
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,080
(What kind of change...)

576
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,350
(will the group
of fortune tellers face?)

577
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,730
(Byeong Yeol is waiting
for his date.)

578
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,260
(A car pulls in slowly.)

579
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,430
(Staring)

580
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,070
(It stops in front of Byeong Yeol.)

581
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,110
(Anticipating)

582
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,380
(Grunting)

583
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,420
(Smiling brightly)

584
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

585
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,320
(Fate Plaque Date:
Hong Yu Ra and Ha Byeong Yeol)

586
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,620
This is cool.

587
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,920
- This is fun.
- Yes.

588
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:07,900
(They had each other
for their first date on the show.)

589
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,730
You must have known it'd be me.

590
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,240
Yes, I knew
whose fate plaque I had chosen.

591
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,270
Did you know it was me
from the beginning?

592
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,510
From the beginning?

593
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,840
- My first hunch about you...
- Yes.

594
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,880
was right.

595
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,910
- Your first hunch?
- Yes.

596
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,310
(Byeong Yeol has the water energy.)

597
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,650
- Did you know it would be me?
- Then...

598
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,220
- What? I had no idea.
- Did you...

599
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,420
- Really?
- Yes.

600
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,420
- Not at all?
- Not at all.

601
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,460
(He ends up
with an unexpected date.)

602
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,960
Remember the cards we saw yesterday?

603
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,690
- The tarot cards? Yes.
- Yes.

604
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,000
The card I remember is...

605
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,130
- The Tower.
- I see. The Tower.

606
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,440
It represents
an unexpected situation.

607
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,770
- And I really didn't expect this.
- Really?

608
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,710
- What didn't you expect?
- That I would go on a date...

609
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,840
with the man whose fate plaque...

610
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,010
- I see.
- I chose.

611
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,280
(They didn't see
today's date coming.)

612
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,150
But it wasn't a bad card
or anything.

613
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,150
It just meant that
something unexpected could happen.

614
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,590
I didn't know
we'd go on another date.

615
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,990
I see. Same here.

616
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,730
- How unexpected.
- Yes.

617
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,500
My card reading said
it would go well for me.

618
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,870
- But I had to brace myself...
- I see.

619
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,770
- because my partner...
- Yes.

620
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,270
wouldn't lack anything.

621
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,510
- She'd be fine on her own.
- Right.

622
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,640
- That's right.
- Yes.

623
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,780
(Last night)

624
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,620
- I'm getting a good vibe from it.
- Yes.

625
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,820
But...

626
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,390
you might get hurt.

627
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,790
- I might get hurt?
- Yes.

628
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,220
This could symbolize your lady.

629
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,290
What does the card mean?

630
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,090
This card means...

631
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:47,960
she wouldn't have a problem
being on her own.

632
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,370
Materialistically or mentally,
she's already...

633
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:55,070
- fulfilled.
- I see.

634
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,470
- So...
- She doesn't need anything.

635
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,980
Right. That could be the dynamic.

636
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,580
- This might end up hurting you.
- I could get hurt from that.

637
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:08,120
In relationships,
couples are expected...

638
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
to complement
each other's weaknesses.

639
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,560
"She's the one.
I'm with the right person."

640
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,520
I used to think that...

641
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,090
this was what relationships
were supposed to be.

642
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,100
But you touched on that subject
when you were reading my cards.

643
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,570
- How fascinating.
- Yes, it was fascinating.

644
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,540
- There are so many cars here.
- Right.

645
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,170
I guess they're all exiting.

646
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,870
I must be careful. I drew The Tower.

647
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,640
What? You must be careful?
Because of the tarot card?

648
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,010
I drew The Tower.

649
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,180
The Tower. Okay.

650
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,250
- You must be a good assistant.
- I got it.

651
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:45,150
(Suddenly getting nervous)

652
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,490
(Glancing)

653
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,160
- Are you nervous?
- Gosh, no.

654
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,330
- No?
- No.

655
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,400
(Biting his lips)

656
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,330
(Utterly nervous)

657
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:57,770
(Will the two saju readers be able
to finish the date unharmed?)

658
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:03,070
(A tranquil hanok cafe
in the heart of the city)

659
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,270
- Hello.
- My gosh.

660
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,210
(Gasping)

661
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,450
(Truly surprised)

662
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:10,980
- Hello.
- Hello.

663
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,650
(Fate Plaque Date:
Lee Kyung Eon and Jung Hyeon U)

664
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,820
- This way.
- Here?

665
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,880
Yes.

666
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,290
Did you have to wait a long time?

667
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,120
- No, I didn't have to wait long.
- You didn't?

668
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,760
- It wasn't a long wait.
- I see.

669
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
No.

670
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,030
Gosh, this is beautiful.

671
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,130
- The ambiance here is amazing.
- Right?

672
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,030
- Yes.
- I picked this place.

673
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,130
- Really?
- Yes.

674
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,130
(Intrigued)

675
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,670
I love checking out
interior designs like this.

676
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:36,940
(A teahouse with a sentimental vibe)

677
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,110
I remembered that you liked tea.

678
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,110
- Yes, I did.
- Right? Yes.

679
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,940
- I can't drink coffee.
- Right.

680
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,250
The vibe here is great.

681
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,950
Did you not expect to see me?

682
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,550
No, I didn't think it'd be you.

683
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,950
- Really?
- Yes.

684
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,720
- This is fascinating.
- Yes.

685
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:57,290
So did you choose my animal sign?

686
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,100
Yes. I did.

687
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,470
(The destined partner she chose...)

688
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:05,270
(was Hyeon U, the Blue Chicken.)

689
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:10,740
Should I say the characteristics
of your Day Master?

690
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,610
I got the feeling that
you would be sweet...

691
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:17,110
but very strong at the same time.

692
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:20,620
So I was just curious about you.

693
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,520
- Yes.
- I see.

694
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:23,990
It's fascinating.

695
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,120
- Right?
- Yes.

696
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:29,430
I thought that
you could be a shaman.

697
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,890
- That crossed my mind briefly.
- Really?

698
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:31,990
Just briefly.

699
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:36,370
Yes. I felt that the struggle
could have hit you pretty hard.

700
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,230
- The struggle could've hit me hard?
- Yes.

701
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,770
Let me elaborate on my reading.

702
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,880
You're like a flower
on top of a big rock.

703
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,210
- I see. A flower on a big rock?
- A flower.

704
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,350
(Hyeon U's saju is equivalent
to a flower on a big rock.)

705
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,750
People believe that...

706
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,220
flowers should be rooted in soil...

707
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,450
- for them to grow more robustly.
- Right.

708
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,750
But rocks are very hard.

709
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,360
And they can be cold too.

710
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:05,760
But once a seed gets
somehow planted in the rock,

711
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,130
the flower will grow
just like any other flower.

712
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,130
- I see.
- And it would be...

713
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,670
a beautiful flower too.

714
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,510
I don't know what kind of struggle
you had to face...

715
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,880
or what you had to go through.

716
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,940
It could've been your effort...

717
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,750
or determination
to overcome the struggle.

718
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,810
But whatever it was,

719
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,320
I had a strong feeling that
you were handling it...

720
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,850
with a sense of resolution.

721
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,390
- I see.
- I got that from your saju.

722
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,720
How fascinating.

723
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,460
- I think she's spot-on.
- Yes.

724
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,430
You know what? She precisely
described the Hyeon U...

725
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,600
- we've observed so far.
- Right.

726
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,760
- Her description was precise.
- That was spot-on.

727
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,170
This is a good example of
why Kyung Eon chose him.

728
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,370
She said he was a flower
rooted in a rock.

729
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,640
But he has too much water energy...

730
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,110
that his roots could rot.

731
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,180
But Kyung Eon has warm fire energy.

732
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,210
She must think that she has the energy
that can save him.

733
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,180
(Her warm energy can save Hyeon U.)

734
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,320
- Gosh, they're so spot-on.
- Seriously.

735
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:09,830
This is fascinating. I didn't know
you could read that in my saju.

736
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:13,400
(Kyung Eon's interpretation
of his saju comforted him.)

737
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,500
- Here you go.
- Gosh, this is amazing.

738
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,070
Here are your tea and some sweets.

739
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,440
Try them with the tea.

740
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,070
- The elderly will love this place.
- They will love it.

741
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,510
- I was looking forward to this.
- Really?

742
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,480
(Munching)

743
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,150
- Is it good?
- It's got everything I like.

744
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,250
But I'm not a big fan
of dried persimmons.

745
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,920
- You're not?
- No.

746
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,060
- Why not?
- Do you like dried persimmons?

747
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,660
I like anything that's sweet.

748
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,700
(Taking a bite)

749
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:51,630
(This is perfect for the palate
of his granny spirit.)

750
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,810
(Under the foot
of a quiet mountain,)

751
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,580
(there's a warm spot for dates.)

752
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,780
By the way,
I wanted to ask you this.

753
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,580
From what I know,

754
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,490
- based on our saju,
- Yes?

755
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,990
- there's an animal compatibility.
- Yes.

756
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,360
Our animal compatibility is
supposed to be good.

757
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,530
- Our animal signs?
- Our animal compatibility.

758
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,200
- Right. That also exists.
- Yes.

759
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,100
(The two saju readers
with good animal compatibility...)

760
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,370
(go to a cafe for their date.)

761
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,610
You're just like your animal sign.

762
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,610
- That was sudden.
- Yes, I know.

763
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,710
- That was sudden.
- Yes.

764
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,410
- Both of us can read saju.
- Yes.

765
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,920
In our relationship,
I would be the life-giving partner.

766
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,980
- Right.
- Yes.

767
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,550
I like Nurturing Day Masters.

768
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,550
- I see. Nurturing. Right.
- Yes.

769
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,590
- You're the life-giving partner.
- Yes, I am.

770
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,690
Right.

771
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,230
What?

772
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,390
(Only saju readers
can keep up with this talk.)

773
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,500
My gosh.

774
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,570
What? What are they talking about?
What was that?

775
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,530
Byeong Yeol was born as water.

776
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,140
- And Yu Ra was born as a flower.
- Yes.

777
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,210
Water will give life to the tree.

778
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,270
- That's what they're talking about.
- I see.

779
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,980
She really needs him then.

780
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,610
Gosh, it's the kind of conversation
regular couples would never have.

781
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,650
They didn't have to ask questions.

782
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,710
- They understood each other.
- Yes.

783
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,120
- So... Yes.
- But on the other hand,

784
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,720
I have the energy you lack.

785
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,850
Right.

786
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,220
My tree energy
can help beat your earth energy.

787
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,290
- Right. That would be lovely.
- Yes.

788
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,130
- I should do that.
- Yes.

789
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,330
(It refers to the suppression
of earth energy by tree energy.)

790
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,560
- I've never had this kind of talk.
- I love it.

791
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,900
I feel at ease.
It feels very comforting.

792
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:34,400
I wanted to talk to you about saju.

793
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,540
I bet.

794
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,670
Your tree energy
can suppress my earth energy.

795
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,710
- Right.
- I didn't know. We must do that.

796
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,280
And I can nurture your tree energy.

797
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,880
When the earthly energy
opposes each other,

798
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,180
we should get rid of
the earth energy for you.

799
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,920
- Right.
- Yes.

800
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,780
(They're engrossed
in their own conversation.)

801
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,520
Did you guess my Day Master
based on my first impression?

802
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,730
I thought your color would be
either black or blue.

803
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:57,960
Black or blue.

804
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,530
A lot of people thought...

805
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,730
- it was black.
- Really?

806
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,870
Ra Yun also thought that
I had the Yin Water energy.

807
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,940
- People with water energy...
- Yes?

808
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,140
don't share what's on their mind.

809
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,670
- Right.
- It's hard to read them, you know?

810
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,680
From what I observed,

811
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,780
I'm not sure
if you're just the cautious type.

812
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,150
I think that might have been why
Ra Yun thought so.

813
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,750
Yes. There were so many things
to consider.

814
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,750
- I had to behave carefully too.
- Right.

815
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,660
I had to make sure
I didn't cross the line.

816
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,690
There were so many things
to consider.

817
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,100
I noticed that you started to
make friends in the house.

818
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,400
After becoming comfortable
around them,

819
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,600
you began to spread your wings,
so to speak.

820
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,940
It seemed to me that you needed
that push to get things going.

821
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,680
That's what I drew
from my observation.

822
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,110
(He picked up on her personality
in advance.)

823
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,650
You're good at
analyzing people's saju.

824
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,850
My gosh.

825
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,680
Actually,
this is how it felt personally.

826
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,150
When you began to spread your wings,

827
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:02,120
I felt that I wasn't close enough
to experience your change.

828
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,430
So I must have had a hard time
approaching you.

829
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,130
- That's right.
- Yes.

830
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,660
That's true. We went on one date.

831
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,940
Then you wanted to
get to know other people.

832
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,700
- I see.
- I knew that's how you felt.

833
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,810
- I didn't want to pressure you.
- I see.

834
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,970
I wouldn't say I distanced myself.

835
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,210
Right.

836
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,950
Having this kind of feeling...

837
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:27,520
- could lead to misunderstandings.
- Yes.

838
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,250
"Am I..."

839
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,590
"making myself feel uncomfortable
or awkward around Yu Ra?"

840
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,990
This kind of thought
crossed my mind...

841
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,360
because I didn't know you better.

842
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,300
I guess that must have affected
my behavior in some way.

843
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,500
- During our date, I felt that...
- Yes?

844
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,370
when we were talking,
there could be...

845
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,800
- I see. Okay.
- a misunderstanding.

846
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,310
But I can't remember
everything clearly.

847
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,380
When you were expressing
your thoughts,

848
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,780
they were completely different
from mine.

849
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,210
It felt like...

850
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,150
- you were objecting to me.
- I see.

851
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,350
- I see.
- But that kind of hurt my feelings.

852
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:02,520
Really?

853
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,150
I can be... Here's the thing.

854
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,490
- I wanted us to feel comfortable.
- Did you feel comfortable?

855
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,390
- So I might've been expressive.
- I figured.

856
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,760
It could've been a mistake.

857
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,930
I can understand that.

858
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,430
(The two of them finally clear up
the misunderstanding.)

859
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,130
My gosh. Thank you.

860
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,230
You know, I'm like a cat.

861
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,440
Right. You have yin energy.

862
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,110
I do have yin energy.

863
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,770
- That's right. Yes.
- Yes.

864
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:26,980
I also have yin energy.

865
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,980
- Yes.
- So I can understand that.

866
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,150
- Thank you for understanding.
- Sure.

867
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:33,820
(They understand each other
through saju.)

868
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,620
My gosh.

869
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:39,520
They had a chance to clear up
the misunderstanding. How nice.

870
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,890
To carry yin energy,

871
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:43,060
the first letter
of the date of birth...

872
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,560
must be categorized as yin.

873
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,100
If I were to compare it to MBTI,
they'd be introverts.

874
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,370
Byeong Yeol and Yu Ra...

875
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,270
were born with yin energy.

876
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:53,770
So they're not the expressive types
who take initiative.

877
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:55,300
Energy-wise,
they wait for the right time...

878
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,470
and are rather obedient.

879
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:58,240
That's why
he compared himself to a cat.

880
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,240
(He fully understands it now.)

881
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,640
Do you have any regrets?

882
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,480
I always have regrets.

883
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:07,020
So I had some regrets here too.

884
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,650
But I thought that
I didn't need to regret them.

885
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,920
And some things worked out.

886
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:19,060
Now, I don't have any regrets.

887
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,200
- That's good.
- Yes.

888
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,700
As for the problems...

889
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,800
or incidents I had to face here,

890
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,410
I believe I was able to
wrap them up on a good note.

891
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:35,310
So a sense of relief
came over me today.

892
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,150
It's been a while
since I came out...

893
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,450
- Yes. What about...
- on a date.

894
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:45,550
I like that I have a chance to
talk to you like this. That's all.

895
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:49,690
- I had fun.
- I also had fun.

896
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,760
(Their last date ended
without any regrets.)

897
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,010
(At the same time, in the house)

898
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,410
(Yu Gyeong and Ho Am are sitting
across from each other.)

899
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,880
- How do you feel?
- What?

900
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,910
- How do you feel?
- What do you mean?

901
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,080
About the date.

902
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,520
What do you think?

903
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,290
How do you think I feel?

904
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,320
If the Gold Dragon...

905
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,590
had pursued you eagerly,

906
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:26,760
you would've been torn.

907
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:31,730
You're right.

908
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:33,270
I totally agree.

909
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:34,540
That's so true.

910
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,310
(Sighing)

911
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,680
- I'll be honest.
- Yes?

912
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,080
You went on a date with me.

913
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,210
You also went on a date
with Byeong Yeol.

914
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,310
You guys talked a lot too.

915
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,220
And I was more worried about him,
not Byeong Yeol.

916
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,920
- Because you might know who he is?
- Yes.

917
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,850
If we're talking about the same guy.

918
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:56,290
To be honest, I'm quite worried
about today's date.

919
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,930
That's why I've been down
the whole day.

920
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,300
That's completely understandable.

921
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,600
The thing is...
Hold on. I'm worried.

922
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,540
I'm worried for real, to be honest.

923
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,010
Because I know.

924
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,550
(Ho Am understands
the weight of fate.)

925
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:21,250
If we even have 30 minutes together,
it'll be dangerous.

926
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,090
If that person and I spend
30 minutes in the same place,

927
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:27,660
it'll be like that.

928
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:33,660
You chose him with your senses
without even seeing his face.

929
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,900
And you'll have
a date with him today.

930
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:38,070
We really aren't compatible.

931
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,470
Saju-wise,
we really aren't compatible.

932
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:42,600
But I could only see that one.

933
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:45,040
Your instinct drew you in.

934
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,210
Today,
everyone is meeting the person...

935
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:55,750
they were most drawn to
in terms of spirits or saju.

936
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,250
- Today is a dangerous day...
- That's right.

937
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,590
- for everyone.
- I agree with you.

938
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:01,090
It isn't like that just for me,
but everyone.

939
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:02,120
That's right.

940
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,260
I'm worried...

941
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:08,800
that I'll fall head over heels
for the person I'm drawn to.

942
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,770
Perhaps, I don't want to be drawn
to that person.

943
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,440
- Right.
- The aftermath might be too much.

944
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,100
(Surprised)

945
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,540
- Really?
- Is the attraction that strong?

946
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,540
Is the attraction that strong?

947
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,340
I guess she feels a certain energy.

948
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,750
Really? Yu Gyeong's words...

949
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:24,750
worry me a bit.

950
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:27,220
I feel like she's using
a roundabout way to say,

951
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,520
- "I'll fall for this person."
- Yes.

952
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,550
- That's how it sounds.
- It's like a declaration.

953
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:35,160
Ho Am is being very nice...

954
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,760
and going along with what
she's saying, but his feelings...

955
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,900
It must be heartbreaking.

956
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,400
Despite knowing everything,
he continued to like Yu Gyeong...

957
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,670
and express his interest.
I think that's commendable.

958
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,510
(Staring)

959
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,210
What will you do
if you can't avoid it?

960
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,080
- If I can't avoid the pull?
- Yes.

961
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:09,490
(Ho Am finds it difficult to answer
Yu Gyeong's question.)

962
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:13,130
If someone is already drawn
to someone strongly...

963
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:14,300
like me,

964
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,300
it'll be hard to change their mind.

965
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,010
Since I'm already drawn
to someone strongly.

966
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:27,910
(He expresses his genuine feelings
for Yu Gyeong.)

967
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:30,080
I see.

968
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:35,620
(Sighing)

969
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,590
In this situation, I know too much.

970
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:40,890
I received a spiritual message.

971
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:46,260
That's why I'm a bit worried.

972
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,200
To be honest about today,

973
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,840
I think that person
will also waver...

974
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,440
if I make a move...

975
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,710
- with a strong conviction.
- Right.

976
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,610
I'm sure that it'll be
a two-way interaction.

977
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:09,020
Thus, it might affect
both people's final selections.

978
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,420
I had that thought.

979
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:13,990
I agree with you.

980
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:19,130
(Yu Gyeong wavers before her fate.)

981
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:23,570
(Ho Am can only watch.)

982
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,900
My goodness.

983
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,700
This is dangerous.

984
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,970
I'm suddenly so curious
about the final selection.

985
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,870
- Seriously.
- How is she so certain?

986
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,970
- I know. There was nothing.
- Seriously.

987
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,440
"That person will waver
if I make a move..."

988
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,110
"with a strong conviction."

989
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:37,810
It's hard to have
that kind of certainty.

990
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,550
It's possible because
Yu Gyeong is a shaman...

991
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,780
and this person
was picked by a divine spirit.

992
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,450
They scare me so much.

993
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,960
I'm sorry, but I'll return
after singing a verse of a hymn.

994
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,960
I'm too scared.

995
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,160
(He calls upon the Lord,
not a divine spirit.)

996
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,760
It's scary.

997
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,700
I thought you were going
to the restroom.

998
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,770
Seriously.

999
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:03,310
(What result
will the Fate Plaque Date bring?)

1000
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:10,110
(Meanwhile, Sang Hyeok goes
to the location of the date.)

1001
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:13,780
(Surprised)

1002
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:16,690
- Hello.
- Hello.

1003
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,590
- We meet again.
- Did you know... Seriously.

1004
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,390
Did you know that it was me?
You didn't know, right?

1005
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,390
I really didn't know. So...

1006
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:23,860
It seemed like no one knew.

1007
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:27,100
The two of us left
at a similar time.

1008
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,470
- How about a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

1009
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,640
On my very first day,

1010
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,540
you went on a date with me.

1011
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,340
It's fascinating.
Come to think of it,

1012
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,410
- you chose me then,
- Yes.

1013
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:42,440
- based on the first impression.
- Yes.

1014
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,810
- And I chose your fate plaque.
- Seriously.

1015
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,980
It's quite fascinating.

1016
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,420
Seriously. It's very fascinating.

1017
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,690
The timing played a big role.

1018
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,890
You entered the house belatedly.

1019
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:01,100
(In retrospect,
the timing was regrettable.)

1020
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,030
You specialize in astrology,

1021
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:05,600
- not saju.
- Right.

1022
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:09,840
Why did you choose the Gold Dragon
among all the fate plaques?

1023
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:13,310
In astrology,

1024
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:15,340
your sign is Leo.

1025
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,340
That's right.

1026
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:18,250
- There were many things.
- About me?

1027
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,820
- About Leo.
- About Leo?

1028
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,280
- I'm talking about the planets.
- The planets?

1029
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,790
Yes. There's something
called the ascendant.

1030
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:26,990
It's related to your appearance.
For you, it's Scorpio.

1031
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,660
- Your ascendant is Scorpio.
- Okay.

1032
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,330
It made me go,
"This person must be handsome."

1033
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:33,760
- So, I chose that fate plaque.
- That's incredible.

1034
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,700
- Do you know what's funny?
- What?

1035
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,030
- You absolutely love to eat.
- Yes.

1036
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:41,040
- It's in the astrology chart.
- That's incredible.

1037
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,610
Your moon sign is Taurus.

1038
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:46,070
Taurus loves tasty food.

1039
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:48,010
- I totally love tasty food.
- Yes.

1040
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:50,380
Exactly. You eat nonstop.

1041
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,510
It's so fascinating.

1042
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:54,280
- It's fascinating, right?
- Yes.

1043
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,820
After getting
an astrology reading from you,

1044
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:01,190
people said that
you were very skilled.

1045
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:02,960
You say, "It's providential."

1046
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,060
- "It's providential."
- Yes.

1047
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,990
I learned it from Ra Yun.
"It's providential."

1048
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:07,600
Providential, not skilled.

1049
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,430
- I guess so.
- Okay.

1050
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:12,030
Many people said that
your readings were providential.

1051
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:13,640
It's so fascinating.

1052
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,870
- It's all here.
- I should check it out later.

1053
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,040
It's well-known about Taurus.

1054
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,370
(They reminisce
through the talk of astrology.)

1055
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:19,710
- You're a gourmet.
- Ever since I entered the house,

1056
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:20,840
I ate tasty food nonstop.

1057
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,840
You eat nonstop.

1058
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:30,120
Compared to the time
we went on our first date,

1059
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,420
you became much more comfortable.

1060
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,120
- During that time...
- Did you become used to me?

1061
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,420
- Or...
- That's one reason.

1062
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,660
That's right.
On the first day, I felt so awkward.

1063
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:41,560
- When you were with me?
- Yes.

1064
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,800
I tried to treat you
in a friendly and relaxed way,

1065
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,300
but I'm the type...

1066
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,570
- to need a lot of time.
- Right.

1067
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:49,970
I need a lot of time.

1068
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,240
You weren't
in good condition either.

1069
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,780
That's right.
Things were a bit hard that day.

1070
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,410
That's good.

1071
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,580
It was like that.

1072
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:00,880
(They clear up the misunderstanding
about the first date.)

1073
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:03,820
I'm glad that
the awkwardness is gone.

1074
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:05,650
- It seems that way.
- Yes.

1075
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:09,020
The way you speak and such
make me think that you're...

1076
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:11,460
very carefree...

1077
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,960
and more relaxed than I imagined.

1078
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,870
- That's a good thing, right?
- Of course, it is.

1079
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:20,070
- It's a compliment, right?
- Yes.

1080
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,800
Yes. You're very charming.

1081
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:25,810
I don't know
what will happen tomorrow.

1082
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:30,050
After the selection,
some people will become couples.

1083
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,280
Some will be happy
while the others will be sad.

1084
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,020
- Right. I'm sure of it.
- Seriously.

1085
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,320
I'm nervous about tomorrow.

1086
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,930
It isn't me, right?

1087
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,960
- It's a secret.
- A secret?

1088
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,530
- It's totally a secret.
- Okay.

1089
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:55,340
I said what I wanted to say.

1090
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,710
Leo has a bright energy.

1091
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:01,540
How will it feel...

1092
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:04,510
to meet a man who exudes
the main character energy?

1093
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:07,050
I found him charming
and became curious.

1094
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,090
During my stay in the house,

1095
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:14,060
the moments and feelings
I experienced...

1096
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,590
were separate
from the astrology chart.

1097
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:20,830
Human emotions couldn't be helped.

1098
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,870
I developed feelings
for another person first,

1099
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:26,170
so I became less interested
in the fate plaque.

1100
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,310
I learned the charms
of another person first.

1101
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:33,610
In retrospect,
the timing is very important.

1102
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:34,910
(Despite the fate plaque,
she fell for someone else.)

1103
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,180
I'm letting the man
of my fate plaque go...

1104
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,580
in a cool-headed way.

1105
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:42,020
Still, I chose the fate plaque
with seriousness.

1106
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,160
It was nice to meet the man...

1107
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,560
of my fate plaque.

1108
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,160
Thank you for giving me a good time.

1109
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,160
Same here.

1110
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,630
- Bye.
- See you later.

1111
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,300
- I'll get going now.
- Okay.

1112
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:00,340
Bye.

1113
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:09,540
(Thus, Yun Jeong says goodbye
to her destined partner.)

1114
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,150
It feels a bit like a breakup.

1115
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:15,780
You know, it's very nice.

1116
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,150
- Yes. Seriously.
- I agree.

1117
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,650
It's a beautiful ending.

1118
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,220
Yun Jeong looked for him so eagerly.

1119
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,690
- I know.
- She looked for the Gold Dragon.

1120
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:25,790
But this happened.

1121
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:26,900
Life is all about timing.

1122
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,560
- That's right.
- I agree with you.

1123
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:33,400
(Ho Am spends time alone.)

1124
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:37,640
(Yu Gyeong heads over
to the terrace.)

1125
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,680
Jang Ho Am!

1126
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:47,020
- What are you doing?
- What?

1127
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,020
What are you doing?

1128
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,920
(He's cute.)

1129
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:51,590
Come on in.

1130
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:54,160
- Is it fun?
- What?

1131
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,320
- Is it fun?
- How did you come out?

1132
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,390
What kind of a question is that?
I'm on the balcony.

1133
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,830
(Laughing)

1134
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:02,900
- When will you come inside?
- What?

1135
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,270
- When will you come inside?
- After I'm done eating.

1136
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:06,300
- After you're done eating?
- One remains.

1137
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,300
Does one remain?

1138
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:08,640
Okay.

1139
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,280
(Hurrying)

1140
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,290
(He runs up the stairs
since Yu Gyeong called him.)

1141
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:28,760
(They meet again on the 2nd floor.)

1142
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:32,260
The date you'll go on today...

1143
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,160
is a necessary one, in my opinion.

1144
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:36,870
You're right.

1145
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:39,270
Can you guess how it'll be?

1146
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,700
- The date?
- Yes.

1147
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:44,170
Have you thought about...

1148
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:46,040
how a date with someone else
would be?

1149
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,750
(Thinking)

1150
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,580
I haven't really thought about it.

1151
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:53,650
- Really?
- Yes.

1152
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,850
You could've thought,

1153
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:59,520
"I want to have a conversation
with this person..."

1154
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,760
"before this ends."

1155
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,590
There wasn't anyone like that.

1156
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:05,930
- Yes, there was.
- There was?

1157
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:07,130
- Yes, there was.
- No, there wasn't.

1158
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,660
Yes, there was.

1159
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,700
(Yu Gyeong seems to know something.)

1160
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,170
You...

1161
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:12,830
Did the divine spirit tell you
that it was a lie?

1162
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,840
There's no use in lying.

1163
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:23,950
I bet you were a bit drawn
to Yun Jeong.

1164
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,080
I had that thought.

1165
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:28,350
- Really?
- Yes.

1166
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,490
(Thinking)

1167
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:40,560
To be honest, I was a bit torn once.

1168
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,730
But I made a decision
that wouldn't leave me...

1169
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:45,400
any regrets.

1170
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:49,270
Had I been torn...

1171
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,910
and made a different decision,

1172
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:53,070
- I would have regrets now.
- Why?

1173
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,480
I wasn't torn
because I truly liked someone else.

1174
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:04,820
I was driven by jealousy.

1175
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:07,390
- I see.
- Yes. It was like that.

1176
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,260
Had I made a different decision,

1177
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,230
I would've regretted it.

1178
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:16,100
So I still think,
"I made the right decision."

1179
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:25,210
(Ho Am's every moment was
a decision toward Yu Gyeong.)

1180
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,840
(Yu Gyeong leaves
for a date with Sang Hyeok.)

1181
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,820
Yu Gyeong is torn.

1182
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:40,720
Since today is the last day,
I feel more disappointed.

1183
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,490
"I wish we had more time."

1184
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:46,130
I have that thought.

1185
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:53,670
(Not much time remains,
so Ho Am's disappointment grows.)

1186
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:58,470
(He feels bad.)

1187
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:00,740
If Yu Gyeong and Sang Hyeok
become a couple...

1188
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,380
through this date...

1189
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,810
- Oh, my.
- Will that really happen?

1190
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,020
- I guess it's possible.
- No way.

1191
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,480
I can't watch this.

1192
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:11,490
I need to watch this right away.

1193
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,490
(No way.)

1194
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:26,630
(Yu Gyeong is waiting
for her destined partner.)

1195
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:30,270
Destiny isn't easy.

1196
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,840
I think it's inevitable.

1197
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,840
You become drawn to someone
helplessly.

1198
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,480
"My heart will waver a lot."

1199
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,280
That thought was scary.

1200
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,520
Who is it?

1201
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,930
(She waits for Sang Hyeok
with nervousness in her heart.)

1202
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,340
(Nervous)

1203
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,710
(Smiling)

1204
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:14,650
(Sang Hyeok gets out of the car.)

1205
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:16,880
Hello.

1206
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:19,850
(Embarrassed)

1207
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:20,890
Please get in.

1208
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,200
(Fate Plaque Date:
Chae Yu Gyeong and Yun Sang Hyeok)

1209
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,270
Let's go.

1210
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:35,640
All right.

1211
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,270
(Glancing over)

1212
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,180
- Let's hit the road.
- Let's go.

1213
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,280
- Gosh, it's a railroad.
- Yes.

1214
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:52,450
I take it
that you were in the house.

1215
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:56,220
Yes,
there were some people in the house.

1216
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,100
We haven't talked
to each other much,

1217
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,570
- so it's a bit awkward.
- I know.

1218
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:12,370
- Right?
- It's very awkward.

1219
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,280
(Glancing over)

1220
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:19,250
(Yu Gyeong is especially quiet
today.)

1221
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:21,280
You're very...

1222
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,990
- honest.
- Me?

1223
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:26,150
- Yes.
- What do you mean?

1224
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:27,690
You express yourself...

1225
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:30,260
and stay honest about your emotions.

1226
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:34,660
I always thought that you were cool.

1227
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:36,960
(Smiling)

1228
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:40,800
I even told people,
"Yu Gyeong seems like..."

1229
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,170
"a cool person."

1230
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:45,670
- Am I cool?
- Yes.

1231
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:46,770
I should be pretty.

1232
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,480
Of course, you're pretty.
On top of that,

1233
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,410
you're very cool and charming.

1234
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:53,880
I thought you were like that,

1235
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:57,350
so I really hoped that I'd have...

1236
01:01:57,350 --> 01:02:00,890
a chance to talk to you.

1237
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,490
(Nodding)

1238
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,490
It was like that for me.

1239
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:09,460
(I see.)

1240
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:14,900
(She didn't expect
Sang Hyeok to be so honest.)

1241
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:20,980
What is it?
If you feel uncomfortable,

1242
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:23,210
you don't need to answer me or talk.

1243
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:25,450
I'm fine talking by myself.

1244
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:28,950
There were no emotions,

1245
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:32,520
but my intuition and gut feeling
told me this.

1246
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,760
"If I become involved with him,"

1247
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,690
"I'll be very drawn to him."

1248
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:41,460
So I didn't want to have
a conversation.

1249
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,430
I avoided it because I was scared.

1250
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:51,040
To be honest, I was very nervous.

1251
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:52,970
- Really? Yesterday?
- Yes.

1252
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,640
I can explain.

1253
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,110
I didn't want to face you...

1254
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,080
because of different reasons.

1255
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,250
My heart was like that.

1256
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,620
As for me,

1257
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:09,420
I don't usually get nervous
in front of others.

1258
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,830
But strangely,

1259
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:16,160
I get nervous in front of you.

1260
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,000
- I'm the same in front of you.
- Really?

1261
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:19,530
How fascinating.

1262
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:20,770
- I become nervous.
- I see.

1263
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:22,940
It's like that, so...

1264
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:25,570
(They felt a strange sort of tension
in each other's presence.)

1265
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,580
So you made me more curious.

1266
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:31,480
"What does she think about?
What is she like?"

1267
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,150
- Really?
- Yes.

1268
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:36,520
I'm really curious
about such things. And...

1269
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,090
although there's no way of knowing
or seeing them with my eyes,

1270
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:43,390
some people seem to exude charms.

1271
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,260
It made me wonder,
"What are her charms?"

1272
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:49,130
- My charms? You were curious.
- Yes.

1273
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,440
- We make each other nervous,
- Yes.

1274
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,480
I guess.

1275
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,380
(Scratching)

1276
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:09,120
(Glancing over)

1277
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:12,420
You can turn it down.

1278
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:14,860
- Which one? The heater?
- Yes.

1279
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,190
- Are you hot?
- No, you look tired.

1280
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,230
No, I'm not tired.

1281
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:19,690
- It's really okay.
- You can turn it down a bit.

1282
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:20,730
Okay.

1283
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,600
- It's a bit suffocating.
- Is it? Then I'll turn it down.

1284
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:25,900
Tell me if you feel cold.

1285
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,670
(Laughing)

1286
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:33,980
By any chance, do I appear...

1287
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,010
younger?

1288
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,850
Than me? You're younger than me.

1289
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,380
Why do you ask?

1290
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:46,920
- You keep using a casual tone.
- Did I use a casual tone?

1291
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,590
- Yes.
- Did I use a casual tone?

1292
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:49,960
Yes. You did that repeatedly.

1293
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,990
I prefer using a casual tone,
to be honest.

1294
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:53,860
Speak casually. I'll do the same.

1295
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,030
Speak casually.

1296
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:59,400
Should I call you Mr. Sang Hyeok?

1297
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,040
Just call me Sang Hyeok.

1298
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,070
- Can I do that?
- Go right ahead.

1299
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:05,440
That sounds good.

1300
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,010
(They decide to speak casually
to each other.)

1301
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,010
- So I used a casual tone.
- Yes.

1302
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,310
I'm the type
to use a polite tone religiously.

1303
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:16,050
I guess you're comfortable
around me.

1304
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:17,420
Maybe that's why.

1305
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:19,120
It's fascinating.

1306
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,790
(The two of them become close
very quickly.)

1307
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,960
- Although they're only in the car,
- It's the most electrifying date.

1308
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,130
- it's so much fun.
- Yes.

1309
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:31,300
- It's the most electrifying date.
- They make us focus, right?

1310
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:34,000
I'm getting a dopamine rush.

1311
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,840
Earlier, she said...

1312
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:39,240
that spending 30 minutes
alone with him would be dangerous.

1313
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,240
That's right.

1314
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,640
It's a brief conversation...

1315
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,810
- in the car,
- That's right.

1316
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:44,050
- but it feels different. Right?
- Yes.

1317
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:45,110
- It's extraordinary.
- Definitely.

1318
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,110
- Even we can feel that energy...
- That's right.

1319
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,820
- through the screen.
- How should I put it?

1320
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,820
It's like the moment...

1321
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:52,620
- before a volcanic eruption.
- Yes.

1322
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,420
- It's entirely natural.
- Right?

1323
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:57,560
Emotions are enough
to make people waver.

1324
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:58,690
But there are
both emotions and destiny...

1325
01:05:58,690 --> 01:05:59,690
- in this situation.
- That's right.

1326
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:00,730
So it's natural to be swayed...

1327
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:01,760
- and rattled.
- yes.

1328
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,370
- For tomorrow's selection,
- That's right.

1329
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:06,670
- they're getting to know everyone.
- That's right.

1330
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:09,840
- It's their very first date too.
- That's right.

1331
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,410
It really looks dangerous.

1332
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:13,510
- It's dangerous.
- Yes.

1333
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:14,580
It's dangerous.

1334
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:17,550
Why did the Gold Dragon
have to be handsome?

1335
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:20,180
(That's funny.)

1336
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:26,090
(After the Fate Plaque Date,
Yun Jeong returns to the house.)

1337
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,030
(Slamming)

1338
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:32,760
(Glancing over)

1339
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:36,330
What?

1340
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:38,000
Yun Jeong, is that you?

1341
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:39,370
What?

1342
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,740
(Happy)

1343
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,140
You came back early.

1344
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,240
Yes. I only went to one place.

1345
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,180
(They're so happy that they talk
without seeing each other's faces.)

1346
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,150
- Have you stayed here all along?
- What?

1347
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:53,310
- Have you stayed here all along?
- Yes.

1348
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:55,750
- I played at home.
- What did you do?

1349
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:58,120
- What?
- This and that.

1350
01:06:58,290 --> 01:06:59,390
Have you spent time like that?

1351
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:00,450
(She bursts out laughing.)

1352
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,890
I'm so hungry.

1353
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:03,560
- Didn't you have a meal?
- No.

1354
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,260
- Really?
- I only drank coffee.

1355
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:10,300
(They get to spend time
by themselves.)

1356
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:13,900
"I want to talk to Ho Am."

1357
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,400
I had a vague idea to do that.

1358
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:20,040
I was lucky...

1359
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,040
because Ho Am was in the house
when I returned.

1360
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:25,010
Haven't other people come back?

1361
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:26,780
No.

1362
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,050
No one?

1363
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:30,420
I thought it'd take a while.
You came back quickly.

1364
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:33,750
I wondered until when
I'd need to be here by myself.

1365
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,690
(Shy)

1366
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,790
I think many things
will happen today.

1367
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:40,930
- Today?
- Yes.

1368
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,860
The Fate Plaque Date is...

1369
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:46,900
a chance to go on a date
with someone you picked first.

1370
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:50,000
I think it might lead to changes.

1371
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:53,070
Yun Jeong,
isn't there a change in your heart?

1372
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:59,080
As for me, it didn't really matter.

1373
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:01,050
Really?

1374
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:07,050
(Yun Jeong shows her certainty
before Ho Am.)

1375
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:12,230
I wonder who picked my fate plaque.

1376
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:20,500
I should do that.

1377
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,540
Do what?

1378
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:25,340
Pay you for the reading.

1379
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,210
(A few days ago)

1380
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:34,450
(Ho Am blessed Yun Jeong
with the five-element flags.)

1381
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,920
(This is considered...)

1382
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,320
(the best flag in shamanism.)

1383
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:43,460
(Yun Jeong,)

1384
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,130
(you're cool.)

1385
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:51,530
(Ho Am consoled Yun Jeong
when she was struggling.)

1386
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:57,140
(How should I pay you
for the reading?)

1387
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:01,040
(She promised to pay Ho Am
for the reading.)

1388
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:02,940
(I remember.)

1389
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:05,250
- I need to pay you.
- Give me tasty food then.

1390
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:07,350
Seriously. I don't have anything.

1391
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,850
(Joking)

1392
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:13,490
(Thinking)

1393
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,490
Shall we go and eat then?

1394
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:19,690
Shall we go and eat then?

1395
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:21,230
Outside?

1396
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:23,330
Yes.

1397
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:29,700
(Nervous)

1398
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,710
Let's go and eat.

1399
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,050
- Well done.
- Well done.

1400
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,180
Congratulations. Seriously.

1401
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,950
Yun Jeong plucked up her courage...

1402
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:44,690
- and asked him out.
- I know. Yun Jeong finds it hard.

1403
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:47,120
- It took her a lot of courage.
- That's right.

1404
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,160
- She knows who he likes.
- That's right.

1405
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,590
- That's right.
- But she went, "Let's have a meal."

1406
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:53,560
That's right. To be honest,
Yun Jeong struggled a lot.

1407
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:55,700
- She went through a hard time.
- Yes.

1408
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,870
I'm so proud of her...

1409
01:09:57,870 --> 01:10:00,130
- for plucking up her courage.
- Yes.

1410
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:03,140
The timing is perfect.

1411
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:06,270
Let's go and eat.

1412
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:13,750
I wanted to eat and converse
with him,

1413
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:15,280
so I lied.

1414
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,380
I said,
"Let's go out freely by ourselves."

1415
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,120
I wanted to talk to him more.

1416
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,320
I hoped to have time...

1417
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:24,760
that would bring us closer.

1418
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:33,900
(Yun Jeong prepares
to go out with Ho Am.)

1419
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:41,710
(It makes her hum.)

1420
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:43,880
Yun Jeong seems to be excited.

1421
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,910
Women do this in that situation
because they're nervous.

1422
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:48,380
"It's just a meal."

1423
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:50,880
"I'm just going out for a meal.
It's just dinner."

1424
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,390
"Don't be nervous."

1425
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:53,450
- "It's just a meal."
- "It isn't a date."

1426
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:55,720
- "It's just a meal."
- Do you say that to the mirror?

1427
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,590
"I'm just going out for a meal.
Seriously."

1428
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,130
(That's so funny.)

1429
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,200
That's so funny.

1430
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,130
Men go,

1431
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:05,200
"What will I do
if it's just a meal?"

1432
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,770
They do that.

1433
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:09,240
"Maybe she'll go home
after the meal."

1434
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,110
- Men do that, right?
- Yes.

1435
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:12,510
Women do that to ease the nerves.

1436
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,540
They make an effort
to avoid going overboard.

1437
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,380
- Do you do that too?
- As for me, I have...

1438
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:19,750
a stranger thought.

1439
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:22,050
- Like what?
- "He likes someone else."

1440
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:23,480
Exactly.

1441
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:25,550
- Women do that.
- Yes.

1442
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:27,050
"I don't like him either."

1443
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:29,590
"He likes someone else."

1444
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,830
- "We won't become a couple."
- "Today,"

1445
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:33,030
- "after a meal,"
- "It's just a meal."

1446
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:35,300
- "he'll go and meet her."
- "We'll have a tasty dinner."

1447
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,560
"We'll do that today."

1448
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:38,700
I see. I didn't know that.

1449
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:40,100
That's so funny.

1450
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,170
Let's go.

1451
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:49,180
(Secret Date:
Kim Yun Jeong and Jang Ho Am)

1452
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,310
A taxi? My goodness.

1453
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:53,610
(Secret Date:
Kim Yun Jeong and Jang Ho Am)

1454
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,750
- Go on in.
- Thank you.

1455
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:00,620
(Excited)

1456
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,360
Do we know where we're going?

1457
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:06,460
Yes.

1458
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,700
(Grinning)

1459
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,300
(Glancing over)

1460
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:17,240
I'm glad I came out.

1461
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,870
- What?
- I'm glad I came out.

1462
01:12:18,970 --> 01:12:20,410
Had I stayed home,

1463
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:24,510
I would've just lazed around.

1464
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:27,350
- In your padded vest.
- My padded vest.

1465
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:28,650
In your padded vest.

1466
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:31,890
It'll be nice to have
a tasty meal and talk.

1467
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,220
(Proud)

1468
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,900
What was the most memorable thing
you did on a date?

1469
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,230
The most memorable thing?

1470
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:49,900
You know, timing plays a big role.

1471
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:54,910
The first date was impactful.

1472
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:56,380
- Really?
- I didn't expect that.

1473
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:59,150
After all, it was...

1474
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,480
- the first date on this show.
- That's right.

1475
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:05,490
So it was...

1476
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:07,790
(She reminisces about
the first date with Ho Am.)

1477
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:09,390
- The first date.
- Yes.

1478
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:12,730
(Embarrassed)

1479
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,830
(At the same time)

1480
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,900
What are you like?

1481
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,800
- What?
- Your personality.

1482
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,370
- Me?
- Are you calm or serious?

1483
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:26,140
(Thinking)

1484
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,310
Are you cute?

1485
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:36,480
I get excited often,

1486
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:39,220
but I try to keep myself centered.

1487
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:41,560
I'm a bit like that.

1488
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,890
- You mean, you have many charms.
- No.

1489
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:47,390
I joke around,

1490
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:50,760
but I try to keep myself centered.

1491
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:52,000
I make an effort.

1492
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,170
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1493
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:56,870
The way you speak...

1494
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:59,010
- I speak incoherently.
- That isn't true.

1495
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:01,510
The way you speak,

1496
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,010
you trail off in the end.

1497
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:04,780
- I see.
- Do you know what I mean?

1498
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:05,880
I know what you mean.

1499
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:09,080
You go, "Like that..."

1500
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,150
I don't mean that
you speak incoherently.

1501
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:14,990
Your tone becomes weaker
toward the end.

1502
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,190
- That's right. It's...
- Because of that,

1503
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:19,690
- I focus even more.
- Really?

1504
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:21,760
"Will he say something more?"
I focus even more.

1505
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,560
- I think it's your charm. Yes.
- Really?

1506
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:26,500
When I follow my line of thought
as I speak,

1507
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,470
my words don't come out
in an organized way.

1508
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,540
- But I need to end them somehow.
- That's right.

1509
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:32,910
- So I just keep going...
- Okay.

1510
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,710
and stop speaking abruptly.

1511
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:35,940
Because of that,

1512
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:38,150
it's fun to talk to you.

1513
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:40,210
Thank you
for looking kindly upon me.

1514
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:44,950
The more I get to know you,
the more interesting you become.

1515
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:50,160
Thank you
for looking kindly upon me.

1516
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:54,090
Can I ask you what this bracelet is?

1517
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:56,530
- The prayer beads?
- Are these prayer beads?

1518
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:58,500
- Yes, they're prayer beads.
- Really?

1519
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,170
I visited the Jingwansa Temple
recently...

1520
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:02,840
and bought them.

1521
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,740
- May I touch them?
- Sure.

1522
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:07,310
(Putting them down gently)

1523
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:10,480
It's my first time
seeing white ones.

1524
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,750
It's called howlite.

1525
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,110
- How...
- Howlite.

1526
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:14,110
Howlite?

1527
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:15,150
I got them at a Buddhist university.

1528
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:17,780
I see. They're very pretty.

1529
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:18,820
They're pretty, indeed.

1530
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:21,320
I want them.

1531
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,890
(What?)

1532
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:25,890
She's asking for them.

1533
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,630
(Laughing)

1534
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:29,660
Already?

1535
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:31,730
"If you have feelings for me,
give me this bracelet."

1536
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,330
(That's incredible.)

1537
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:37,940
I want them.

1538
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:41,980
It's pretty.
Shamans have such bracelets.

1539
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,080
- Really?
- Yes.

1540
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,910
If you visit Jingwansa Temple,
I'll buy you one.

1541
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:48,520
You'll buy me one only if I visit,
right?

1542
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,650
- I...
- I need to go all the way there.

1543
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:52,120
I'll buy one on my way to meet you.

1544
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:55,390
It's so pretty.

1545
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:57,560
Thank you.

1546
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:04,100
(The two of them arrive at a cafe.)

1547
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:07,530
"Please pull."

1548
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,800
- Thank you.
- All right. Please go on in.

1549
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:15,610
- A cat is sleeping.
- How cute.

1550
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:16,940
(Welcome.)

1551
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:20,750
Baby, did you wake up?

1552
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:23,920
Gosh, you're cute.

1553
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:26,590
It has an eye booger.

1554
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:29,320
- Let me take it off.
- Can I pat your belly?

1555
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:31,190
I bet it won't let you
pat its belly.

1556
01:16:31,730 --> 01:16:33,090
How are you so pretty?

1557
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:36,500
Do you like cats as well?

1558
01:16:38,730 --> 01:16:40,000
I like all the animals.

1559
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
- Really?
- I like cats too.

1560
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:42,800
How cute.

1561
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,070
It'll purr soon.

1562
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:45,870
How cute.

1563
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:47,670
(It feels nice.)

1564
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:52,950
To be honest,

1565
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:55,980
I picked your fate plaque
for a reason.

1566
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:59,450
- I can't go into details.
- Okay.

1567
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,920
But there's a being called
the Great Divine Grandmother.

1568
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,830
And I got the best flag.

1569
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:07,330
- When you asked about me?
- Our saju results...

1570
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:08,730
weren't very compatible,

1571
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:10,560
but I kept getting the best flag.

1572
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,570
I found it hard to believe,

1573
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:15,670
so I asked 4 to 5 times.

1574
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,110
But I kept getting the same flag.

1575
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,310
- She looked kindly upon me.
- Yes.

1576
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,610
I was only drawn
to that fate plaque.

1577
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:28,650
Only that one seemed to shine.

1578
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:32,490
"I'll definitely be drawn
to this fate plaque."

1579
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:34,320
(I'll definitely be drawn
to this fate plaque.)

1580
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,320
I knew that already.

1581
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:40,290
I felt like I'd fall too deep...

1582
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:42,030
if I approached you
and talked to you.

1583
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,830
I was worried about that.

1584
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:48,400
To be honest,
I was scared about that.

1585
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:52,110
That was why
I didn't approach you first.

1586
01:17:52,110 --> 01:17:54,780
(Yu Gyeong was scared about
approaching Sang Hyeok.)

1587
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:59,180
How was it for you? Did you know?
Did you expect it to be me?

1588
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:01,550
- When I was coming today?
- Yes.

1589
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:05,050
I did think that it was you.

1590
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:07,320
- I see.
- That idea suddenly occurred to me.

1591
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:10,790
Besides,
you were one of the people...

1592
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:14,260
I wanted to talk to.

1593
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,030
Whenever I was asked about
my thoughts...

1594
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:22,170
on shamanism and such on this show,

1595
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,940
I said that I was fine with it.

1596
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:28,040
After all, I thought that a shaman
would do a better job...

1597
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,540
of looking into me.

1598
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:34,820
If there's someone
who can really look through me...

1599
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:36,280
and figure out my essence,

1600
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,320
it's a good thing.

1601
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,390
That was why...

1602
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:43,120
I was curious about you.

1603
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:46,860
It was like that.

1604
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,130
There wasn't much of a conversation
between us.

1605
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:52,770
- That's right.
- Not really.

1606
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:53,770
Not really.

1607
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
You know...

1608
01:18:58,470 --> 01:19:02,180
For some reason, I...

1609
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:04,610
(Sang Hyeok begins
to speak carefully.)

1610
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:06,780
I think...

1611
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:11,020
When I was by your side
in the house,

1612
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:15,460
there seemed to be people
who were certain...

1613
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:16,960
about each other.

1614
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:19,890
(Surprised)

1615
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:21,530
So I had this stance.

1616
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:22,930
I became curious about you...

1617
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:27,170
and thought that you were
cool and charming...

1618
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:30,600
as time passed
after I entered the house.

1619
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:35,810
But I didn't want to make a mess
by coming in between people.

1620
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:37,340
(The reason Sang Hyeok
couldn't approach Yu Gyeong)

1621
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:40,480
I thought it'd be better to leave...

1622
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:42,920
two people alone
to continue seeing each other...

1623
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,050
if they were certain.

1624
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:48,050
That was why
I couldn't talk to you before.

1625
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:51,260
But this is
the more honest feeling...

1626
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:55,260
- in my heart, I think.
- I see.

1627
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:57,530
(This is the more honest feeling
in my heart.)

1628
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:58,600
I see.

1629
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,430
- I had no idea.
- Right.

1630
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,140
Thanks for telling me.

1631
01:20:06,910 --> 01:20:10,180
If you hadn't told me,
I wouldn't have known.

1632
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:13,910
Right. It's foolish,

1633
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:16,350
I thought a lot about it by myself.

1634
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:23,260
As I had a long conversation
with Sang Hyeok today,

1635
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:26,830
I could see why
the divine spirit chose him...

1636
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:28,530
as my partner.

1637
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:32,500
What he thinks about
and the way he draws conclusions...

1638
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,340
are very similar to mine.

1639
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:37,640
And it's very enjoyable
to spend time with him.

1640
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:42,340
Yu Gyeong was a cool person,
just as I thought.

1641
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:45,010
I could feel that
she wanted to spend...

1642
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:47,050
more time with me.

1643
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:50,380
I think it's game over for them.

1644
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:51,950
- It's unusual.
- It's unusual.

1645
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:53,920
Watching the date,

1646
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:57,090
I can see why Yu Gyeong was
so nervous before the date.

1647
01:20:57,590 --> 01:21:00,560
We could see them
become absorbed in each other...

1648
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,900
- in a short amount of time.
- Yes.

1649
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:09,240
Sang Hyeok joined the group
belatedly.

1650
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,710
"What? I want to talk to her."

1651
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:14,110
"But things are going well
for her and another man."

1652
01:21:14,110 --> 01:21:15,710
- It was awkward for him...
- That's right.

1653
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:16,740
to interfere.

1654
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:18,850
That was why
he only watched her from afar.

1655
01:21:18,850 --> 01:21:20,280
But he got his chance today.

1656
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,350
- That's right.
- Exactly.

1657
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:22,850
Who knows what will happen now?

1658
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,820
- Thank you.
- Please enjoy.

1659
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,120
It looks good.

1660
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:30,990
It looks really good.

1661
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:32,560
- Here.
- Thank you.

1662
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:36,230
- It looks good.
- I should take this off.

1663
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,570
- Your coat?
- Do you want to take yours off?

1664
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:40,970
My goodness. Hold on.

1665
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:44,900
- You can keep it on.
- My skirt is short.

1666
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:45,910
Is that so?

1667
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:47,470
You should use this then.

1668
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:49,410
(Sang Hyeok gives her his coat.)

1669
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:50,810
- Shall I use this?
- Yes.

1670
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:52,110
Thanks.

1671
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:55,350
I think it'll be too long
since you're tall.

1672
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:56,820
It's okay if it drags a bit.

1673
01:21:58,590 --> 01:21:59,590
It's like a blanket.

1674
01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:02,820
(Sang Hyeok's long coat
solves the problem.)

1675
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:05,230
What's your ideal type?

1676
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:06,330
- Mine?
- Yes.

1677
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:10,700
Someone who has...

1678
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,270
her unique charms.

1679
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:15,400
Someone honest.

1680
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,440
I like someone like that.

1681
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,910
I think being honest is...

1682
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:21,440
(Staring)

1683
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:22,840
(Glancing over)
(Averting his eyes)

1684
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,710
It's all about voicing
what she likes...

1685
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:28,780
and dislikes.

1686
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:29,780
(Yu Gyeong meets his eye
as she listens.)

1687
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,120
Someone like that.

1688
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,890
I like such a woman.

1689
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:35,990
I'm drawn to such a woman.

1690
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,330
Do you find it hard to maintain
eye contact when you talk to people?

1691
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:42,560
You're the only one
who feels that way.

1692
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,560
Why?

1693
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,070
(Flustered)

1694
01:22:46,430 --> 01:22:48,470
It isn't that I avoid eye contact...

1695
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:49,940
- Do you do that to think?
- No.

1696
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:52,540
- Well,
- I'm curious.

1697
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:55,210
it's a bit... For example...
How should I put it?

1698
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:57,380
Please explain it to me.
I'm curious.

1699
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:01,920
Well, I rarely avoid eye contact.

1700
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,380
- But it just happened that way.
- Really?

1701
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:06,050
It was my first time hearing...

1702
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:08,560
- that I avoided eye contact.
- I see.

1703
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:10,920
(Staring)

1704
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,130
(Averting his eyes)

1705
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:15,300
I see.

1706
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,400
(Bursting out in laughter)

1707
01:23:22,370 --> 01:23:26,110
In any case,
you'll make a decision tomorrow.

1708
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:28,410
- Yes.
- Are you torn about anyone?

1709
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:30,580
Are you certain
about whom you'll choose?

1710
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:34,480
As for me...

1711
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:40,090
- The answer is up to you.
- Okay.

1712
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:45,330
(Torn)

1713
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,830
In any case, the one I choose...

1714
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:51,460
will be my destined partner.

1715
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:55,140
Thus, the relationship will be...

1716
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,180
a serious one.

1717
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,110
The relationship will be like that.

1718
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:06,250
- You're right.
- Yes.

1719
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,880
Because of that thought...

1720
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:10,220
To be honest,

1721
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:14,250
I had so many worries.

1722
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:16,120
"How am I supposed to resolve..."

1723
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,820
"this situation?"

1724
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:19,930
"Is this homework?"
I had that thought.

1725
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:21,190
Seriously.

1726
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:24,900
It's hard.

1727
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:27,770
(Before her destined partner,
her worries grow.)

1728
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:28,770
Yes.

1729
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:33,040
(Meanwhile)

1730
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:36,280
We should eat as if we're filming...

1731
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,310
- an eating show, right?
- That's right.

1732
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:40,050
Think of it as an eating show.

1733
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,120
That risotto was better.
The one we had on the first date.

1734
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,320
It was tasty.

1735
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:48,390
The steak was tasty too.

1736
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:49,590
(Embarrassed)

1737
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:51,990
(Eating)

1738
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:53,060
Totally.

1739
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:55,090
It's tasty.

1740
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,430
It's a beer snack.

1741
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,000
- It's a beer snack.
- We're eating with our hands.

1742
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:02,170
I want to eat like this.

1743
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:04,470
(Eating)

1744
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:07,210
(Grabbing)

1745
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:09,680
(Laughing)

1746
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,110
(Finding her cute)

1747
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:13,250
Don't laugh.

1748
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,520
- Excuse me?
- Right.

1749
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,950
(Being cheeky)

1750
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,320
(Laughing)

1751
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:20,990
Gosh.

1752
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:26,030
(She can't stop laughing
even with a small joke.)

1753
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:30,100
It was an unexpected dish.

1754
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,070
- But we came to a good place.
- Right.

1755
01:25:33,530 --> 01:25:34,530
It's nice.

1756
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:36,800
I feel better now.

1757
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,810
(Relieved)

1758
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:44,310
Will there be
something else tonight?

1759
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,150
I do feel excited.

1760
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:50,380
There might be something exciting.

1761
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:52,320
The night before
the final selection.

1762
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:53,690
There might be something
waiting for us.

1763
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:57,190
Everyone must feel restless.

1764
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,430
How do you think it will be...

1765
01:25:59,730 --> 01:26:00,830
when we return to the house?

1766
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:04,830
There will be people who will
try their best until the end.

1767
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:10,270
There will be people
who just go with the flow.

1768
01:26:15,610 --> 01:26:18,650
Did you make up your mind
while getting some rest today?

1769
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:22,980
Yes. I think I've made up my mind.

1770
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:29,920
What about you?

1771
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:36,000
At first,
I didn't even understand my heart.

1772
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,700
I kept feeling confused and
mixing it up with something else.

1773
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:42,240
That was how I felt,

1774
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,000
but at one point,
I felt completely lost...

1775
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:46,970
and had no idea what to do.

1776
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:52,280
I realized that I made things
too complicated for myself,

1777
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,750
so I emptied out my heart.

1778
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:59,520
I went with what my heart
was attracted to without thinking...

1779
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,550
and that made things a bit clearer.

1780
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,420
(One person came into
Yun Jeong's eyes.)

1781
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:08,290
I think I've never been
like that before.

1782
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:09,530
Really?

1783
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:11,460
I've never just followed
my true heart.

1784
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,270
You've decided to follow your heart.

1785
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:18,400
(Yun Jeong is following her heart
for the first time.)

1786
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:20,970
It was...

1787
01:27:23,610 --> 01:27:24,610
great...

1788
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:28,110
to be able to eat with you today.

1789
01:27:31,650 --> 01:27:36,620
It was a secret time
between ourselves.

1790
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:39,830
It's a moment
that only we will remember.

1791
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:43,230
We did a lot of talking together.

1792
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:45,200
I had an expectation...

1793
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:49,970
that I would be...

1794
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:51,500
taking a place in his heart.

1795
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:53,270
Also,

1796
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:57,210
I wished that he would...

1797
01:27:57,210 --> 01:27:59,050
feel the same way about me as well.

1798
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,710
That's me being honest about it.

1799
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:05,890
- Do you want to take a picture?
- Let's do it.

1800
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:07,720
(Moving close)

1801
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:12,360
Where must I look?

1802
01:28:14,530 --> 01:28:15,900
It looks nice.

1803
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:18,260
(Saving their memory with pictures)

1804
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:27,540
During their date today,

1805
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:29,610
Yun Jeong was with Ho Am,

1806
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:32,510
and she kept looking bright.

1807
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:34,480
- Right.
- She laughed a lot,

1808
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,920
and it made
even us feel comfortable.

1809
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:36,950
- Right.
- Right.

1810
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:39,090
It was great to see her be honest
about her wanting him...

1811
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:40,920
- Right.
- to feel the same way about her.

1812
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:42,720
To be honest,

1813
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,160
- I'm still rooting for them.
- Same here.

1814
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:48,360
- They look great together.
- They really do.

1815
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:52,770
It must be delicious.

1816
01:28:52,770 --> 01:28:54,730
- Gosh, this is great.
- It's great!

1817
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:59,070
This is amazing.

1818
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,910
- Omakase.
- It must be delicious.

1819
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:04,310
Omakase.

1820
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:09,050
- Hello.
- Hello.

1821
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:11,320
Thank you.

1822
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:16,390
This is amazing.

1823
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:18,990
It looks really good.

1824
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:21,690
It looks delicious.

1825
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:24,500
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

1826
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,700
(Amazed)

1827
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:30,000
- Is it good?
- It's amazing.

1828
01:29:32,370 --> 01:29:33,640
(Satisfied)

1829
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:37,280
I think I'm going to eat
too quickly.

1830
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:39,610
(A dinner meal
that is perfect for their tastes)

1831
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:42,120
The shrimp is really good.

1832
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:43,720
- The shrimp? Where is it?
- Yes.

1833
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:44,880
(Laughing)

1834
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,090
- This one?
- The one next to that.

1835
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:49,860
- No. The one next to that.
- Is there another shrimp?

1836
01:29:50,190 --> 01:29:51,560
- That one.
- This one?

1837
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:52,560
Yes.

1838
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:55,760
Do you travel?

1839
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:57,630
I like traveling.

1840
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,470
Where was the last place
you visited recently?

1841
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:03,200
The last time I went somewhere
was for a prayer.

1842
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:07,340
My friend said Mount Gyeryong
had great energy.

1843
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:08,810
I go to Mount Gyeryong often.

1844
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:10,540
- Does it have great energy?
- It does.

1845
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:13,550
- Really?
- It's a great place to pray.

1846
01:30:13,550 --> 01:30:14,780
- Really?
- Yes.

1847
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:16,280
Do you always pray like this?

1848
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:17,550
(Nodding)

1849
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,920
I want to visit.

1850
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:24,260
(Looking intently)

1851
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:27,430
- Let's go together.
- That sounds good.

1852
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:36,970
We got comfortable
with each other quickly.

1853
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,440
I'm a bit like this.

1854
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:40,910
I get comfortable
with people quickly.

1855
01:30:42,710 --> 01:30:46,480
You must make others
feel comfortable.

1856
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:47,650
I guess so.

1857
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:53,550
(Looking intently)

1858
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:57,520
What is it?

1859
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:01,830
Do you have something to say?

1860
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,610
What was that? What did I just see?

1861
01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:15,070
- What was that?
- This is a new moment...

1862
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:16,280
in Korean dating show history.

1863
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:21,850
- He has long legs as he's tall.
- Right.

1864
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:23,220
He just did that?

1865
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:24,350
(Going wild)

1866
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:26,690
(Focused)

1867
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:31,660
Right.

1868
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,390
I think it'll be fun
if we head back and play a game.

1869
01:31:34,890 --> 01:31:37,300
I wish we could play
something like Game of Truth.

1870
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:43,040
- Game of Truth?
- Don't you think it'll be fun?

1871
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:48,070
What do you want to ask...

1872
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:49,380
- if we are to play?
- Me?

1873
01:31:52,610 --> 01:31:56,850
While being here...

1874
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:01,490
and trying to meet someone,

1875
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:05,690
I want to ask about each person's
greatest competitor.

1876
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:08,030
That's an awesome one.

1877
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:09,930
That's an awesome one.

1878
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:11,060
(Sang Hyeok mentioned
a sharp question.)

1879
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:12,500
- That kind of question...
- That must be fun to ask.

1880
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:16,100
- That's a good one.
- That's interesting.

1881
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:18,470
There's a reason that's a good one.

1882
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:22,710
That would be a great chance
to express their hearts.

1883
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:25,710
- Right.
- If they answer it...

1884
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:28,580
The moment that is answered,

1885
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:30,780
everyone will know
who they have in their heart.

1886
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:34,020
If Yu Gyeong is to say
it's Kyung Eon, that would mean...

1887
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:35,720
- Right.
- Right.

1888
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:37,990
- My goodness.
- That's how it'll be.

1889
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:40,530
I have a competitor too.

1890
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,660
- Really?
- Yes.

1891
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:52,040
There was someone who I thought
was very charming out of the men.

1892
01:32:52,370 --> 01:32:54,740
I still do think that way.

1893
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:00,180
You still think that way?

1894
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:02,150
Yes.

1895
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:06,320
I think I know who it is.

1896
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:09,360
Who is it? Whisper it to me.

1897
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,690
(Whispering)

1898
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:12,730
You're right.

1899
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:17,200
(Byeong Yeol?)

1900
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,030
You're right.

1901
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:20,770
He's charming.

1902
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:29,740
(Sang Hyeok's answer
felt significant.)

1903
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:34,880
There's something I'm curious about.

1904
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:38,050
Well... Should I not bring this up?

1905
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:40,390
Tell me.

1906
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,760
- Tomorrow...
- Yes?

1907
01:33:52,130 --> 01:33:54,200
There must be someone...

1908
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:56,740
you have in mind...

1909
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,600
for the final selection.

1910
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,040
But...

1911
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:05,040
does that person
make you feel certain too?

1912
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:10,120
(Thinking)

1913
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:13,420
I can see that
he's making an effort.

1914
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:16,290
I see.

1915
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:19,190
There's no certainty,

1916
01:34:19,190 --> 01:34:22,630
but I do see that
he's making an effort.

1917
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:31,470
(Whom will their shaking hearts...)

1918
01:34:31,470 --> 01:34:35,670
(head toward?)

1919
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:38,980
(At that moment)

1920
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:40,910
(Looking around)

1921
01:34:41,850 --> 01:34:43,420
Is Yu Gyeong here?

1922
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,290
- Yu Gyeong?
- I couldn't see her today.

1923
01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:47,650
- You couldn't?
- No.

1924
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:49,320
Where did you lose her?

1925
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:51,990
- Where did she go?
- "Where did you lose her?"

1926
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:54,330
Where did Yu Gyeong go?

1927
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:55,800
I guess more than one man chose her.

1928
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:59,470
She said she was heading out
in the afternoon.

1929
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:01,170
- Really?
- Right.

1930
01:35:01,870 --> 01:35:04,270
She must've had a date
with one person in the morning...

1931
01:35:04,270 --> 01:35:06,140
and another date in the afternoon.

1932
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,080
Is that possible?

1933
01:35:11,710 --> 01:35:15,280
(Byeong Yeol is lost in confusion.)

1934
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,950
Did you make your decision?

1935
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:19,290
Did you?

1936
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:21,220
I've...

1937
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:23,120
(Kyung Eon doesn't know anything.)

1938
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:24,560
- made up my mind.
- You did?

1939
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:25,590
(Kyung Eon doesn't know anything.)

1940
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:26,860
You said you didn't know.

1941
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,460
You've made up your mind?

1942
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:33,470
This is what
I'm slightly disappointed about.

1943
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:36,900
I think I might have made up my mind
a bit too quickly.

1944
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:41,040
- You could feel that way.
- Right.

1945
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:46,310
I might have closed the doors
to my heart too quickly.

1946
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:48,510
- To the others?
- Right.

1947
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:53,050
- You could feel that way.
- In my opinion...

1948
01:35:53,050 --> 01:35:54,350
What was that?

1949
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:55,590
In my opinion,

1950
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:57,060
there was someone else
who would've clicked with me.

1951
01:36:00,490 --> 01:36:05,360
(In between shaking fate...)

1952
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:24,850
(and certain hearts)

1953
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:31,820
(How will things end
in this confusion?)

1954
01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:43,270
- I choose Sang Hyeok.
- Me?

1955
01:36:43,270 --> 01:36:44,340
Yes.

1956
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:56,280
(The suffocating Game of Truth
a day before the final selection)

1957
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:02,020
Who are you most attracted to?

1958
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:06,730
Isn't this too hard to answer?

1959
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:09,400
Why are you being like this to me?

1960
01:37:20,110 --> 01:37:22,070
(Sighing)

1961
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:36,120
This is fun.

1962
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:42,430
(Fortune Tellers' Love 2)

1963
01:37:42,430 --> 01:37:46,200
(The time for the final selection
has come during the confusion)

1964
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,830
(Let's play the Game of Truth.)

1965
01:37:47,830 --> 01:37:48,900
(I choose Sang Hyeok.)

1966
01:37:49,770 --> 01:37:50,770
(This is fun.)

1967
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:53,110
(Did you want my interest?)

1968
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:54,810
(What if we could go back in time?)

1969
01:37:54,810 --> 01:37:57,740
(With you from the past...)

1970
01:37:57,740 --> 01:38:00,480
(Between shaking fate...)

1971
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:06,220
(and anxious hearts)

1972
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:08,450
(She must've been
attracted to me spiritually.)

1973
01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:09,790
(I've made up my mind.)

1974
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:11,720
(The day of the final selection)

1975
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,190
(Will they follow their instincts?)

1976
01:38:13,190 --> 01:38:16,460
(Will they follow
their inevitable fates?)

1977
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:19,160
(Gosh, I feel drained.)

1978
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:23,900
