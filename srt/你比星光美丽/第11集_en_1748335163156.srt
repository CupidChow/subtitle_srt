1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to pass through the water and you in my mind

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Even if I encounter a miracle, I'll be lost in the mist

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the mist

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I can't see the courage in the crowd

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm afraid I'll be distracted by the crowd

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to go to the end of my own life

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I forgot the original myself

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to go to the end of the road and you in my mind

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sure I'll be lost in the mist

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid I'll be distracted by the crowd

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm afraid I'll be distracted by the crowd

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I want to go to the end of the road and you in my mind

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I won't give up

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll be distracted by the crowd

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Even if I'm distracted by the crowd

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Here

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Thank you

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You're welcome

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll wash the clothes and return it to you soon

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's okay

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll look after your ass when I go back

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You should go back and rest

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm leaving

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Bye

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
insgesamt

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Your ass is amazing

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't offer it as an abuse

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,640
Come.

31
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,040
Slowly之前

32
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,960
If

33
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,040
if anyone is troubled about

34
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,220
the micro Communicon.

35
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,020
You are聰明.

36
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,060
I will also make you

37
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,100
a slightly different person

38
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,140
to move around on micro predictable son.

39
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,960
I'll buy some fruits.

40
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll buy some fruits.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,160
Here, have some fruits.

42
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
I'll buy some fruits.

43
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,000
Here.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll buy some fruits.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What are you doing?

46
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,840
You're so thin recently.

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Are you tired?

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm not thin.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm so thin.

50
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,000
You're still laughing.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You're even thinner than me.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let me tell you.

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The biggest wish of being a mother

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
is to have a child

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,960
to be happy and healthy.

56
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,960
It's okay to be normal for the rest of your life.

57
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
Don't be too tired.

58
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,960
I'm happy.

59
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
I didn't see it.

60
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
I'm just lying to your father.

61
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
You

62
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
have a lot of feelings when you're young.

63
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,960
But life is not easy.

64
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,960
Actually, from the beginning,

65
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
I think it's good.

66
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
Life is not always the same.

67
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
It's changing every day.

68
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,960
Everything is normal.

69
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,920
Do you know that?

70
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,920
You think I'm a loser again, right?

71
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
I just want to tell you.

72
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
Look, this job

73
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
is changing.

74
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,920
It's over.

75
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
You'll understand when you're a mother.

76
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,920
You'll meet a lot of customers in your life.

77
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Some of them

78
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,920
just have a meal with you.

79
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Some of them

80
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
have been with you for a few years.

81
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,920
If you're with you for a lifetime,

82
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
maybe you'll meet them very soon.

83
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
Yes, yes, yes.

84
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
It's okay.

85
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
What are you talking about?

86
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
You're a woman.

87
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
You're a woman.

88
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
You're a woman.

89
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Don't be so sweet.

90
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Eat more.

91
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
I'm just kidding.

92
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
Didn't you say you like

93
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,920
the one in the third sister's picture?

94
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
I'll find it for you.

95
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
I'll find it for you.

96
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
You're a boss.

97
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
You're usually busy.

98
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
Can you

99
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
eat with your mother?

100
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
The place we live in

101
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
is too crowded.

102
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
The medical resources are limited.

103
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,920
There are no urgent conditions.

104
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,920
The patient's blood pressure is too high.

105
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
We've tried our best.

106
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Be safe.

107
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,920
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,920
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Ms. Cong Ming Guo.

137
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
I'm the brand manager of the construction company.

138
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Do you like the promotion

139
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
of our brand?

140
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
Okay.

141
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
I'll cooperate with you.

142
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
You can come to our store at any time.

143
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
I'll send you the location.

144
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
You just need to help us

145
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,920
promote the live broadcast.

146
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Okay.

147
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
I'll go there tomorrow.

148
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
You've been so fast this year.

149
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Yes.

150
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
I'm home.

151
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,920
I've seen you several times this year.

152
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
You're going to work, right?

153
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
You don't have time to work.

154
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
You're working now.

155
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
You're even busier.

156
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Then what if your daughter's dream comes true?

157
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
You can tell the manager

158
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
that your daughter is good.

159
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Just like you and

160
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Chu Yi were my best friends.

161
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
I don't care if you succeed.

162
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
Just think of it as you're busy

163
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
and go back to your hometown early.

164
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
That's necessary.

165
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
Although it's not new

166
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
in the new year,

167
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
but everyone

168
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,920
is busy with

169
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
the family.

170
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
That's the problem, right?

171
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Yes.

172
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
I'll go back to you

173
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
when I'm back.

174
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Don't be so annoying

175
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
in the next three or five days.

176
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Your temperament

177
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
is what I'm used to

178
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
for you.

179
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
Listen to me.

180
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
You're different now.

181
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
You're the boss.

182
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
You should learn from Xiaohan.

183
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
I'll take care of you.

184
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
Yes.

185
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
You're so independent.

186
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
You're more mature than you were in the past.

187
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
You must be suffering a lot

188
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
from outside.

189
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
As a child,

190
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
I feel very far away

191
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
from him.

192
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
You take me to say goodbye to him.

193
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
Let him take care of himself.

194
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Let him have time

195
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
to come to our house anytime.

196
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
I'll welcome him anytime.

197
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Okay, I'll take you there.

198
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
You care about him a lot.

199
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
I care more about you.

200
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Hello.

201
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Hello.

202
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
Lu Lingjia?

203
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Why are you here?

204
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
I'm shooting an ad today.

205
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Come on.

206
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Are you an ad artist?

207
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
My business is very wide.

208
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Come on.

209
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
Now, add my WeChat.

210
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
I'll send you the number.

211
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
I'll contact you when I have something to do.

212
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
Hurry up.

213
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
You're a fan of Jia Luo?

214
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
What do you mean?

215
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
I want you to know

216
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
the taste of the shirt.

217
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Are you a fan?

218
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Yes, I'm a fan.

219
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
I'm a fan.

220
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
I'm a fan of Jia Luo.

221
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
I'm a fan of Jia Luo.

222
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Yes, I'm a fan.

223
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
You're a fan.

224
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
I'm a fan.

225
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
You're a fan.

226
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Tell you Lu Lingjia.

227
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
You don't want to add my WeChat in your life.

228
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
I'm not shooting an ad.

229
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Lu Lingjia, what do you want to do?

230
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,920
Ruoshu, you're here.

231
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
President Liu, let me introduce you to

232
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,920
the famous Internet celebrity.

233
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
He's a smart guy in the Nimbus tree.

234
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
I'll leave the rest to you.

235
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
I'll leave the rest to you.

236
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Leave the rest to me. Don't worry.

237
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
I'll go now.

238
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Song Mingguo, let's get ready for the next girl.

239
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Now, there's a chance to get a big gift.

240
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Okay, babies.

241
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Today, the Google is on the electric car

242
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,920
and the power supply is here.

243
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Thank you for your support.

244
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Bye.

245
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
Thank you.

246
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
Thank you.

247
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
Thank you so much.

248
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Lu Shao has always recommended you to us.

249
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
He said your live broadcast is very active.

250
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
I saw it just now.

251
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
You're really good at it.

252
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
Thank you.

253
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
I'll give you the car.

254
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Give it to me.

255
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Thank you.

256
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Thank you.

257
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
Thank you.

258
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
We'll have a chance to work together next time.

259
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
See you.

260
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
See you.

261
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
I don't want to thank you.

262
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
It's because

263
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
you sent me a message.

264
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
Okay.

265
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,920
Boss,

266
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
the message is on the floor.

267
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Okay.

268
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,920
Tang Tazhu.

269
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,920
Miss Xi.

270
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Hello, Tang Tazhu.

271
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,920
I have something to ask you.

272
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
But I'm on the way.

273
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Tell me.

274
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Tell me.

275
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,920
Can we

276
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,920
use the winter vacation to buy three-d shoes?

277
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Yes.

278
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Use the winter vacation to buy three-d shoes.

279
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
Because the number of shoes

280
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
in the high-end is too small.

281
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,920
If our small enterprises are on the line,

282
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
they will be on the line for a long time.

283
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Then we can buy it.

284
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Then we can continue.

285
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
It's like this.

286
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
I've finished reading the comments

287
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Mr. Han gave me.

288
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
I've made a new work plan.

289
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,920
Now there are only three things in the new project.

290
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Expand the team,

291
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
find the laboratory

292
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,920
and buy three-d shoes.

293
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
Isn't it almost New Year's Eve?

294
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,920
I want to put the photos

295
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
and find the laboratory after the New Year.

296
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,920
But buying a shoe

297
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,920
is a must.

298
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,920
Then why do you want to ask him?

299
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
So what do you want me to do?

300
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
It's just that

301
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
in the help of the department,

302
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
we can meet

303
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
me and the equipment factory

304
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
and pull a group.

305
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
Then which side of the boss?

306
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
This can be temporarily

307
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
not moved by Mr. Han.

308
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,920
Open the workshop.

309
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,920
Okay.

310
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
Okay.

311
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
Thank you.

312
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
You're so good.

313
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
Thank you.

314
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Then

315
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,920
come to my office.

316
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Let's go.

317
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
Let's go.

318
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Why didn't you come to me?

319
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
I think

320
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
you don't have to

321
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,920
bother yourself with these small things.

322
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
If you're not coming,

323
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
you have to be careful.

324
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,920
Can I?

325
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
You mean

326
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,920
you can buy three-d shoes

327
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,920
with Dongyang's channel?

328
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
It depends on whether you agree.

329
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
And 5% of shares.

330
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Then I'll figure it out myself.

331
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
Han Zao.

332
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Yes.

333
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
I'm leaving.

334
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,920
Lili, help me.

335
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
Do you have any way

336
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
to buy equipment quickly?

337
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
I'll do it.

338
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Lili, you?

339
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Dad.

340
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
I'll do it.

341
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
I have an urgent matter.

342
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
You have to eat first.

343
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
If you have any worries,

344
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,920
I can help you solve it.

345
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,920
If someone scolds me,

346
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
you have to scold me.

347
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Who is so bold?

348
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,920
How dare you?

349
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
It's not important

350
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
who is not important.

351
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,920
You don't need to

352
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
do this kind of thing.

353
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
I'm leaving.

354
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Our relationship now

355
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,920
is very comfortable

356
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
and pure.

357
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
I don't want to ruin this feeling.

358
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,920
Once you're separated,

359
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
you can't go out

360
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,920
if you want to.

361
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,920
I'll wait for you.

362
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
I'm back.

363
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,920
Xing Xing, you're off work so early.

364
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
What's wrong with you today?

365
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,920
You're in such a good condition.

366
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
I told you.

367
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,920
I have a car.

368
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,920
I want a electric car.

369
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
I've already planned it.

370
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
I'll give you a helmet

371
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,920
when you're back.

372
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
I'll take you out for a ride.

373
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
Okay.

374
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
Why did you suddenly buy an electric car?

375
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
It's not a car.

376
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
Xing Xing,

377
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
he introduced me to a guy

378
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
in his family.

379
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
Although he's a brainless person,

380
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
he's not a reliable friend.

381
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,920
But

382
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,920
he told me to buy an electric car.

383
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
I'll

384
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
put it down and buy it.

385
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
Do you think

386
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
I'm not going to the hospital?

387
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
I'll go to the hospital

388
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
and get rid of my new job.

389
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,920
New job?

390
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
What?

391
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
What are you doing?

392
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
I'm going to a new dating company with a friend.

393
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
I'll be a few days' job.

394
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
I'll be a delivery man

395
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
and buy a new customer

396
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
at the same time.

397
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,920
I'll be the salesman.

398
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
This is called

399
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
a good-looking man

400
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,920
with a good look.

401
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,920
Great.

402
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,920
Come on.

403
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
I'll listen to you.

404
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
Xing Xing,

405
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
I don't know

406
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
if you've ever heard of a fish.

407
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
Come on.

408
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
I'll send you a gift

409
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
for the new job.

410
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
You're so lucky.

411
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
I'll give you a hand-pick.

412
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,920
I'm going to the house now.

413
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Are you going to the house?

414
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
Don't be shy.

415
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
I'll go to the supermarket.

416
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
I'll make more technical resources.

417
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,920
I'm going to the house now.

418
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,920
It's worth a lifetime,

419
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,920
I can't forget.

420
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,920
You can sing

421
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
as long as you want.

422
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Thank you, auntie.

423
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
The piano is very good.

424
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
How about you try it?

425
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
I'm not here to buy the piano.

426
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,920
I don't know how to play it.

427
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
I'm just

428
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
attracted by your singing

429
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
and your feeling.

430
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Auntie, don't say that.

431
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
Everyone

432
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,920
can't start from the beginning.

433
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,920
In my heart,

434
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,920
I think the beauty of music

435
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
is actually

436
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
the difference in culture.

437
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,920
But as long as you think about it,

438
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,920
you can communicate with the world.

439
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,920
You're really good.

440
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Are you a student

441
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,920
from the Hong Kong Night School?

442
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
Yes, I'm a student of Xingyi.

443
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,920
But I've graduated.

444
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
I'm here to stick to it.

445
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
You're here to stick to it?

446
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,920
Yes.

447
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Auntie,

448
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,920
if you have a little friend

449
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
who wants to learn music,

450
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
you can find me anytime.

451
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
I can go up the stairs

452
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
and give you a discount.

453
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Really?

454
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
Yes.

455
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
That's great.

456
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,920
You're really a good musician.

457
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
My family is looking for a teacher.

458
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Really?

459
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,920
How old is your little friend?

460
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
What level is he?

461
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
Or do you think

462
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
he's convenient?

463
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,920
I'll go see him.

464
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
Our little friend

465
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
is a teacher.

466
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
It's me.

467
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
But I'm a foundation.

468
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
I don't know anything.

469
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,920
Can you teach me?

470
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
Yes.

471
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
Then...

472
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Liu.

473
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
Goodbye.

474
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,920
That's too much.

475
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
What's wrong?

476
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Mr. Wu,

477
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Sao Li,

478
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
his wife got divorced recently.

479
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
His wife is in a mess.

480
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
She's taking a picture of her.

481
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
And she's a little Sao.

482
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,920
What?

483
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,920
Look.

484
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,920
It's been so long.

485
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Why is she still not letting go?

486
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Who can be so commentative?

487
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
Qing,

488
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
should I write a small letter

489
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,920
and scold her?

490
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Wait a minute.

491
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
I'll call her.

492
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Hi, Li Li, what are you doing?

493
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
I'm calling you right now.

494
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
I've found the venue.

495
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,920
I'll go to the local restaurant tomorrow morning.

496
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
Great.

497
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
You're welcome.

498
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
Well...

499
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
You're on the Internet.

500
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Yes.

501
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
What's the big deal?

502
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
I'm just scolded by the netizens

503
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,920
who are under the unknown.

504
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
They don't want me to eat,

505
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
dress, date,

506
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
or anything else.

507
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
I don't care what they say.

508
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Okay, I'll hang up now, baby.

509
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Li Li, you're so handsome.

510
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
Okay, I'll be relieved.

511
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Let's go tomorrow.

512
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
Okay.

513
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
Okay, bye.

514
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Li Li, it's okay.

515
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
You can work.

516
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Okay.

517
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
Sister Xing,

518
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
you said

519
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
Li Li is also

520
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
doing this job for our sake.

521
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
Should we

522
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
invite Li Li

523
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
to work in the city?

524
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
I'm telling you,

525
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
I really think

526
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
Li Li's work is very capable.

527
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
I've thought about this.

528
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,920
But I'm afraid

529
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
our temple is too small

530
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
and I'll be in trouble.

531
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
How could this be?

532
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
Sister Xing,

533
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,920
we're

534
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
a backup company.

535
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
We're a big city.

536
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,920
Let me think about it.

537
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
Think about it.

538
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Work.

539
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Okay.

540
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Look,

541
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,920
here are all the SLM 800.

542
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
There are 25 of them.

543
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
The rest are all SLM 600.

544
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
These are all

545
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
we've prepared

546
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
for the world-wide

547
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
eight-world world in a month.

548
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
By the way, Miss Ji,

549
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
you're preparing for the seven stages.

550
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
We only need one stage.

551
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,920
One stage?

552
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,920
I'll give you the first stage now.

553
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
If you count the production

554
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,920
and the operation,

555
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
it'll take

556
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
about half a year.

557
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
It takes so long.

558
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
It takes so long.

559
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
We're in a hurry.

560
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
Is there any way

561
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
to make it faster?

562
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
Look, there are so many goods here.

563
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,920
Can you take one for us?

564
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
These are all

565
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
the products

566
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
that were prepared in advance.

567
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
They're all in the inventory.

568
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
You've been working on this for so long.

569
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
Can you talk about the price?

570
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Miss Li,

571
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
you only need one stage.

572
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
And now

573
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,920
you're in the purchasing price.

574
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
If you take the discount again,

575
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
the company

576
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
will deduct my money.

577
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
We're mainly

578
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
still in the previous stage of the experiment.

579
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
But our company

580
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,920
is developing very fast.

581
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,920
When our products

582
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
arrive at the mass production,

583
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
they'll definitely

584
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
buy it again.

585
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
I also follow

586
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,920
the company's rule of thumb.

587
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,920
There's really no way

588
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
to do the price.

589
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,920
Please understand.

590
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Well, I'll take my leave.

591
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
Thank you.

592
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Thank you.

593
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
Come, this way.

594
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
President Chang is here.

595
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
President Chang is here.

596
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
Well.

597
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
You didn't ask me to come here.

598
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
I had to come here early.

599
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
Aren't you

600
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
busy with the project

601
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
of the robot Xiao Bai recently?

602
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
The important thing

603
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,920
is that I'm really busy with the head-banging.

604
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,920
Isn't it that the machine-torn hospital is always out of the way?

605
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,920
The size of the head-banging is so small.

606
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,920
Right?

607
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,920
Isn't it very white recently?

608
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
It's very gray.

609
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
Tell me about it later.

610
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,920
The projects I've been working on

611
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,920
are all big hospitals.

612
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,920
This time, the robot Xiao Bai

613
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,920
needs some basic medical resources.

614
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
I'm not good enough.

615
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Why don't you help me

616
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,920
to buy some fresh air?

617
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
It's a small matter.

618
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
Didn't Dong Yi

619
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,920
just make the robot-torn hospital?

620
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,920
Dong Ge is a model.

621
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
Dong Ge's medical system

622
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,920
is very low in the second and third-tier cities.

623
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
It's easy to protect

624
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
and protect you from the virus.

625
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
Or else,

626
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,920
let's officially sign a strategic agreement

627
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
and work together.

628
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
Okay.

629
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
But

630
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
Guang Hua is

631
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,920
Dong Yi's investment company.

632
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
Dong Ge is Dong Yi's

633
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
strongest opponent.

634
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,920
How can we open

635
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
this deep cooperation?

636
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,920
I don't think so at all.

637
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
It's great that

638
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Han Ting hasn't come back.

639
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
I've used all my resources

640
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
to you.

641
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
Han Ting came back

642
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
and you told me

643
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,920
that you knew it.

644
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,920
What are you talking about?

645
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,920
I want to know

646
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,920
what you want.

647
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
I won't ask you out.

648
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
Miss Ji, you're young.

649
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,920
You can work in your own business.

650
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
You can do it.

651
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
If you need any money

652
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
in the future,

653
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,920
we'll arrange it in advance.

654
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,920
But we can't do it this time.

655
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
I understand.

656
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
Then, Lily,

657
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
let's go back to Dongyang

658
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
and tell the boss

659
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,920
that there are too few doctors.

660
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,920
They can't give the doctor.

661
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,920
Let's talk about it in Dongyang.

662
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Okay.

663
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Thank you for your help.

664
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
We'll go first.

665
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,920
Which Dongyang

666
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
was you talking about?

667
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,920
There's only one Dongyang in China.

668
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,920
Our investment company is Dongyang.

669
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Can you tell us

670
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
which one is responsible?

671
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,920
Han Ting.

672
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
I'm just saying

673
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
that our new technology

674
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
is not limited to money.

675
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Please sit here for a while.

676
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
Mr. Lin

677
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
went out for business today.

678
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
I'll call him

679
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,920
and report to him.

680
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
Okay.

681
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,920
Sit down.

682
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
Thank you.

683
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
Smart.

684
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
So realistic.

685
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
I've seen all the sales

686
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
before.

687
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
Besides, you didn't lie to me.

688
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
I'm sorry.

689
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Han Ting's name

690
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
is quite good.

691
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
No.

692
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Mr. Lin,

693
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,920
you're apologizing to me

694
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
yesterday.

695
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
You've misunderstood.

696
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,920
How could it be?

697
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
Someone's helping me.

698
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
When will you come to my house?

699
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,920
You know what I like most?

700
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,920
The goal is to be brave.

701
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
Don't amplified your real appearance.

702
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
Too busy is tough.

703
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
But sometimes,

704
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,920
we can compete

705
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
with different levels of skill.

706
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
The dragonει bridge

707
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
makes me angry.

708
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
It's easy

709
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
to give up ayud,

710
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
but people leave from it.

711
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,240
Don't tell me.

712
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,120
Don't scare me.

713
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,240
Your taste is good.

714
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,360
I've seen it.

715
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,640
You've been trying to get to Hanping.

716
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
Have you ever thought

717
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,040
if he would care about you?

718
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,400
If he doesn't,

719
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,960
he's my biggest investment.

720
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,640
If I don't get him,

721
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,920
who will I get?

722
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,080
Hello, Mr. Lin.

723
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,320
Mr. Dong.

724
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,640
Do you know

725
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,160
the machine next to Xingte?

726
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,640
The machine?

727
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,240
Please wait.

728
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,760
Have some water.

729
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,080
Have some water.

730
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,080
Thank you.

731
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Mr. Lin said

732
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,760
he could take a machine

733
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,000
from another unit.

734
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,960
Thank you so much.

735
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,160
What about the time of the promotion?

736
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,000
That's right.

737
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,400
It's about to be New Year's Eve.

738
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,960
You must give Xingte a promotion first.

739
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,920
Thank you.

740
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,840
Let's talk about the contract details.

741
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,720
Okay.

742
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,840
Sorry.

743
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,320
Please talk to Mr. Lin.

744
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,200
I'll answer the phone.

745
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:43,840
Okay.

746
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,560
Can we

747
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,880
give you another 5% discount

748
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,000
for this project?

749
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,320
Miss Li,

750
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,840
it's our limit

751
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
to give you a machine

752
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,120
from another unit.

753
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,000
Moreover,

754
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
you can't

755
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,520
do anything about the price

756
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,040
as long as you want.

757
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,800
And you don't have any cash.

758
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,120
Don't worry.

759
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,440
Xingte is not a grasshopper.

760
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:11,960
Right.

761
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,920
Xingte and Beidi

762
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,080
will have many contracts.

763
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,480
At that time,

764
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,840
we won't give you a discount.

765
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,640
Mr. Ji and Mr. Han

766
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,840
are college classmates.

767
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,800
Mr. Han really appreciates Mr. Ji.

768
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,680
He wants to start a business

769
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,480
and he's the first one to invest.

770
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,480
Don't forget.

771
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,920
Mr. Ji and Mr. Han

772
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,240
are very low-key people.

773
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,000
Don't let others

774
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,120
pay too much attention to them.

775
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,000
I see.

776
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,160
Mr. Ji and Mr. Han

777
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,920
have similar ideas.

778
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,120
So Mr. Han invested a lot.

779
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,720
Mr. Han is really a good guy.

780
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,320
Mr. Lin and I

781
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,400
are very impressed

782
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,280
to see you

783
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,920
have the guts to do this.

784
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,080
How about this?

785
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,520
I'll make a decision.

786
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,640
I'll give you

787
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,880
5% discount

788
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,680
for this contract.

789
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,080
Thank you so much.

790
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,960
Thank you so much.

791
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:07,880
By the way,

792
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,480
Mr. Lin called just now.

793
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,600
He wants to treat you two to a meal tomorrow noon.

794
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,680
I don't know...

795
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,400
Okay.

796
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,000
Okay.

797
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,800
But we have to ask for this.

798
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,040
I'll send you the restaurant.

799
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,560
Okay.

800
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,080
Mr. Lin said

801
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,480
he was on the way to the car

802
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,520
and he was late.

803
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,080
How is the company?

804
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,360
If we still can't find

805
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,600
the conditions for 5%

806
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,520
we'll be in trouble.

807
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,320
Mr. Han,

808
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,240
the arrangement is going well.

809
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,080
It's a pity that

810
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,120
we have to keep

811
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,760
the shares of 5%

812
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,680
for ourselves.

813
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,200
How can we solve this?

814
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,560
Business secrets.

815
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,160
Hello.

816
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,680
We'll have a meal together later.

817
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,680
I have something to tell you.

818
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,600
Okay.

819
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,760
I didn't expect that

820
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,720
you're a free entrepreneur.

821
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,680
You're so hardworking.

822
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,360
You don't only waste your sister-in-law

823
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,760
but also your heart.

824
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,320
Especially that apple.

825
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,480
It's so pitiful.

826
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,400
Look.

827
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:30,960
This...

828
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,960
It's not good to see it on the table.

829
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,080
It's white.

830
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,480
This...

831
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,000
It's not good.

832
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,800
And Mr. Lu is the key.

833
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,560
One apple and one Mr. Lu.

834
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,600
They're just enemies.

835
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,280
They're my birdies.

836
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,080
You're so lucky.

837
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,480
If Mr. Lu

838
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,200
shows up in my live broadcast room again,

839
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,640
I'll kick him out.

840
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,480
That's right.

841
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,800
I should have done that.

842
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,960
I should have

843
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,720
kicked that Mr. Mi

844
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,600
and Mr. Mi out.

845
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,040
But,

846
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,240
you're talking about this.

847
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,240
I remember

848
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,200
my son.

849
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,720
My son.

850
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,360
His father passed away early.

851
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,840
I was just a child.

852
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
I was afraid of him

853
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,040
when I was young.

854
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,360
So I was so proud of him.

855
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,160
I was so proud of him.

856
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
I didn't expect that

857
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,240
he was so bad.

858
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,160
How long has it been since he graduated from college?

859
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,920
He's been so hardworking.

860
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,840
He's not like me.

861
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,240
I'm so old.

862
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,200
I'm still learning to sing and play the flute.

863
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,600
How can you compare with your grandma?

864
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,360
Auntie Han.

865
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,160
Besides,

866
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,800
your sister-in-law is not that old.

867
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,560
You're so sweet.

868
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,400
Have a good soup.

869
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,240
Drink more.

870
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,560
Thank you, Auntie.

871
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:38,920
You look good.

872
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,840
You look good.

873
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,240
I'll take a photo.

874
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,280
Here.

875
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,960
This shop is quite expensive.

876
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,400
500 yuan per person.

877
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,960
Mr. Ji,

878
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,200
you're so low on money.

879
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,720
Such a big person

880
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,840
needs to pay back.

881
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,600
You like it more than a little.

882
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,600
Here.

883
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,960
The company has got the investment.

884
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,600
It's a normal business banquet.

885
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,000
Give me a chance

886
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,200
to treat you well.

887
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,760
Just treat me to a spicy soup.

888
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,600
It's expensive.

889
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,800
Men should treat me.

890
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,400
What are you busy with lately?

891
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,360
Do you want to come to Xing Chen?

892
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,960
Xing Chen just started.

893
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,000
But there's a business behind it.

894
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,240
You come here to do

895
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,800
the purchasing and sales.

896
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,280
You can help me.

897
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,760
Xin Xin.

898
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,600
I don't want to trouble you.

899
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,000
And

900
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,640
being a secretary and a partner

901
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,600
are two things.

902
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,640
If you can't handle it,

903
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,200
I don't want you to be like

904
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,320
our current relationship.

905
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,320
I don't think so.

906
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,560
We're all famous people in the company.

907
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
But I can't

908
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,320
give you a good treatment now.

909
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,480
With your ability,

910
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,120
if it weren't for this,

911
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,680
I wouldn't have invited you.

912
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,360
Xing Chen needs you.

913
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,920
I need you too.

914
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,520
I'll think about it.

915
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,520
Order some more.

916
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,360
It's expensive.

917
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,520
Miss Ji.

918
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,360
Miss Li.

919
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:07,960
Mr. Lin.

920
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,200
What's the matter with me?

921
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,000
I've booked the box.

922
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,880
Go in and talk.

923
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,960
Miss Ji's taste is really good.

924
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,440
The box of this restaurant

925
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,320
is hard to book.

926
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:21,960
Yes.

927
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
How do you like the dish?

928
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,520
It's great.

929
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,120
You like it.

930
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,600
Thank you.

931
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,440
Thank you.

932
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,720
I heard that Miss Ji

933
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,200
has a good relationship with Mr. Han.

934
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,680
Not bad.

935
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,200
He's from college.

936
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,720
Mr. Han is a good company.

937
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,320
He can't be a good company.

938
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,320
Miss Ji and Xing Chen are both

939
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,720
good friends.

940
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,880
Thank you.

941
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,560
Here.

942
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,120
I toast to Miss Ji.

943
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,760
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

944
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,880
Thank you for your help.

945
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,200
You're welcome.

946
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,440
Take your seat.

947
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,720
Miss Ji is satisfied with

948
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,080
our North Di products?

949
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,080
Of course.

950
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,640
North Di's equipment

951
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,160
is completely different from other countries.

952
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,680
It's also very good for the service.

953
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,560
Yes.

954
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,840
I'm very confident

955
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,920
about the equipment.

956
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,640
Since Miss Ji

957
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,800
is very close to our company,

958
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,240
actually,

959
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,680
I have something to ask Miss Ji.

960
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,360
Go ahead.

961
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,480
Hello.

962
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,520
It's hard to do business now.

963
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,160
I have an unkind request.

964
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,440
Can you help Miss Ji

965
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,840
to sign a contract with Mr. Han

966
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,480
to make a cooperation

967
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,760
between North Di and Dong Yi?

968
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,400
Ms. Xia?

969
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,360
Beautiful woman

970
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,480
with your hands?

971
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,440
With your relationship with Mr. Han,

972
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,560
as long as you say it,

973
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,880
Mr. Han will definitely give you this face.

974
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,480
Miss Ji, don't worry.

975
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,880
Our mouth is very strict.

976
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,880
With your relationship with Mr. Han,

977
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,960
we will never talk about it outside.

978
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,320
After the trial,

979
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,800
this benefit

980
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,080
will not be as big as yours.

981
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,680
Don't think that this skill

982
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,960
is a skill.

983
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,760
I didn't expect that you are so bright.

984
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,920
You are good at using resources.

985
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,080
But don't be angry.

986
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,360
People who want to go up like this

987
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,440
are all like this.

988
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,760
You called me here on purpose, right?

989
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,040
What do you think?

990
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,400
I...

991
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,360
Mr. Lin,

992
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,880
we need to talk about something.

993
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,400
I'll go first.

994
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,840
We've met each other today.

995
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,520
We'll take care of each other.

996
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,520
Okay.

997
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,880
Mr. Han and Mr. Ji

998
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,200
are all technical people.

999
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,400
You are so good at making products.

1000
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,960
Are you afraid that Bo Le will not find out?

1001
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,560
After dinner,

1002
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,960
I'll invite you to sing a song.

1003
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:30,800
Okay.

1004
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,040
As you wish. Let's continue.

1005
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,400
I'll have to write the materials later.

1006
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,720
Next, let Mr. Li and you talk.

1007
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,800
The production space is short.

1008
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,920
Mr. Ji will report to Mr. Han in person.

1009
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,040
Mr. Lin,

1010
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
please understand.

1011
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,240
Don't think we are not important.

1012
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,440
What do you mean?

1013
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,520
Come on.

1014
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,360
Let's toast to Ms. Ji.

1015
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,560
Have a good cooperation.

1016
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,360
Have a good cooperation.

1017
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,960
Have a good cooperation.

1018
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,960
What else do you want to order?

1019
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,120
Mr. Li, please say hello.

1020
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,040
I'll go to the bathroom.

1021
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,880
Let's eat.

1022
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,360
Come on.

1023
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,060
ipe viewers for your

1024
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,560
Trust me.

1025
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,000
You can join the assembly ship.

1026
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,560
Vultures.

1027
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,200
The равntological economical and profitable

1028
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,400
penguins were able to

1029
00:39:46,560 --> 00:40:01,960
value their ancient body oil for the past

1030
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,520
and bought the pot of Yutong

1031
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,240
in ourصلine Sydney.

1032
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,720
Sure.

1033
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,920
Do you rent a room with the client in your luminescent room?

1034
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,880
No, it's not living room.

1035
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,000
Well, this bed is a registered private room with the client.

1036
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,320
We still have to move it for the dorm company to pay it back.

1037
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,080
Or Whirlian will charge the rent Cons grupo or reserve pay it.

1038
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,760
I've no choice.

1039
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,160
I just happen to have a business thatade in my yard.

1040
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,160
Do you like my name?

1041
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,160
What do you think of my name?

1042
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,160
I used to think you were a love-hate.

1043
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,160
You are a love-hate.

1044
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,160
You even get a little bit of blame.

1045
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,160
I underestimated you.

1046
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,160
You really know how to be a good person.

1047
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,160
You are self-sufficient.

1048
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,160
I told them that you are my college classmate.

1049
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,160
You are my college classmate.

1050
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,160
I didn't lie.

1051
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,160
So you are a good person.

1052
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,160
They misunderstood me.

1053
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,160
You think you are right.

1054
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,160
You dare to say that you didn't mean to make them misunderstand.

1055
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:56,160
They think we are related.

1056
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
Brother,

1057
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,160
I am sorry about what I did to bother you.

1058
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,160
It doesn't matter.

1059
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,000
I...

1060
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,720
Look at you.

1061
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,560
You're so reactionary.

1062
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,480
If you say something more difficult,

1063
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,400
can you accept it?

1064
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,120
Tao Se Fei Wen doesn't care about me.

1065
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,920
But she will hurt you.

1066
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,560
If you can't bear the consequences,

1067
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,520
don't be anxious.

1068
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,400
Be anxious

1069
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,600
to pay the price.

1070
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,400
You're standing opposite me.

1071
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,280
You're taking the world that I'm not familiar with.

1072
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,240
Those who seem far away,

1073
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,520
but hate each other.

1074
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:54,360
I want to test who has crossed the border.

1075
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,380
I want to hold the sword.

1076
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,520
We're no longer here.

1077
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,440
Looking forward to no return from a strange birth.

1078
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,300
We were forced to face the challenge,

1079
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,140
but no one was more able to accept it.

1080
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:28,360
I'm afraid that I'll be able to get rid of you.

1081
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,360
I'm afraid that I'll be able to get rid of you.

1082
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:36,360
I'm afraid that I'll be able to get rid of you.

1083
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,360
I'm afraid that I'll be able to get rid of you.

1084
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:44,360
I'm afraid that I'll be able to get rid of you.

1085
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:48,360
I'm afraid that I'll be able to get rid of you.

1086
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:52,360
I'm afraid that I'll be able to get rid of you.

1087
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:57,360
We can stay for a half.

1088
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,360
Let's just let our feelings be.

1089
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,360
We can leave.

1090
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,360
We won't be afraid.

1091
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,360
We have to face the difficulties.

1092
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,360
We have to face the difficulties.

1093
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:19,360
Our feelings have become a mess.

1094
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:24,360
We can't stay.
