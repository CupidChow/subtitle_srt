1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm so tired of this

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm so tired of this

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm so tired of this

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm so tired of this

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm so tired of this

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm so tired of this

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm so tired of this

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm so tired of this

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm so tired of this

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm so tired of this

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm so tired of this

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm so tired of this

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm so tired of this

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm so tired of this

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm so tired of this

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I though it helps

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll never go out

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
With Вы

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Lee

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Then Why

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The world on my mind

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
doesn't know

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if there is no end, I will always believe that even if

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,400
Why did you write my name?

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,800
I just want to see how it feels to be connected with these two names.

27
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,400
From now on, not only will our names be connected,

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,800
tomorrow, we will also be together forever.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm so tired of this

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm so tired of this

I'm so tired of this

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm so tired of this

I'm so tired of this

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm so tired of this

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm so tired of this

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm so tired of this

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm so tired of this

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm so tired of this

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm so tired of this

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm so tired of this

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's go

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's go to the bathroom

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's go to the bathroom

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's go to the bathroom

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Hello

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What's up?

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Are you talking?

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
When?

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Now

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Say it

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Li Li

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I've thought a lot these days

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
about our relationship

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I've always thought

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
we know each other's relationship

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But now I'm not sure

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You want to keep this sense of border

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You don't want to destroy it

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I can understand

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But security and border

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
are always the same

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
They're always changing things

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't want this

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll work harder

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll try to satisfy your expectations

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I thought you could feel

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
my efforts and changes

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You know what I want

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You just don't want to give it to you

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What I want

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Can you give it to me?

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll do it

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You know it

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll do it

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll do it

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll do it

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'll do it

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll do it

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I hope you're happy

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I really care about you

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You know it

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I want more

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You can answer me

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Sister

115
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Something happened

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What's wrong?

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You didn't read the news

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You should have been hurt

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're not a victim

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You're a victim

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You're a victim

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You're a victim

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're a victim

124
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're a victim

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The first wave of the night

126
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The new technology in Ming-Achu

127
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
was invented by the investment of Dongyang Medical

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
in the first wave of the industry

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
In this scandal

130
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The price of Dongyang Medical

131
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
was affected and the market was closed

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Dongyang Medical has experienced a bad trend

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The new leader Han Ting

134
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
is bold and powerful

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
How will Dongyang Medical

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
deal with this wave?

137
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I heard

138
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
that

139
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
this has been done by Old Man

140
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What do you want?

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
am interested in

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
the drug industry

144
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
just like Han Ting

145
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I knew Han Ting's price

146
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Parents

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
love you

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Am I not

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
your target?

151
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Project

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Emperor

153
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Xia Multipar body

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Jiang Zihong

155
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,000
You are my life

156
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't fall in love with PD

157
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,160
Please,

158
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,120
and count the time

159
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,440
of both days.

160
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,960
הוא

161
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,240
yu

162
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,280
of the company

163
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,780
will ask you future

164
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,040
your business plan.

165
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,720
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

166
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I didn't expect that

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
such a big mess could happen in this Han Ting.

168
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I've said it before.

169
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Xing Chen is the breakthrough of the tour of Han Ting.

170
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Mr. Yuan is still as good as a mountain.

171
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Since this matter has already affected Dong Yi,

172
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
why don't we postpone it?

173
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I understand.

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'll contact the chairman now.

175
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
This matter has already ended.

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Why is there someone who has turned it out to be a article?

177
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Everything is designed well.

178
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Someone must have pushed it out from behind.

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Who is it?

180
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Xing Chen is a competitor,

181
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
but he doesn't know that he'll die.

182
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Let's see the result first.

183
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
For now,

184
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
what is the consequence of today's matter?

185
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Xing Chen is suffering from a stroke of life.

186
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And he has a thousand-lion Dongyang medical treatment.

187
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Dong Yi's family has been in the summer.

188
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Who is the biggest beneficiary?

189
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Who is the real beneficiary?

190
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
How do you know?

191
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Don't worry.

192
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
This is not a bad thing.

193
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
There is always a chance to challenge the illness.

194
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Boss, the board of directors is coming.

195
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,840
I'm coming.

196
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,640
I'll go with you.

197
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,520
No need.

198
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,320
It's not like you're the only one

199
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,560
who can make trouble at the board meeting.

200
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,920
I can handle it.

201
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,600
Don't worry.

202
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,880
But this is because of me.

203
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,560
Listen to me.

204
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,760
The most important thing now

205
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,680
is not to make any trouble.

206
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,880
Back then,

207
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,120
we were called Blackradas.

208
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,240
These days,

209
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,920
we're calledальный now.

210
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,080
I have contacted some construction companies.

211
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,800
But the plan doesn't go.

212
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,500
We still have to think about other measures.

213
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,080
Why are you greeting them like that?

214
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,600
They're off to security.

215
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,600
Are you wondering about

216
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,200
any other such consequences?

217
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,220
Dongyue,

218
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,260
What?

219
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,260
It is...

220
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,320
it is...

221
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,360
really잠 would like to go

222
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,560
toded and

223
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,120
never come back.

224
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,680
This is you.

225
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,220
Nothing.

226
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,520
I left home

227
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,180
because of you.

228
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,000
Stop it.

229
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,760
You laRes are just...

230
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,680
Call me.

231
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,880
You can just call me.

232
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,040
President Zhou.

233
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,880
The meeting is over.

234
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,120
Love is real.

235
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,720
SK2 brings you to the right content.

236
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,520
Look.

237
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,680
These two days,

238
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,920
the old family in East Yang,

239
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,760
what did they say?

240
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,160
They said they were too young.

241
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,560
They didn't listen to me.

242
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,640
Every time they have a meeting,

243
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,840
every time they say,

244
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,360
they still do that.

245
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,160
We've made a reminder.

246
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
What did you say?

247
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,920
What we should say is to be the head.

248
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,160
Then they won't listen.

249
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,880
They always want to harm us.

250
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,760
Anniang.

251
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,320
I don't think this meeting

252
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,600
will make any sense

253
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,440
if we keep going like this.

254
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,160
Uncle.

255
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,880
What's your solution?

256
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,640
Three days.

257
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,640
Give me three days.

258
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,840
I'll be back as soon as possible

259
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,040
to stabilize the old family.

260
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,560
You heard it, right?

261
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,960
He said it himself.

262
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,480
If you don't want to be a housewife in three days,

263
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,760
you'll be his wife.

264
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,800
That's all.

265
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,800
Anniang,

266
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,200
come with me.

267
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,160
Miss Han, Miss Zeng is here.

268
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,840
Sis.

269
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,040
Miss is here.

270
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,040
What's wrong?

271
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,840
I heard you're not feeling well.

272
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,520
I came to see you.

273
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,680
It's okay.

274
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,880
Didn't Grandpa go to the company to ask for responsibility?

275
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,640
If I go again,

276
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,040
it seems like the whole family is forcing Han Ting.

277
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,520
I won't go there.

278
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,800
How are you doing?

279
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm fine.

280
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,960
But Han Ting is in a bad mood.

281
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,480
The storm of the new god

282
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,320
has also affected the share price of Dong Yi.

283
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,400
I didn't expect that.

284
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,720
I've told him before.

285
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,840
To invest in a company like this

286
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,560
is to be careful of risk control.

287
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,320
Sis, you're so calm.

288
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,520
It seems that this fire

289
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,880
can't burn Dong Ke.

290
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
Dong Ke is my executive company.

291
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,240
No matter if it's from the daily economy

292
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,360
or foreign investment,

293
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,520
it's always very cautious.

294
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,280
How can it cause fire?

295
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,680
Dong Yi and Dong Ke are brothers.

296
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,640
You're Dong Yi's vice-chairman.

297
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,920
You're so tolerant.

298
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,600
Sis,

299
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,760
although Han Ting is usually a bit selfish,

300
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,520
don't be so mean to her this time.

301
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,640
Xiaodi,

302
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,480
what you mean is

303
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,280
I'm the one who caused Dong Yi's accident.

304
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,440
Sis, of course I didn't mean that.

305
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,880
You're sisters.

306
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,320
Why would you hurt her?

307
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,480
I'm just worried about Han Ting.

308
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,400
She's a strong woman.

309
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,440
Even if she needs someone,

310
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,320
she won't open her mouth easily.

311
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,760
Then now you're the only one

312
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,120
who can help her this time.

313
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,920
You.

314
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,320
If you use half of your mind

315
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
on Han Ting,

316
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,520
you're already a woman now.

317
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,920
Why can't you let go of my

318
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,640
brother who doesn't love me?

319
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,640
He's a man who needs to choose his own.

320
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,920
Han Ting has her own way of thinking

321
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,760
and her own plan.

322
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,600
Xiaodi,

323
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,400
I'll remind you of one thing.

324
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,480
A man

325
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,280
will never forget the soft heart

326
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,160
for a woman who pleases for love.

327
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,320
But right now,

328
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,600
Han Ting will likely

329
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,400
seize your chance.

330
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,760
A gler?

331
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,620
That's theotive.

332
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,440
It's almost safe.

333
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,560
Xing Chen made his face so embarrassful.

334
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,400
Use Guang Hua toilarila

335
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,680
to transfer the other man's face here.

336
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,600
I'm sure he'll know

337
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,560
where she's going to choose.

338
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,120
Okay, sister.

339
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,840
I see.

340
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,360
Don't you want to say something to me?

341
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,240
I understand your worries.

342
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,360
But the new god is not the first time

343
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,160
to face the crisis.

344
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,840
It will definitely be solved.

345
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,280
Have you found a way

346
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,640
to prepare for it?

347
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,680
Without your help,

348
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,240
can you resolve this misson?

349
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,160
Yes.

350
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,640
Every time Xing Chen encounters the crisis,

351
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,080
it's all up to them to settle this.

352
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,720
Grandpa,

353
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,480
I will slow down on this game again.

354
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,880
Fine.

355
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,320
I look forward to your performance

356
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,120
after three days' long wait.

357
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,260
(#I Come To You Crazy?)

358
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,680
fragen

359
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,060
Here.

360
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,960
Thank you, auntie.

361
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,500
Thank you, auntie.

362
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,680
I'm sorry.

363
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,840
This is your last chance to do the surgery.

364
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,400
If you agree to sign this agreement,

365
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,800
you must also testify to us

366
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,080
and prove your old injury and heart failure.

367
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,080
Are you really willing to do the surgery with me?

368
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,640
I really want to help you.

369
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,720
Or else, I can just leave it alone.

370
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,920
Give them some money and they'll leave.

371
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,560
But who cares about your illness?

372
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,880
You think those who are just making trouble for you

373
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,960
are doing it for your own good?

374
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,480
Why are you pushing you into the fire pit?

375
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,440
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,920
I was too careless.

377
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,880
But

378
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,120
if my family finds out,

379
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,720
they won't let me off.

380
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,920
Your illness

381
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,120
may not be worth the money.

382
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,120
Now it's finally the time to do it.

383
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,720
You're still not cherishing it.

384
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
You still have to do it.

385
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
I'm not lying to you.

386
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,320
If you keep doing this,

387
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,720
you'll be in trouble for the rest of your life.

388
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,720
Look at your child. He's so cute.

389
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,520
He's still so young.

390
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,720
Even if you can accept it,

391
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,120
you won't be able to stand up.

392
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,520
Have you ever thought about him?

393
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,920
What will his future be like?

394
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,120
You chose a father like him.

395
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
Except for you,

396
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,120
who else can protect him?

397
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,920
You're back.

398
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
Xue is back.

399
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Go.

400
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
He'll find out you're back.

401
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
He won't let you off.

402
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
Think about it.

403
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,320
I'll come to you tomorrow.

404
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,520
I know.

405
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,120
I know.

406
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,720
Hurry up.

407
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Mr. Feng is here.

408
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,320
Let me report to you.

409
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
Xiao Bai's second period of development is good.

410
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,520
She's in good health and wisdom.

411
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
She's in good health.

412
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,720
She's in good health with Dr. Zhi Hui Yun.

413
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,520
It should be a good example.

414
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,920
If the report goes out,

415
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,920
I think we can keep the news of her.

416
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,920
Mr. Feng.

417
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
Mr. Feng.

418
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Mr. Feng.

419
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
Mr. Feng.

420
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Mr. Feng.

421
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
Mr. Feng.

422
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
Mr. Feng.

423
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
Mr. Feng.

424
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
Mr. Feng.

425
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
Mr. Feng.

426
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Mr. Feng.

427
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
Mr. Feng.

428
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
Mr. Feng.

429
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
Mr. Feng.

430
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Mr. Feng.

431
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,920
Mr. Feng.

432
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,920
Han Ting.

433
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,920
Actually, I know very well

434
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,920
that the best way to clean up the mess

435
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,920
is to cut off the relationship between Dong Yi and Xing Chen.

436
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
Of course, I don't mean anything else.

437
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,920
It's just that the thing is too serious.

438
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
If...

439
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
My sister taught you.

440
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
It doesn't matter who taught me.

441
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
It's important that you can't continue.

442
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
Feng Di.

443
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,920
Why did Zhang Feng Mei's husband make a mess?

444
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,920
I think you should be more clear-minded.

445
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,920
I have warned you.

446
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Don't do anything that damages Dong Yi and Xing Chen.

447
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,920
Do your best.

448
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
Wait for my words to be sealed.

449
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,920
I didn't do the media thing.

450
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
You know that

451
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,920
I will never hurt you.

452
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
I will never hurt you.

453
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,920
That Ji Xing pulled his leg out one by one.

454
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
You never hurt him.

455
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Ji Xing and I are together now.

456
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,920
I will transfer all the shares of the flowers to you.

457
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,920
I will never hurt you.

458
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,920
I will never hurt you.

459
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,920
Don't be so sad.

460
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
I bought some desserts for him.

461
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
Xiaosheng.

462
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,920
Hurry up.

463
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
Let's go.

464
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
Give him some powder.

465
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,920
Everyone has it.

466
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
Take a rest.

467
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Eat well and work harder.

468
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Thank you, Mr. Si.

469
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
You're welcome.

470
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,920
Sister Li.

471
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,920
Take a rest.

472
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
Have some desserts.

473
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Here.

474
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Thank you.

475
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
You're welcome.

476
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
So many.

477
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
I have enough.

478
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,920
Take these and give them to them.

479
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
No.

480
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
I prepared all of them for you.

481
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Each one has its own flavor.

482
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
Try it.

483
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
After you finish it,

484
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
just keep it.

485
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
Eat slowly.

486
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
No.

487
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
I will eat slowly.

488
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
I will eat slowly.

489
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
I will eat slowly.

490
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,920
I will eat slowly.

491
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
No.

492
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
It's too wasteful.

493
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
It's not wasteful.

494
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
It's not wasteful.

495
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Everyone has it.

496
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
You can't finish it.

497
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
It's not wasteful.

498
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
Zhizhou.

499
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,920
I'm not just talking about desserts.

500
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,920
You don't have to waste time on me.

501
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,920
We talked about it last time.

502
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
I think

503
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,920
it's not wasteful.

504
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,860
The first one is

505
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,760
used as the%%%%% in art.

506
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,620
This is beautiful.

507
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,720
Let's try.

508
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Let's try.

509
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,920
You're so naive.

510
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,400
It makes me think

511
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
about the important things

512
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
I can do.

513
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,120
I'm not afraid of you.

514
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,320
Because I like you,

515
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,920
I realized that my lack of self-respect

516
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,120
is not very mature.

517
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
Because I like you,

518
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,520
I have the motivation to grow and improve.

519
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Don't worry.

520
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,520
I won't make you a man again.

521
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,120
So,

522
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,120
let's be ordinary friends.

523
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,520
Okay?

524
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,320
Okay.

525
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Okay.

526
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
I'll get back to work.

527
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,320
Bye.

528
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,520
Yichen.

529
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,520
You're back.

530
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,920
Did you see Xing Chen's news?

531
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:51,920
I did.

532
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,320
It's a big deal.

533
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,720
I'm worried about it.

534
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,120
Don't worry.

535
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,320
Xing Chen's product quality is good.

536
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,520
All the clinical trial procedures

537
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,720
we've done before

538
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,320
in the center of innovation

539
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,320
are very successful.

540
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,320
I'm in the all-new cases

541
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,120
of President Huizong's

542
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,720
and the clinical trial procedures

543
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,120
that are still in the collection.

544
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,320
I'm also in the process of

545
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,720
the clinical trial procedures.

546
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
Maybe we can use them.

547
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:19,920
Oh, right.

548
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,920
You can send me

549
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,120
the data of Xing Chen's product.

550
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,320
I'll send it to the specialist

551
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,120
in my field.

552
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,320
Maybe you can help me.

553
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:26,920
I will.

554
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,520
I'll send it to you.

555
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,120
Okay.

556
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,120
Over there?

557
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,920
Yes.

558
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:44,920
So the seal meets you,

559
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,720
wasn't it?

560
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,240
All you need to do is

561
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,920
throw it and serve him well,

562
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,720
and go to the professional lab.

563
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,920
I'll send it to you.

564
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,920
Get to work.

565
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,720
Thank you.

566
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,720
Mr. Xing.

567
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,120
Kidnapping.

568
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,120
I'm only knowing it under agent Turn.

569
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,480
How come the result is not out yet?

570
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,920
How come it's a new technology?

571
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,000
Besides,

572
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,800
the new product from the experiment to now

573
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,400
has never been in any problem.

574
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,800
I don't know the specific situation.

575
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,520
Why do you say that

576
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,640
the new product is from the black star company?

577
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,840
We don't know you.

578
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,560
I think you're with them.

579
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,400
Stop cheating the company.

580
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,920
I wish you a good day.

581
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,760
It's so funny.

582
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,760
Please pay attention to your quality.

583
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
The live broadcast room of my company

584
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,320
is welcome to have people who are not capable.

585
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,560
Such a broken pot

586
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,400
is not good.

587
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,120
It's not good to sing and listen to.

588
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,920
Don't look at it.

589
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,720
Get used to it.

590
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,560
Forget it.

591
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,520
Don't come in again.

592
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,320
If you come in and give him a bonus,

593
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,520
he will be more satisfied.

594
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,080
He will rely on this to take a bath.

595
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,040
What I'm talking to you about

596
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,240
is to talk to you about money.

597
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,880
I won't say it. I'm scared.

598
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,480
You want to be the host like this?

599
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,640
You're going to turn the market.

600
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,400
Be the host.

601
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,560
Don't care about the money.

602
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,280
Hurry up and turn the market.

603
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,480
Don't be embarrassed here.

604
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,040
Have you ever thought about

605
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,480
the feelings of those hand-painted patients?

606
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,760
You're still called smart.

607
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,600
You're really filial.

608
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,080
You're not smart.

609
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,080
This Wu Liang host

610
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,680
and Wu Liang company are really perfect.

611
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,640
Jiang Chen, you're so polite.

612
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,360
You worked so hard to help him.

613
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:42,880
You...

614
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,560
cerebral laugh.

615
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,120
I have some bad news on the internet.

616
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,840
Are you okay?

617
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,400
Don't look at it.

618
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,480
Those people of psychologicalklärothes

619
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,880
arezzarellaing online.

620
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,560
Once you do,

621
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,200
when negotiation started,

622
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,720
an extra bounty was knocked down.

623
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,840
duties to face the problem.

624
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,240
The boss said that

625
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,760
you don't need to translate it.

626
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,520
I understand.

627
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,240
A hunter shot a fox.

628
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,800
As a result, the hunter was shot dead.

629
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,640
The fox said,

630
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,880
I'm a reverse fox.

631
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,880
A fish-drawer caught a fish.

632
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,160
The fish asked him to

633
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,320
let me go.

634
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,400
The fish said,

635
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,080
I'll ask you a few questions.

636
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,200
The fish said,

637
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,520
I'm going to test it.

638
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,360
The fish said,

639
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,080
Cut the crap.

640
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,800
Cut the crap.

641
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,920
Then you should test me.

642
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:12,920
So,

643
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,840
the fish-drawer caught the fish.

644
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,040
Cui Mingguo,

645
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,520
are you happy?

646
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,440
Don't be sad.

647
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,720
If you can't stand it,

648
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,720
just cry.

649
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,240
Thank you.

650
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,840
I feel unhappy.

651
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,640
Don't next to me.

652
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,560
Please tell me again.

653
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,840
I need to inferior regarding your son's performance.

654
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,600
Ha, ha.

655
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
You're so smart!

656
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,320
We need to chat.

657
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,120
By the way, my mom recently sent me a few new soups.

658
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,240
I'll ask you to try them.

659
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,840
Okay.

660
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,280
In a few days,

661
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,120
thank you, auntie.

662
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,400
I'm Lu Dahuang. You're Lu Wuyi.

663
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:42,920
An Yu.

664
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,920
Xinxing.

665
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,840
I've seen all those.

666
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,920
Are you okay?

667
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,520
I'm fine.

668
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,320
Aren't you supposed to be on the live stream?

669
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,320
I'm pretty tired today.

670
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,680
I'll be on the live stream in advance.

671
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
I'm fine.

672
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,320
I'm fine.

673
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
I'm fine.

674
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,320
I'm fine.

675
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
I'm fine.

676
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
I'm fine.

677
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,320
I'm fine.

678
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,320
I'm fine.

679
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,320
I'm fine.

680
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,760
You must be very sad now.

681
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,760
How about I talk to you for a while?

682
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,040
No need.

683
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,880
Thank you, Mei Shang.

684
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,520
I just want to stay here for a while.

685
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,000
Okay.

686
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,440
Have a good rest.

687
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,600
I'll go take a shower.

688
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,720
I'll order some food and drink with you tonight.

689
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
Okay.

690
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,360
Have some more.

691
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,520
Sorry, by wrong.

692
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,400
Thank you.

693
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,440
I don't want to be an indirect person.

694
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
Promise me one thing.

695
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,440
When I can't see you,

696
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
you must take good care of yourself.

697
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,440
Okay.

698
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
Go to bed early.

699
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
Bye.

700
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,440
Rat,

701
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,440

702
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
Real CHARGE or SHIFTthe power of BLORES

703
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,000
Chen He Le,

704
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,440
Are you разversed in fun and drinking?

705
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,880
You can't find this IU tech!

706
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,440
I'm very serious.

707
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,440
Do it.

708
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,960
They're good people.

709
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,040
We can't

710
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,680
make them pay for the money.

711
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,600
I beg you.

712
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,600
Give back the money.

713
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,440
Give back what?

714
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,440
Go and change.

715
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,440
Or you can go and find the money.

716
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,520
Boss.

717
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,280
This is from Mr. Xiao.

718
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,760
It contains the information about Xu Zhuang

719
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,280
and the investigation report of the accident.

720
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,000
Go.

721
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,040
Go to Xu Zhuang's house.

722
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,240
Then...

723
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,040
Then you go.

724
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,040
You go and tell the media.

725
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,640
Tell them that my injury

726
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,040
is not because of their products.

727
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,040
It's because of your husband's products.

728
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,640
You want me to tell them

729
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,240
that I caused your injury, right?

730
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,640
You want me to be a slave?

731
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,840
Xu Zhuang.

732
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,640
What are you doing?

733
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,440
I'll call the police if you hit anyone again.

734
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
What are you doing?

735
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,640
I'm telling you the address.

736
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,240
Tell me.

737
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,040
He's a madman.

738
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,440
You hit him.

739
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
Are you human?

740
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,440
Give me your phone.

741
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,640
Don't mess it up.

742
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,640
I recorded everything.

743
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,240
Give it to me.

744
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,040
Qi Feng.

745
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
Qi Feng, run.

746
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,240
Qi Feng.

747
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:34,640
Get up.

748
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,040
Stop.

749
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,040
Stop.

750
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,840
Give me your phone.

751
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,840
Hurry up.

752
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,040
How is it?

753
00:39:59,240 --> 00:39:59,840
Are you okay?

754
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
I got the evidence.

755
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,240
No one can bother you anymore.

756
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,640
Don't do such a dangerous thing again.

757
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,840
Do you hear me?

758
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,840
I have good news for you.

759
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,240
Xu Zhuang has been taken away and taken to the investigation.

760
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,440
Yes.

761
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,640
Great.

762
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,040
This guy is really a bad guy.

763
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,040
He's a good guy.

764
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,640
He deserves to be a bad guy.

765
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,640
He's still a good guy.

766
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,040
He's not only a good guy,

767
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,040
but also a good guy.

768
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,640
He's also a good guy.

769
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,640
What's his name?

770
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,440
Ying Huo De Fu.

771
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,640
Okay.

772
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,040
You've worked hard during this time.

773
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,840
No.

774
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,640
Zhang Feng Mei's surgery is done.

775
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
It's in three days.

776
00:40:59,240 --> 00:40:59,640
Okay.

777
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,840
This time, I can help Zhang Feng Mei

778
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,440
to get a chance to stand up again.

779
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,440
I'm a little bit better.

780
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,440
Let's go back to see him.

781
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,840
His recovery fee is paid with the new city.

782
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:10,840
By the way,

783
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,440
Zhang Feng Mei's daughter is now in her parents' house.

784
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,440
The child is very safe.

785
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,840
This time,

786
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,640
it's finally over.

787
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,040
It's not easy.

788
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
It's not easy.

789
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,040
Mr. Ji,

790
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,240
do we still have to thank someone?

791
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,240
Yes.

792
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Fortunately, Mr. Han arrived in time.

793
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,440
Mr. Han is like Mr. Ji's wife.

794
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,640
He really makes people envious.

795
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,040
Okay, don't be so excited.

796
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,240
Let's have a meeting.

797
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,040
Sister Xing.

798
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,840
Our business is so complete.

799
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
Please go to the bathroom.

800
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,040
Let's have a date next time, okay?

801
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,840
We have a date tonight.

802
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,640
Okay, okay.

803
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,240
Then tonight,

804
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,840
we won't disturb you and Mr. Han.

805
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,240
How about this?

806
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,240
I'll invite everyone to eat and sing this Sunday.

807
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:00,840
Okay.

808
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,440
Okay.

809
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,640
Okay, let's continue working.

810
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,840
Okay, let's work.

811
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,440
Mr. Su.

812
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,640
Please help me with this product.

813
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,440
Okay.

814
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
This is correct.

815
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,240
The data is very accurate.

816
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,440
It's not bad.

817
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,640
Thank you, Mr. Su.

818
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:25,640
Come on.

819
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,840
Then, then, then you go,

820
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,840
you go and talk to the media.

821
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,840
You talk, you say that my business

822
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,440
is not a product of Xing Chen.

823
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,240
It's your wife's product.

824
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,840
Do you have any doubts?

825
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,040
I will try to figure out a way to get the stock price.

826
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,640
But I don't want to hear

827
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,920
the East and West

828
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,040
to be suspicious of Dong Yi, Xing Chen,

829
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,240
and other business.

830
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,040
I'm sorry.

831
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,040
I'm sorry.

832
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,240

I'm sorry.

843
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,240
I'm sorry.

844
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,240
I'm sorry.

845
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,240

I'm sorry.

853
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,240
I'm sorry.

854
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,240
I'm sorry.

855
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,240
I'm sorry.

856
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,240
I'm sorry.

857
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,240
I'm sorry.

858
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,240
I'm sorry.

859
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,640
