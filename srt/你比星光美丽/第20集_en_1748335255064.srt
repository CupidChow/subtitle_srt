1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to pass through the water and you in my mind

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Even if I encounter a miracle, I'll be lost in the mist

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the mist

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I can't see the crowd in the crowd

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm afraid I'll be distracted by the crowd

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to go to the top of my own head

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I forgot the original self

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to go to the top of my own head

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sure I won't hesitate

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I want to show my future

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm afraid I'll have no courage

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I want to go to the top of my own head

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I won't give up

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid I'll be Coward

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I will live without장님

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Even if I sight not, I'll wake…

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:45,280
Subbed by Stir-Fried Qu Portuguese Unfortunately, CC by dropped

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,680
I like a girl.

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,880
Her name is very nice.

21
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,080
Her name is Lily.

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,880
Lily?

23
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,480
Yes.

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,480
Such a vulgar name.

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,880
Her history is

26
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,280
a history of unbearable and unbearable.

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,080
Just like her name,

28
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,280
she is beautiful and beautiful.

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,680
I've never met such a girl.

30
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,280
So I feel like

31
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,080
a light heart to her.

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,280
A light heart

33
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,880
to her.

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,080
You like her, so where do you chase her?

35
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
I chase her.

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,080
She has a boyfriend.

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,280
And

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,880
even if she doesn't have a boyfriend,

39
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,680
she doesn't like me.

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,080
She is so wild.

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,480
She is not so ordinary.

42
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,280
Look at my figure.

43
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,880
What is the difference between me and her?

44
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,880
Bro,

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,880
let's be honest.

46
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,680
To be honest,

47
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,680
the most beautiful thing

48
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,080
is you.

49
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,080
You have to find your own special charm.

50
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
Stand down. Let me see.

51
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,880
Yes.

52
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,080
You look so good.

53
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,480
You are so talented.

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,280
But

55
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,080
how can you look like this?

56
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,080
So you say

57
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
I still have hope?

58
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,480
Yes. Of course.

59
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
To be honest,

60
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,680
this bar is opened by Bro.

61
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,480
You are so beautiful.

62
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Bro has seen a lot of you.

63
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
Tell me

64
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,680
how should I wear

65
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,680
to be able to

66
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,880
find my own special charm?

67
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,880
Okay.

68
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,480
It seems like we are in the same field.

69
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,080
Bro will help you change your face.

70
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,280
Okay.

71
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,280
Wait a minute.

72
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
I will remember.

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,280
You are a new technology.

74
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
Do you know our company?

75
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,680
I know. It's so familiar.

76
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,280
You are my big brother.

77
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,280
And your boss.

78
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:48,880
Ji Xing.

79
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
And some of them.

80
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,080
Tu Xiaomeng.

81
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,680
Lili.

82
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,680
We are so familiar.

83
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,680
Wait.

84
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,080
Wait.

85
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,880
You said Lili.

86
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,680
It's...

87
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,680
You are the best.

88
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
Don't tell anyone.

89
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,680
Okay. Okay.

90
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,280
I beg you.

91
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:03,880
I know.

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,680
I know you have seen a lot of you.

93
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,680
I know. I will protect you.

94
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,280
Okay.

95
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,080
You don't have to remember.

96
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,880
Come with me.

97
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,480
Where are you going?

98
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,280
How did you

99
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,240
wear this

100
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,680
unbeatable clothes?

101
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,280
You are wearing that

102
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,160
plain and elegant

103
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,080
and mature.

104
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
Mature?

105
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,880
I think it's quite comfortable.

106
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,280
The last root is plain and elegant.

107
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,680
How can you be the best in the crowd?

108
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,480
I don't know.

109
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,480
Forget it.

110
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,680
I will help you.

111
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
It's weird.

112
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,480
It's so weird.

113
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,480
I will put on your suit.

114
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,880
Turn around.

115
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
Open your mouth.

116
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,280
Why do I feel like a beggar?

117
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,480
I know.

118
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
You are still looking at me.

119
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,280
Don't be angry.

120
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
Although you are a little worse than me,

121
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,280
you are already a top-notch.

122
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,280
Forget it.

123
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,880
I think I am not a beggar.

124
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,040
How can you wear this

125
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
unbeatable clothes?

126
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,680
There must be a better

127
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,880
bright and youthful clothes.

128
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,280
Got it.

129
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,480
Go.

130
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,880
Morning.

131
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,280
Wait.

132
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,880
Thank you.

133
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,680
Who is it?

134
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,280
I...

135
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,280
I...

136
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,080
You really wear...

137
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,480
a bright one.

138
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,680
Thank you.

139
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
We will have a meeting later.

140
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
We will also have a practice in the shopping department.

141
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,880
You should inform me.

142
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,680
Okay.

143
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,280
Mr. Li.

144
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Is there something important?

145
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,680
No.

146
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,080
If you are busy, you should go first.

147
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
I will go out first.

148
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,680
No.

149
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
You are wearing

150
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,680
a very good dress today.

151
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,480
Xia.

152
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
Let's sign the contract later.

153
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,480
Okay.

154
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,480
A good dress?

155
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,680
Is it a word for hugging or a word for leaving?

156
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,280
Li said it is not obvious.

157
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,280
It is a good dress.

158
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,680
Don't tell me next time.

159
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,080
I told you I am not suitable for the job.

160
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,080
Did you put the bill in the building?

161
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,280
I am doing a practice today.

162
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,280
So I came to see you.

163
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,480
To see me?

164
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,680
I didn't see you before.

165
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
You came to see me when you were resting.

166
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,880
No wonder.

167
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,680
You recommended Xiaoyu to come here.

168
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,280
Xiaoyu was really a good person.

169
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,280
No wonder my niece is so busy.

170
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
Don't talk to me.

171
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,480
I am a normal woman.

172
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
I decided to come here

173
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,080
after a long time.

174
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,080
And remember this.

175
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Don't tell Yichen.

176
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,280
He is not feeling well.

177
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,480
Is Yichen busy today?

178
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,080
Why didn't you see him?

179
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,880
He is busy with the clinical trial

180
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,280
of the clinical trial

181
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,880
of the three-dimensional treatment

182
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,680
that I have worked with Xing Chen.

183
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,880
He should be in the center of the innovation.

184
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,280
You just call him directly.

185
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,480
Okay.

186
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,680
Mr. Han.

187
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,080
This is the health report of the patient.

188
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,480
The patient has started to do basic shoulder training.

189
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,280
The combination of shoulder massage and hip massage is also very good.

190
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,480
Okay.

191
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
What are you busy with lately?

192
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:39,880
Yes.

193
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,880
I have a deadline.

194
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,480
I will answer it when I think about it.

195
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,280
Can you recommend me a test?

196
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,480
No.

197
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,880
I have given them some small things recently.

198
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,880
I have a test in Germany.

199
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,880
I want to learn from them

200
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,880
and figure out the product placement of Xing Chen.

201
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,280
You are welcome.

202
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,280
Boss,

203
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,480
it's time for the meeting.

204
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,480
Don't set yourself up.

205
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,480
Jump out of the room as a fixed time.

206
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
What do you mean?

207
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,880
Think about it yourself.

208
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,480
By the way,

209
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,880
there is one more important thing.

210
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Mr. Ji is a professional.

211
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,080
He is a professional.

212
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
He is a professional.

213
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,480
Mr. Ji has forgotten me, right?

214
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,280
What is it?

215
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,480
It's the case of the date with my report to the king.

216
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,480
The king?

217
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,080
So beautiful.

218
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,680
I have said it recently.

219
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
Give him some more time.

220
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Okay, boss.

221
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,480
He just came back.

222
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,080
He is going out again.

223
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,680
Here, have some juice.

224
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,880
Yes.

225
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
I will go to Germany.

226
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
Germany?

227
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,880
It's so far away.

228
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,880
It's not familiar.

229
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,880
What are you doing there?

230
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,680
I want to go to the

231
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,520
excellent old-fashioned medical equipment

232
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
and body manufacturer

233
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,280
to learn.

234
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,880
It's a famous sightseeing place.

235
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,480
Okay.

236
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,480
I am here to support you.

237
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
We have to support each other.

238
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,480
Life is not short.

239
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,680
Learn is not worth it.

240
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,480
Come on.

241
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
He is so funny.

242
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,680
Hua Hua,

243
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,480
you should add some oil to your mom,

244
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:38,680
okay?

245
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,080
My big mom.

246
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,680
She is so comfortable here.

247
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,680
I just took a picture of her.

248
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,680
So obedient.

249
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,080
I am sleepy.

250
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,080
I am sleepy.

251
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,280
I am sleepy.

252
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,080
I am sleepy.

253
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
I am sleepy.

254
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
I am sleepy.

255
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,080
I am sleepy.

256
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
Qiu Zi, come in.

257
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:05,880
Senior doctor,

258
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,880
congratulations on your success

259
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,880
in Xinang Hospital.

260
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,880
Thank you.

261
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,880
I have a soup for you.

262
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,480
You may sit first.

263
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,280
Okay.

264
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,680
Senior doctor,

265
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
you have already cooked.

266
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
I told you

267
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
I will help you celebrate.

268
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
You are a guest.

269
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,440
I'm not asking you to cook.

270
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,840
Jiu Zi,

271
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,400
it's good that you've been taking care of me for a while.

272
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
I have time to prepare the interview.

273
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,160
And the reference materials you gave me

274
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,600
are really useful.

275
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,440
Thank you.

276
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,960
You're excellent.

277
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,720
Even if I don't help, you can still get on.

278
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,800
By the way,

279
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,840
I brought you a bottle of wine.

280
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,640
Try it.

281
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
A glass of wine?

282
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,720
Yes.

283
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,200
I thought it was good.

284
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,720
So I brought you a bottle.

285
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,840
How is it?

286
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,840
Do you think it's good?

287
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,960
I haven't had it yet.

288
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,880
It's your turn.

289
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,280
Have a taste.

290
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,160
Try it.

291
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,800
It's good.

292
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,480
I knew you'd like it.

293
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,200
It tastes very similar to me.

294
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,160
You made me the best fried chicken.

295
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,960
Have a taste.

296
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,680
It's not bad.

297
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,280
How is it?

298
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,720
Good.

299
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,120
Thank you.

300
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,880
Drink up.

301
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,840
Yeah.

302
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,960
I understand

303
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,680
how your family Guanyin

304
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,560
likes to fight for money recently,

305
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,640
right?

306
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,640
It seems that this one is different from the other.

307
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,640
But we understand that

308
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
we don't know how much the change of boyfriend

309
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,640
can bring back the past.

310
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,640
This one is a bit different.

311
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,640
It's my ideal type.

312
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,640
I really can't bear to change it.

313
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,640
This is for real.

314
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,640
When will you bring it out and let us meet?

315
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
I've been back since I was a child.

316
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,640
I'll let you give me the lock.

317
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Di Xin.

318
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
Okay.

319
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
What's wrong?

320
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
Did you change your clothes?

321
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
Did you bring it?

322
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
I did.

323
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Here.

324
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,640
You and Su Rizhou have been in this time.

325
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
If there's anything,

326
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
you can call me.

327
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Don't worry about the time difference.

328
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,640
And, Tu Xiaomeng.

329
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
If you don't get along with the maid,

330
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
you can talk to her.

331
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
Don't worry.

332
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
I'll take care of her.

333
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
I'll give her the key.

334
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
Xinxing.

335
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
If you have time,

336
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
can you help me

337
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
bring some household goods to the hotel?

338
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
I'll send you the list later.

339
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Of course.

340
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
Don't lie to me.

341
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
Thank you.

342
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
Xinxing.

343
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
You must be careful

344
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,640
when you're out there.

345
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
If you have any questions,

346
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,640
just tell me in the group.

347
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
Okay.

348
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
Come over and help me

349
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
to put the box down.

350
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
Put it down.

351
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
Here.

352
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
Slowly.

353
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
Did you bring the book?

354
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
Yes.

355
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
This is the document.

356
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
It's the document of the body.

357
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
What are you doing?

358
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
What are you doing?

359
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
What do you mean?

360
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
What do you mean?

361
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
The shoes...

362
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
No.

363
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
Don't press it.

364
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
Put the shoes here.

365
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Don't press it.

366
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Don't press it.

367
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
Put the shoes here.

368
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
Put the shoes here.

369
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Put the shoes here.

370
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
I have a document.

371
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Put it here.

372
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
Hello, guys.

373
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,640
I've been busy with the return secret.

374
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,640
I've been running late.

375
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,640
Are you all waiting for the next episode?

376
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,640
Thank you.

377
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
Thank you for the gift.

378
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
Today,

379
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
do you want to listen to

380
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
the singer of the smart fruit

381
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
or do you want to chat with Guo Guo?

382
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,640
The smart fruit looks smart today.

383
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
You know I'm on live.

384
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,640
You even dare to disturb me.

385
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
Long time no see.

386
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,640
I'm here to give you the gift.

387
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,640
The live broadcast effect of the bar last time

388
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,640
was great.

389
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,640
There are many fans who have been smart

390
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,640
and have been famous.

391
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,640
They all count as KPI.

392
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
The mail for the fake user

393
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,640
sent you the mail.

394
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
If you look at it,

395
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,640
you'll get the money after you confirm it.

396
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
I'm not sleepy anymore.

397
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
I'll sign the contract right away.

398
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
Today,

399
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,640
Guo Guo is in a good mood.

400
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
How are you feeling?

401
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
How about we sing a happy song today?

402
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,640
Miss Qi.

403
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,640
Mr. Han.

404
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Excuse me.

405
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
I'll go first.

406
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,640
Hello, Miss.

407
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
This way, please.

408
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Thank you.

409
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,640
Hello.

410
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,640
Please give me a blanket.

411
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,640
Okay, you can go.

412
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,640
Thank you.

413
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
Hello, Miss.

414
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
Thank you.

415
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Why are you alone?

416
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,640
Where are the classmates of the financial class?

417
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
They went there one day before.

418
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
It's time for class to arrive.

419
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
I'll burn you a piece.

420
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,640
Okay.

421
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Thank you.

422
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
You're the teacher.

423
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,640
Our plane is about to take off.

424
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,640
Please take care of the bags.

425
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Please find the luggage.

426
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,640
The paper is in the bag.

427
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Hello, Miss.

428
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Wake up.

429
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,640
The plane has landed.

430
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
I'm not sure.

431
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
I'm here.

432
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
Please.

433
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
Please.

434
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
Please.

435
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,640
Please.

436
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Miss.

437
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
Mr. Han.

438
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Thank you for your warning.

439
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Thank you for your warning.

440
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
You're here for a business trip?

441
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
Yes.

442
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Which hotel do you live in?

443
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
I live in Weijing.

444
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,640
Me too.

445
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
Weijing?

446
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
What did you go to the exam for this time?

447
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
What did you go to the exam for?

448
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
All on this handbag.

449
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,640
This is the account you reported last time.

450
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
How much?

451
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
45,000 yuan.

452
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,640
As a marketer, you can pay for it.

453
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,640
It's so bad.

454
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,640
I've checked the information of these companies.

455
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
What you can find is what others want you to see.

456
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
B.

457
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,640
Kebo.

458
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,640
Han Si.

459
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
These two families were once in the yellow.

460
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
They've been walking down the road.

461
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
Many people in China know about it.

462
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,640
I really don't know they're walking down the road.

463
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,640
They say they're very powerful.

464
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
It's okay.

465
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,640
You can go and see.

466
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
Take it as a reminder.

467
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
They're not the same angle as the time.

468
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,640
They're your car.

469
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
Tabe.

470
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
Simei.

471
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
These two families have no bright spot.

472
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,640
They're the people who make the brand.

473
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,640
But there are many praise for them.

474
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,640
They're very confident.

475
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,640
You can be a reverse teacher.

476
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,640
You can change your position.

477
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,640
You can be a free person.

478
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,640
DeMan, Baiwa, AJ Technology.

479
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,640
You can take a look at these three.

480
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,640
I'm most interested in these three.

481
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
DeMan's technology is very advanced.

482
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
Baiwa.

483
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Pay attention to management.

484
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,640
The management mode is worth the credit.

485
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,640
AJ Technology's innovation is very outstanding.

486
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,640
It's always leading the industry to go crazy.

487
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,640
DeMan is...

488
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
Technology is very advanced.

489
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
Hello.

490
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,640
The common weekend today.

491
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,640
Miss, give it to me.

492
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
Thank you.

493
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,640
The photo is so beautiful.

494
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,640
I'll go look for it.

495
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Okay.

496
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Why are you here?

497
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,640
Where are you going?

498
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,480
I want to take a walk with you.

499
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,800
Great.

500
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,040
I want to take a walk, too.

501
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,800
Let's go.

502
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,600
Okay.

503
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,320
Let's go.

504
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:58,960
Let's go.

505
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,480
It seems you don't like the song.

506
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,160
I want to take a photo of them.

507
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,080
Here.

508
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,080
Where did you get it?

509
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,820
This shop

510
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,880
provides tourists to buy them.

511
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,380
It's authentic Grandpa.

512
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,580
Little star.

513
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,040
Hello.

514
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,240
Here.

515
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,800
Here.

516
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,560
CONNECTED

517
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,400
Shoot!

518
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,200
More high.

519
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,160
Do Ok while filming overseas on days you want to record your take pictures.

520
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,040
Oh, yeah, right.

521
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,160
Also, when you hear the surrounding anger from theeveryth tense,

522
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,240
you catch the people and they don't know what the weapon is.

523
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,360
What do you mean?

524
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,440
Can I take a picture of you for them?

525
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,160
OK, OK, OK, OK!

526
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,000
Do you remember Diana deadlines?

527
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
No yet.

528
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:33,640
Ah in s

529
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,800
It'sfect.

530
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:44,480
You'll make a living.

531
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Yes.

532
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
Right.

533
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,480
You have to be careful.

534
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
Okay.

535
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,480
Good.

536
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Thank you.

537
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
Thank you.

538
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Thank you.

539
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
You are so sweet.

540
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,480
You are so sweet.

541
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
Bye.

542
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Bye.

543
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
Bye.

544
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Do you understand?

545
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
I should thank you.

546
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,480
I can understand.

547
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
What about the last line?

548
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,480
What does it mean?

549
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,480
It's written by Susan.

550
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,480
You mean it slowly?

551
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,480
You are so beautiful.

552
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,480
We are the one that can't keep living.

553
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,480
Rise and see.

554
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,480
You are everything.

555
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Mr. Han is there.

556
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,480
What are you laughing at?

557
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Look.

558
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
How happy you are to play with it.

559
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
We have been to Germany

560
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
when you are not busy.

561
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,480
There are many places in Germany.

562
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,480
I didn't tell you to go to Germany.

563
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
How did you know?

564
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
I went there before.

565
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
I recognized it.

566
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,480
I asked you why you are so busy.

567
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
You went out.

568
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
It's not easy for me to see you.

569
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,480
I won't see you tonight.

570
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,480
Is your fridge so big?

571
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,480
I brought it for my friend.

572
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Here you are.

573
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
I don't drink.

574
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
It's because you don't drink.

575
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
You used this to drink with me

576
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,480
when I drank it.

577
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
Thank you.

578
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
You are welcome.

579
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,480
How do you go to the exam in the afternoon?

580
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,480
They didn't ask me to go.

581
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,480
They have a car to pick you up.

582
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
Since you are here to do the exam,

583
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
use your heart.

584
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
You can learn good experiences

585
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
and have good experiences.

586
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
You can be a good person.

587
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
This is so cute.

588
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
Okay.

589
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,480
Excuse me.

590
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
This is for you.

591
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,480
How many days have passed?

592
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
Six days.

593
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,480
I need to help you with tomorrow's schedule.

594
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,480
Are you free today?

595
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
See you at nine o'clock.

596
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,480
Okay.

597
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,480
I'll see you in ten minutes.

598
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
Okay.

599
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,480
I'll see you in ten minutes.

600
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
I'll be there in ten minutes.

601
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
Okay.

602
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
I'll see you in ten minutes.

603
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
Okay.

604
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Okay.

605
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Mr. Han.

606
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,480
How is the exam result?

607
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,480
I think every company

608
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,480
has a place to think about and reflect.

609
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
For example?

610
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,480
Hello.

611
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,480
What's happened again?

612
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
What's happened?

613
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Didn't you say

614
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
German, Bavarian, A.J. Technology are good?

615
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
I took the responsibility to examine these companies.

616
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,480
I found that their responsibilities are so modest.

617
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
And it gives people a sense of comfort.

618
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,480
Here, please.

619
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
I think

620
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,480
the company's success is all because of you.

621
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,480
And the words you said in the last book

622
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,480
from the small place to the time

623
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,480
and the market found the demand.

624
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
You came here

625
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,480
to test my true heart?

626
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,480
No.

627
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,480
I just feel more sincere

628
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,480
after my own personal experience.

629
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Where are the other companies?

630
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,480
I went to Tabe, Saimei,

631
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,480
but they were too much.

632
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,480
The staff and the boss

633
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,480
had a dream.

634
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
But when you asked about the specific business,

635
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
they all got confused.

636
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
So,

637
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,480
learning from a great leader

638
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,480
and a great company

639
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,480
is a very important thing.

640
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Tell me.

641
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
What's the matter with me?

642
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,480
I'll be back in a day.

643
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,480
I want to go to Dongyang

644
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,480
before I go there.

645
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
I'll see you at the hotel

646
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,480
at two o'clock in the afternoon.

647
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
Great! You promised.

648
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,480
Did you eat?

649
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,480
No.

650
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
I love you.

651
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,480
You're good at learning.

652
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
I'm sorry.

653
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Dongyang's base

654
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
was built in October 2017.

655
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,480
There was only one building.

656
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
The first building was built in October 2017.

657
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,480
There was only one building.

658
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,480
The first building was built in January 2017.

659
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,480
Now, the second building is complete.

660
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
The second building is the main building.

661
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,480
The third building is ahead.

662
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
It's still in construction.

663
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
What's that building for?

664
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,480
It's the center of the research project.

665
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
There's a lab.

666
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,480
There's a production base.

667
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,480
The environment here is great.

668
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,480
Welcome to Dongyang's

669
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
research center.

670
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
The robot Xiaohuang is here to serve you.

671
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,480
Her name is Xiaohuang?

672
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
The yellow one is the yellow one.

673
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,480
Xiaohuang is a robot.

674
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,480
She will take us to the restaurant

675
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
and the exhibition.

676
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,480
Hello, Miss Han.

677
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,480
Hello.

678
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Hello.

679
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Please follow Xiaohuang.

680
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
Is her original system Chinese?

681
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
She will use our sample

682
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,480
and our conversation

683
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
will be shared by Chinese.

684
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
This exhibition is

685
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
a product of the artificial intelligence

686
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
of Dongyang's research base.

687
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
It's divided into different exhibitions

688
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
according to the function.

689
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
Please continue to go forward with Xiaohuang.

690
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,480
The exhibition is about

691
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,480
the development of the artificial intelligence

692
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
of the Chinese.

693
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,480
The exhibition is about

694
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,480
the development of the artificial intelligence

695
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
of the Chinese.

696
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
The exhibition is about

697
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,480
the development of the artificial intelligence

698
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
of the Chinese.

699
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
The exhibition is about

700
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,480
the development of the artificial intelligence

701
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
of the Chinese.

702
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
The exhibition is about

703
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,480
the development of the artificial intelligence

704
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
of the Chinese.

705
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,480
The exhibition is about

706
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,480
the development of the artificial intelligence

707
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,480
of the Chinese.

708
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,480
The exhibition is about

709
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,480
the development of the artificial intelligence

710
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
of the Chinese.

711
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
The exhibition is about

712
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
the development of

713
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
the artificial intelligence

714
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
of the Chinese.

715
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:27,900
Please read

716
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,480
it out,

717
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,480
Why are the failed products on the top?

718
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,480
The success of the light ring turns into a miracle.

719
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,480
The failed teaching can keep us from going forward.

720
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,480
Then why did they develop failures?

721
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,480
Technology is safe.

722
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,480
The main thing is that the market is not accurate in analysis.

723
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,480
In fact, developing new products is like gambling.

724
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
It's just that some people are in a lot of different ways.

725
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
But not 100% winning.

726
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,480
The big group in Dongyang is strong and strong.

727
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,480
It can also be made a mistake.

728
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,480
For a small company like us,

729
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,480
if we make a mistake, it may be over.

730
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,480
I have been thinking about the positioning of new products.

731
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,480
I'm afraid of choosing the wrong product.

732
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
I also studied all the products of Hanhai.

733
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,480
I thought about competing with them.

734
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
But I was often accused of being a fraud.

735
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,480
There is a good thing about competition.

736
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,480
But you can't be confused by the opponent.

737
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
Choose the product and start with your own personal situation.

738
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,480
The company also has its own unique features and styles.

739
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,480
That's why it has the best performance.

740
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,480
Your brother also came to the basketball court?

741
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
Yes.

742
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
He came when he was under pressure.

743
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
You were under a lot of pressure in Germany.

744
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,480
But then I realized that there is pressure and motivation.

745
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
As long as you adjust your mentality,

746
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,480
you can change it yourself.

747
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
Do you know how to play basketball?

748
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
Of course.

749
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,480
I'll teach you.

750
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,480
Come on.

751
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
I'll teach you.

752
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

753
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

754
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

755
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

756
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

757
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

758
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

759
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

760
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

761
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

762
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

763
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

764
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

765
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

766
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

767
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

768
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
I'm afraid of being a fraud.

769
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,480
What's the problem?

770
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,480
I'm not a fraud.

771
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
I'm a fraud.

772
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,480
You look so handsome in that white skin.

773
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
How about adding some black skin?

774
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
I'm not a fraud.

775
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,480
I'm not a fraud.

776
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,480
I'm a fraud.

777
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
Okay, do it slowly.

778
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,480
I'm not familiar with this place,

779
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
I haven't known you since you've played basketball.

780
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
What do you mean?

781
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
You're like a drunk boy.

782
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
What are you talking about?

783
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
I'm really lucky.

784
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,480
You're so energetic.

785
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,480
You must be tired.

786
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,480
Drink more water.

787
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
Okay, drink it.

788
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
Come on, drink it.

789
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,480
Come on, drink it.

790
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,480
Thank you for taking care of me these days.

791
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,480
Give it to me.

792
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,480
I found that the exercise is quite suppressive.

793
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,480
I have a lot of thoughts in my mind now.

794
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,480
But I also have a lot of worries.

795
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,480
You regret your work out?

796
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,480
I regret it.

797
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
Don't give yourself too much pressure.

798
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
Take your time.

799
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,480
I won't cut off the stars because of your footstep.

800
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,480
Try this salad.

801
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
It's very delicious.

802
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
No.

803
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,480
Isn't the person who cares the most about the head?

804
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,480
Don't you think it's not up to us to cut off the stars?

805
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,480
I don't care about your footstep.

806
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,480
It's because the creative and life are very similar.

807
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
They all have their own ways.

808
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,480
You don't need to go to the point where you dare to go to other companies.

809
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
You can walk your own path.

810
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,480
The flower season should come.

811
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
It will always come.

812
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,480
I won't drink wine.

813
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,480
But I know how to make chicken soup.

814
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,480
Drink slowly.

815
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
Don't drink too much.

816
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,480
No.

817
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
When people are happy, they won't drink.

818
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,480
So you're very happy today.

819
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,480
I'm not happy today.

820
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,480
I'm not happy today.

821
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,480
The music in this shop is so nice.

822
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,480
It's good and feels good.

823
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,680
Just go back straight.

824
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,760
It was a good sound.

825
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,360
You shouldn't have drink too much.

826
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
Be careful.

827
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,780
It's okay.

828
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,980
You

829
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,420
Were you with your girlfriend

830
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,460
in Germany

831
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,840
when you were a little girl here ?

832
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,380
Were you different?

833
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:11,940
No.

834
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,060
Really?

835
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,220
You looked like this...

836
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,740
Hello to 911.

837
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,140
I've got English lessons in the country

838
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,660
and busy with creative work.

839
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,260
You don't have so much thought.

840
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,740
Not like you.

841
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,820
Life is full of talents.

842
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,700
Work, love, and care.

843
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,060
How do I feel that you're trying to fool me?

844
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,700
In your eyes,

845
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,700
am I just a person who only tries to fool you?

846
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,100
Not really.

847
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,300
Then what am I like?

848
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:23,140
You were standing in my opposite side.

849
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:30,140
You were trying to take me into the world I'm not familiar with.

850
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:34,140
Those who seem far away,

851
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,540
but hate each other in between.

852
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:43,140
I want to test who has crossed the border.

853
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:49,140
If I can get closer to you,

854
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:56,140
can I start over with memories?

855
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,140
Time goes by so fast,

856
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,140
let the lonely be safe.

857
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:11,140
Don't let the flow become a kind of adventure.

858
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:18,140
Time goes by so fast,

859
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:23,140
let the lonely be safe.

860
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:28,140
Don't let the flow become a kind of adventure.

861
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:35,140
Don't let the flow become a kind of adventure.

862
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:41,140
Don't let the flow become a kind of adventure.

863
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:46,140
We can stay for a while,

864
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:53,140
and let our feelings be given to you.

865
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,140
Don't be afraid,

866
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:59,140
you have to face the difficulties.

867
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:08,140
Don't let the flow become a kind of adventure.

868
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:13,140
Don't be afraid.
