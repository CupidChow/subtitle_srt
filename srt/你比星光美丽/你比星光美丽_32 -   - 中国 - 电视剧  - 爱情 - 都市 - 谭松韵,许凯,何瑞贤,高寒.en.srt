Xing,

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,840
what are we going to do next?

25
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,760
Next, you will

26
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,560
go over your work at hand

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,230
and get ready for the merger.

28
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,950
Their guys will be sent for the takeover.

29
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
As long as you guys stay,

30
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,870
Xingchen will not fall apart.

31
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,630
Miss Ji,

32
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,760
after the merger,

33
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,680
we will not disgrace Xingchen.

34
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,550
Chang He,

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,520
I really didn't tell

36
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,000
you could be so romantic.

37
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,310
For Zeng Di,

38
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,680
you exchanged Xingchen's shares

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,630
for Han Ting's shares in Guanghua.

40
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,030
Ms. Yuan, take it easy.

41
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,150
Love is love.

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,430
Business is business.

43
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,400
Dongyang Medical holds shares in Hanhai.

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,360
Even if Tongke

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,710
is a small shareholder of Xingchen,

46
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,080
we can hardly surpass Dongyang Medical

47
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,150
in a short time.

48
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,630
But with some shares in Guanghua,

49
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,840
I'm confident enough to persuade Zeng Di

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,630
to let me wholly own Guanghua.

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,840
Then, I can truly strengthen Tongke

52
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
and boost its stock price.

53
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,470
So, you betrayed me?

54
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,120
I just made

55
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,190
the most beneficial choice for Tongke.

56
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,960
You know what you'll get from offending me.

57
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,120
Ms. Yuan, calm down. Don't be angry.

58
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,430
Dongyang Medical has nothing to do with you.

59
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,430
If you get rid of an ally like me,

60
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,910
next, Han Ting will

61
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,400
kick you out of Dongyang.

62
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,710
You want to use me for leverage?

63
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,560
I always believe

64
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,520
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,910
Ms. Yuan,

66
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
you will need me

67
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,310
in some cases.

68
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,310
OK.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,870
I'd like to see

70
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,710
what else you can do.

71
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,960
But let me remind you.

72
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,150
My pet peeve

73
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,030
is to be used as a trade bait.

74
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,540
(Dongyang Group)

75
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,680
Boss, Ms. Yuan is here.

76
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,400
Han Ting,

77
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,400
congratulations.

78
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,910
You fulfilled your pledge ahead of time.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,840
I thought

80
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,030
you were here to apologize

81
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,750
instead of congratulating me.

82
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,390
What are you talking about?

83
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,390
You colluded with Chang He
a long time ago, huh?

84
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,870
Without proof,

85
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,240
don't slander me like that.

86
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,040
When I secretly offered

87
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,510
to acquire Zhu's Medical Instrument,

88
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,000
Chang He started

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,430
to negotiate with Zhu Houyu.

90
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,870
He knew what I was doing

91
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,120
and he even knew my offer.

92
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,720
If an insider helped him,

93
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,870
it could be no one but you.

94
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,880
Think about it.

95
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,600
If I show these photos

96
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
to the directors or Grandpa,

97
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,360
what will happen?

98
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,360
I really overestimated your wisdom.

99
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,310
In an internal competition,

100
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,360
I don't care.

101
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,270
But colluding with our rival

102
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,070
and selling company secrets

103
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,430
are another thing.

104
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,600
I thought even if you had a problem with me,

105
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,950
you would at least

106
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,360
put our company interests first.

107
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,560
I didn't expect you to be so silly.

108
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,390
Do you not remember

109
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,720
you're the vice chairwoman of Dongyang?

110
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,560
Since you get something on me,

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,870
punish me the way you want.

112
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,670
Just right.

113
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,480
After you take me down,

114
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720
no one in Dongyang will object to you.

115
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,160
I won't make it public.

116
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't get me wrong.

117
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,200
You're my family.

118
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,390
Making my family a laughingstock

119
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,390
isn't what I would do.

120
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,640
Also,

121
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,000
I took back Xingchen completely

122
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,800
from your ally Chang He

123
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,630
with a mere exchange of interests.

124
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,960
Yuan,

125
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,600
a stranger can't be trusted.

126
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,400
In the future,

127
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,360
will you cooperate with me

128
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,000
or will you go your own way?

129
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,390
Or will you keep competing?

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,840
The choice is yours.

131
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,750
As for your shares in Dongyang Medical,

132
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
give them to me soon.

133
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Seriously, I admire you.

134
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,640
To win,

135
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,190
you got your beloved woman involved

136
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,360
and made use of her.

137
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,680
Ordinary people can't do that.

138
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,830
Even after this case is over,

139
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,630
Ji Xing will not be with you

140
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,510
as if nothing happened,

141
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,430
unless she has no feelings for you.

142
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,950
I'm quite curious.

143
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,040
What do you want her to do,

144
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,230
leave or stay?

145
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,040
Dahuang doesn't leave with me.

146
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,480

Xing,

165
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,320
you forgot your skincare.

166
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,670
Tomorrow is the New Year's Eve.

167
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,390
Go back home for some good rest.

168
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,750
Don't think of anything.

169
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,150
I won't think of anything.

170
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,750
All I want is to celebrate the New Year.

171
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,150
But you've packed so many things.

172
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,870
Will you not come back after the New Year?

173
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,630
What are you thinking?

174
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,320
Oh, the skincare your mother wanted.

175
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,720
Got a taxi for tomorrow morning?

176
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,030
Yes. Don't worry.

177
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,870
OK.

178
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll pick up my suitcase and go.

179
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,000
What about you?
How will you celebrate it?

180
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,510
I'll celebrate it alone more freely.

181
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,870
So, this year,

182
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,000
let's still have a video chat.

183
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,600
We will.

184
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,750
Come on. Press it.

185
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,480
Done. Lock it up.

186
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,120
You're fantastic.

187
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,080
Mom?

188
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,440
What are you doing here?

189
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,600
You didn't go home. Can I not even come?

190
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,510
That's not what I mean.

191
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,670
You could have told me

192
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,720
and I could have picked you up.

193
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,630
If I called you,

194
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,870
could I even come?

195
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,670
Mom, when you talk,

196
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,320
do not satirize me.

197
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,870
How do I satirize you?

198
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,670
Before, you had

199
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,790
a rich boyfriend.

200
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,270
What did I say?

201
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,600
I told you he was honey-tongued

202
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,720
and trickery.

203
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,080
I told you not to get stuck.

204
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,670
You just didn't listen.

205
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,150
When you broke up with him,

206
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,240
you deserved that pain.

207
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,790
Mom, who did you get such information from?

208
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,600
Can you stop doing this?

209
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,390
You're my daughter.

210
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,030
When you don't tell me anything,

211
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,910
why can't I ask someone else?

212
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,120
I read about your posts
from someone else's Moment

213
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,320
and is that illegal?

214
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,400
- I tell you nothing
- What the heck!

215
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,790
just because I don't want to hear this.

216
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,200
Give me some space, will you?

217
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,440
What is wrong with you?

218
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,030
Why do you never listen to me?

219
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,120
You'll lose something one day.

220
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,030
I told you.

221
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,200
Why do you always talk to me like this?

222
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,960
Han Ting,

223
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,270
why did you steer the yacht so fast?

224
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,390
Trying to kill me?

225
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,910
You're just too weak.

226
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,120
No personal insult, please.

227
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,720
I'm here with you for good intentions.

228
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,600
Xiaomeng told me

229
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,440
you would have gone

230
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,790
to Ji Xing's hometown for New Year.

231
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,910
Don't be so serious.

232
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,510
It's normal

233
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,630
when the couple quarrels, right?

234
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,390
Come on. Don't be too hasty.

235
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,200
Let Ji Xing go home

236
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,320
and calm down.

237
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,390
When she's back in a few days,

238
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,870
you can coax her.

239
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,480
A couple usually makes up quickly.

240
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,960
Do you think she will come around?

241
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,320
She will.

242
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,910
She loves you, doesn't she?

243
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,600
Besides,

244
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,440
when she's with you,

245
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,720
not to mention Hanhai Xingchen,

246
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,600
even Dongyang Medical will be hers.

247
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
She will understand.

248
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,320
Something wrong with that?

249
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,480
She isn't in?

250
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,000
He's quite eligible.

251
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,600
Why do you not want that?

252
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,480
Tomorrow, go with me

253
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,320
and see him.

254
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,440
Go if you want. I just won't.

255
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,270
What are you doing here?

256
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,870
Who's he?

257
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,440
Hi, madam.

258
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,440
I'm Li Li's boyfriend.

259
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,320
I'm here to visit you.

260
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,660
(Rhubarb Rice)

261
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,870
What are you up to?

262
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,240
I meant to bring you some New Year's food.

263
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,750
Then I heard your mother

264
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,720
force you to have a blind date

265
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,670
and you didn't want it.

266
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,240
So, I was trying to help you out.

267
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,750
Don't worry.

268
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,720
We're just a fake couple.

269
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,160
Oh, Su.

270
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,790
How about you come out and sit?

271
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,360
Let Li Li do the cooking.

272
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,440
Be right there, madam.

273
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,120
Don't say too much.

274
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,800
Rest assured.

275
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,560
Madam.

276
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,840
Come and sit.

277
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,630
Since when were you in a relationship?

278
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,670
Why did Li Li never

279
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,200
tell me about you?

280
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,870
Madam,

281
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,360
it's normal for Li Li

282
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,200
not to talk about me.

283
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,910
I can't get tested from you

284
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,080
too early, right?

285
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,200
You know what?

286
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,200
I fell in love with Li Li at first sight.

287
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,670
To pursue her,

288
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,910
I did a lot of funny things.

289
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,000
You did? Tell me about it.

290
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,480
At that time, Li Li had a boyfriend.

291
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
But I didn't know.

292
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
She loved a bag.

293
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,320
I wanted to buy one for her.

294
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,000
But when I just received the bag,

295
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,360
she was already using one

296
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,840
from her ex-boyfriend.

297
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,600
Later, I got to know

298
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,910
that bag wasn't available online.

299
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,840
But I bought one online.

300
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,720
I was so silly, wasn't I?

301
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,510
Your money was wasted, huh?

302
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,320
It wasn't.

303
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,270
I bought that bag

304
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,910
to make Li Li happy.

305
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,270
She got that bag

306
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,600
from someone else.

307
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,150
But when she was happy,

308
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,360
I was happy, too.

309
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,750
You're quite honest.

310
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,480
I think

311
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,550
you're far better

312
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,240
than her ex-boyfriend.

313
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,720
Don't think he's sincere

314
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,360
just because he bought Li Li a bag.

315
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,440
So little money

316
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,550
is nothing to that man.

317
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,840
He can casually spend it

318
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
just to make a woman happy.

319
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,240
When he bought Li Li a bag,

320
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,720
he could buy a car for another woman.

321
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,360
Mom, you just won't stop, huh?

322
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
You have poor taste.

323
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,630
The boyfriend you had

324
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,830
was really unreliable.

325
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,790
Why can't I complain?

326
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,590
Madam,

327
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,110
I don't quite agree.

328
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,920
Because shortly after that, Li Li broke up

329
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,760
with that man.

330
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,310
She chose me wisely.

331
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm only a little bit successful.

332
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,790
But I have true feelings

333
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,030
for Li Li.

334
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,400
And it was hard for us

335
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,590
to get together.

336
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,110
Think about it. When we go out,

337
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,960
everybody will praise her

338
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,270
for having good taste, won't they?

339
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,920
It's also your glory, isn't it?

340
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,350
Yeah, it's really my honor

341
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,160
to have picked you.

342
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,000
That's true.

343
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,680
Li Li has finally had a good boyfriend.

344
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,240
Madam,

345
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,240
Li Li didn't go home for the New Year.

346
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,000
But you're here for her.

347
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,240
And she has a boyfriend like me.

348
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,590
We're in a stable relationship.

349
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,960
In this way,

350
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,270
we have a family reunion.

351
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,200
How about this, madam?

352
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,000
Have some glutinous rice balls.

353
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,750
Wish you happiness and good luck

354
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,070
in the coming New Year.

355
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,240
You taste some, too.

356
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,270
It has black sesame filling.

357
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,110
Tastes good.

358
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,110
OK.

359
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
Let's have good luck.

360
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,400
So sweet.

361
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,590
Madam,

362
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,800
you know what?

363
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,030
To pursue Li Li,

364
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,790
I really did a lot of funny things.

365
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,510
A friend of mine

366
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,720
said I couldn't get Li Li

367
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,240
because I had a poor style.

368
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,310
He dragged me to his house

369
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,000
and dressed me up differently.

370
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,960
The next day, I went to my office.

371
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,200
As soon as Li Li saw me, she said,

372
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,440
"Your outfit is

373
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,720
extraordinary."

374
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
Then she walked away.

375
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,310
I froze where I was.

376
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,150
I didn't know

377
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,640
whether it was a compliment or sarcasm.

378
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
Then, everybody in my company

379
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,200
laughed at me.

380
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,400
I was so pissed off.

381
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,310
There was another time...

382
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,400
I'll put your suitcase in your room.

383
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,240
OK.

384
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,310
Xing,

385
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,790
tell me.

386
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,510
Why isn't Han here?

387
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,310
He has a family emergency

388
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,310
and he can't come.

389
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,110
But he promised to come.

390
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,030
I've prepared the toiletries for him.

391
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,200
It's OK. Maybe another time.

392
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,000
Well, go take some rest.

393
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,270
I'll call you when dinner is ready.

394
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,280
OK.

395
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,200
Our daughter looks awful.

396
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,590
What happened?

397
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,400
Han isn't coming?

398
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,000
No.

399
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,150
Why?

400
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,830
How do I know?

401
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,920
When we have dinner,

402
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,030
don't ask improper questions.

403
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,720
I know.

404
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,110
I was right, huh?

405
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,440
What did I say?

406
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,960
The contradiction between you

407
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,310
can hardly be reconciled.

408
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,880
You will end up separated.

409
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,350
Grandpa,

410
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,510
she and I aren't done.

411
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,790
Still deny it?

412
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,830
Not every piece of calligraphy

413
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,400
will be stamped.

414
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,030
You're stubborn.

415
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,680
Fine. I'll wait and see.

416
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,110
Let's see if you can get her back.

417
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,660
(Poles Apart)

418
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,860
(Blossom)

419
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,070
Here come the prawns.

420
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,110
Xing,

421
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,270
your favorite beef balls...

422
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,830
I asked your father to make quite a lot.

423
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,350
You'll have enough today.

424
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,110
Yeah. It's the festival.

425
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,110
Don't think about losing weight.

426
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,310
Just eat.

427
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,400
Do you hear? Come on.

428
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,550
Have a prawn for nutrition.

429
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,680
Have more. Prawns are nutritious.

430
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,280
And this.

431
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,550
I made the bacon myself.

432
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,770
It's your favorite.

433
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,830
During the festival, you will

434
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,160
feed me like a piglet.

435
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,640
A piglet isn't as lovely as my daughter.

436
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,160
- Right?
- Yeah.

437
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,110
Here. You have some, too.

438
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,030
The beef balls Dad makes

439
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,880
are the most delicious.

440
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,590
Aren't they? I cook as well as before.

441
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,240
Dad and Mom,

442
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,590
after dinner,

443
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,510
I'll go out to see the fireworks.

444
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,310
Shall I go with you?

445
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,270
Yeah. We can go together.

446
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,270
No need. You just watch the gala.

447
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,310
I want to walk around alone.

448
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,430
Fine.

449
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,520
OK.

450
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,160
But it's cold out there.

451
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,070
When you go out,

452
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,910
wear more.

453
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,880
Come on. Just eat.

454
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,160
- Here.
- Oh, no.

455
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,400
Glutinous rice balls are being boiled.

456
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,510
I forgot that.

457
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Look at you.

458
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,200
What a poor memory you have!

459
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,670
Oh, your mother.

460
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Light it and run back over.

461
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,480
Don't get too close.

462
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,640
Hurry.

463
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,210
Oh, yeah. Come on.

464
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,060
- Take a photo.
- Yeah.

465
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,190
- Take a photo.
- I'll do a video.

466
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,310
Let me do a video.

467
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,720
It's glorious.

468
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,590
Come on. Hurry.

469
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,640
- Take a photo.
- Come on.

470
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,750
Turn around. Turn around.

471
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,270
- Looks great.
- Grandaunt.

472
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,190
I should go.

473
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,550
It's so late. Where are you going?

474
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,030
Come on, Linjia.

475
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:43,880
Don't just look. Come.

476
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
Ting, it's the New Year's Eve. Don't leave.

477
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,080
Stay and play with us.

478
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,880
Yeah. Look, the fireworks are glorious.

479
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,830
Have fun with us.

480
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,830
Zhou Ying is making dumplings.

481
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,790
We haven't had dumplings yet.

482
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,720
- Come on.
- Grandaunt.

483
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,590
I'm tired. I'll go.

484
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,160
Why are you rushing for?

485
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,680
Come on, Linjia.

486
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,160
Something's wrong with him.

487
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,040
What happened?

488
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,090
They quarreled.

489
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,110
He quarreled with Ji Xing?

490
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,920
A quarrel means they'll be OK.

491
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,960
But you... Care more about your son.

492
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,550
Why would I care about my silly son?

493
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,350
This one looks great.

494
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,880
- Hurry. Take a photo.
- I'll do it.

495
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,720
Turn the camera...

496
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,110
Oh, I've got a message.

497
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,950
Who sent it?

498
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,200
Xiaomeng.

499
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,880
She's so lovely and caring.

500
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,350
- She sent me a video.
- Hi, Ms. Han.

501
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,720
Happy New Year.

502
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,070
In the coming year,

503
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,920
hope you can sing aloud

504
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,960
and sing whenever you want.

505
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,920
She's so adorable.

506
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,400
Thanks, Xiaomeng. Happy Chinese New Year.

507
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,240
After the New Year,

508
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,200
let's go to Linjia's bar

509
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
and sing together.

510
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,870
She's so cute.

511
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,510
Why hasn't she texted me?

512
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,880
She knows who is the boss of our family.

513
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,720
It's glorious.

514
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,440
I'll go check the dumplings.

515
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,960
- Be careful.
- OK.

516
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,480
- Stay safe when you play.
- I will.

517
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,320
I get it.

518
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
(Lu Linjia)
Why did you only

519
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
send my mother a video

520
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,880
instead of sending me one?

521
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,160
(Smart Lemon)
Your mother is more important.

522
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,590
She's prioritized.

523
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,680
Happy Chinese New Year.

524
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,790
I'm setting off fireworks.

525
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,630
Let me do a video for you.

526
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,910
Look.

527
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,270
I'll get closer.

528
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,240
This is the Chinese New Year's Eve.

529
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,440
On such a day of family reunions,

530
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,440
the whole city

531
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,400
is shrouded in a happy atmosphere.

532
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,000
Let's get rid of the old year

533
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,030
and welcome a brand new year.

534
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,100

Why do you make a wish to fireworks?

546
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,070
Fireworks look most like meteors.

547
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,640
Make wishes to fireworks

548
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,160
and all of them will come true.

549
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,350

Thank you, Mr. Han. The same to you.

00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,320
Han.

565
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,680
When did you have a new password?

566
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
I'm a great friend, huh?

567
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,960
I'm here for you on such a night.

568
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,070
Shouldn't you make me some good dishes?

569
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,440
What is your new password?

570
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,400
Her birthdate.

571
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,070
Looks like

572
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,920
you've been having a hard time.

573
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,590
It's OK. I'm here for you.

574
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,270
It's the New Year's Eve.

575
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,070
Why do you not keep Beibei company?

576
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,590
She has gone abroad with my parents.

577
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,640
I had planned to spare some time

578
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,790
and celebrate it with Li Li.

579
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,480
Unexpectedly...

580
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,550
Ji Xing has totally moved out, huh?

581
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,200
You suffered a double loss.

582
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,720
So sad for your shares in Guanghua.

583
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,480
You spent all of them on Xingchen.

584
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,510
It's good to have Han Yuan
see through Chang He.

585
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,160
I'll cooperate with her later.

586
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,160
But you let go of Guanghua like this.

587
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,000
We don't know

588
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,480
what trouble it will have.

589
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,920
If you feel bad, just drink.

590
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,830
I'm here to talk to you

591
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,070
and distract you.

592
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,200
You just don't cooperate.

593
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
The wine is better.

594
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,040
Don't worry.

595
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,790
You and I are in different cases.

596
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,400
I want to see her, but I can't.

597
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,400
After the New Year,

598
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,110
you'll have a shareholders' meeting, right?

599
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,750
Ji Xing still works for Hanhai Xingchen.

600
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,510
You'll often meet her.

601
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,160
You have plenty of chances to get her back.

602
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,320
Dahuang?

603
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,310
It's dinner time.

604
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,640
Come have dinner.

605
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,350
Dahuang?

606
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,350
Dahuang.

607
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,480
Dahuang.

608
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,870
Dahuang!

609
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,110
Dahuang!

610
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,190
What happened?

611
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,550
Dahuang is gone.

612
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,350
You live on the upper floor.

613
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,720
It can't jump off.

614
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,720
Unless the door isn't...

615
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,320
Dahuang!

616
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,670
Dahuang!

617
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,000
Dahuang!

618
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,110
Dahuang!

619
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,390
Dahuang!

620
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,960
- Dahuang!
- Dahuang!

621
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,350
Dahuang!

622
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,150
Dahuang!

623
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,840
Dahuang!

624
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,080
Dahuang!

625
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,350
Quiet.

626
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,430
Dahuang.

627
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,270
Don't get down! There's a bridge!

628
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,070
If you don't mind,

629
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,350
I should go.

630
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,110
You got your cat back.

631
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,590
You'll get her back, too.

632
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,110
Happy Chinese New Year.

633
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,790
You sneaked out.

634
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,310
Is it because you also missed her?

635
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,510
Don't sneak out anymore.

636
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,440
She will be back.

637
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,070
Before that,

638
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,280
let's wish her a happy New Year, OK?

639
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,950
Come on.

640
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,500
(Xing, Happy New Year.)

641
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,280
Happy New Year.

642
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,860
(Dongyang Group)

643
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,230
Boss, the shareholders' meeting
of Hanhai Xingchen

644
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,110
will start in half an hour.

645
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,800
Going so early?

646
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,140
(Ji Xing)

647
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:02,540
(Han Ting)

648
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,480
Mr. Han, you're so early.

649
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,160
- Mr. Han.
- Mr. Han.

650
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,070
We're not late, are we?

651
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,350
Mr. Han.

652
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,720
Mr. Han.

653
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,070
Hi, Mr. Han.

654
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,510
Mr. Han, let's get started.

655
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,320
Miss Ji hasn't arrived.

656
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,230
Let's wait for her.

657
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,560
(Luo Ping)
Miss Ji...

658
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,920
She texted me, saying she would not come.

659
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,670
Fine. Let's get started.

660
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,630
Today, our topic

661
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,190
is the appointment of personnel

662
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,710
for all departments of Hanhai Xingchen.

663
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,510
After the merger,

664
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,000
there will be one president

665
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,190
and two vice presidents.

666
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,110
I'll be the president.

667
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,960
The vice presidents will be

668
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,110
Chen Ningyang, former CEO of Hanhai,

669
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,400
and Ji Xing, former CEO of Xingchen Technology.

670
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,670
Xingchen Technology

671
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,440
retains its right of independent R&D.

672
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,230
The form technical departments

673
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,440
of Hanhai and Xingchen

674
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,590
will become

675
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,400
Technical Division 1 and Division 2

676
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,670
of Hanhai Xingchen.

677
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,280
The director of Division 2

678
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,670
will be Su Zhizhou.

679
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,590
Other departments will be merged.

680
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,630
(Luo Ping)
Li Li, the purchasing director

681
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,030
of Xingchen Technology,

682
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,840
will be the deputy director
of the Sales Department.

683
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,760
The director of Division 1

684
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,840
will be Wang Yu.

685
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,510
I can agree to your terms.

686
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,880
But I hope

687
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,710
Xingchen will not have any other teams.

688
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,030
In terms of human resources,

689
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,070
I'll have full control.

690
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,510
Agreed.

691
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,350
May we work well together.

692
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,800
We will.

693
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,400
You and I will celebrate

694
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,480
all your birthdays from now on.

695
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,590
I'll always be with you

696
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,800
for reunion.

697
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,840
OK.

698
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,920
Hope Hanhai Xingchen will prosper.

699
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,920
Mr. Han, do you have anything else to say?

700
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,360
So much for today.

701
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,630
OK. Dismissed.

702
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,340
(Ji Xing)

703
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:25,980
(Han Ting)

704
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,480
The subscriber you dialed

705
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,030
cannot be reached.

706
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,840
Please redial later.

707
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,300
(Xing)

708
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,550
The subscriber you dialed

709
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,920
cannot be reached.

710
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,980
(Ji Xing)

711
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,800
Shang,

712
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,160
what's wrong?

713
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,800
Miss Li and Mr. Su,

714
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,240
we...

715
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,070
We all received an email from Miss Ji.

716
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,180
(A Letter to Family)

717
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,280
Since Xingchen was established,

718
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,670
it's been simply more than one year.

719
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,550
But we've gone through

720
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,590
a lot of things together.

721
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,190
Like old comrades-in-arms,

722
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,110
we have a deep bond.

723
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,360
Due to everybody's effort,

724
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,920
Xingchen has been glowing.

725
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,480
It has become a rising star in this industry

726
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,190
from an unknown company.

727
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,440
(A Letter to Family)
Shang, thank you for staying with Xingchen

728
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,030
through the hardest time in the beginning.

729
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,960
Even when we had

730
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,440
a financial problem,

731
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,230
you didn't leave us.

732
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,360
Instead, you hung on long enough

733
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,190
until we got financing.

734
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,710
They all say eating instant noodles
is your signature.

735
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,510
I've got you a long-term VIP card

736
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,000
in the Food Hall downstairs.

737
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,510
(Food Hall)
Hope you'll have meals regularly

738
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,920
and take good care of yourself.

739
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,070
Instant noodles are delicious.

740
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,150
But you can sometimes try something else.

741
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,720
Xia,

742
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,320
thank you for picking Xingchen at first.

743
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,280
And thank you for trusting me again

744
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,070
and coming back to us

745
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,440
after you left.

746
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,880
You've grown with us until now.

747
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,840
I put two books on your desk.

748
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,400
(Resignation)
They're the most useful

749
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,190
reference books I've been reading

750
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,800
about 3D medical printing.

751
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,510
In the books, I wrote down

752
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,760
some notes and comments.

753
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,440
Hope they can help you.

754
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,660
(3D Printing)

755
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,240
Zuo,

756
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,840
you joined Xingchen upon graduation.

757
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,480
You and Xingchen

758
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,840
have grown together.

759
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,960
You made some mistakes during the process.

760
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,670
But you have long been

761
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,070
the technical backbone.

762
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,320
Zhizhou told me

763
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,510
you always carried a notebook

764
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,230
with all the operation details on it.

765
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,030
The iPad in your drawer

766
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,630
is my personal support for you.

767
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,960
Hope it will

768
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,800
go further with you.

769
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,350
Youyou,

770
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,920
thank you for joining Xingchen

771
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,400
after your internship in a big company.

772
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,920
I see you drink coffee all the time.

773
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,190
You must be an enthusiast for coffee.

774
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,070
I've got you some dark roast coffee

775
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,760
you love most.

776
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,630
But don't drink too much coffee a day.

777
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,190
Drink it in moderation.

778
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,840
Hi, Zhong.

779
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,440
You're a fantastic girl.

780
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:45,400
You can always surprise us.

781
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,320
Your desk is also the most distinctive

782
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,400
in the office area.

783
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,030
I'll leave you

784
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,150
the succulent on my desk.

785
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,510
Hope you'll take care of it for me.
