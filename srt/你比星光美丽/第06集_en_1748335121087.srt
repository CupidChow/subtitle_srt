1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to forget the past.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sure I'll be brave.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'm going to forget the past.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't give up.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll be more confident.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Even if I'm not alone.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Mr. Han, where do you think our problem is?

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You lack management experience.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You don't have the people in the industry.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You don't have sales or channels.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You don't have the product to be sold in the market.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Mr. Han.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Thank you for reminding me.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've already sent it.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll reflect and make up when I go back.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But since Mr. Han doesn't want to give up.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I won't bother you.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I hope we can work together in other places.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
After all, it's a joke.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm not in the business.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No business.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Business is not a friend.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's an enemy.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's our honor to be the enemy of Mr. Han.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You're so confident.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You can succeed in business.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Mr. Han.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
There may be a problem in your eyes.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But in this society, no one can suppress anyone's light.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The truth is old and simple.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's gold.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It will shine.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You may be a gold-hearted person.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But don't forget.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This city is full of gold.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Long road.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Walk around.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Zhizhou, let's go.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Sorry to bother you.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's go.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Goodbye, Mr. Han.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Tianzhen.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Xing, I think Mr. Han is right.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Since it's a project,

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
why don't we do it together?

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
After we get the money,

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
we...

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What's wrong, Xing?

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I regret it.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's go back to him.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I regret working with you.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Xing, I think they're really good at making conditions for him.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Besides, we have nothing else to do.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Su Zhizhou, didn't you understand?

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He made our city a mess.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He made us suspect.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And he didn't succeed in the business.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He said he was not a friend, but an enemy.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He threatened us.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He took you to his rhythm step by step.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're a boss like him.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Do you think you can get out of it?

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He said you should go back now.

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm not going.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
People have to have their own style.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What we're going to do now is to go forward.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If we don't go back, we'll succeed in the business.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Xing, you're so handsome.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You...

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Where's your style?

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm looking at Liang Yan.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Then take it home and watch.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Take it home and watch.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Sure.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Boss, you've prepared so much.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Xing, you're still the one who refused.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't worry.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He won't take long.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Everyone, this is your

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
victory in the final round

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
of the tournament.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thank you.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Thank you for your support.

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
After the live broadcast,

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I will sing.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Thank you.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What songs do you want to listen to?

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Good days.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Good, good.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Today is the good day, right?

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It depends on now.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,600
I'm sure the famous Lu Jia Niang Hua

103
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,000
will be able to walk straight to the heart of the baby.

104
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,400
Maybe your Lu will be late,

105
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,000
but you won't be absent.

106
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
It's okay.

107
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,600
It's okay to fail.

108
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,000
Thank you for helping me pick up the baby.

109
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,800
Let's use the book.

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Guo Guo is giving a song to read the apple.

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,800
And his Lu song.

112
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,400
A song for you.

113
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,000
The little time is still long.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
I can't forget you.

115
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't be afraid, Dahuang.

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
You can be with me again.

117
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
The sky is dark.

118
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,200
We are the same.

119
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,200
The hope of the world is warm.

120
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,000
This reporter

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
is definitely a lesson in your career.

122
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,800
We've known each other for so long.

123
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,000
I've never seen anyone

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,400
who can mess with you

125
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,000
while being a kid.

126
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
You can't even drink your wine.

127
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,000
You can just start a reporter.

128
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,400
The way of creating is not for anyone.

129
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,600
He has the ability to think.

130
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,200
He can directly enter the East.

131
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,600
He can show his ability to make the most of it.

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,200
Creating a career.

133
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,400
It's not just about technology.

134
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
You are a man.

135
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,400
It's good to have someone you like.

136
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,200
Anyway, I don't want him to be successful

137
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,600
and can make up for his mistake.

138
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,000
Let's see.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,400
He has nothing to do with the complicated investment.

140
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,000
Chun Chun is a god of love.

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,800
He doesn't have so many problems.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,600
I won't give up my investment idea

143
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,200
for this girl.

144
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Moreover,

145
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,600
he doesn't want me to invest

146
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,000
in this project.

147
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Do you understand?

148
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,200
Who would think you would be tea-ed?

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,400
You don't drink wine.

150
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,200
Why do you ask me to do that?

151
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,800
I don't want to be a good girl.

152
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,200
I don't want to be a good girl.

153
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,600
I don't want to be a good girl.

154
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,200
I don't want to be a good girl.

155
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
I don't want to be a good girl.

156
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,200
I don't want to be a good girl.

157
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,800
I don't want to be a good girl.

158
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,200
I don't want to be a good girl.

159
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,800
I don't want to be a good girl.

160
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,600
I don't want to be a good girl.

161
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,200
I don't want to be a good girl.

162
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,800
I don't want to be a good girl.

163
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,200
I don't want to be a good girl.

164
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,600
I don't want to be a good girl.

165
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,200
I don't want to be a good girl.

166
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
I don't want to be a good girl.

167
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
I don't want to be a good girl.

168
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
I don't want to be a good girl.

169
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,600
I don't want to be a good girl.

170
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,200
I don't want to be a good girl.

171
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,400
I'm going to buy some flowers.

172
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,600
We will go together.

173
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,840
I hope no one will find out about him.

174
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,480
Thank you!

175
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,200
See you.

176
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,360
You're welcome.

177
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:47,320
I'm

178
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,460
Daietnameseные.

179
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,680
You promised

180
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,320
You...

181
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,520
And yours?

182
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,680
Sure, thanks.

183
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,480
Thanks.

184
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,040
it is time for learning from books of the devil

185
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:53,600
I did a hard schedule for a whole night

186
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,360
Go

187
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,640
We attached webtoon

188
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
I'll take a rest.

189
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Excuse me.

190
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
How many times should I tell you?

191
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
I've already recreated a business plan

192
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,680
based on his approval.

193
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,680
You can do it, Xin Xin.

194
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,680
Although I didn't get the investment,

195
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,680
I got the punishment.

196
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
Don't leave empty-handed.

197
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
I'm learning to live.

198
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,680
To be honest,

199
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,680
I was a little bit shocked

200
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
to see Director Han's secret mom's approval yesterday.

201
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
I've borrowed so many investors these days.

202
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
They can't even look at us.

203
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
The model product

204
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
is not working well.

205
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,680
I'm a little confused.

206
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Xin Xin.

207
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
Do you think

208
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,680
we can do it?

209
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,680
That's how a business is.

210
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,680
Trust yourself.

211
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Find the problem.

212
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,680
You can break it.

213
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
Let's go.

214
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
Give me one.

215
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Surprise!

216
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,680
Su Zhizhou, right?

217
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
Happy birthday.

218
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
Can't you invite us in?

219
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
Come in.

220
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
Come in.

221
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
Hi.

222
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Hi.

223
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
Nice.

224
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,680
Xin Xin, you're so nice.

225
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,680
You even have a big table.

226
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
Thank you.

227
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,680
Why are you here so early?

228
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
Isn't it 12 o'clock?

229
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Thank you.

230
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
It's nothing.

231
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
Come here early.

232
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,680
You've made up your mind.

233
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
Do you like it?

234
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
I like it so much.

235
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,680
But where is the difference?

236
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,680
You can't say it.

237
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
Xin Xin.

238
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,680
Hi.

239
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
The opening ceremony is over.

240
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
I gave you some gifts.

241
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,680
Thank you.

242
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,680
What is this?

243
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,680
It's a pen.

244
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,680
Each one of you.

245
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,680
I hope you can have more big orders.

246
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
Thank you, Qiu Zi.

247
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
Xin Xin.

248
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
I bought you a home-made meal.

249
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
Look.

250
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
I saw it.

251
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,680
Baby, I've got a barbecue.

252
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
I'll be there in a minute.

253
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
Come on.

254
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
Wake up.

255
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Xin Xin.

256
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
You really have a good day.

257
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,680
You're so pretty.

258
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
The barbecue is here.

259
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
Li.

260
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,680
Xin Xin.

261
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,680
How long has Yichen been here?

262
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
Do you want to wait for him?

263
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
No, thanks.

264
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
He called and said

265
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
he has something to do at the hospital.

266
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,680
He told us not to wait for him.

267
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
Xiao Meng, don't look.

268
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,680
Come here.

269
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,680
Yes.

270
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,680
Here you are.

271
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
Li.

272
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
You look so pretty.

273
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
You usually eat barbecue.

274
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
Or spicy.

275
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,680
No, I don't like the taste.

276
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
Li.

277
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
Don't be busy. Let me do it.

278
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
You're a guest.

279
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,680
How can you work?

280
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,680
Okay, wait for me to finish the barbecue.

281
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
Okay.

282
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,680
Li.

283
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,680
Actually, my barbecue is pretty good.

284
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,680
When we were in school,

285
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,680
we went out to have a barbecue.

286
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,680
I can grill a half-baked skewer by myself.

287
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,680
You got bullied by them?

288
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
No.

289
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,680
They think I'm good at cooking.

290
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
They think I'm good at cooking.

291
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
They think I'm good at cooking.

292
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,680
Okay, I won't tease you anymore.

293
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
Which grade are you from?

294
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
I'm from grade 13.

295
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,680
I'm two years younger than Xing.

296
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
Okay.

297
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,680
Li.

298
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
How about you?

299
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,680
I'm older than Xing.

300
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,680
So you're three years older than me?

301
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
You're my junior.

302
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,680
I'm okay.

303
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,680
Actually, I'm not that young.

304
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
Xing.

305
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,680
How's your salary?

306
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,680
Don't mention it.

307
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,680
I rarely see people.

308
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
The price is the most normal.

309
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
There's a hairpin.

310
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
And there's a dog.

311
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,680
He just puked at you.

312
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,680
Xing, okay.

313
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
He's your confidence.

314
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,680
He wants to recruit us.

315
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,680
He's so many people.

316
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
Why are there so many people?

317
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,680
Baby, don't be angry.

318
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
I'll show you tomorrow.

319
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
Is there anyone interested in the surrounding customers?

320
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,680
Li.

321
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
Li is so good at selling.

322
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
Of course.

323
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,680
Li is the best selling doctor in Hong Kong.

324
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,680
She's a good doctor.

325
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
She's so good at making a living.

326
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
What?

327
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,680
She's so good.

328
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
You guys have a taste.

329
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,680
I'll continue to do it.

330
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
Thank you.

331
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,680
My dear.

332
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
Are you free tomorrow?

333
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
What's wrong?

334
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,680
Go to a blind date with me.

335
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,680
Blind date?

336
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,680
You're taking us there?

337
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,680
Isn't that great?

338
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,680
My mom asked me to go with her friend's son to have dinner.

339
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
And she took him with her.

340
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,680
You guys go with me.

341
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,680
I'm embarrassed to go alone.

342
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
Okay.

343
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,680
I'm not going to go alone.

344
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
I'm not going to go alone.

345
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,680
I'm not going to go alone.

346
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,680
I have something to do tomorrow.

347
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,680
I can't go with you.

348
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
I can't go with you.

349
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,680
I'm not going with you.

350
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
I have a lot of people.

351
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
Don't go with me.

352
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
I heard that they are doctors.

353
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,680
You should be a colleague.

354
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
You should be a good person.

355
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,680
What if you get hurt?

356
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,680
Yes.

357
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,680
You should go.

358
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,680
What if you know him?

359
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Right?

360
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,680
Okay.

361
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,680
But you should be a relative.

362
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,680
Okay.

363
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,680
Mr. Su.

364
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,680
Stop cooking.

365
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
Come and eat with me.

366
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,680
Okay.

367
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,680
The good night is over.

368
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
Thank you, Mr. Su.

369
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
Thank you.

370
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
You should eat with me.

371
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,680
Yes.

372
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
I'll sit over there.

373
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,680
This is not spicy.

374
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Thank you.

375
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,680
You're welcome.

376
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,680
Come on.

377
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,680
Let's celebrate the new year together.

378
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,680
Happy New Year.

379
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,680
Happy New Year.

380
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,680
Happy New Year.

381
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,680
What's wrong, boss?

382
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
Have you ever kissed?

383
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,680
Yes.

384
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,680
Brother, can you do it?

385
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,680
You don't have this skill.

386
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,680
Don't pretend to be a god.

387
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,680
Run.

388
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
Run.

389
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
They are chasing you.

390
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,680
Run.

391
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
Come on.

392
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
Get on the car.

393
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,680
Get on the car.

394
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,680
Right now.

395
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,680
Run.

396
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
Run.

397
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
Run.

398
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
I didn't ask you to leave.

399
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
Open the door.

400
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
I'm sorry.

401
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
I'm sorry.

402
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
Be careful.

403
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,680
Why is he so quiet?

404
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,680
Xiaotian.

405
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
Call Dami.

406
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
Xiaotian.

407
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
Han Tian.

408
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,680
Go and see who's the most beautiful

409
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,680
in the world.

410
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,680
Don't be so sad.

411
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,680
If it wasn't for my grandma,

412
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,680
I wouldn't have been with you.

413
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,680
My mom is.

414
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,680
She knows about me.

415
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,680
She took my car.

416
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,680
She stopped my car.

417
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
She's still making me a blind date.

418
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,680
I just graduated.

419
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
She wants to find a girl

420
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,680
to take care of your son-in-law.

421
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
Have you written the proposal?

422
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,680
What proposal?

423
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,680
Didn't you want to

424
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
buy the car that was in the golden age

425
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,680
and make it yourself?

426
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
You promised.

427
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
You can show your true self.

428
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
I'll promise you

429
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,680
if you pass the proposal.

430
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,680
I knew it.

431
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
Chen Jiajie,

432
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
you're the best to me.

433
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
My mom

434
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
doesn't want to steal herself.

435
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,680
I'm just a fool.

436
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,680
I'm just a fool.

437
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,680
I'm sorry.

438
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,680
I'm sorry.

439
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
I'm sorry.

440
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
You'd better

441
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
take care of this hotel.

442
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
Otherwise...

443
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Thank you for my apology.

444
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
Don't worry.

445
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
I'll do my best.

446
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
And

447
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
who will threaten

448
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
to take the blame?

449
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
Hello.

450
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Mr. Han from

451
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
Donghai Bao Xiang.

452
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,680
This way, please.

453
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
Let's go.

454
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
Qiuci,

455
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,680
your blind date

456
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,680
should be quite rich.

457
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
My mom said

458
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
it seems that

459
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
Jiajie is quite good.

460
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,680
It's too late.

461
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,680
You're late.

462
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
I'm leaving.

463
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,680
If you want to invest,

464
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
you can sit down.

465
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,680
Please.

466
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,680
I'll wait for you.

467
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
I'm sorry.

468
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
I'm sorry.

469
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
Please.

470
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
I'm sorry.

471
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,680
I'm sorry.

472
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
I'm sorry.

473
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,680
I'm sorry.

474
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,680
I'm sorry.

475
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
I'm sorry.

476
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
I'm sorry.

477
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,680
I'm sorry.

478
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,680
I'm sorry.

479
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
I'm sorry.

480
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
Get up.

481
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
Mr. Han,

482
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
your guest is here.

483
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,680
Please.

484
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
Let's go.

485
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,680
Let's sit here.

486
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,480
An Ting.

487
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,040
Hello, I'm Wei Qiuzi.

488
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,400
This is my friend Tu Xiaomeng.

489
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,120
Hi.

490
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,520
Sit down.

491
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,840
We have a friend on the road.

492
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,320
I'm sorry for being late.

493
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,040
Don't worry.

494
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,480
Have some tea first.

495
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,520
No need to reward me.

496
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,760
Just give me a little.

497
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,360
Dad.

498
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,880
You are the smart fruit in the lemon tree.

499
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,720
Yes, I am.

500
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,440
Have you watched my live broadcast?

501
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
Of course.

502
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,760
Why are you so familiar with it?

503
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,360
The world is so small.

504
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,640
Yes, that...

505
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:34,840
Thanks.

506
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,120
I'll introduce you to my family.

507
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,600
I graduated from college at 22 this year.

508
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,280
I like to play games.

509
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,680
Sorry.

510
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,720
I'll answer the phone.

511
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,560
You can talk to me first.

512
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,040
Kiss

513
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,160
Where are we?

514
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,440
I'm indigenous

515
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,320
but it's like a third wheel on us.

516
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,120
So you have watched our live broadcast.

517
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm not sure.

518
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,680
Then,

519
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,600
do you want to help us

520
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,760
tie up a knot?

521
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,400
I'll just take a look.

522
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,160
What's your nickname?

523
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,280
If you're a fan,

524
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,480
I'll definitely have an impression.

525
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,040
You're so red.

526
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,200
I'm sure I won't have an impression.

527
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,080
Don't say that.

528
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,600
Have you ever ordered a song?

529
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,240
Which song do you think I like the most?

530
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,840
I like all the songs.

531
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,600
That's so complicated.

532
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,560
Say it.

533
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,440
No hand, no hand.

534
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,240
I've never sung it.

535
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,960
You and you

536
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,680
sang it once recently, right?

537
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,360
Yes.

538
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,720
I did sing it.

539
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,360
The one from MPK

540
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,800
gave me a bad apple

541
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,040
and his Miss Lu.

542
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,600
Ms Lu.

543
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,720
I'll seal the meal.

544
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,480
Miss Lu!

545
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,280
Lu Lin Jia?

546
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,720
Miss Lu?

547
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,080
So you're the one who

548
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,880
bullied me with that idiot

549
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,200
who came back from the country, right?

550
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
How can you say that?

551
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,920
Bai Xue is such a kind person.

552
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,200
Do you know how pitiful she is?

553
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,680
She's pitiful?

554
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,280
Are you blind?

555
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,320
Can't you tell?

556
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,360
You're so fake.

557
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:54,960
Xiaomeng.

558
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,960
Mr. Lu.

559
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,680
How about this?

560
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,560
We'll ask Bai Xue out next time

561
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,240
to go to the KTV.

562
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,440
We'll be in trouble.

563
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,200
You can't.

564
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,080
Xiaomeng.

565
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,240
You guessed it right.

566
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,200
You're really not a fake.

567
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,480
Since the last time

568
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,360
the board of directors

569
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,960
asked you to be the third-party

570
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,880
and you have to be the one to hit the target,

571
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,760
your sister is the name of Dongyang Technology.

572
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
She's usually in contact

573
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,760
with the same company on the surface.

574
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,520
Is she telling others

575
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,200
that she wants to upgrade her brother

576
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,720
so she wants to help her?

577
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:24,840
Yes.

578
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,600
You're so bloody.

579
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,560
You guessed it right.

580
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,880
Do you want to let it go?

581
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,880
To prepare for her to head to the reliable company,

582
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,040
she'll definitely become

583
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,280
a good teacher.

584
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,840
If she really finds it,

585
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,240
no matter which company

586
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,720
she'll just kick her ass to death.

587
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,120
I'm here, Qiu Zi.

588
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,880
It's the report from Donghai, right?

589
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,760
How could I ever meet her?

590
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,760
Mr. Han.

591
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,440
Miss Ji, what a coincidence.

592
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
You're here for dinner?

593
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,560
I've made an appointment with a investor.

594
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,960
You're so good.

595
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,360
You're making an appointment with an investor so soon?

596
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,600
I'm an angel investor.

597
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,680
After reading my business plan today,

598
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,800
I'm so happy

599
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,440
that I've made an appointment with a investor.

600
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,200
Sorry, I'm not disturbing you.

601
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,840
I'm leaving.

602
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,360
Okay.

603
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,040
Sir, how about leadership and professionalism?

604
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,440
Sure.

605
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,880
Excuse me.

606
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,720
Qikilim?

607
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,920
Come on in.

608
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,840
Here.

609
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:27,600
Come on.

610
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,760
Come on in.

611
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,880
Come on in.

612
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,440
Do it.

613
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,120
This is my longithines friend, Xi Xi.

614
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,640
Her bedside is quite busy these days,

615
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,600
so she is late

616
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,560
You are the one.

617
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,120
I thought to myself,

618
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,960
but you seem to be here to meet a maid there.

619
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,240
Ren for you.

620
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,360
Xi Xi is never decline.

621
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,080
Right,

622
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
Director Han,

623
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,480
I heard you are an investment sometimes.

624
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,800
wondering whether

625
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,760
I'll think about it.

626
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,600
I'll invest in a first-class creative company.

627
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
Why don't you know about our company?

628
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,560
Yes.

629
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,960
Our company is very strong.

630
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
No need.

631
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
No need to bother.

632
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,360
We've waited for a long time.

633
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,360
Are you hungry?

634
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,360
Why don't you eat first?

635
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,360
It seems that Miss Ji has already melted.

636
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,800
Not yet.

637
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,640
How can someone invest in her?

638
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,080
Why do you have to do this to me?

639
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,600
Why do you have to say that?

640
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,360
I thought Miss Ji was going to sign the contract.

641
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,000
The investors who had previously met

642
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,600
were very unreliable.

643
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,720
Reliable?

644
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,800
Yes.

645
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,280
They are all the owners of paper paintings and money.

646
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,720
And one more thing.

647
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,000
They just want to pay us back.

648
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,320
They are very dog-like.

649
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,720
Right?

650
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,320
Very dog-like.

651
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,320
Miss Ji, are you okay?

652
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,560
If you need anything,

653
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,200
you can try to find me.

654
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,720
No.

655
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,960
I've already said that.

656
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,160
It's so active.

657
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,720
Do you need your WeChat?

658
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,520
No need to bother.

659
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,600
No bother.

660
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,760
I'll add one.

661
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,640
A long-distance contact.

662
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,080
Thank you, Mr. Han.

663
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,920
You're welcome.

664
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,440
Your phone is not that bad.

665
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
Can you scan it?

666
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,320
Yes.

667
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,120
Xing Xing, why did you send me a text message?

668
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,160
Thank you.

669
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,800
You're welcome.

670
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,040
The security condition is still effective.

671
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,640
Mr. Han,

672
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,880
if you have time,

673
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,400
go to our company to sit down.

674
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,800
It's a great opportunity to meet you.

675
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,480
How about talking about your dad's Qiu Zi?

676
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,920
You're the main character today.

677
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,560
No, I'm not.

678
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,760
Let's just meet each other and make friends.

679
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,360
Who wants to be your friend?

680
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,320
I'm home.

681
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,960
Come on.

682
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,800
Eat.

683
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,640
Miss Ji, are you hungry?

684
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
Come on, eat some crabs.

685
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm not hungry now.

686
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,280
Thank you for your invitation today.

687
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,280
You're welcome.

688
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,760
It's not a good place to get a taxi.

689
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,720
I'll take you there.

690
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,160
Can we sit down?

691
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:43,920
Mr. Han,

692
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,720
remember to contact Xing Xing often.

693
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,040
Why are you walking so fast?

694
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,480
What a great opportunity to meet him.

695
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,080
Mr. Han,

696
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,560
do you mean something to that Ji Xing?

697
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,720
You're still not admitting it?

698
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,560
You believe me today?

699
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,320
I'm not like that Wei Qiu Zi.

700
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,560
You want to make up for it.

701
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,560
But you...

702
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,800
But Ji Xing...

703
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,560
is a little bit...

704
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,000
Come on, Mr. Han.

705
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,560
Nine hundred and twenty-one.

706
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
I'm not sure.

707
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
I'm not sure.

708
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
I'm not sure.

709
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
I'm not sure.

710
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
I'm not sure.

711
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
I'm not sure.

712
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,160
Do you still want to open the bar?

713
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,960
Of course.

714
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,160
I did a good job today.

715
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,160
You can't lose.

716
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,960
Give me the proposal.

717
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,360
Okay.

718
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,160
Yes.

719
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,960
No problem.

720
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,360
Thank you for today.

721
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,960
Lei Cai's name is a準.

722
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,360
He's not a good choice.

723
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,560
What's the name of your name?

724
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,560
Do you know Mr. Han?

725
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,560
Isn't he the relative of Lu Ling's family?

726
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,760
He's the brother of Lu Ling's family.

727
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,360
He's the person who took care of us.

728
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,160
He's a big investment person.

729
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
Is he the one who drove you out of the restaurant

730
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
and became the boss?

731
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,960
He's a university friend.

732
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,360
He said he's really low-key.

733
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,760
I didn't notice your relationship at all.

734
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,160
He's so hideous.

735
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,560
No wonder Xing Xing said he was a dog.

736
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,960
I'm sorry, baby.

737
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,160
I've already thought it through.

738
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
Did you just

739
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,160
dig out a hole for 31 days?

740
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,160
I've dug out a hole for you.

741
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,560
I've been telling you all the time.

742
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,760
Don't bother.

743
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,360
You're still pushing me out.

744
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,760
I thought you mean

745
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
we're polite.

746
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,560
I thought we were.

747
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,760
What's the matter with you?

748
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
I'm not polite.

749
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
I've kicked you out.

750
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,360
I hit you.

751
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,360
Look at me.

752
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,960
I'm not so polite.

753
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
I can't see you.

754
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,960
We're not in touch.

755
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,760
No.

756
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,360
I'm not.

757
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,560
And you.

758
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,760
You can add WeChat.

759
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,360
You can add my number.

760
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
If it weren't for your situation,

761
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
I would have left earlier.

762
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
I'd be so embarrassed.

763
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,360
But you're back.

764
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,960
You're going to post a post

765
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,160
on your date.

766
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,360
You don't look like it.

767
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,560
Do you need to post a post?

768
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,360
No.

769
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,960
I'm sorry.

770
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,160
Can I ask you a question?

771
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,160
Of course.

772
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,360
Thank you.

773
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,960
It doesn't look normal.

774
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,760
I'm telling you.

775
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,560
That Lu Lin's family is my best friend.

776
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,160
I'm just a little bit sick.

777
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,560
You know?

778
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,760
She has a problem with her eyes.

779
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,560
She supports the apple.

780
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,560
How can we see a blind man?

781
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,760
It's not just a person.

782
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,560
And Lili asked us

783
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,160
if we wanted to post a post.

784
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,760
So I let uncle open it.

785
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,360
Good girl.

786
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,960
Qiu Zi.

787
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,160
What kind of boy do you like?

788
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
Tell me.

789
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,960
I...

790
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
If I have to say it,

791
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,560
I'll be gentle and gentle.

792
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,360
I'll be gentle and gentle.

793
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
I'll be gentle and gentle.

794
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,160
I don't need to be rich.

795
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,160
I'll be peaceful and peaceful.

796
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,160
Right.

797
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,760
If I can cook, I'll be better.

798
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,760
Then I'll be a little bit sick.

799
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,760
Then you should post a post on me.

800
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,160
I was going to be a little bit sick

801
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,360
with Xin Xin.

802
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,760
Right?

803
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,160
What time is it?

804
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,560
Why are you talking about not being a good girl?

805
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,760
Last time when we were having dinner,

806
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,360
you said she had a cousin in a distant house.

807
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,960
Really?

808
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,760
I forgot.

809
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,360
How can you forget?

810
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,560
You said that...

811
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,160
Xia.

812
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,360
Send me the three models you made yesterday.

813
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,760
Okay, I'll send them right away.

814
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,760
Xiao Shang.

815
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,760
You're still making the wrong effort.

816
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,360
You're just kidding.

817
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,560
I'll send you the other models.

818
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,960
Okay.

819
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,360
Xin Xin.

820
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,160
You gave me a few investment sales yesterday.

821
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,560
I was satisfied after I showed them the business proposal.

822
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,760
But I heard that we didn't have any models.

823
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,360
So I didn't have any children.

824
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
Okay, I know.

825
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,360
Everyone, you've been working hard these days.

826
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,360
After our continuous adjustment,

827
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,560
the model is done better than the model.

828
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,160
The data is getting more accurate.

829
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,960
Next, we'll keep working hard.

830
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,960
We'll try to make the model product as soon as possible.

831
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:38,960
Okay.

832
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:39,960
No problem.

833
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,960
Okay, come on.

834
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,960
Mr. Su, this is the information you wanted.

835
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,560
Okay.

836
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,360
You should make a translation version of this.

837
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,160
Okay.

838
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,760
Okay.

839
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,960
Xin Xin.

840
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,160
Do you know Xing Chen's new technology?

841
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,160
Yichen?

842
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,160
Yichen.

843
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,760
Yichen.

844
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,160
Why are you here?

845
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,760
I came to send you the materials.

846
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,560
The materials?

847
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,560
Well, let me introduce you.

848
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,960
Shao Yichen, my boyfriend.

849
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Hello, Mr. Chen.

850
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,760
Xia, this is Xia.

851
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,960
Have you not eaten yet?

852
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,560
Zhou Zhou, give us the meal.

853
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,360
Okay.

854
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,160
Thank you, Mr. Su.

855
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,760
Why didn't you go to work today?

856
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,360
I'm on holiday these days.

857
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,760
Come here and have a good meal.

858
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:44,960
Thank you.

859
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,360
Mr. Ji is so bright.

860
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,160
I said Mr. Ji is like a poor energy.

861
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,160
It turns out that someone is charging in the back room.

862
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,560
This is a machine.

863
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,160
Okay, eat quickly.

864
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
You have to work after eating.

865
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,360
Xin Xin, this is yours.

866
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,160
Remember, eat first and then work.

867
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,960
Okay.

868
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,360
Come with me.

869
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:03,960
No need.

870
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
I've already eaten.

871
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
Don't worry about me.

872
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,360
I'll stay there for a while.

873
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,760
You have to work hard.

874
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
I'll wait for you to get off work.

875
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,960
Let's go back together.

876
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,360
Okay.

877
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
Then you can go anywhere.

878
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,360
There's water there.

879
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,360
Then go out there.

880
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,160
Don't worry.

881
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,960
Go eat.

882
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:18,960
Okay.

883
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,560
Okay.

884
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,360
Mr. Ji, you're here.

885
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,360
I'm here.

886
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,160
I'm here.

887
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,160
I'm here.

888
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,160
I'm here.

889
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,160
I'm here.

890
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,160
I'm here.

891
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
I'm here.

892
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,160
I'm here.

893
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
I'm here.

894
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
I'm here.

895
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,160
I'm here.

896
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
I'm here.

897
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
I'm here.

898
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
I'm here.

899
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
I'm here.

900
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
I'm here.

901
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
I'm here.

902
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,160
I'm here.

903
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,160
I'm here.

904
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
I'm here.

905
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,160
I'm here.

906
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,160
I'm here.

907
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,160
I'm here.

908
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,160
I'm here.

909
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,160
I'm here.

910
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
I'm here.

911
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,160
I'm here.

912
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
I'm here.

913
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
I'm here.

914
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
I'm here.

915
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
Thank you.

916
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,080
I believe that through our efforts,

917
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,240
the lights of the city

918
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
always have a light

919
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,760
that shines for us.

920
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,560
Xingxing,

921
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,240
am I still in your future?

922
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,280
Yes, Lady Yan.

923
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,120
Xingxing,

924
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
in a few days,

925
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,580
it'll be our anniversary

926
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,040
at National Day of Love.

927
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,240
Let's celebrate.

928
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,720
If you miss your wife,

929
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,920
it's not our business.

930
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,360
What are you worried about?

931
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,680
Why did you need to ask me out?

932
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,800
Don't ask me out.

933
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,880
I'll ask you out.

934
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,160
Turn it off.

935
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,840
instructions.

936
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,080
To be continued.

937
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,120
I'll go now.

938
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,120
I almost forgot.

939
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,960
You like Jin Lan, right?

940
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,000
I bought two paintings.

941
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,080
Let's go and celebrate our four-year anniversary together.

942
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,680
I'm so happy.

943
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
I'm so happy.

944
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
I'm so happy.

945
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
I'm so happy.

946
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,080
I'm so happy.

947
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,080
I'm so happy.

948
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,080
I'm so happy.

949
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,080
I'm so happy.

950
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,080
I'm so happy.

951
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,080
I'm so happy.

952
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,080
I'm so happy.

953
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
I'm so happy.

954
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm so happy.

955
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I'm so happy.

956
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm so happy.

957
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'm so happy.

958
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I'm so happy.

959
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,640
Okay.

960
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,120
I'll pick you up when you're there.

961
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,080
I'll put the tickets in your place.

962
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:37,920
Bye.

963
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,680
Bye.

964
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,720
The skin is beautiful, the skin is bright,

965
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,280
and the soul is more than 90 kg.

966
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,880
I'm your guest,

967
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,240
Cong Ming Guo.

968
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,880
Welcome to my live room.

969
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,120
Hello, everyone.

970
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,960
I'm here to open the door.

971
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,560
Hello, Cong Ming Guo.

972
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,680
Why are you here again?

973
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,520
Oh, my god.

974
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,080
Come here and smash the factory.

975
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,800
Lu Ge,

976
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,200
don't miss the pass.

977
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
Give me a gift.

978
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,080
I'm not here to smash the factory.

979
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,680
I'm not here to give you a gift.

980
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
I'm just here to see

981
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,080
the winner of our Bai Xue.

982
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,560
You

983
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,000
seem to have something

984
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,240
in my live room.

985
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,280
But it's okay.

986
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,920
Maybe it's a little bit of a smell.

987
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,040
It's not important to lose

988
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,720
the P&K with our Bai Xue.

989
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,960
Why is the power of the world

990
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,840
out of the question?

991
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,480
I feel so sorry for her.

992
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,480
Please take care of yourself.

993
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,840
Guo Guo has driven the warehouse out.

994
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,480
So let's pack up.

995
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,080
Let's listen to the song.

996
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,560
The first model product

997
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,040
of our new technology

998
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,600
is finally completed.

999
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,320
Yes.

1000
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,320
Mr. Ji,

1001
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,800
the model product is ready.

1002
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,240
Next, it's time to buy the machine.

1003
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,880
Let's start the product experiment.

1004
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,480
Yes.

1005
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,440
Let's play the music.

1006
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,080
Don't worry.

1007
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,680
The sound will be here soon.

1008
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,840
Next,

1009
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,600
I'll do the social work with Zhizhou.

1010
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,400
You've been working hard these days.

1011
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,840
I'll give you three days off.

1012
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,560
Rest.

1013
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,040
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

1014
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,320
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

1015
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,280
Great.

1016
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,920
Let's go to eat hot pot tonight.

1017
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,440
We're leaving, Mr. Ji.

1018
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,320
Bye.

1019
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,200
It's been a long time since we ate hot pot.

1020
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:41,600
Yes.

1021
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
We should sing.

1022
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
You're awake.

1023
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,680
I...

1024
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,240
Okay.

1025
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,800
I'll go.

1026
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,800
I'm leaving.

1027
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,800
Bye.

1028
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,240
Xing.

1029
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,840
Xia

1030
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,520
has asked me

1031
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,240
about the printing machine several times.

1032
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,640
Although we've made the model product,

1033
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,080
if the printing machine doesn't work,

1034
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,320
the work will be stopped.

1035
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,440
I know.

1036
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,840
But the printing machine is worth millions.

1037
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,000
We can't afford it.

1038
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,080
But our model product is made.

1039
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,040
It may be more successful.

1040
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,240
How about

1041
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,840
we rent a printing machine?

1042
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,280
Rent?

1043
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,720
Is it reliable?

1044
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,760
Go to the market

1045
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,320
and ask around.

1046
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,720
See which companies have free printing machines.

1047
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,120
We rent one first.

1048
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,800
We'll do the processing first.

1049
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,440
If we can make it,

1050
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,840
if we can make the food,

1051
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,520
the process will be even better.

1052
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,440
Okay.

1053
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,720
I'll contact

1054
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,240
the company I've met before.

1055
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:00,840
Okay.

1056
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,080
I'll ask them.

1057
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,520
Okay.

1058
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,360
We'll contact them.

1059
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,040
Okay.

1060
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,440
I want to test

1061
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,000
who has crossed the border.

1062
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,080
If I can

1063
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,360
get closer to you,

1064
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,840
can I

1065
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:05,880
start over

1066
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,600
with memories?

1067
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,040
Time goes by so fast.

1068
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,360
Let the lonely

1069
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,680
be at least safe.

1070
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,120
Don't let the flow

1071
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:24,640
become the routing.

1072
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,680
We've already been apart.

1073
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,120
How can we pocket

1074
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,880
in thepfereeing when

1075
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,640
things are no longer beautiful?

1076
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,560
After all,

1077
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,880
let eyes knowing

1078
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,120
that both are lovely

1079
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,640
will slowly

1080
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,640
I'm not afraid of you.

1081
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,640
I'm afraid of you.

1082
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,640
I'm afraid of you.

1083
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,640
I'm afraid of you.

1084
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,640
I'm afraid of you.

1085
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,640
I'm afraid of you.

1086
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,640
I'm afraid of you.

1087
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,640
I'm afraid of you.

1088
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,640
I'm afraid of you.

1089
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,640
I'm afraid of you.

1090
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,640
I'm afraid of you.

1091
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,640
I'm afraid of you.

1092
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,640
I'm afraid of you.

1093
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,640
I'm afraid of you.

1094
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,640
I'm afraid of you.

1095
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,640
I'm afraid of you.

1096
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,640
When we start a relationship,

1097
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,640
you have to reduce it years later.

1098
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,640
Not half City is gone.

1099
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,800
Waiting for the road is the same way.

1100
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,640
No future.

1101
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,560
The road is wrong.

1102
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,880
Above me.

1103
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,160
I'm afraid to forget you.

1104
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,160
When I stand alone.

1105
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,200
I'm afraid of you.

1106
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,000
I'm afraid of you.
