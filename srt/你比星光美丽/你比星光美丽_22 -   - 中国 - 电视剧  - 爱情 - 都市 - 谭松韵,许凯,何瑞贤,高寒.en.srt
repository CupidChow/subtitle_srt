23
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,680
Hello, everybody.

24
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,230
Let me introduce myself.

25
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,590
I'm the mother of the bar owner...

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,200
That cool guy.

27
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,120
I'm his mother!

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,760
My name is Han Yumei.

29
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,230
Welcome to visit

30
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,840
my son's bar.

31
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,230
Hope you can

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,310
enjoy yourselves here!

33
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,790
Thanks for coming.

34
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,280
- Yeah!
- Nice!

37
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,080
New girl?

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,190
Hello, I'm here to report for duty.

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,400
Zhong Yini of the Purchasing Dept.

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,240
Miss Li told me about you.

41
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,150
The receptionist is away.

42
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,470
That's the office area. I'll take you there.

43
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,840
Thank you, then.

44
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,080
Such great plants.

45
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,280
Yeah. I love them.

46
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,240
Me, too.

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,910
With a good office environment,

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,360
everybody can be motivated to work.

49
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,360
Come on.

50
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,360
This is your seat.

51
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,030
- OK.
- Mr. Su.

52
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,030
There's still some problem

53
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,150
with yesterday's product.

54
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,800
When will you have time?

55
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,150
Let's check the parameters.

56
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,270
OK.

57
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,870
If you need anything,

58
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
ask the receptionist for it.

59
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,750
OK. Thank you.

60
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,710
Let's go to the lab.

61
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,150
We'll have a meeting. Hurry up.

62
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,750
The department directors

63
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,590
made some reports

64
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,590
and have you reviewed them?

65
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,800
I have an audacious idea.

66
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,590
Xingchen will change its original strategy

67
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,960
and specialize in 3D printing skeletons.

68
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,800
Instead of catching up with others,

69
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,280
why don't we focus on ourselves?

70
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,960
We'll make our own products

71
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,080
with the best quality.

72
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,190
We should reduce the cost

73
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,150
and improve our technology.

74
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
So far, we have

75
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,360
accumulated the most experience and resources

76
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,630
in the field of skeleton.

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,520
From this day on,

78
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,080
we'll implement this strategy

79
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,560
to specialize in skeletons.

80
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,680
OK.

81
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,800
According to authoritative data,

82
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,000
implantable medical devices

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,560
occupy a market of 150 billion globally.

84
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,040
Even if we only take up 1% of the market,

85
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,800
Xingchen will still be promising.

86
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,830
If you have no objection,

87
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,720
let's work out

88
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,920
the strategy proposal

89
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,390
before Mr. Han comes back.

90
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,830
- OK.
- OK.

91
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,630
Unlocked.

92
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,220
(Xing: Found the right positioning.)

93
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,040
Not too silly.

94
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,180
(Xing)

95
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,800
What can I do for you, Mr. Han?

96
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,800
Looks like your trip to Germany isn't in vain.

97
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,040
When will you come back?

98
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,560
I'm back in Xinggang.

99
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,040
I'm going to see you at Xingchen.

100
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,400
OK.

101
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,560
See you in half an hour.

102
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,640
See you.

103
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,680
Going out?

104
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,070
I'm just in time, then.

105
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,030
What's up?

106
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,800
Today, you should buy me lunch.

107
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,390
The contract of buying fractional shares.

108
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,560
Such a cute fridge magnet.

109
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,390
Your home finally looks warm.

110
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,750
Who gave it to you?

111
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,910
Don't gossip.

112
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,430
I have something to ask you.

113
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
What do you think is a good present

114
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,270
for a girl's birthday?

115
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,000
For the girl he loves,

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,870
the poker-faced guy

117
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,040
is racking his brains.

118
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,830
Looks like our CEO

119
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,310
will stop the commercial drama

120
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,000
and start a romantic drama.

121
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,600
If you really don't know what to buy,

122
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,430
a necklace, a jewel, or a bag

123
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,680
will never go wrong.

124
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,480
Just don't give her a casual present.

125
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,480
What kind of present isn't casual?

126
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,430
Something meaningful to her.

127
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,560
Don't you know what Ji Xing loves?

128
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,480
I certainly do.

129
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,830
I'm still starving.

130
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,670
You're leaving already?

131
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,750
Cook for yourself.

132
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,360
Such a cold fish.

133
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,390
The magnet shouldn't be on the fridge,

134
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,480
but on you.

135
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,100
(Dongyang Group)

136
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,320
Here.

137
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,440
Thanks.

138
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,430
You look confident.

139
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,040
Before, I only thought about charging forward

140
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,630
instead of focusing on myself.

141
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,120
You told me a lot

142
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,360
and I've finally figured it out.

143
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,630
I've made up my mind.

144
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,830
Xingchen will specialize

145
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,430
in making 3D skeleton.

146
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,640
Good.

147
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,830
That's all?

148
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,800
Some people like to extend one sentence

149
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,830
out to a long composition.

150
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,430
But some people

151
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,630
love to conclude a long speech

152
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,950
with one single sentence.

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,750
This gentleman who loves
to conclude a long speech

154
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,270
with one single sentence,

155
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,560
could you sometimes extend it?

156
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,920
What if the listener wants

157
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,830
to know some more exact information?

158
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,870
If the listener

159
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,870
isn't sure,

160
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,310
maybe the speaker

161
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,950
will tell her,

162
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,950
if he were her,

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,190
he would do the same thing.

164
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,430
Specializing in skeleton?

165
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,630
It's the best way out for Xingchen.

166
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,680
You've found it.

167
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,600
It's so easy.

168
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,720
Why did I not think of it until now?

169
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,160
It's just like studying.

170
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,120
When you're in junior high,

171
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,480
you'll find the primary school exams easy.

172
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,070
Have you had this idea for a long time?

173
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,670
Every time you told me
about strategy and positioning...

174
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,910
Wait. When you first

175
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,080
checked my proposal, did you...?

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,150
In the beginning stages,

177
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,510
it's natural for everyone

178
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,440
to suffer setbacks

179
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,670
and take detours.

180
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,670
I'm a little slow.

181
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,720
You are.

182
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,630
Let me get some more water.

183
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,080
It's OK to be slow.

184
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,200
I'll take it

185
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,240
as 5% of the stock I've earned.

186
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,510
Just kidding.

187
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,470
I have things to do.

188
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,440
I should go.

189
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,200
Let me walk you out.

190
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,750
Tomorrow is your birthday.

191
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,360
How will you celebrate it?

192
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,080
How do you know it's my birthday?

193
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,870
In the investment agreement,

194
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,150
there's your ID information.

195
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,030
Tomorrow, I'll just have dinner
with my best friends.

196
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,390
Fine.

197
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,320
I should go.

198
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,870
Bye.

199
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,580
(Xing, Happy birthday.)

200
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,660
(Xing)

201
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,460
(Smile invites you to a voice call...)

202
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,220
(Smile)

203
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,740
(Smile)

204
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,270
Don't call me now.

205
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,840
Happy birthday.

206
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,060
(Xing)

207
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,860
(Li Li, Qiuzi, Su Zhizhou, Xiaomeng)

208
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,020
(Han Ting: Happy birthday.)

209
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,260
(Thanks. It must be hard for you
to text me at midnight.)

210
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,550
(Ji Xing)
Thanks. It must be hard for you

211
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,960
to text me at midnight.

212
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,320
(Han Ting)
Just a coincidence.

213
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,670
Grandpa.

214
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,960
When did you last practice calligraphy?

215
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,510
More than six months ago.

216
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,550
I've been too busy lately.

217
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,150
Busy...

218
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,120
That's not an excuse.

219
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,720
When you have time,

220
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,790
practice calligraphy more.

221
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,120
Concentrate.

222
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,910
If you don't even have time for this,

223
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,240
your work

224
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,240
will be messy.

225
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,840
I get it.

226
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,720
But to practice calligraphy,

227
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,240
I need to do it under a roof.

228
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,870
But someone always wants to break the roof.

229
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,390
I have to mend the roof first.

230
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,750
You see how much profit Dongyang has made

231
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,840
in the last six months.

232
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,630
I believe you know

233
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,910
why I have no time for calligraphy.

234
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,320
But Dongyang Medical's market share

235
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,120
of large medical devices

236
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,120
has declined.

237
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,150
When low-end products are cleared out,

238
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,360
the decline in market share

239
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,750
isn't surprising.

240
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,550
With guaranteed quality,

241
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,240
our previous clients

242
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,360
will come back to us in a couple of years.

243
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,630
Yuan,

244
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,510
only by doing this can we go a long way.

245
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,150
(Harmony)
You should work.

246
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,240
You should practice calligraphy, too.

247
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,560
I know.

248
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,750
Grandpa.

249
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,840
I have things to do.

250
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,960
I should go.

251
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,200
Come over and sit.

252
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,510
Your cousin

253
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,030
is our family, after all.

254
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,510
She's been managing Dongyang Medical for years.

255
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,910
In some cases,

256
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,030
she has a point.

257
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,270
You must not be too radical.

258
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,320
Don't let the love thing stand in your way.

259
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,320
Also, Zeng Di

260
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,320
is a good choice for you.

261
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,800
Grandpa,

262
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,000
she isn't even part of the equation.

263
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,270
You need a wife like her

264
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,910
to always keep your head on straight.

265
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,550
No one in our family

266
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,630
can get married

267
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,630
just because of the love thing.

268
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,040
Grandpa.

269
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,320
I made such achievements in Germany

270
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,150
without relying on anyone or anything.

271
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,840
To develop Dongyang,

272
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,360
you can count on me.

273
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,150
What you want me to do,

274
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,750
I will make it.

275
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,320
But I'll do it my own way.

276
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,790
Fine.

277
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,000
Remember the deal we had.

278
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,320
What I said

279
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,360
is not just empty talk.

280
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,200
I know.

281
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,150
(Xiao Yixiao)
Happy birthday to Ji Xing.

282
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,200
Bring my message to her.

283
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,670
The gift will be given later.

284
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,200
You really take me as a messenger?

285
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,720
Why do you not go up?

286
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,790
I'm waiting for you. Come on.

287
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,920
Hold this for me.

288
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,760
Here.

289
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,920
Is the room decorated?

290
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,000
Don't worry. Everything's ready, my queen.

291
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,400
I had it decorated this afternoon.

292
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,510
Xing will be satisfied.

293
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,400
Qiuzi said she would bring the cake.

294
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,510
Let's get up there first.

295
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,440
Is that Shao Yichen?

296
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,920
Eat more at dinner.

297
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,480
Have a good time.

298
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,750
- OK.
- When it's about to end,

299
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,510
text me and I'll pick you up, OK?

300
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,510
- OK.
- Qiuzi!

301
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,590
Wei Qiuzi,

302
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,720
don't you feel ashamed?

303
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,830
When did you start your relationship?

304
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,160
Not until recently.

305
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,750
I don't care when you started.

306
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,510
Stop this romantic stuff.

307
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Xing and Yichen broke up.

308
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,720
You couldn't have had any other man.

309
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,310
Why does it have to be Shao Yichen?

310
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,030
I'm with the man I love.

311
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,310
What wrong have I done?

312
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,550
You're with your best friend's ex-boyfriend.

313
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,350
Does it even make you proud?

314
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,880
Why did I not know

315
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,030
you were so capable of this?

316
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,480
I guess you wanted him a long time ago!

317
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,440
Will you stop?

318
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,200
I came on to Qiuzi.

319
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,110
She's innocent.

320
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,800
Say no more.

321
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,400
It's your freedom

322
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,440
to be together.

323
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,240
But today is Xing's birthday.

324
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,440
Shao Yichen, leave now.

325
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,200
Xing will arrive soon.

326
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,950
Qiuzi,

327
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,160
text me when it's about to end.

328
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,640
I'll come and pick you up.

329
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,480
OK.

330
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,560
Have a good time.

00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,510
I want the meatball.

380
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,480
This?

381
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,510
- Done.
- Which spot?

382
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,830
Either. One in each pot.

383
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,510
Are you sure?

384
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,750
Come on.

385
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,920
Here, some in both pots.

386
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,160
Only one for each pot?

387
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,680
Boil some more.

388
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
- Don't be stingy.
- OK.

389
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,920
One more in the spicy pot.

390
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,430
I...

391
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,310
What about this?

392
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
Why did you hang me up last night?

393
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,750
To send "happy birthday" to Ji Xing?

394
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,480
Since you care so much for her,

395
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,110
why do you not go to her birthday party?

396
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,920
That's a dinner for best friends.

397
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,160
Man-free.

398
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,480
Don't gossip.

399
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,590
Think about how we can persuade these guys.

400
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,840
Yeah.

401
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,110
Those who will come

402
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,550
hold quite a lot of shares

403
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,390
of Dongyang Medical.

404
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,880
If we can buy over their shares,

405
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880
your position in Dongyang Medical
will be more stable.

406
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,670
However,

407
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,400
they seem to be close to your cousin.

408
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,350
I don't think we can easily persuade him.

409
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,400
A merchant seeks profits naturally.

410
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,790
Mr. Han and Mr. Xiao, sorry.

411
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,640
Sorry, we're late.

412
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,720
Terribly sorry.

413
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,790
Mr. Ling is still on his way.

414
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,720
He'll be right here.

415
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,680
We just arrived, too.

416
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,240
- Sit.
- Let's play and wait.

417
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,080
Sit, please.

418
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,340
(Xing, happy birthday.)

419
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,200
Pretty.

420
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,350
- Is it good?
- Yes.

421
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,680
You come over.

422
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,240
- Stop that.
- Such a small face.

423
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,480
Blow out the candles and eat the cake.

424
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,550
- Come on.
- Xing.

425
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,350
Birthday girl.

426
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,190
Xing,

427
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,270
I bought you

428
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,880
your favorite strawberry cake.

429
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,310
Thank you.

430
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,310
Let me put the candles.

431
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,880
Peace in pieces.

432
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,590
- That's right.
- Come on, Xing.

433
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,920
Let's only put this on.

434
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,440
You'll always be young.

435
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,740
(Xing, happy birthday.)

436
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,110
Xing, make a wish.

437
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,590
Do it.

438
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,670
Qiuzi.

439
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,310
I saw what happened.

440
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,110
You're single, after all.

441
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,680
It's normal that you have a relationship.

442
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,270
Shao Yichen and I broke up a long time ago.

443
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,070
You don't need to avoid me.

444
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,350
Xing.

445
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,200
You should have told me earlier.

446
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,110
What? I'm OK.

447
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,070
Thank you for the cake.

448
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,000
I like it.

449
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,160
I want to go out for a walk.

450
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,480
Eat the cake for me. Eat it up.

451
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,000
Xing...

452
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,800
Xing.

453
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,670
Are you OK?

454
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,640
I'm OK, seriously.

455
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,000
Actually, whoever Shao Yichen dates or marries,

456
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,550
it's OK with me.

457
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,270
I'll give him my blessing

458
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,160
and wish him a good life.

459
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,390
I just...

460
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,590
I just didn't expect it to be Qiuzi.

461
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,880
But actually, Qiuzi did nothing wrong.

462
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,030
I just suddenly...

463
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,870
- I...
- I understand.

464
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,830
Leave them to me.

465
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,550
You go back for some rest.

466
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,520
I should go.

467
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,880
What are you doing?

468
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,820
(Li Li)

469
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,670
Four of King.

470
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,870
Pass.

471
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,400
(Xiao Yixiao)
Dinner is over so soon?

472
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,790
(Li Li)
Something happened.

473
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,160
Three of six.

474
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,670
Your turn.

475
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,280
Pass.

476
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,520
A minute, please.

477
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,840
What happened?

478
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,480
At Ji Xing's birthday party,

479
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,070
some little accident happened.

480
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,980
(Li Li)

481
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,960
You keep them company.

482
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,830
I'll go check on her.

483
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,310
Gentlemen.

484
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,200
Mr. Han has some emergency.

485
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,110
I'll play with you.

486
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,750
Come on. Hurry.

487
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,920
I'll take over Mr. Han.

488
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,760
Hurry.

489
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:34,300
(Han Ting)

490
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,000
Hello.

491
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,350
Where are you?

492
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,480
I'm...

493
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,110
Taking a walk.

494
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,640
I need you for something.

495
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,680
Send me the location. I'll pick you up.

496
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,320
OK.

497
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,480
Bye-bye.

498
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,400
(Tu Xiaomeng)
Xing, where are you?

499
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,550
How about I keep you company?

500
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,160
It's your birthday, isn't it?

501
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,680
I just had a little problem

502
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,070
with my friend.

503
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,310
But I'm OK now.

504
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,240
Your friend is silly.

505
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,790
On this day,

506
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
it must be her fault, whatever has happened.

507
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,830
Where are we going?

508
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,310
To Xingyue Club.

509
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,750
Please wait, gentlemen. I'll be right back.

510
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,590
OK.

511
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,390
Ji Xing?

512
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,630
Mr. Xiao.

513
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,720
Why are they still here?

514
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,640
It's OK. Tell me.

515
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,000
Those guys are really tough.

516
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,590
I guess your cousin reminded them in advance.

517
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,750
So far, I haven't persuaded them

518
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,640
or won the card game.

519
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,920
Looks like you have to go personally.

520
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,200
These years, it's been the first time

521
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,590
we talk business in front of someone.

522
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,640
Don't be embarrassed.

523
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,400
Xingyue Club actually belongs to Han Ting.

524
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,920
I'm only a nominal owner.

525
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,550
You're the owner of Xingyue?

526
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,310
Han Ting always keeps a low profile.

527
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,200
He even cooked personally.

528
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,350
I guess the one who tasted it

529
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,200
still doesn't know he made it.

530
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,840
All right.

531
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,750
I'd like to borrow Han Ting

532
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,590
for a while.

533
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,480
Can I?

534
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,390
Yes.

535
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,350
You take some rest.

536
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,000
I'll go talk to them.

537
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,960
- Mr. Han.
- Be seated.

538
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,590
- Enjoy it.
- Thanks.

539
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,040
Strawberry drink.

540
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,320
Thanks.

541
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,390
What a coincidence!

542
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,920
They know I love strawberries.

543
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,000
I ordered it for you.

544
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,270
(He even cooked personally.)

545
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,310
(I guess the one who tasted it)

546
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,240
(still doesn't know he made it.)

547
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,000
Xingyue Club offers takeout food?

548
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,310
No. I packed some.

549
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,720
Tastes good.

550
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,350
When you want some dishes,

551
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,400
let me know.

552
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,350
I'll have the chef cook for you.

553
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,920
OK. Thank you, Mr. Han.

554
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,000
Anyway, just do what I say.

555
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,110
Let's call it a day.

556
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,520
- OK.
- Xiao.

557
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,800
See them out.

558
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,350
Let me walk you out. Come, please.

559
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,590
Let's go.

560
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,680
Have you been waiting long?

561
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,000
Not at all.

562
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,280
You're done talking?

563
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,400
How was it going?

564
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,110
I don't mean to get some information.

565
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,480
Just talking.

566
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,590
It's your birthday.

567
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,880
But I was held up.

568
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,350
It's not too late, anyway.

569
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,920
- Mr. Han.
- Give me the lighter.

570
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,400
One minute to go.

571
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,950
Haven't made a wish, huh?

572
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
No.

573
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,840
Make a wish now.

574
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,480
♪Everything you wanted me to be♪

575
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,610
♪I tried to let you be my destiny♪

576
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,510
I suddenly don't know what wish to make.

577
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,640
Then be happy and healthy.

578
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,880
♪Hold my hand across the land and sea♪

579
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,900
♪Call my name from distance guiding me♪

580
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,710
♪We are the ones that God keeps blessing♪

581
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,600
♪Restlessly♪

582
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,160
♪You are everything♪

583
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,070
What do you want to do next, birthday girl?

584
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,840
I want to drink.

585
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,200
OK.

586
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,550
Want to play?

587
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,030
Do you know how to play?

588
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,480
I'm super good at playing dice.

589
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,230
That's interesting. I'm good at it, too.

590
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,670
Shall we play?

591
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,550
What is the stake?

592
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,110
If it's too small, I'll quit.

593
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,110
If you lose,

594
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,550
give me 3.4% of Xingchen's stock.

595
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,350
Deal.

596
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,720
I'm serious.

597
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,840
If you win, I'll give it to you.

598
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,510
OK. Let's bet on it.

599
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,000
What if you lose?

600
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,110
Whatever you say.

601
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,160
Whatever I say?

602
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,590
I can do whatever I want?

603
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,360
Of course. Come on.

604
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,480
Three of three.

605
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,200
Three of six.

606
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,400
Four of five.

607
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,760
Five of five.

608
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,640
Six of five.

609
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,550
Seven of five.

610
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,230
What? Want to check mine?

611
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,550
Tricking me?

612
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,600
Check.

613
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,760
I won.

614
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,920
Tell me. What do you want?

615
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,880
What do you want me to do?

616
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,350
All right.

617
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,320
I won't tease you anymore.

618
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,070
Happy birthday.

619
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,440
Shall I put it on you?

620
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,320
Done.

621
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,840
Let me drive you home.

622
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,320
For the game,

623
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,280
you haven't told me what you want.

624
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,230
If you lost,

625
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,400
would you really give me

626
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,510
3.4% of Xingchen's stock?

627
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,390
Yes.

628
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,590
Then I'll also pay my bet.

629
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,070
Hey, Xiaomeng.

630
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,280
Li Li, can you get through Xing?

631
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,030
I texted her, but she didn't reply.

632
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,150
Could she be in trouble?

633
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,190
Don't worry.

634
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,280
I'll call her.

635
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,320
I'll call you back later.

636
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,550
OK.

637
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,030
What's wrong?

638
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,280
Xiaomeng said Xing was missing.

639
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,480
Ji Xing is with Han Ting.

640
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,640
Don't worry.

641
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,510
You know Han Ting?

642
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,360
Oh, Han Ting.

643
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,880
He is

644
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,070
a regular customer of my club.

645
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,710
I met Ji Xing for the first time

646
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,760
at his dinner.

647
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,400
In Xingyue, I saw them stay together.

648
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,070
Hey, Xiaomeng. Don't worry.

649
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
I contacted her.

650
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,070
She's fine. She's at a friend's.

651
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,150
You go to bed early.

652
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,190
That's good. I was scared.

653
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,000
All right. You sleep early, too.

654
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,550
- Good night.
- Good night.

655
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,030
I should go, then.

656
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,280
For some family business.

657
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,600
What is it?

658
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,880
Let me go with you.

659
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,400
No need. You take some rest.

660
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,800
We'll have a good time another day.

661
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,550
(Su Zhizhou)
Xing, where are you?

662
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,880
Why haven't you come to work yet?

663
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,510
