(Xiao Yixiao)

24
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,710
You're just in time.

25
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,150
The problem is solved.

26
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,560
That's good.

27
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,480
You helped me, right?

28
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,510
A friend of mine knew Mr. Ma

29
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,120
and I asked him to set us up.

30
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,560
Didn't I tell you?

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,920
I don't need you

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,560
to solve my problems at work.

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,070
I just don't want you to be upset.

34
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,150
Just this once, then.

35
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,360
I have to work. I'll hang up.

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,280
Miss Li, you have such a sweet smile.

37
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,840
Who were you calling?

38
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,280
The one who bought you the bag?

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,690
Tell everybody

40
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,630
the raw materials will be here within a month.

41
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:31,684
Wow. Ms. Li, you are amazing.

42
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,720
Go ahead.

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,430
Don't do this again.

44
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,710
Or I may rely too much on you.

45
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,310
(Li Li)

46
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,240
Nothing is wrong with that.

47
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,190
It's just a problem I can handle.

48
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,940
(Xiao Yixiao)

49
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:06,620
(Xiao Yixiao: Nothing is wrong with that.
It's just a problem I can handle.)

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,650
Mr. Ma,

51
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,960
I think my grandpa taught you

52
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,840
to keep your promise, didn't he?

53
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,430
Sorry, Miss Zeng.

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,240
I did promise you.

55
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,590
But another friend

56
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,710
asked me to help him.

57
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,430
I couldn't reject him.

58
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,080
I had to deliver
the raw materials within a month.

59
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,630
Which friend?

60
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,150
I'm quite curious.

61
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,080
Miss Zeng, don't push me.

62
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,320
Fine.

63
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,100
But anyway,

64
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,420
what exactly is "within a month"?

65
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,700
Ten days is within a month.

66
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,700
So is thirty days.

67
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,740
I won't do the delivery

68
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,740
until the 30th day.

69
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,220
Not even a single day earlier.

70
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,180
In this case,

71
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,580
I won't embarrass you anymore.

72
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,790
Thanks.

73
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,870
Oh.

74
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,060
If someone asks about this...

75
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,060
I understand.

76
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,060
Don't worry.

77
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,260
One month?

78
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,100
This is the shortest time

79
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,100
I can get.

80
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,180
I understand. But it's still too long.

81
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,020
In our agreement with Dongyang Medical,

82
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,460
there are due dates.

83
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,020
Without raw materials,

84
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,860
we can't even do the sample inspection.

85
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,180
Let's find another way.

86
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,180
Or we'll be breaking the agreement.

87
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,420
Hello. Your coffee.

88
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,510
Thanks.

89
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,060
Hello, Mr. Han.

90
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,660
The material problem isn't solved?

91
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,180
It's half solved.

92
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,580
We don't need to wait without a due date.

93
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,700
But we'll wait for about one month.

94
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,820
One month?

95
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,220
Not exactly.

96
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,380
Do you need my help?

97
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,420
No. Don't bother.

98
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,700
I should go.

99
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,660
You do have double standards.

100
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,340
When Ji Xing wanted food,

101
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,260
you cooked for her.

102
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,300
You invited me here to dinner.

103
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,980
But I cooked instead.

104
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,060
You didn't even say thank you.

105
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,260
Thank you. Medium, please.

106
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,780
Well, don't say anything

107
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,540
unless it's about business.

108
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,980
Let's get to business, then.

109
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,020
Xingchen and Kebo...

110
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,140
You interfered?

111
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,380
Are you jealous because I helped Ji Xing?

112
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,620
I think you know clearly

113
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,740
who did this dirty trick.

114
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,460
Anyway, Dongyang Medical has

115
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,620
quite a lot of suppliers.

116
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,140
You could have easily helped her.

117
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,620
Why did you choose to do nothing?

118
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,940
I don't understand.

119
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,900
I believe she can solve the problem.

120
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,820
So, I shouldn't have worried, huh?

121
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,620
Han Ting, you know what?

122
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,380
I'm not worried about nothing.

123
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,060
Fine. Medium, huh?

124
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,980
I'll make it well done.

125
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,100
Even better done.

126
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,060
(Dongyang Group)

127
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,820
(Xingchen Technology)

128
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,220
You have hard work, guys.

129
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,700
I've brought you something to eat.

130
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,220
- Thanks, Miss Li.
- Thank you, Li.

131
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,300
Come get some.

132
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,580
Youyou, get some for me.

133
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,140
I'm in the middle of something.

134
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,740
Thank you, Miss Li.

135
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,990
Miss Li,

136
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,700
I'll send one pack to Mr. Su.

137
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,100
OK.

138
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,750
Here.

139
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,300
Come on, Weiwei. Take one.

140
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,500
Thank you, Miss Li.

141
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,630
Come on in.

142
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,590
Su,

143
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,780
Li bought us something to eat.

144
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,700
Have some.

145
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,180
Not until I'm done

146
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,500
with my work.

147
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,740
These days,

148
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,540
you sit in here from morning to night

149
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,260
without leaving the office.

150
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,420
Who do you work so hard for?

151
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,700
No one.

152
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,740
Just for myself.

153
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,150
Come on.

154
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,580
I have to focus on work.

155
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,470
Out you go.

156
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,460
- OK.
- Thank Miss Li for me.

157
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,540
Close the door.

158
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,750
OK.

159
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,300
(Eat more pastry, Get a higher pay.)

160
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,660
Don't pull a long face in the morning.

161
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,300
Here. Have some pastry.

162
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,860
Pastry in this store is hard to get.

163
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,990
Every time I pass it,

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,180
I see a really long queue.

165
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,820
I usually ask those

166
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,260
who queue ahead of me

167
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,660
to buy some for me.

168
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,220
I give them some free pastry.

169
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,580
It costs more but saves time.

170
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,380
Clever trick.

171
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,270
What?

172
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,620
Li Li, it's so lucky to have you.

173
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,300
It is, indeed.

174
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,500
I've got an idea.

175
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,900
What is wrong with you?

176
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,140
What if we buy the raw materials

177
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,860
in the way you buy pastry?

178
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,340
We can borrow some from the buyers ahead of us.

179
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,460
And we'll offer

180
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,140
a 5% of the price for their help.

181
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,980
But those buyers

182
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,620
also need raw materials for production.

183
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,300
They may not accept this offer.

184
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,380
If 5% can't work,

185
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,460
make it 8%.

186
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,220
In the worst case, make it 10%.

187
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,020
Ask more buyers
and one of them will approve.

188
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,900
OK. I'll go check

189
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,500
what companies are lining ahead of us.

190
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,980
OK. Come on.

191
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,780
What makes you so happy today?

192
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,140
You even asked me out to lunch.

193
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,380
Bay is going very well.

194
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,180
Thanks for your hard work. Be seated.

195
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,940
So many dishes?

196
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,780
When you were in Germany,

197
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,460
you weren't this fussy about food.

198
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,300
At that time, I was even too busy to sleep.

199
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,540
I was in no mood for food.

200
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,060
I remember it was when

201
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,500
you just established Dongyang Base.

202
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,060
Few people thought highly of it.

203
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,460
You were stressed out.

204
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,740
I offered to stay and help you,

205
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,780
but you rejected me

206
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,300
and insisted on struggling alone.

207
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,860
Indeed.

208
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,340
The initial stage of a company is hard.

209
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,940
Even the slightest lapse

210
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
may bring the company to destruction.

211
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,420
Let's eat.

212
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,180
I had a meeting all morning and I'm tired.

213
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,460
One has limited strength.

214
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,540
Focus more

215
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,260
on serious business

216
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,820
and you won't be that tired.

217
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,940
What do you mean?

218
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,180
What other business did I do?

219
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,700
You're the boss.

220
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,860
Don't waste your time

221
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,780
setting someone up.

222
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,110
You asked Mr. Ma

223
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,900
to postpone the delivery of raw materials

224
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,340
so that Xingchen couldn't

225
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,580
have their experiment as scheduled.

226
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,980
Are you not involved?

227
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,940
Xingchen can't get the raw materials,

228
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,220
but what does it have to do with me?

229
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,340
You can't blame me

230
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,740
for Ji Xing's failure, can you?

231
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,500
Mr. Ma is your grandpa's student.

232
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,140
You've always been close.

233
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,900
That's right.

234
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,900
But so what?

235
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,700
You know me.

236
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,340
Will I slander anyone

237
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,620
without investigating her?

238
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,780
Without telling me,

239
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,460
she poached my employee.

240
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,540
I feel humiliated, don't I?

241
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,180
Teaching her a lesson like this

242
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,060
isn't too harmful, huh?

243
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,580
Xingchen is invested by Dongyang Medical.

244
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,620
When you gave it a lesson,

245
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,620
you'd be disgracing me.

246
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,100
Is Guanghua not your company, then?

247
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,940
It is, of course.

248
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,740
No matter who does such dirty tricks,

249
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,300
I will interfere.

250
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,230
I get it.

251
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,140
I'll meet Mr. Ma personally.

252
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,500
Maybe there's some misunderstanding.

253
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,420
Let's eat.

254
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,500
Taste your favorite fish.

255
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,460
Yichen.

256
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,860
The chef offers

257
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,780
to cook in your place.

258
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,980
Don't turn her down.

259
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,380
How about we eat out?

260
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,980
Do you not believe in my cooking skills?

261
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,260
Rest assured.

262
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,660
You don't need to do anything.

263
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,740
When the dishes are done,

264
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,460
just give me some comment.

265
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,660
You even brought some wine?

266
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,940
Yeah. Good wine for fancy dishes.

267
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,980
It tastes good.

268
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,140
How about you taste some later?

269
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,710
Yichen,

270
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,420
do you like stir-fried meat with chili?

271
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,180
The other day, I learned to cook it

272
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,620
the original way.

273
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,710
OK.

274
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,660
What else do you like to eat?

275
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,030
Anything.

276
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,340
How about I make you

277
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,190
some light dishes?

278
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,420
When I stayed with Xing for a long time,

279
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,940
I loved spicy food, too.

280
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,460
But recently,

281
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,100
I haven't had light dishes for a while.

282
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,740
Sorry.

283
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,780
Yichen, I don't mean to...

284
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,870
It's OK.

285
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,260
I didn't eat spicy food, either.

286
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,460
Your finger is cut. Let me tie it up.

287
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,460
I'll be more gentle.

288
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,150
It's OK.

289
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,140
The cut won't heal

290
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,340
before it hurts.

291
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:13,740
(Pearl River Piano)

292
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Smart Lemon?

293
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,660
What are you doing here?

294
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,020
Didn't I tell you I would run a bar?

295
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,380
So, I'm here to buy

296
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,220
some impressive instruments

297
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,340
and I'll put them in my bar.

298
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,660
Then,

299
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,420
whoever visits my bar will say,

300
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,700
"The owner is professional."

301
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,980
Will you really open a bar?

302
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,300
The money and the location are almost done.

303
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,020
Based on the advice you gave me,

304
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,220
I'm working on a proposal.

305
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,470
When it's approved,

306
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,580
money will not be a problem.

307
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,180
That bar looks really good.

308
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,900
I won't redecorate it.

309
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,540
I'll change the bar sign and open it.

310
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,940
So, you...

311
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,380
Before your proposal is approved,

312
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,460
you buy instruments already?

313
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Don't worry. You offered some advice.

314
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,380
There won't be a problem.

315
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,060
So, you do a part-time job here?

316
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,430
Yes.

317
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,060
The owner is my friend.

318
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,180
You haven't boosted popularity

319
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,820
for Snow White for a long time.

320
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,180
You're no longer a fan?

321
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,140
Don't mention it.

322
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,700
Before, on the Internet,

323
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,500
she humiliated her fans.

324
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,300
I was just blind.

325
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,700
Fine. It's never too late to correct.

326
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,100
You're not completely blind.

327
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,550
Seriously,

328
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,260
you gave me some good advice last time.

329
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,820
How about you serve as my consultant?

330
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,660
When you're there, you'll have free drinks.

331
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,350
OK.

332
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,620
Pick me some instruments.

333
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,700
- Let's go.
- OK.

334
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,180
I had meant to cook for you.

335
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,540
But in the end, you had to cook.

336
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,140
You're my guest.

337
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,740
I should cook for you.

338
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,820
I don't cook very well, though.

339
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,260
Make do with it.

340
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,900
No way. They smell great.

341
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,660
Does it still hurt?

342
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,580
No. Just a little cut.

343
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,510
Qiuzi.

344
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,940
Thank you for helping me

345
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,340
with my family problem.

346
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,580
These days, you've also been comforting me.

347
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,340
Here. A toast to you.

348
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,580
Yichen, there's no need of that.

349
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,060
Yichen,

350
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,500
I want to help you as much as I can.

351
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,630
Thanks.

352
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,900
Enjoy the dishes before they get cold.

353
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,420
Whenever you need me,

354
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,620
I'll always be there.

355
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,550
I...

356
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,300
I want to be with you forever.

357
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,140
Qiuzi,

358
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,460
I'm sorry.

359
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,580
I'm not ready

360
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,660
to start a new relationship.

361
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,940
It's OK.

362
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,390
I understand.

363
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,700
Don't worry about it.

364
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,940
Let's eat.

365
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,860
This dish tastes good.

366
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,940
The raw material problem has been solved.

367
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,420
We've received

368
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,460
the best resin,

369
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,060
titanium alloy, and tantalum metal.

370
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,580
The registration of intervertebral cage
is also in progress.

371
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,260
The product experiment will be done soon.

372
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,660
I'll waste no time.

373
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,020
I'm getting back to work, then.

374
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,860
(Guideline of 2023 MBA of Xinggang University)

375
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,100
Thank you, Mr. Han.

376
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,900
I'll study hard.

So much

405
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,780
for today's class.

406
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,060
If you have any questions,

407
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,260
let's communicate after class.

Class is over.

409
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,100
Mr. Ma, I should go.

410
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,950
OK.

411
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,140
Mr. Ma Feng.

412
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,900
Nice to meet you.

413
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,700
I watched your interview.

414
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,820
When you were in college,

415
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,460
you started the research of genetic testing.

416
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,140
Before graduation, you had got some investment.

417
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,340
That's impressive.

418
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,060
Thanks. And you are?

419
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,660
I'm Ji Xing from Xingchen Technology.

420
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,940
What a surprise to meet you here!

421
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,660
I have things to do. Excuse me.

422
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,790
Professor.

423
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,140
Mr. Ma, long no see.

424
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,580
Prof. Xiang, I've learned quite a lot today.

425
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,140
Your five theories...

426
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,460
So, this is your note?

427
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,860
Mr. Han? What are you doing here?

428
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,470
Prof. Xiang.

429
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,100
You wait for me out there.

430
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,750
Oh, Han Ting.

431
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,780
I thought you would wait in my office.

432
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,630
Long time no see.

433
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,500

435
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,630
I am.

436
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,580
Nice to meet you.

437
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,820

Hope we can cooperate someday.

440
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,260
Sorry, but I need

441
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,260
to talk to Prof. Xiang.

442
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,100
You guys talk.

443
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,380
I'll leave you alone.

444
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,980
Hope we can cooperate.

445
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,910
OK.

446
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,380

Miss Ji.

451
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,860
Oh, Mr. Ma Feng.

452
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,060
I'm sorry.

453
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,460
I forgot to give you my name card.

454
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,620
I didn't expect you to know Mr. Han.

455
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,060
Shall we have dinner someday?

456
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,260
My treat.

457
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,110
- OK.
- All right.

458
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,220
I have to go.

459
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,940
- OK. See you.
- Bye-bye.

460
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,340
My treat.

461
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,430
OK.

462
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,350
What are you looking at?

463
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,230
Let's go.

464
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,860
Mr. Han, you don't always

465
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,140
need a name card, do you?

466
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,900
Your face can talk.

467
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,620
Watching interviews can't help, huh?

468
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,940
What have you learned these days?

469
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,860
I realize I have

470
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,740
awesome classmates.

471
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,620
They're all famous guys.

472
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,860
But of course, you're the most impressive.

473
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,940
I'm hungry.

474
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,220
Shall I invite you to lunch?

475
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,230
OK.

476
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,110
What would you like to eat?

477
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,060
Anything.

478
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,910
Let's go.

Look. He's so handsome.

482
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,860
Yeah. So cool.

483
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,580
This is what you've bought me?

484
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,380
You said anything would do.

485
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,140
It's the flavor you can only taste

486
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,460
in a school cafeteria.

487
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,670
Taste it.

488
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,580
How does it taste?

489
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,300
Good.

490
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,060
Thanks for the compliment, Mr. Han.

491
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,420
It's seldom your treat, after all.

492
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,260
What do you mean, "seldom"?

493
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,580
That year, when we won the first prize,

494
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,540
the dinner was my treat.

495
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,700
You just didn't come.

496
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,340
I was going to Germany at that time

497
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,940
and I texted you.

498
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,260
You didn't text back.

499
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,340
You texted me?

500
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,780
That day, I...

501
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,300
I accidentally lost my phone.

502
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,540
What did you say in the text?

503
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,460
Nothing special.

504
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,260
I just told you I couldn't go.

505
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,260
Oh, are you available tomorrow?

506
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,580
I want to brief you.

507
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,140
So soon? Want the second payment?

508
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,700
It's almost the day

509
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,540
of the second payment, after all.

510
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,780
How's it going with your work?

511
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,460
This afternoon,

512
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,860
we'll print out the sample

513
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,700
of intervertebral cage.

514
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,980
Tomorrow, we'll have your internal inspection.

515
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,980
Once it's done,

516
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,460
we'll have it tested in the institute.

517
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,380
Hope we can get

518
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,940
the qualification report soon.

519
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,500
Are you so sure

520
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,060
you'll pass tomorrow's inspection?

521
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,550
Yes, of course.

522
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,340
Or I'd break our agreement.

523
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,860
Hello, Zhizhou.

524
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,750
Hey, Xing.

525
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,140
You're answering, at last.

526
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,100
The anxiety is killing me.

527
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,980
What happened? Tell me.

528
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,830
Don't be anxious.

529
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,220
When Zuo operated the printer,

530
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,620
he broke it.

531
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,260
Is the problem serious?

532
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,020
The printer breaks down when it's turned on.

533
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,860
The screen also goes blank when it's on.

534
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,460
Now, you call Beidi

535
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,940
for the maintenance work.

536
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,790
I'll be right back.

537
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,870
Got it.

538
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,820
Something's wrong. I have to go.

539
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,270
Let me drive you.

540
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,860
Have you decided what to do?

541
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,700
Our priority is to fix the printer.

542
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,860
When I'm back,

543
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,060
I'll see what is exactly wrong.

544
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,620
Don't worry.

545
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,700
When Beidi has the printer fixed,

546
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,220
the printing will take only 40 minutes.

547
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,900
The inspection won't be delayed.

548
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,900
Since Xingchen was established,

549
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,940
there hasn't been a clear disciplinary system

550
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,420
or a personnel management system.

551
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,140
This kind of accident

552
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,420
has something to do
with process and management.

553
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,420
You just learned to manage a company.

554
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,740
Time to put your learning to use.

555
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,660
Through this problem,

556
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,700
I can sort out

557
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,740
Xingchen's structure.

558
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,220
In the early stage, you won support

559
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,940
from employees with dreams and emotions

560
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,660
and inspired them to work hard.

561
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,500
That's acceptable.

562
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,660
But initiative isn't the only factor for work.

563
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,380
The sense of crisis
and motivation are as important.

564
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,540
Competition and elimination are crucial, too.

565
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,220
You have to control

566
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,020
the bond between them.

567
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,900
I get your point.

568
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,900
Indeed, many regulations in Xingchen

569
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,820
aren't perfect.

570
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,420
So, how will you deal with employee

571
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,740
who broke the printer?

572
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,820
If you were me, what would you do?

573
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,750
I'd hold him responsible

574
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,860
and consider if I'll fire him accordingly.

575
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,740
Fire him?

576
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,460
Isn't it too cruel?

577
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,460
In a loose management,

578
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,140
prestige will be gone as time goes by.

579
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,420
But besides regulations,

580
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,620
we also care for human nature.

581
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,940
Zuo is a talented man.

582
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,100
He came to Xingchen after graduation.

583
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,460
And employees of Xingchen

584
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,860
get along like friends.

585
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,020
If I fire him,

586
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,500
what will other employees think?

587
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,260
They'll be discouraged.

588
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,900
Then you can

589
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,860
give his credit and profit

590
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,100
to other members

591
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,950
of this project.

592
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,140
There must be a better solution.

593
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,260
It's so thoughtful of you.

594
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,500
Have you thought about this?

595
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,060
If you can't finish as scheduled,

596
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,500
you'll break the agreement.

597
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,260
We'll finish as scheduled

598
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,250
and won't break the agreement.

599
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,700
Do you need me there?

600
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,940
No. If I can't even solve this little problem,

601
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,340
I'll be too ashamed to be the boss.

602
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,510
Boss,

603
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,660
Miss Ji looks rather anxious.

604
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,230
How about you pamper her?

605
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,660
Come on. Can't you

606
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,060
transfer a maintenance man

607
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,140
to fix our printer?

608
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,700
We're in urgent need

609
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,820
and no time can be wasted.

610
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,700
Please help us, OK?

611
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,030
Hello?

612
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,950
Hello?

613
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,260
You're the vice general manager.

614
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,580
You must calm down.

615
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,340
Or the others will be more anxious.

616
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,500
Cheer up, guys.

617
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,860
There are always solutions.

618
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,180
We still have some time.

619
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,660
The problem will be solved.

620
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,110
Mr. Su,

621
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,500
if the printer

622
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,900
can't be fixed,

623
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,660
what do we do?

624
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,900
Don't jinx it.

625
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,740
Let's think of more ways to solve it.

626
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,820
We'll have the inspection tomorrow.

627
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,940
If the printer isn't fixed,

628
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,820
the overall progress will be delayed.

629
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,740
But in the progress report to Dongyang Medical,

630
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,260
we said we would finish as scheduled.

631
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,820
What do we do now?

632
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,300
They're aware, I think.

633
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,060
My friend in the Technical Department
of Dongyang Medical

634
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,660
just called me to ask about this.

635
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,380
Their technical department

636
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,140
was established by Ms. Yuan.

637
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,340
I guess the news

638
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,540
has reached her.

639
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,030
Zuo,

640
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,220
how did you operate the printer?

641
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,540
If we can't finish as scheduled,

642
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,300
can you hold the responsibilities?

643
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,980
Has Beidi's maintenance man come?

644
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,740
I called them.

645
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,400
All their employees

646
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,520
are traveling in another province.

647
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,940
The maintenance man can't come
until the day after tomorrow.

648
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,140
You two come to my office.

649
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,740
Focus on your work.

650
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,990
Boss,

651
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,500
I've prepared the materials

652
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,420
for this afternoon's debriefing meeting.

653
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,820
Our company has been developing stably.

654
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,020
I don't think Ms. Yuan

655
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,660
will find fault this time.

656
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,700
We'll know.

657
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,950
Sit.

658
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,460
What exactly happened?

659
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,900
It happened so suddenly.

660
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,700
Zuo can't remember

661
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,700
which step went wrong.

662
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,660
Who else was present then?

663
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,860
He operated it alone?

664
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,180
According to operational regulations,

665
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,020
at least two operators should be present, huh?

666
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,910
Xing,

667
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,460
there was something wrong

668
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,140
with the contract of our material supplier.

669
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,220
The materials were delivered

670
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,220
three days late.

671
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,340
To catch up with the schedule,

672
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,100
I took all the other employees

673
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,500
to work overtime, reviewing the process.

674
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,540
In this case,

675
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,660
none of us was available.

676
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,820
So, Zuo

677
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,620
operated the printer alone.

678
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,310
Xing,

679
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,340
I'm responsible.

680
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,220
You are.

681
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,820
Can you figure out the fault?

682
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,540
The printer broke down directly.

683
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,100
We can't detect anything wrong.

684
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,110
Xing,

685
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,420
shall we tell Mr. Han

686
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,940
about what happened

687
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,820
and postpone the inspection?

688
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,180
It's a special case, after all.

689
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,740
Nobody could expect it.

690
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,420
In business, we must be honest.

691
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,860
And in the agreement,

692
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,740
the schedule is clarified.

693
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,060
Just because he supports us,

694
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,500
we can't drop the ball.

695
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,780
Whatever happens, tomorrow,

696
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,900
we have to do the inspection.

697
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,750
Zhizhou,

698
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,460
ask everybody to work normally.

699
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,220
We'll contact

700
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,420
the companies we know

701
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,660
and see if any of them have the same printer.

702
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,660
We'll borrow it.

703
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,470
Go ahead.

704
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,740
The first phase of our reform

705
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,580
has been completed.

706
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,500
All the departments have cooperated very well.

707
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,140
The Product Department keeps advancing

708
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,500
the construction of new production lines.

709
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,780
Highly effective.

710
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,220
(Quarterly Overview)
The sales of the last quarter

711
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,540
has also risen by 8%.

712
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,460
I'll make adjustments accordingly

713
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,020
for the next phase

714
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,460
to reach perfect collaboration and operation.

715
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,220
Han Ting is doing good, indeed.

716
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,460
Directors,

717
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,500
if there's nothing else,

718
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,020
today's meeting

719
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,190
will be over.

720
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,500
Mr. Han,

721
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,100
since you took over Dongyang Medical,

722
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,700
we've witnessed the powerful measures

723
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,100
you've been taking.

724
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,980
They're effective, indeed.

725
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,820
But there's one thing

726
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,940
I do not understand.

727
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,180
For companies affiliated to Dongyang Medical,

728
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,180
you shouldn't treat

729
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,140
the head office and the subsidiary

730
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,300
very differently, should you?

731
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,110
Mr. Zhou,

732
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,220
what do you mean?

733
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,460
It's not a big deal, actually.

734
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,660
I just heard,

735
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,660
due to Xingchen's poor management,

736
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,860
there was a major failure

737
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,340
in their printer.

738
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,380
If I remember correctly,

739
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,860
in the report

740
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,620
Xingchen submitted last month,

741
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,700
in a day or two,

742
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,180
their intervertebral cage

743
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,780
will have the quality inspection.

744
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,620
Now, if their target can't be reached

745
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,060
because of the poor management,

746
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,260
Mr. Han,

747
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,820
what will you do?

748
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,540
Mr. Zhou,

749
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,900
a startup company

750
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,020
certainly has some small problems.

751
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,700
Xingchen has taken rapid responses.

752
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,700
There's no point in discussing
such a little thing at the board meeting.

753
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,420
Mr. Han,

754
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,380
this isn't a little thing.

755
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,020
It indicates something wrong

756
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,540
with our investment

757
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,580
in Xingchen Technology.

758
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,500
We do investment

759
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,460
instead of charity.

760
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,820
What we expect is success

761
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,860
and efficiency.

762
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,860
In the agreement between us,

763
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,340
it's clarified

764
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,820
that if Xingchen's intervertebral cage

765
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,100
can't have the quality inspection as scheduled,

766
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,780
it'll be overdue.

767
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,710
Being overdue

768
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,660
will be a breach of contract.

769
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,950
That's right.

770
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,500
We are a listed company, after all.

771
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,780
Since we've chosen

772
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,900
to invest in the field

773
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,900
of 3D medical printing,

774
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,940
we should make a difference.

775
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,820
Hanhai Technology

776
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,660
has been developing very well.

777
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,300
But look at our company.

778
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,820
Due to poor management,

779
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,380
the quality inspection will be delayed.

780
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,500
If it gets out,

781
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,860
I'm afraid our stock price will be affected.

782
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,020
Don't worry, directors.

783
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,580
Xingchen's research

784
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,100
will be advanced

785
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,580
as specified in our agreement.

786
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,700
Mr. Han,

787
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,740
we're not questioning Ji Xing's ability.

788
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,340
But she's a technical guy, after all.

789
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,860
Here's what I think.

790
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,220
When you have a technical talent

791
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,140
do products and management at the same time,

792
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,140
you're indeed pushing her.

793
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,780
So, Mr. Zhou, are you saying

794
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,860
a professional manager

795
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,860
should be assigned to Xingchen

796
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,180
to help with their administration?

797
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,860
Ms. Yuan,

798
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,710
you're professional.

799
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,860
It's a good idea.

800
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,900
I said

801
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,100
I would be held responsible.

802
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,540
Xingchen doesn't need any parachute manager.

803
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,420
This is just a suggestion.

804
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,980
You're in charge, after all.

805
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,900
If you insist,

806
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,060
we won't argue too much.

807
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,380
Let's wait and see.

808
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,710
Dismissed.

809
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,820
If Mr. Han keeps

810
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,060
going his own way like this,

811
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,580
I'm afraid we'll be in trouble.

812
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,980
We should tell our chairman about this.

813
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,990
Boss,

814
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,660
they're obviously making a fuss

815
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,660
and finding fault.

816
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,590
Anyway,

817
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,420
shall we remind Miss Ji?

818
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,590
No need.

819
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,300
Don't put more pressure on her.

820
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,430
OK.

821
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,380
(Smile)

822
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,220
(Dongyang Group)

823
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,100
Hello, Mr. Hong.

824
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,220
This is Li Li.

825
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,300
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

826
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,140
Do you have an idle printer

827
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,420
that can be lent to us?

828
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,390
I'll let you work, then.

829
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,700
Hello, Mr. Liu. This is Ji Xing.

830
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,820
Hello, Mr. Chen.

831
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,980
Our 3D printer has a failure.

832
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,940
May I ask if you have an idle one?

833
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,340
Our 3D printer has a failure.

834
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,340
- Can we borrow yours?
- Fine.

835
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,260
It's OK.

836
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,310
Thank you.

837
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,460
What if tomorrow we can't

838
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,140
do Dongyang's inspection?

839
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,100
In this case,

840
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,820
will it be a breach of contract?

841
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,300
Will there be a penalty?

842
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,780
Will the investment be cut?

843
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,260
Will our company

844
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,180
fall out because of this?

845
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,420
The problem will be solved.

846
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,340
Don't worry about it.

847
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,060
Knock off early

848
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,100
and go back home.

849
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,390
Mr. Su,

850
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,620
you, Miss Ji, and Miss Li

851
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,540
haven't left.

852
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,380
How can we leave before you?

853
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,220
Yeah. We'll stay.

854
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,620
Maybe we can help.

855
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,110
Li.

856
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,460
How's it going?

857
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,580
We're in urgent need.

858
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,540
We contacted anyone we could,

859
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,780
but failed to borrow the same printer

860
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,940
in such a short time.

861
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,590
Guys,

862
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,140
Mr. Zheng of Nanyou Technology

863
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,700
promised to lend us their printer.

864
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,340
Nanyou Technology is in Jingxi.

865
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,180
The company I worked for

866
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,420
did business with them.

867
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,270
I'll go.

868
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:04,990
OK.

869
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,500
Zhizhou, you go with Li Li.

870
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,180
A technical guy like you
can operate the printer.

871
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,100
- OK.
- Later,

872
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,420
I'll get you guys in a group chat

873
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,540
where you can contact Mr. Zheng.

874
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,540
Let's go now

875
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,740
and buy the flight tickets on the way.

876
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,380
We'll print it overnight and fly back

877
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,260
early tomorrow morning.

878
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,350
We should go.

879
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,240
OK.

880
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,700
It's getting late.

881
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,340
You get packed and knock off.

882
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,380
Zuo and Xia, go with me to the lab.

883
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,230
- OK.
- Miss Ji.

884
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,140
Shall we go with you?

885
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,420
Now, we have a solution.

886
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,100
You don't need to waste time here.

887
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,180
Go home for some rest.

888
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,780
We can't help even if we go.

889
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,180
Let's just listen to Miss Ji.

890
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,020
Then contact us when you need anything.

891
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,620
We'll be always on call.

892
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,670
OK.

893
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,910
Let's go.

894
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,500
(Can't find the file)

895
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,180
It still doesn't work.

896
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,020
Sorry, Miss Ji.

897
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,070
It's OK.

898
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:05,980
Miss Li and Mr. Su

899
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,140
have gone to Jingxi.

900
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,980
We're doing a Plan B

901
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,830
just in case.

902
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,700
Go get me the instruction manual

903
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,550
of the printer.

904
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,540
You know mechanics

905
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,580
and I know the software.

906
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,420
Now, we aren't sure about the problem.

907
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,700
We have to check the software

908
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,580
and the hardware.

909
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,020
What? Have no confidence?

910
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:24,910
Miss Ji,

911
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,620
what if I make it worse?

912
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,900
Don't worry. I'm here for you.

913
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,420
Later, I will call

914
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,300
Beidi's maintenance men

915
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,460
and see if they can offer

916
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,100
some online guidance.

917
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,540
I'll go get the toolbox.

918
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,900
OK. I'll go get the instruction manual.
