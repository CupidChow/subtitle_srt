00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,680
Mr. Han, what do you think

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,170
are our problems?

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,680
You lack management experience

26
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,920
as well as top connections

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
in the industry.

28
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,970
Without sales or channels,

29
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,650
how can you put your product into the market?

30
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,010
Mr. Han, we...

31
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,280
Thank you for reminding us.

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,560
I've kept that in mind.

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,090
When I'm back, I'll rethink and make it up.

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,970
Mr. Han, since you don't want to invest,

35
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,370
we'll leave you alone.

36
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,210
Hope we can cooperate

37
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,530
somewhere else.

38
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,370
We were schoolmates anyway.

39
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,720
There's still friendship, huh?

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,120
No friendship.

41
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,970
In business, there are either partners

42
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,880
or enemies.

43
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,330
It is also our honor

44
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,970
to be Mr. Han's enemy.

45
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,600
Are you so confident

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,840
that you can succeed?

47
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,530
Mr. Han,

48
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,190
in your eyes,

49
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,720
Xingchen may have a lot of problems.

50
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,810
But in this society,

51
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,370
no one can eclipse the other.

52
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,770
It's an old saying

53
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,930
and it's very simple.

54
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,330
"Gold always shines."

55
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,400
You may be a piece of gold.

56
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,650
But don't forget.

57
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,560
In this city,

58
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,210
gold is everywhere.

59
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,810
Life is still long. We'll try.

60
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,770
(Business Proposal)
Zhizhou, go.

61
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,160
We'll leave you alone.

62
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,120
Come on.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,880
Goodbye, Mr. Han.

64
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
Naive.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,810
(Dongyang Group)
Xing, actually I think

66
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,840
Mr. Han has a point.

67
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,530
Since we can do projects,

68
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,440
why do we start

69
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,440
in Dongyang Medical?

70
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,490
When we get financing

71
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,090
and channels, we can...

72
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,810
What's wrong, Xing?

73
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,490
I regret it.

74
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,330
Then let's go back to him.

75
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,720
I regret partnering with you.

76
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,960
Xing,

77
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,930
I just think they gave us

78
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,280
a really good offer.

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,810
Honestly, we have nothing

80
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,280
but techniques.

81
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,170
Su Zhizhou,

82
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,330
did you not get that?

83
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,370
He tore down

84
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,720
our company,

85
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,210
making us doubt ourselves.

86
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,600
Then he recruited us with a high offer.

87
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,440
When he failed,

88
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,370
he said

89
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,280
we would be either friends or enemies.

90
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,600
That was a threat.

91
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,250
Step by step,

92
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,120
he got you into his rhythm.

93
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,530
If you work for this kind of boss,

94
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,530
do you think you can easily get away?

95
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,280
Or are you going back to him now?

96
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,170
I'm not.

97
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,690
We should have our pride.

98
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,840
What we should do now

99
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,090
is move forward.

100
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,650
Do not turn back. We will succeed.

101
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,010
Xing,

102
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,400
that's cool.

103
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,430
What are you doing?

104
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,480
What about your pride?

105
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,210
Let me take another look.

106
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,890
Why don't you take it back?

107
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,120
OK.

108
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,120
Boss,

109
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,890
you prepared that much,

110
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,890
but Ji Xing still rejected you.

111
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:06,890
Don't worry.

112
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,650
She won't hold long.

113
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,650
My family,

114
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,010
you strongly requested

115
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,600
a PK game with Poison Apple.

116
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,840
(Smart Lemon)
You only start it,

117
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,330
but don't help me to win?

118
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,360
Thanks.

119
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,280
Thanks for your support.

120
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,330
Love you.

121
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,970
At the end of today's live streaming,

122
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,970
I'll sing a song to thank you.

123
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,890
Any song you like.

124
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,570
Good Day?

125
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,010
OK.

126
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,530
This is the moment that decides

127
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,130
whether it's a good day today.

128
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,480

I'm immediately energized.

131
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,330
Mr. Lu may be late.

132
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,970
But he'd never be absent.

133
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,280
It's OK.

can start a company.

162
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,530
She has a talent and ideas.

163
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,970
Working for Dongyang Medical

164
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,450
will maximize her ability.

165
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,880
To start a company,

166
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,400
she'll have to face

00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,330
more than technical problems.

168
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,160
Come on. When you like a girl,

169
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,360
just do whatever she wants.

170
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,280
Anyway, you don't expect her
to be successful enough

171
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,400
to feed Dongyang Medical back.

172
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,970
As far as I see,

173
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,010
investing in her

174
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,210
has nothing to do
with complicated investment evaluation.

175
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,010
It's just about love.

176
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,360
Don't make it so complicated.

177
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,620
I will never change my ideas

178
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,060
about investing just for chasing a girl.

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,220
Besides,

180
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,540
she doesn't want me to invest in her

181
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,860
for the love thing.

182
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,300
You have no idea.

183
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,860
Why did you give me some tea so late?

184
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,340
Because you don't drink wine.

185
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,220
Why must he be so twisted?

I'll go buy a bouquet.

187

00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,740
Kid,

189
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,660
you did something wrong
and you should apologize.

00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,140
You're an adult.

192
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,780
Why don't you let go of a kid?

193
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,020
It's normal that a kid is insensitive.

194
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,420
Why are you also unreasonable?

195
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,380
You're his example, don't you know?

196
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,300
How could you be so mean?

197
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,820
Bums me out.

198
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,380
Let's go, son.

199
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,780
Is it yours?

200
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,540
Or what?

201
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,620
Thanks.

202
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,900
I've studied Han Ting all night.

203
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,780
Mr. Han?

204
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,940
Han Ting's comments.

205
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,660
Since we started the financing thing,

206
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,540
he's been the only one

207
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,700
who carefully read our proposal.

208
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,940
He said something harsh.

209
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,500
But it makes sense.

210
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,380
Based on his comments,

211
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,180
I've made a new proposal.

212
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,060
Well done, Xing.

213
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,180
You didn't get investment,

214
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,580
but you were enlightened.

215
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,060
That's still something.

216
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,900
Speak wisely.

217
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,940
To be honest,

218
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,420
when I saw the dense comments

219
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,940
Mr. Han made yesterday,

220
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,660
I was kind of frustrated.

221
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,780
We've seen so many investors these days.

222
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,420
None of them think highly of us.

223
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,700
The analog product

224
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,180
isn't going very smoothly, either.

225
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,180
I'm getting confused.

226
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,420
Xing...

227
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,220
Tell me.

228
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,780
Can we or can we not succeed?

229
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,420
This is how people start a company.

230
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,180
Trust yourself,

231
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,500
find the problems,
and solve them one by one.

232
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,220
Shall we?

233
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,540
There you go.

234
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,140
Surprise!

235
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,180
Su Zhizhou, right?

236
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,820
Congratulations. Don't you get us in?

237
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,940
Come in, please.

238
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,020
Xing, this is a nice office.

239
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,260
Oh, such a big table.

240
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,900
Thank you.

241
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,300
Why have you come so early?

242
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,580
- Didn't we make it twelve?
- Thanks.

243
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,780
Today, we don't have things to do,

244
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,060
so we agreed to come early.

245
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,180
Oh, it's installed. Do you like it?

246
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,540
I love it.

247
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,660
Where should it be plugged?

248
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,420
Read the instructions.

249
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,420
Xing.

250
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,500
Wish a good happy opening

251
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,540
and a great fortune.

252
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,260
Some gifts for you.

253
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,820
Thank you. What are these?

254
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,660
Pens. One for each of you.

255
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,540
Hope you will get

256
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,420
a lot of big contracts.

257
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,580
Thank you, Qiuzi.

258
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,660
Xing, I bought you a humidifier. Look.

259
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,780
I saw it.

260
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,300
Sweetheart, I ordered barbecue.

261
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,380
It'll be delivered soon.

262
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,180
Let's wait for lunch.

263
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,820
Let's eat.

264
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,820
Xing,

265
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,140
you have such a special rooftop.

266
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,580
So beautiful.

267
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,380
The barbecue is here.

268
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,500
Here, Li.

269
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,420
Xing,

270
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,780
when will Yichen arrive?

271
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,180
Shall we wait for him?

272
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,540
No need. He called me, saying

273
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,540
he had some emergency work.

274
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,180
He asked us to eat instead of waiting.

275
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,780
Xiaomeng, stop looking. Come and eat.

276
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,900
Coming.

277
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,500
- Li.
- It's so nice.

278
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,780
What kind do you prefer, spicy food,

279
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,620
or non-spicy food?

280
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,660
Non-spicy. I have a poor stomach.

281
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,180
Li, you can stop. Leave it to me.

282
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,820
You're a guest. How can I make you work?

283
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,540
Come on. Not until this round.

284
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,340
OK.

285
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,740
Li,

286
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,500
I'm actually good at barbecue.

287
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,900
Back in college,

288
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,060
every time we had a field trip,

289
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,020
I could do a barbecue for the whole class.

290
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,180
You were bullied, huh?

291
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,540
I don't think so.

292
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,900
They...

293
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,300
They just thought I cooked very well.

294
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,500
All right. I won't tease you.

295
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,260
When did you gratulate
from Xinggang University?

296
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,380
In 2013.

297
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,020
Two years later than Xing.

298
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,020
Li, what about you?

299
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,940
I graduated one year earlier than her.

300
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,780
So, three years earlier than me.

301
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,420
You're my young junior, then.

302
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,540
Not really. Not too young.

303
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,700
Xing, how's your financing going?

304
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,300
Don't mention it.
We've seen a lot of investors.

305
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,060
It's normal that some bargained.

306
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,060
- Some even stole our proposal.
- Stole?

307
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,380
Someone was tricky.

308
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,180
- First, he mentally mocked us
- You do it.

309
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,420
- to hurt our confidence.
- Sure.

310
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,900
He even wanted to recruit us.

311
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,780
Too many tricks.

312
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,780
Such an evil man.

313
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,380
Sweetheart, don't be discouraged.

314
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,660
Tomorrow, I'll check

315
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,300
if any of my clients are interested.

316
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,020
Oh, Li.

317
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,420
You're so well-connected, Li.

318
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,060
Of course. She is

319
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,300
the best salesgirl

320
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,420
in Xinggang's medical market.

321
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,020
Beautiful and talented, huh?

322
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,140
Impressive.

323
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,940
You taste some.

324
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,660
I'll go back there.

325
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,100
Thanks.

326
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,900
Sweethearts,

327
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,180
are you available tomorrow?

328
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,020
What for?

329
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,260
Go with me to see a blind date.

330
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,780
- Blind date?
- Blind date?

331
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,060
Isn't it inappropriate to take us?

332
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,300
My mother insisted

333
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,020
I have a meal with the son of her friend.

334
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,420
He'll also take someone.

335
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,540
You just go with me.

336
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,780
If I go alone,

337
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,620
I'll be embarrassed.

338
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,660
Fine. I'll protect you, then.

339
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,660
It's so nice of you.

340
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,180
I have to work tomorrow.

341
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,380
I can't keep you company.

342
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,580
How about I don't go, either?

343
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,420
Xiaomeng can go with you.

344
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,420
Don't take too many guys.

345
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,380
Don't. Xing, go with us.

346
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,300
I hear he also works

347
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,500
in the medical industry.

348
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,900
Pretend you'll get to know a peer

349
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,180
for another connection.

350
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,180
What if you need his help someday, huh?

351
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,060
That's right.

352
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,180
Go with us. What if you know him?

353
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,900
Fine.

354
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,420
But your blind date matters most.

355
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,620
OK.

356
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,660
Mr. Su, stop that. Come and eat.

357
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,820
OK. I'm just done.

358
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,660
Thank you, Zhizhou.

359
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,900
Thanks.

360
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,820
Sit down and eat.

361
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,300
OK. I'll sit over there.

362
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,580
This is not spicy.

363
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,820
Thanks.

364
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,380
You're welcome.

365
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,540
Come on. Let's raise our glasses

366
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,060
to celebrate the opening

367
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,540
of Xing's company.

368
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,060
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

369
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,060
What's up, Boss?

370
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,660
Have you had a blind date?

371
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,260
What's your problem, bro?

372
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,380
If you aren't skilled enough,

373
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,300
don't pretend you are.

374
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,540
Run. Just run.

375
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,900
They're coming after you. Run.

376
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,660
Come on. Catch up.

377
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,540
Get in the car.

378
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,660
In a minute.

379
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,780
Go, go, go!

380
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,900
Go!

381
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,780
I didn't ask you to go.

382
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,780
Open the door. I'm sorry.

383
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,620
I'm wrong.

384
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,660
So narrow-minded.

385
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,020
Why are you so impatient?

386
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,260
- Ting.
- Call me Han Ting.

387
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,620
OK.

388
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,180
Han Ting.

389
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,540
Go look around.

390
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,780
What kind of nephew

391
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,140
is always so rude to his uncle?

392
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,620
Don't threaten me with seniority.

393
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,020
Your mother

394
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,300
asked me to take you to the blind date.

395
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,780
Or I would have no time for you.

396
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,020
Oh, my mother.

397
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,700
She restrains me every day.

398
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,100
She confiscated my car

399
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,260
and made my bank cards invalid.

400
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,620
Now, she has a blind date for me.

401
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,220
I just graduated.

402
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,020
She wants a girl

403
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,060
to restrain an obstreperous guy like you.

404
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,220
Are you done with the proposal?

405
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,500
What proposal?

406
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,020
Didn't you say you wanted

407
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,820
to buy the bar on Jintai Road

408
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,660
and run it yourself?

409
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,580
You approved?

410
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,020
Depends on how you do the blind date.

411
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,540
And I won't approve

412
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,500
unless your proposal is OK.

413
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,500
I knew it.

414
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,860
In the family, my nephew

415
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,860
cares for me best.

416
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,060
Unlike my mother.

417
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,300
She didn't invest in me,

418
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,780
but complained about me
of running a bar for fun.

419
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,340
Yes.

420
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,540
Let me get it straight here.

421
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,620
You must run the bar carefully.

422
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,340
- Or...
- Or you would break my leg.

423
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,860
Don't worry. I'll take good care of it.

424
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,060
And what kind of nephew

425
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,860
would scare his uncle?

426
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,060
Hi. May I help you?

427
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,460
East Sea Room reserved by a Mr. Han.

428
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,780
It's over here. Come with me.

429
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,620
Let's go.

430
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,300
Qiuzi,

431
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,580
your blind date

432
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,260
seems to be rich.

433
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,820
According to my mother,

434
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,540
he's from a rich family.

435
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,100
(East Sea)

436
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,380
She hasn't come in time.

437
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,820
She's late. I should go.

438
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,300
If you want an investment in your bar,

439
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,580
sit down here.

440
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,900
Get up.

441
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,060
Mr. Han, your guests are here.

442
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,140
Be seated, please.

443
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,980
- Go.
- Come on, Xiaomeng. Take this seat.

444
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,140
Hello, Miss Wei. I'm Lu Linjia.

445
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,260
This is my neph...

446
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,580
This is Han Ting, my immediate family.

447
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,300
Hello. I'm Wei Qiuzi.

448
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,380
This is my good friend Tu Xiaomeng.

449
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,900
Be seated, please.

450
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,060
A friend of ours is stuck in traffic.

451
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,340
She'll be late. Sorry.

452
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,180
No worries.

453
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,540
Have some tea.

454
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,820
No tips. Just give me a like.

455
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,060
You're Smart Lemon, right??

456
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,980
Yes, it's me.

457
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,500
You watched my live streaming?

458
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,340
Of course, I did.

459
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,820
I wondered why you looked familiar.

460
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,540
Small world there.

461
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,900
Yeah. Umm...

462
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,340
OK.

463
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,260
Let me introduce myself.

464
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,540
I'm 22 years old.

465
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,540
I just graduated from college.

466
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,500
I like to play games.

467
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,500
Sorry, I have to take this.

468
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,540
You guys talk.

469
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,300
(Xing, Lemon, Li, and Qiuzi)
Xing, where are you?

470
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,740
(Ji Xing)
I'm stuck in traffic.

471
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,620
But I'll be right there.

472
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,500
So, Mr. Lu,

473
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,540
you watched Xiaomeng's live streaming?

474
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,500
Then did you boost the popularity

475
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,540
for her?

476
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,060
I just watched casually.

477
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,740
What is your screen name?

478
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,820
If you're my fan,

479
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,140
I think I'm impressed.

480
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,540
You're popular.

481
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,700
I wouldn't impress you.

482
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,740
Don't say that.

483
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,140
Have you ever ordered a song?

484
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,860
Which song do you think I sing best?

485
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,340
All the songs.

486
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,060
Such a casual answer.

487
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,140
Name one.

488
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,620
Always Flattery.

489
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,220
I've never sung that before.

490
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,180
With You.

491
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,260
The song you sang last time,

492
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,100
right?

493
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,700
Right.

494
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,780
I did sing this song.

495
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,340
In a PK game

496
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,980
for Snow White's Poison Apple

497
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,300
and her Mr. Lu.

498
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,780
Mr. Lu?

499
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,230
- I'll go rush the dishes.
- Mr. Lu!

500
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,060
Lu Linjia.

501
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,620
Mr. Lu.

502
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,260
So, you turn out to be

503
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,380
the rich idiot

504
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,300
who bullied me

505
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,300
with Poison Apple!

506
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,460
What are you talking about?

507
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,140
Snow White is a kind girl.

508
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,500
Do you know how pitiful she is?

509
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,780
Pitiful?

510
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,540
Are you blind?

511
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
Can't you see?

512
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,100
- You sing so poorly.
- Come on, Xiaomeng.

513
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,940
Mr. Lu, how about this?

514
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,860
Let's invite Snow White

515
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,460
to karaoke

516
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,620
and sing together, OK?

517
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,460
- No way.
- No way.

518
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,420
Xiaomeng.

519
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,540
You're right.

520
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,540
Your cousin kept herself busy.

521
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,100
Since you proposed 3D medical printing

522
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,140
at the last board meeting,

523
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,060
she's been frequently contacting

524
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,540
similar companies

525
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,940
in the name of Dongyang Technology.

526
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,820
Did she also tell others

527
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,300
she wanted to help her cousin

528
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,540
because he wanted to upgrade

529
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,940
the techniques?

530
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,860
Yes. You're blood-related, indeed.

531
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,860
You guessed this right.

532
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,140
Shall we take precautions?

533
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,300
If she invests in a good company,

534
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,300
it will stand

535
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,460
in the way of Hanhai.

536
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,140
If she gets a company,

537
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,500
whatever it is,

538
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,060
ruin it.

539
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,300
Qiuzi, I've arrived.

540
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,820
East Sea Room, huh?

541
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,780
(Why can I meet him everywhere?)

542
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,980
Hi, Mr. Han.

543
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,620
What a coincidence, Miss Ji!

544
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,620
Here for lunch?

545
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,820
I'll see an investor.

546
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,060
Impressive.

547
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,540
You can see an investor so soon.

548
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,780
It's an angel investor.

549
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,980
He reviewed my business proposal

550
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,260
and invited me to talk in detail.

551
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,020
I won't bother you, then.

552
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,300
- I should go.
- OK.

553
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,180
(East Sea)

554
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,700
Mr. Han, how about you go first?

555
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,180
OK.

556
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,060
Xing,

557
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,380
come in here.

558
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,620
Here.

559
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,820
Come in.

560
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,220
This is my good friend Ji Xing.

561
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,540
She's been busy with her startup.

562
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,540
So, she's late.

563
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,740
Oh, I see.

564
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,140
I thought Miss Ji

565
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,980
was here for some investor.

566
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,180
That's right.

567
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,300
Her company

568
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,620
is getting financing.

569
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,700
Yeah, Mr. Han.

570
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,700
I hear you're an investor.

571
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,380
Will you consider

572
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,580
investing in a medical startup?

573
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,700
How about you get to know

574
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,780
about Xing's company?

575
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,060
Yeah. Xing is very capable.

576
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,140
No, no.

577
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,300
Don't bother.

578
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,460
You have waited for a long time.

579
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,260
You must be hungry. How about we eat?

580
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,500
Looks like Miss Ji has got financing.

581
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,540
Not yet.

582
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,780
No investors put money on her.

583
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,980
Why did you kick me?

584
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,540
Don't be ashamed.

585
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,620
I thought

586
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,220
Miss Ji would sign a contract.

587
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,140
The investors she talked to

588
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,780
are very unreliable.

589
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,860
Unreliable?

590
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,020
Yeah.

591
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,020
They paint a rose picture

592
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,380
instead of investing.

593
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,620
Another one is worse.

594
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,780
- He wanted
- Tu Xiaomeng.

595
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,140
to recruit her with a high offer.

596
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,100
In the words of Xing,

597
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,140
he's extremely tricky.

598
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,060
Right?

599
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,140
Extremely tricky.

600
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,100
Miss Ji, are you OK?

601
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,500
If you need anything,

602
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,060
why don't you talk to me?

603
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,900
Yes.

604
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,300
Mr. Han is quite active.

605
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,540
How about you add each other on WeChat?

606
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,460
Don't bother.

607
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,460
No bother.

608
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,620
Scan him.

609
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,380
Keep in touch with him.

610
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,980
Thanks, Mr. Han.

611
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,900
You're welcome.

612
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,260
Your phone is crooked.

613
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,260
Can you scan it?

614
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,220
Yes.

615
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,860
Xing, give your phone number

616
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,060
to Mr. Han.

617
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,060
(Ji Xing)
Thanks!

618
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,060
(Han Ting)
Not at all. My offer is still valid.

619
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,780
Mr. Han, when you have time,

620
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,340
why don't you visit Xing's company?

621
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,780
It's really nice there.

622
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,500
Why don't we talk about you, Qiuzi?

623
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,780
You're the star of today.

624
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,380
That's not true.

625
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,820
We just get to know each other

626
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,740
and make friends.

627
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,500
- (Who wants that?)
- (Who wants that?)

628
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,540
OK.

629
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,820
Come on. Enjoy the food.

630
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,620
Miss Ji, you must be hungry.

631
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,620
Here. Have a crab.

632
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,940
I'm no longer hungry.

633
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,060
Thank you for the meal.

634
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,900
My pleasure.

635
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,100
It's hard to get a taxi here.

636
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,060
Let me drive you.

637
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,820
Can it hold the three of us?

638
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,340
Mr. Han, remember to keep in touch

639
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,180
with Xing.

640
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,820
Why are you walking so fast?

641
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,220
It's such a great chance of financing.

642
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,540
Ting,

643
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,140
do you have some feelings

644
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,100
for Ji Xing?

645
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,100
Don't deny it.

646
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,700
It's your blind date.

647
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,540
Wei Qiuzi and I

648
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,940
aren't right for each other, obviously.

649
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,060
But you...

650
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,260
You and Ji Xing

651
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,260
stand a chance.

652
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,460
Come on, Ting.

653
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,260
Do you still want the bar?

654
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,060
Yes. Yes, of course.

655
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,220
I behaved very well today.

656
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,140
Don't go back on your word.

657
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,780
Email me the proposal soon.

658
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,820
OK.

659
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:16,900
No problem.

660
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,460
I'd like to thank you, guys.

661
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,060
You complained so wrongly.

662
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,380
So, so wrongly.

663
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,580
What do you mean?

664
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,540
Do you know

665
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,540
who Mr. Han is?

666
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,780
Isn't he Lu Linjia's family?

667
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,860
He looks like Lu Linjia's brother.

668
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,580
He's the major investor in Guanghua

669
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,380
who tried to recruit us.

670
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,540
He can't be your boss

671
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,380
and schoolmate in college

672
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,060
who kicked you out of dinner, huh?

673
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,620
He was pretending

674
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,380
quite perfectly.

675
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,780
I didn't see you through at all.

676
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,300
So scheming.

677
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,580
No wonder Xing said he was tricky.

678
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,060
Sorry, sweetheart.

679
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,380
I can imagine

680
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,860
how embarrassed

681
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,260
you were there.

682
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,380
Even worse.

683
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,220
I was extremely embarrassed.

684
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,500
I kept saying,

685
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,020
"Don't bother."

686
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,500
But you still pushed me out.

687
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,980
Come on. I thought

688
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,860
you were just being polite.

689
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,820
I wondered why you did that

690
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,820
to a close friend like me.

691
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,060
Why was I being polite?

692
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,340
I kicked you and even hit you.

693
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,540
I coughed so hard.

694
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,220
I didn't even cough like that when I was sick.

695
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,060
You got no hints.

696
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,100
We no longer know each other.

697
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,300
Come on, we...

698
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,620
I got it wrong.

699
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,460
And you.

700
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,020
It's OK he's on my WeChat.

701
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,620
You even asked me to give him my phone number.

702
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,540
If it weren't for you,

703
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,700
I would have left.

704
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,820
I was so embarrassed.

705
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,380
But anyway,

706
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,140
you asked for a receipt

707
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,260
in front of your blind date.

708
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,300
So, you don't like him, huh?

709
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,700
Sir, do you want the receipt?

710
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,540
No.

711
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,940
Excuse me.

712
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,300
May I have the receipt?

713
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,220
Of course.

714
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,540
Thank you.

715
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,260
It's normal that she doesn't like him.

716
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,860
You know what?
Lu Linjia is the top-tipping of my rival.

717
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,740
I hate him so much, you know?

718
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,060
He has a problem with his eyes

719
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,860
by supporting Poison Apple.

720
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,820
Qiuzi must not adore a blind guy.

721
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,060
He and I aren't right for each other.

722
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,060
Before, Li Li asked us

723
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,380
for some receipts.

724
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,020
So, I asked for it.

725
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,260
- Good friend.
- Good friend.

726
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,300
Qiuzi.

727
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,300
What kind of boy do you like?

728
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,500
Tell us about it.

729
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,140
Me?

730
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,220
If I have to say,

731
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,700
he should be

732
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,740
gentle,

733
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,460
thin, tall,

734
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,620
and elegant.

735
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,300
He doesn't need to be very rich.

736
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,380
He can be peaceful and stable.

737
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,740
Oh, it'd be better if he could cook.

738
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,020
Isn't that just Shao Yichen?

739
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,020
You have to line up, then.

740
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,940
Last time, I asked Xing

741
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,500
to introduce Shao Yichen's cousin to me.

742
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,060
- Right?
- When?

743
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,380
Hey, how could you break your word?

744
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,700
When we had dinner together,

745
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,020
you said he had a cousin.

746
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,740
I did? I don't remember.

747
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,100
How could you not remember?

748
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,380
You promised.

749
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,540
Xia, email me the 3D model

750
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,380
you modified yesterday.

751
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,780
OK. I'm on it.

752
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,580
Shang, you still get

753
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,740
a wrong porosity.

754
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,700
Take some reference

755
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,540
from what I emailed you.

756
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,980
OK.

757
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,340
Xing, yesterday,

758
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,140
you shared some investors to me.

759
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,060
I showed them our proposal

760
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,780
and they were satisfied.

761
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,780
But hearing

762
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,940
we didn't have an analog product,

763
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,300
they replied nothing more.

764
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,860
OK. I get it.

765
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,500
You've been having a hard time.

766
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,500
Through continuous tests,

767
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,700
our models have been improving

768
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,340
with more accurate date.

769
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,060
We'll have to work harder

770
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,940
to make the analog product

771
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,140
as soon as possible.

772
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,340
OK.

773
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,020
- No problem.
- OK. Let's work hard.

774
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,100
Mr. Su, the information you asked for.

775
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,220
OK.

776
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,380
I'll do a translation of it.

777
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,580
Excuse me. Is this Xingchen Technology?

778
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,380
Yichen?

779
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,860
Yichen?

780
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,220
Yichen.

781
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,700
What are you doing here?

782
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,260
To bring you some energy.

783
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,300
Oh, let me introduce him.

784
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,980
This is Shao Yichen, my boyfriend.

785
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,380
Nice to meet you.

786
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,580
This is Xia and this is Shang.

787
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,780
You haven't had lunch, huh?

788
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,500
Zhizhou, share the food.

789
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,340
OK.

790
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,060
Thank you, Yichen.

791
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,660
Why do you not work today?

792
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,220
I'm on annual leave these days.

793
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,540
I'm here to watch you have meals.

794
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,220
- Thanks.
- Thanks to Miss Ji.

795
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,700
I wondered why Miss Ji

796
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,060
seemed to have endless strength.

797
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,220
So, on the home front,

798
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,020
someone recharges her.

799
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,540
It works better than inspirations.

800
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,220
Come on. Eat quickly.

801
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,180
You have work to do.

802
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,420
Xing, this is yours.

803
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,940
Remember.

804
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,020
Eat before you work.

805
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,260
OK.

806
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,380
Come on. Eat with me.

807
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,060
No. I had lunch.

808
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,060
Don't bother.

809
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,220
I'll sit over there.

810
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,620
You focus on your work.

811
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,660
When you get off work,

812
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,740
we'll go home together.

813
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,180
Fine. Make yourself at home.

814
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,340
Water is there.

815
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,700
And there...

816
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,860
Come on. No worries. Just eat.

817
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,260
OK.

818
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,300
(Yichen,)

819
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,260
(I love this city.)

820
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,740
(I believe through our efforts,)

821
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,820
(one of the millions of the lights)

822
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,140
(in this city)

823
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,340
(will be ours.)

824
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,380
(Xing,)

825
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,020
(am I still in your future plan?)

826
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,420
Xing,

827
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,940
our fourth anniversary

828
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,500
will be four days away.

829
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,100
Shall we celebrate it?

830
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,340
We've arrived?

831
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,620
Yes.

832
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,620
Why was I asleep?

833
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,380
You've been too tired.

834
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,980
Come on. I'll walk you up.

835
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,820
No need.

836
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,940
Today,

837
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,780
you spent the whole day with me.

838
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,620
It must be tiring.

839
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,820
Go home and take some rest.

840
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,780
I'm going up to look things up.

841
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,460
I won't leave before you're home.

842
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,340
Take some rest.

843
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,980
I should go.

844
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,500
Oh, I almost forgot.

845
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,100
You like operas, don't you?

846
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,340
I bought two opera tickets.

847
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,500
Let's watch it

848
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,060
to celebrate our fourth anniversary.

849
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,380
(Don't Be Afraid of the Wind)

850
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,260
OK. I'll come and pick you up.

851
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,260
You keep the tickets.

852
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,740
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

853
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,980
Hello, sweethearts.

854
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,660
(Smart Lemon)
Beautiful girls look the same.

855
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,300
But I'm always the special one.

856
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,980
This is Smart Lemon.

857
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,740
Welcome to my live room.

858
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,300
(Smart Lemon)

859
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,100
Hello, guys. I'm here for a visit.

860
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,460
Smart Lemon, hi.

861
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,540
Why is it Mr. Lu again?

862
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,980
Oh, no. Is he here to make trouble?

863
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,100
Lu, don't waste your trip here.

864
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,180
Give some gifts.

865
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,060
I'm not here to make trouble

866
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,680
or give any gifts.

867
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,940
I just came to see

868
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,060
who lost to Snow White.

869
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,900
I thought something just

870
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,060
came into my live room.

871
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,140
But never mind.

872
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,940
A fly or a mosquito, perhaps.

873
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,460
It doesn't matter

874
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,740
when you lost to Snow White.

875
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,900
But why do you have poor eyesight, too?

876
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,580
How pitiful!

877
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,940
(Pomegranate: Don't be so mean. Give a gift.)

878
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,420
Focus on your own live streamer.

879
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,420
I've expelled

880
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,940
the fly.

881
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,500
Well, next,

882
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,460
let's cheer up

883
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,060
and enjoy a beautiful song.

884
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,300
The first analog product

885
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,940
of our company

886
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,460
has finally been completed!

887
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,660
Miss Ji, the analog product is done.

888
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,060
Shall we buy a printer

889
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,740
and test the product?

890
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,340
Yeah. Let's strike while the iron is hot.

891
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,660
Don't worry. The printer will be here soon.

892
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,460
Next,

893
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,500
Zhizhou and I will do the finishing work.

894
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,340
You've worked non-stop these days.

895
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,340
You'll have three days off.

896
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,900
- Thank you, Miss Ji.
- Thanks, Miss Ji.

897
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:09,980
- Nice.
- Awesome.

898
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,820
Let's have a hotpot for dinner.

899
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,980
We should go, Miss Ji.

900
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,140
Bye-bye.

901
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,060
I haven't had a hotpot for long.

902
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,420
We can also go to the karaoke.

903
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,340
Will you pay?

904
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,540
I... Umm...

905
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,620
Fine. I'll pay.

906
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,740
Let's go.

907
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,260
Xing,

908
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,580
Xia asked me

909
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,980
many times about the printer.

910
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,500
Now, we've made

911
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,460
the analog product.

912
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,460
But if we still don't

913
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,300
get a printer,

914
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,340
we'll have to pause.

915
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,460
I know.

916
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,860
But a printer costs millions.

917
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,820
We can't afford one at all.

918
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,900
Luckily, our analog product

919
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,900
has been done.

920
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,740
It may make our financing easier.

921
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,820
How about

922
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,740
we rent a printer?

923
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,580
Rent?

924
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,540
Isn't that risky?

925
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,780
We can ask about it

926
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,060
on the market.

927
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,340
Let's see which companies

928
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,660
have spare printers.

929
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,900
We can rent one

930
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,740
to test the product first.

931
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,420
If we manage

932
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,740
to make a physical cage,

933
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,300
the financing will be easier.

934
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,260
OK.

935
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,660
I'll talk to those companies

936
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,300
that I contacted.

937
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,300
OK. I'll consult my familiar companies, too.

938
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,340
No problem. Keep each other informed.

939
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,180
Sure.

940
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:09,640
♪Once again, you stand opposite me♪

941
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:16,540
♪Telling the worlds I'm not familiar with♪

942
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:23,960

00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:29,730
