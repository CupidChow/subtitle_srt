1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,560
I will go to the heaven and earth

2
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,040
I will never hesitate to give up my future

3
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,200
I will go to the heaven and earth

4
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,200
I will never give up my future

5
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:33,760
I will go to the heaven and earth

6
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:11,760
I will go to the heaven and earth

7
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,360
When the sea is strong enough

8
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,400
Will you swallow the stars?

9
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,000
Stars want to go their own way

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But will there be no way to go?

11
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Hanning invested in Hanhai in Germany

12
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,200
She just returned to China and followed the rules

13
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,200
Han Yuan had a way to stop Hanhai from entering the East

14
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
So she made a military order

15
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
She took the time to reform the East

16
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,200
She was prepared for Hanhai to enter the East

17
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,200
As for the formation

18
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,200
It's just a smoke bomb that comes from the eye

19
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Okay

20
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,200

Xin Xin...

24
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,680
It might not be a good idea

25
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,280
but I still trust you now

26
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,200

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,380
Who is it?

117
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,240
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,400
Let's talk here.

119
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Okay.

120
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
The problem is

121
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,280
I think

122
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,400
nothing

123
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,400
is serious.

124
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,860
This family

125
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,280
has enemies.

126
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,200
We want to

127
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,220
win first class.

128
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,200
Give it to you.

129
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,520
We've made a decision.

130
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,400
Do you have any ideas?

131
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,800
Shouldn't we

132
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,560
consider Dong Yi first?

133
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,480
Not necessarily.

134
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,760
After the financing,

135
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,000
we'll be in a good mood

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,120
with Dong Yi.

137
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,640
If we invest in foreign companies,

138
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
we'll have to

139
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,000
keep the decision-making

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,200
as long as we can

141
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,440
make a profit

142
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,960
in the exchange of shares.

143
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,240
But if Dong Yi is still there,

144
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,760
we might...

145
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,880
We might be completely failed.

146
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,440
I think

147
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,880
we should consider

148
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,800
the relationship between Xing and Mr. Han.

149
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,120
It's not a big deal.

150
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,160
Love is love.

151
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,520
Business is business.

152
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,960
Xing,

153
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,240
we just

154
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,200
give you a reference.

155
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,880
You can make a decision as soon as you can.

156
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,600
I'll think about it.

157
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,400
Okay.

158
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,600
I'll get back to work.

159
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,440
What's wrong?

160
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,400
Can't stop.

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,040
I'm all right.

162
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:52,720
My blood clot has been a 💡

163
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,360
a � sanitizer?

164
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,240
Pardon?

165
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,880
Come.

166
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,480
Boss,

167
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,400
I don't want to be with you.

168
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,640
She's leaving first.

169
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
When the sea is strong enough,

170
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,280
will you be able to

171
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
swallow the stars?

172
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Stars are the way to go.

173
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,280
But will you be able to go without a road?

174
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,280
The market needs the sea.

175
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,280
And the stars need the stars.

176
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
No need to compare.

177
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Han Ting.

178
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
Han Ting.

179
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Do you love me?

180
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
How can I love you?

181
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
You want to die for me.

182
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Without me, the world is just him.

183
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
This is not the love I understand.

184
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,320
What is the love you understand?

185
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
First of all, it's the right thing to do.

186
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Xin Xin.

187
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
The right thing to do is not a word that can be used.

188
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
There are not many high-ranking doctors.

189
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
It's hard to find a suitable person.

190
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Why did you call me so early?

191
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
What's the matter?

192
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
The water is boiled.

193
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
Don't you want to make tea?

194
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
She knows.

195
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Who?

196
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Ji Xing.

197
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
Ji Xing.

198
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
You finally told her.

199
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
You don't have to be afraid of Han anymore.

200
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
She knows from other places.

201
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
It's not what I said.

202
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
What did she say?

203
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Where is she?

204
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Go to the same class to talk about A-Learn.

205
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Chang He?

206
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
Then why don't you stop her?

207
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
She is now on the stage.

208
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
It's useless to talk to her about anything.

209
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Have you made up your mind?

210
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
Yes.

211
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
This time, Tong Ge invested in Xing Chen.

212
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
I will use the third part of the contract.

213
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
I will use the third part of the contract.

214
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
I will use the third part of the contract.

215
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
The third part of the investment company won't be closed.

216
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,360
This way, it will ensure that the board of directors

217
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
will be able to pass the winter meeting smoothly.

218
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
Please rest assured, Mr. Ji.

219
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
Can it be as fast as possible?

220
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Of course.

221
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
Okay.

222
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,360
Boss, Mr. Ji has already talked to A-Learn's investment company

223
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
about the contract.

224
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Do you want to talk about it with A-Learn?

225
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
No need.

226
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Just take the board of directors.

227
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Okay.

228
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Congratulations, Mr. Chang.

229
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
You have entered the stock market.

230
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

231
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,440
If Mr. Yuan didn't help the board of directors,

232
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,440
the financing plan wouldn't have been passed smoothly.

233
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
Mr. Chang,

234
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
this has nothing to do with me.

235
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
Mr. Yuan, don't worry.

236
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
It will definitely help.

237
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
When the board of directors will find

238
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,440
that Tong Ge and A-Learn are in the same department,

239
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
they will be able to pass the winter meeting smoothly.

240
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
When the board of directors will find

241
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
that Tong Ge

242
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,480
has invested in the third-party company of Xing Chen

243
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,480
and became the shareholder of Xing Chen,

244
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
and entered the investment market with Dong Yi,

245
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
I will see how he will talk to the board of directors.

246
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,480
Mr. Yuan, you are amazing.

247
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,480
Even if Han Ting completes the military order,

248
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
the board of directors will definitely be responsible.

249
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
Mr. Yuan, you can take the board of directors smoothly

250
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
and take back Dong Yi's money.

251
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,520
But Han Ting is always the first to take the third step

252
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,520
in doing things.

253
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,520
This time, the financing decision meeting,

254
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,520
he invested in the third-party company so quickly.

255
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
I am worried that he might have a problem.

256
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,520
This time, I used the third-party company.

257
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,520
He doesn't know that the bottom line is normal.

258
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Even if he knows,

259
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,520
he can't make the decision of the board of directors.

260
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
Don't worry, Mr. Yuan.

261
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Why are you back?

262
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
I will stay with you for two days.

263
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
I am not welcome.

264
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
Welcome? I am so welcome.

265
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
You are not here for a while. I miss you.

266
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
I have a table to eat and a soup. Have some.

267
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,560
I want to drink. I want to have a drink.

268
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,560
Okay, you can sleep.

269
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,560
When you are awake,

270
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,560
I will go to the bathroom.

271
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,560
I will be back.

272
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,560
I will be back.

273
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
I will be back.

274
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Look, it is very beautiful.

275
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
When you are awake,

276
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
we will have a big dinner.

277
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,560
Researches are given to such generous workers from 10 colleges.

278
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,380
These are not Land.

279
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,980
The Story of Xiao Xiao

280
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,980
Episode 1

281
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,180
The Story of Xiao Xiao

282
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,380
Episode 1

283
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,180
The Story of Xiao Xiao

284
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,380
Episode 1

285
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,980
The Story of Xiao Xiao

286
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,980
I will re-select the sales goals for next month.

287
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,780
Okay.

288
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,980
Then, let's do this today.

289
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,580
Sister Xing,

290
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,180
the A-minor has passed the board meeting.

291
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,180
You can take the next step.

292
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,780
Okay. I will make the arrangements.

293
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,980
Okay. I will go back to work.

294
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,580
Did something happen to Rongze?

295
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,580
Nothing serious. He is very successful. Don't worry.

296
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,180
I think you are always worried about nothing these days.

297
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,180
Did something happen to you?

298
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,580
No. Don't worry about me.

299
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,580
It's really nothing.

300
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,180
Tonight, I and the department head Ma

301
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,980
have an appointment to eat at the New Year's Day. Are you going?

302
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,180
I have some other things to do later.

303
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,380
You go. I won't go.

304
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,780
Okay. Then I will go with Zhizhou.

305
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,780
You can just rely on yourself.

306
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,780
What about us?

307
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,180
Nothing.

308
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,980
Congratulations on getting the shares of Xing Chen.

309
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,980
President Chang indeed said yes.

310
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,980
This is your first gift from me.

311
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,580
Thank you.

312
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,380
Next, how are you going to deal with Xing Chen?

313
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,980
Take a look.

314
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,180
Thank you.

315
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,780
What do you mean?

316
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,780
President Han.

317
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,180
You are looking for me in such a hurry? What is it?

318
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,380
President Chang, you should know very well.

319
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,580
I have a lot of things in my mind.

320
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,580
It's not that I can think of it clearly in every matter.

321
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,180
President Han, you have so many things.

322
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,180
I want to take your hand to throw the silk horse.

323
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:40,180
Who else knows your heart?

324
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,180
I will go with you.

325
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,580
President Han used all the luxurious shares in your hand

326
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,980
to exchange for the shares of Xing Chen that I have.

327
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,380
It seems that President Han really likes Xing Chen.

328
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,180
Do you want to exchange or not?

329
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,380
President Han's sincerity is very admirable.

330
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,580
But I don't know if President Ji Xing and President Ji will be happy.

331
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,580
That's not what you should worry about.

332
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,380
Han Ting got all the shares in the luxury shares to exchange for me.

333
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,580
I can't refuse her.

334
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,180
So, the luxury shares in her eyes

335
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,180
are like garbage.

336
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,180
It's a waste of time.

337
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,780
But Tong Ke

338
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,180
has taken the luxury shares as a treasure.

339
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,180
Xiaobai is very important.

340
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,780
But what I am more concerned about is

341
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,180
that you and Han Ting don't have any relationship.

342
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,180
He must be thinking the same way.

343
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,780
President Chang, don't worry.

344
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,580
From today on,

345
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,580
the same thing between Guanghua and Tong Ke is the real alliance.

346
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,380
Thank you for your support for Xing Chen.

347
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,180
Xing Chen has been able to walk to this day

348
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,780
and thanks to the quality material that Ke Bo provided us.

349
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,980
You're so polite.

350
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,780
You've developed a good quality product.

351
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,980
My material is just a piece of cake.

352
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,580
I want to thank you for taking care of Ke Bo's business.

353
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,980
Here, I toast to President Su and President Li.

354
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,180
President Ma, I'm a technical person.

355
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,580
So I'm very clear.

356
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,580
It's because your quality material is good.

357
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,580
So our product development can be done so smoothly.

358
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,580
I should toast to you for this.

359
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,580
I hope our cooperation will be more smooth in the future.

360
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,180
Okay.

361
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,580
Cheers.

362
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,380
Cheers.

363
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,580
Here.

364
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,380
President Ma.

365
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,380
Sorry to bother you.

366
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,580
President Xiao is here.

367
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,180
Everyone is here today.

368
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,780
Here, I toast to you.

369
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,780
Okay.

370
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,180
President Li, you don't need to drink if you don't have a good stomach.

371
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,380
Drink some.

372
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,380
President Li really can't drink.

373
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,980
But to show the sincerity of Xing Chen,

374
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,980
I toast to you for President Li.

375
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,980
I have something to do.

376
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,580
I won't disturb you today.

377
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,980
You eat well and drink well.

378
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,580
I'll drink it today.

379
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,980
Okay, see you.

380
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,580
Here, President Ma.

381
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,380
Let's continue eating.

382
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,980
Okay.

383
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,380
President Su, you've been drinking for so long.

384
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,180
Come on, let's drink.

385
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,780
I dare not.

386
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,380
President Ma, we're very happy that you're here.

387
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,180
Enjoy your meal.

388
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,980
Here.

389
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,380
President Ma, drink it.

390
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,780
Have a taste of this dish.

391
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,780
Here.

392
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,780
Miss.

393
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,780
President Xiao has helped you to avoid the burden.

394
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,380
You don't need to pay for it.

395
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,780
No, I just pay for it.

396
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,780
How much? I'll keep it for you.

397
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,780
I'm sorry.

398
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,780
President Xiao has paid for it.

399
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,780
You can't take your money.

400
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,780
Let me have a look.

401
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,780
Thank you.

402
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,380
Li Li.

403
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,780
I was about to ask you for a favor.

404
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,780
I was about to ask you for a favor.

405
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,220
I just ordered the chef to make you a bowl of

406
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,180
honey milk milk and milk medicine.

407
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,380
I'll send it to you later.

408
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,780
You're not in a good position.

409
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,780
You need to take care of your health.

410
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,980
No need.

411
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,980
I've already transferred the money to you.

412
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,780
I didn't come to Xin Yue today.

413
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,180
I'm here to see President Ma.

414
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,980
I don't want to have any problems with you.

415
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,180
You don't have to do anything for me anymore.

416
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,780
Li Li.

417
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,180
Li Li.

418
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,180
Li Li.

419
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,180
Give me some time.

420
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,180
I really want to talk to you.

421
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,180
There's nothing to talk about between us.

422
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,180
Li Li, listen to me.

423
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,180
Listen to me.

424
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,180
We can try.

425
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,780
Forget it.

426
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,980
You should have said these earlier.

427
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,180
I should have been happy.

428
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,380
But now I understand.

429
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,980
Let's just do it.

430
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,580
It was all my fault.

431
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,380
Don't be angry.

432
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,380
You're...

433
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,580
President Xiao.

434
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,180
It's almost done.

435
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,980
This is what I want to talk to you about.

436
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,780
I hope you don't get involved in any trouble.

437
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,780
Li Li, give me some time.

438
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,380
When will you know what he's going to be?

439
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,980
If you still can't do it this time,

440
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,380
what will he do?

441
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,780
Stop talking.

442
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,580
Li Li.

443
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,980
What's wrong with you?

444
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,580
He's still here.

445
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,380
When will you know what he's going to be?

446
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,380
You used to be

447
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,980
a good and innocent person.

448
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,780
You threw a lot of money at your clients.

449
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,780
But now you're like this.

450
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,580
You really want to be like this

451
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,380
and take your blame for yourself.

452
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,980
My favorite Li Li.

453
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,380
It's not like that.

454
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,380
Li Li.

455
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,980
I...

456
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,980
Xiao Xiao.

457
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,180
He's right.

458
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,980
When you change,

459
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,780
you threw too much money.

460
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,780
Since you have your principles,

461
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,180
you should keep your bottom line.

462
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,380
I don't like you like this.

463
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,780
I can't accept

464
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,780
the kind of self-pity.

465
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,780
That's it for now.

466
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,380
I'm tired.

467
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,580
I'll wash the strawberries.

468
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,980
I'll eat them later.

469
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,780
I've worked with Chang He.

470
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,380
The third-party company of Xing Chen A-Learn.

471
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,180
It's Tong Ke.

472
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,380
I know.

473
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
Aren't you angry?

474
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,780
You want me to be angry?

475
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,780
You don't have anything to say.

476
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,580
You're so annoying.

477
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,580
You shouldn't have told me

478
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,980
why you're doing this.

479
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,180
Tong Ke is my competitor.

480
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,180
What do you want?

481
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,180
Do you care?

482
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,380
You're already in Han Hai.

483
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,180
Is Xing Chen A-Learn important to you?

484
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,980
Or do you think

485
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,380
everything is in control?

486
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,980
Xing Chen A-Learn will not destroy others.

487
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,380
I invest in other companies

488
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,580
to control Han Hai.

489
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,180
Isn't it normal?

490
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,980
Forget about other things.

491
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,180
But Han Hai,

492
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,180
why did you hide it from me?

493
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,780
The company is in danger.

494
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,780
I couldn't tell you before.

495
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,980
Why did you invest in Xing Chen A-Learn?

496
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,380
To find a Yan Wudan to protect Han Hai?

497
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,380
You used to need to be rich.

498
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,180
If it wasn't for me,

499
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,580
would Xing Chen have today?

500
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,380
Xing Chen has your credit.

501
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,380
But I made it.

502
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,980
Design, product,

503
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:51,980
promotion, test,

504
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,980
and collaboration.

505
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,380
I made it myself.

506
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,780
Xing Chen is mine.

507
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,580
He's not yours.

508
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,780
You're not qualified to take it.

509
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,780
What did I do?

510
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,780
Am I interfering in your decision

511
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,780
or did I do something that hurt Xing Chen?

512
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,980
Xing Chen has a good development.

513
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,980
Why did I destroy him?

514
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:14,980
Yes.

515
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,580
You won't want to destroy Xing Chen.

516
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,980
Because he's done well enough.

517
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,980
But if he does better like Han Hai,

518
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,580
you won't let go.

519
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,980
That's why you want to put Xing Chen in Han Hai.

520
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:35,980
Xin Xin,

521
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,380
it's hard to have a company without a background.

522
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,980
Instead of being crushed by the same bank,

523
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,980
it's better to be forced to take the credit.

524
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,980
Xiao Qi wants to become stronger.

525
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,980
The best opportunity

526
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,580
is to stand on the shoulders of the crew and develop quickly.

527
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,980
Han Hai and Xing Chen are all the companies that are together.

528
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,580
Instead of competing with each other,

529
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,180
it's better to have a good balance

530
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,180
and a good chance to choose.

531
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,180
Always work harder than you.

532
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,580
And more important is reality.

533
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,180
So I've realized reality.

534
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,980
I chose to help Tong Ke.

535
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,580
I'm doing this for your benefit.

536
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,580
Shouldn't you show me what I'm capable of?

537
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,380
You can talk about rationality.

538
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,380
I can also talk about my hobby and interests.

539
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,980
I chose my favorite Tong Ke.

540
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,980
You can choose.

541
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,580
Of course, you can have your choice.

542
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,180
First, you have to have your own capital.

543
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,380
Do you have it?

544
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,380
You don't.

545
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,980
I can ban your choice.

546
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,780
Because I have a 33.4 share of my credit.

547
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,580
You're so white-skinned.

548
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,380
It's just that I know I won't make you suffer.

549
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,580
Have you ever thought

550
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,180
that I would be a reporter?

551
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,180
I've lived here for so long.

552
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,180
I've been with you for so long.

553
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,380
I've been through a lot without my credit.

554
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,380
You're so generous.

555
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,380
You'll be my family.

556
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,580
You have to be careful.

557
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,380
Chang He has 30% of his credit.

558
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,380
I'm 53.38% of my credit.

559
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,380
He...

560
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,380
You...

561
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,380
You're competitors in the competition?

562
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,580
I took the money I wanted to pay him back.

563
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,580
I've told you before.

564
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,380
There are no enemies in the mall.

565
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,180
There are no friends in the mall.

566
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,380
There is only a chance to pay him back.

567
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,180
Why did you do that?

568
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,380
If you're just worried that I'll be a star,

569
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,180
can you tell me

570
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,380
if I won't give you our relationship?

571
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,180
What relationship?

572
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,380
What do you regard me as?

573
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,780
A pet?

574
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,980
A toy?

575
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,580
Do you really mean what you said to me?

576
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,380
Or

577
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,980
that's just your good habit.

578
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,380
It's the same for another person.

579
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,380
Do you think I'm a good person?

580
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,380
If you're a good person, I'll beat you up.

581
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,780
You're always wrong.

582
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,980
Why did Tong Ke suffer from star injury?

583
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,780
Have you ever thought about it?

584
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,980
Because they want to unite Han Yuan

585
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,980
and kill me.

586
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,780
Han Yuan is using Star City

587
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,780
to open a mouth to steal Dong Yi.

588
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,380
For the benefit,

589
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,580
they can sell you out.

590
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,980
Do you know that?

591
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,580
You've known Tong Ke would do that.

592
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,380
You even hoped they could succeed.

593
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,580
You're trying to find evidence for Han Yuan

594
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,780
to give Chang He a secret.

595
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,180
You caught him and beat him.

596
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,380
Star City is just like a chess piece to you.

597
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,380
A chess piece?

598
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,380
If it's just a chess piece,

599
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,380
I'll kill myself

600
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,380
and take it back from Tong Ke.

601
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,180
Qingqing.

602
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,780
As long as you want it,

603
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,780
Star City is yours.

604
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,780
It's so scary.

605
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,380
Don't tell me

606
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,780
what the business should do.

607
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,380
Don't use these as an excuse.

608
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,780
I think you're just a hypocrite.

609
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,780
You're cold-hearted and ungrateful.

610
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,780
You're heartless.

611
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,380
Don't touch me, Qingqing!

612
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:51,180
We were so happy together.

613
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,380
You gave me a life.

614
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,380
You gave me a position.

615
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,580
You changed the door of your house

616
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,380
into my birthday.

617
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,380
You took me to see your family.

618
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,780
I...

619
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,380
You...

620
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,180
I thought you liked me

621
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,780
and I would like you.

622
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,780
I didn't like you!

623
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,580
You do like you.

624
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,980
You're a liar.

625
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,980
You're good to me.

626
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,380
It's just because I'm a hypocrite.

627
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,380
Liar!

628
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,380
Listen to me.

629
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,180
Don't come over here.

630
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,980
Listen to me, Qi Xing.

631
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,780
I don't want to see you.

632
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,780
I don't want to see you.

633
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,980
Don't touch me.

634
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,380
You're so terrible.

635
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,180
You're so terrible.

636
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:38,380
Streamers foratisfied people

637
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:42,780
wrap up in silence

638
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,980
on the official online media.

639
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,580
Don't go on a radio.

640
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,380
Don't go out.

641
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,100
Previous Spac offices

642
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,780
wereесure

643
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,580
namelessly crashed around

644
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,380
They reached a lot of good news

645
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,340
to reflect on it.

646
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,900
The East Asia Medical Center is on the rise.

647
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,700
The price is rising.

648
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,220
The East Asia Medical Center is developing

649
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,540
a three-year medical industry

650
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,900
that invests in new companies

651
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,940
and new subjects.

652
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,340
The East Asia Medical Center is controlling

653
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,180
the five-year long-term medical industry,

654
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,100
Hanhai Technology.

655
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,060
The business map is expanding.

656
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,380
The new product will be launched

657
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,700
in Hanhai.

658
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,180
Mr. Chen, long time no see.

659
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:24,940
Yes.

660
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,140
But we will meet often in the future.

661
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,140
I am looking forward

662
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,940
to working with Mr. Ji.

663
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,100
Actually, Xing Chen has always

664
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,820
treated Hanhai

665
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,140
as the most powerful competitor.

666
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,940
But I didn't expect

667
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,540
we are a family.

668
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,460
Did Mr. Chen know about it?

669
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,740
Mr. Ji,

670
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,700
I didn't do it because

671
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,580
we are in the same investment group

672
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,180
and I want to talk to you about something.

673
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,980
I really appreciate

674
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,740
Xing Chen's product and business culture.

675
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,060
I admire Mr. Ji very much.

676
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,900
You said that

677
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,060
you want to work hard for this industry

678
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,820
and change the life of ordinary people.

679
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,420
I remember it deeply.

680
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,100
Thank you.

681
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,420
Actually, I want to talk to you about

682
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,420
what happened between Hanhai and Xing Chen.

683
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,100
Why didn't you directly talk to Mr. Han?

684
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,460
You are in charge of this.

685
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,700
I want to talk to you about the conditions first.

686
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,300
So that you can rest in peace.

687
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,820
I understand.

688
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,420
Actually,

689
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,940
I first mentioned to Mr. Han

690
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,660
that Xing Chen was in Hanhai's mind.

691
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,340
But Mr. Han rejected it.

692
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,660
Then, Mr. Han mentioned the disease.

693
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,060
He emphasized that

694
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,500
Hanhai and Xing Chen are not ill,

695
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,940
but have a chance to cooperate.

696
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,580
If Mr. Ji has any conditions,

697
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,820
you can say it.

698
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,380
I will answer to Mr. Han.

699
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,380
I have two options.
