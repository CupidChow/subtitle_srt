You leave us.

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,280
I heard Ji Xing's printer

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,120
had a failure.

26
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,040
Will you not help?

27
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,000
I won't. I trust her.

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,790
How much stock

29
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,120
do those directors hold?

30
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,200
About 3%.

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,950
Why did you suddenly ask me

32
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,710
to buy fractional shares of Dongyang Medical?

33
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,750
Since I fired Han Yuan's trusted followers

34
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,800
and took over the HR of Dongyang Medical,

35
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,750
she's been unconvinced.

36
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,310
The directors suddenly questioned

37
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,870
my investment in Xingchen

38
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,120
and she must have agitated them.

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,630
Buying the fractional shares

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,200
is just my precaution.

41
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,870
I don't think

42
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,430
she can threaten you.

43
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,870
Your grandpa has

44
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,520
the absolute power of speech, doesn't he?

45
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,710
I won't want to disturb him.

46
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,840
Don't be too partial to Xingchen.

47
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,310
In case Han Yuan gets something on you.

48
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,240
Instead of hiding,

49
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,920
I would rather

50
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,910
put everything on the surface.

51
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,630
You care so much for Ji Xing.

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,310
I'm kind of jealous.

53
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,750
What is your relationship now?

54
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,310
Seriously, bro?

55
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,800
Still haven't got her?

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,630
Aren't you always decisive?

57
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,750
Go ahead.

58
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,520
She just let go of her ex-boyfriend.

59
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,000
I won't rush anything.

60
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,560
You're really patient.

(3D Print Room)

62
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,680
Hello.

63
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,360
Is the printer fixed?

64
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,120
Beidi's maintenance man

65
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,430
gave us online guidance.

66
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,800
We borrowed a printer

67
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,710
from Nanyou Technology.

68
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,710
Li Li and Su Zhizhou

69
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,960
have landed in Jingxi.

70
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,960
Hopefully,

71
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,000
they can do the printing

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,400
and fly back tomorrow morning.

73
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,710
Where are you now?

74
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,000
In my company.

75
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,270
OK.

76
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,960
Tang Song.

77
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,120
To Laosi Wonton Shop.

78
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,200
OK.

79
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,030
Xing,

80
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,040
do you think we can get through?

81
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,350
Miss Ji!

82
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,640
Miss Ji!

83
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,560
Slowly, slowly. What?

84
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,120
The breakdown has been solved.

85
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,480
Now, the printing has started.

86
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,750
I knew you could do it.

87
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,790
Good.

88
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,400
Miss Ji.

89
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,750
Mr. Han bought you some food.

90
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,760
Hi, Mr. Han.

91
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,510
Come and enjoy the food.

92
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,400
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

93
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,590
This is yours.

94
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,190
Thank you.

95
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,560
Tell me.

96
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,830
Even Mr. Han is aware of this.

97
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,390
Will I be fired?

98
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,040
We've worked for Miss Ji

99
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,120
for such a long time.

100
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,510
She has the most human touch.

101
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,750
When she's here, you won't be fired.

102
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,000
The point is

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,510
I made such a big mistake.

104
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,190
If I'm fired,

105
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,750
I'll accept it.

106
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,040
But Xingchen has a good prospect

107
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,000
and a nice atmosphere.

108
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,240
I don't want to stop writing codes.

109
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,240
I really don't want to leave.

110
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,160
Don't think that much.

111
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,720
What you can do now

112
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,630
is fill your belly

113
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,430
and then concentrate on your work.

114
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,270
Besides,

115
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,360
when the sample is properly printed,

116
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,750
even if you're held accountable,

117
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,160
the punishment won't be severe.

118
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,150
Not enough?

119
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,000
Here.

120
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,920
- One more, please.
- OK.

121
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,380
(Laosi Wonton)

122
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,040
Thank you, Mr. Han, for the food.

123
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,360
The wonton tastes great.

124
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,830
You borrowed a printer, didn't you?

125
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,160
Just to have a plan B.

126
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,830
Li Li is printing the sample there.

127
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,120
If there's an accident,

128
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,390
we won't

129
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,520
have wasted our time

130
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,950
waiting for nothing.

131
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,720
The boss of Xingchen

132
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,310
fixes the printer in the lab

133
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,120
with her employees in the middle of the night.

134
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,070
Quite a weird story.

135
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,830
I don't think so.

136
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,920
As far as I see,

137
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
in such a crisis,

138
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,190
the boss should stay

139
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,160
with her employees.

140
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,040
And I have Chen Zuo fix the printer

141
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,360
because I don't want him

142
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,510
to be discouraged

143
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,830
for this case.

144
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,510
If he can fix it,

145
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,720
he'll make up for his mistake.

146
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,040
If he can't,

147
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,560
he has at least tried his best.

148
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
Then he'll feel better.

149
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,950
With this lenient management,

150
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,600
can you guarantee

151
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,360
the same problem won't happen again?

152
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,590
Right.

153
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
I can severely punish him

154
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,870
and I can even fire him.

155
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,270
With a warning to others,

156
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,720
I can establish authority and rules.

157
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,430
But I left Guanghua

158
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,750
and established Xingchen

159
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,270
with the hope of building

160
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,310
a different workplace.

161
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,040
I got stuck in trouble.

162
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,750
So, I want to shelter them

163
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,950
within the best I can do.

164
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,160
Everybody makes a mistake.

165
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,800
And he isn't that kind of guy

166
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,000
who never corrects himself.

167
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,600
I believe after going through this,

168
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,750
everybody will be more cautious.

169
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,110
Eat it.

170
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,240
Or it'll get cold.

(Dongyang Group)

172
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,820
(Abnormal feeding, the printing is paused.)

173
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,910
Still can't work.

174
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,200
What do we do?

175
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,720
We can't reach the maintenance man now.

176
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,240
He must be asleep at this time of day.

177
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,000
How's everything going?

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,440
Xing, everything is going smoothly here.

179
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,790
The printing has started.

180
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,630
That's great.

181
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,910
We'll fly back tomorrow morning.

182
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,510
Thank you.

183
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,120
All right. Everything is smooth with Miss Li.

184
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,870
Finish the work and go back home.

185
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,440
Miss Ji,

186
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,200
I want to try again.

187
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,240
I'll stay with you.

188
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,360
OK. Let's continue.

189
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,360
With an abnormal feeding,

190
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,120
there's something wrong with the scraper.

191
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,600
I'll check it immediately.

192
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,720
(I got stuck in trouble.)

193
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,600
(So, I want to shelter them)

194
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,790
(within the best I can do.)

195
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,390
(But besides regulations,)

196
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,600
(we also care for human nature.)

197
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,750
Human nature.

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,670
(Grandpa)
Come home tomorrow morning.

199
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,910
Hey, Xing. The printing is done.

200
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,200
We're on our way to the airport.

201
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,360
OK. We'll wait for you.

202
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,390
Wish you a safe journey.

203
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,560
Bye-bye.

204
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,840
Miss Ji.

205
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,200
Miss Ji.

206
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,080
Why are you here so early?

207
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,720
I can't help worrying.

208
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,120
I guess you haven't had breakfast.

209
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,510
So, I bought some breakfast for you.

210
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,320
Then, I met Youyou at the entrance.

211
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,080
Yeah. Come have breakfast.

212
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,230
Give it to me.

213
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,350
It's for you, Xing.

214
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,350
Miss Ji.

215
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,360
How's it going?

216
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,120
We're still testing it.

217
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,720
Miss Li is on her way back.

218
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,150
The problem will be solved.

219
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,080
Don't worry.

220
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,150
Go get Zuo out.

221
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,480
Ask him to have breakfast first.

222
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,320
OK.

223
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,800
Grandpa.

224
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,440
There you are.

225
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,000
You're busy cleaning up Xingchen's mess.

226
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,120
It's even hard for me

227
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,270
to see you.

228
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,510
Grandpa,

229
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,120
I invested in Xingchen.

230
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,120
When it's in trouble, I should help.

231
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,840
Han Ting.

232
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,720
I handed over Dongyang Medical to you

233
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,960
but it doesn't mean you can do

234
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,120
whatever you want.

235
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,320
Do you know

236
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,240
how many people

237
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,510
are complaining about you?

238
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,150
The flowers and grass in the garden

239
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,840
must be trimmed regularly.

240
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,200
Or weeds will grow all around.

241
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,270
Only when we cut

242
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,390
these unnecessary branches

243
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,960
can the flowers

244
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,840
grow fast.

245
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,670
Running a company is like growing flowers.

246
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,550
Xingchen has a messy administration.

247
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,320
They need a professional manager

248
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,510
to smooth everything there.

249
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,390
With a professional manager,

250
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,750
the core team will be a figurehead.

251
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,910
It'll ruin the meaning of my investment.

252
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,480
Such a clumsy mistake

253
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,750
has also ruined the meaning of your investment.

254
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,910
Grandpa, please wait.

255
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,390
At five, the result of the internal inspection

256
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,230
will come out.

257
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,240
It's not too late

258
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,030
to make a decision after that.

259
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,080
Come on.

260
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,960
You just won't stop until you run into a wall.

261
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,150
If Xingchen fails this time,

262
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,200
either you withdraw from it

263
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,080
or take your cousin's advice

264
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,790
to get a manager for Ji Xing.

265
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,750
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

266
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
If you help her,

267
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,120
I won't accept the result.

268
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,320
I mean what I say.

269
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,750
Passengers to Xinggang, attention, please.

270
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,390
We regret to tell you

271
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,910
the flight you take

272
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,750
will be delayed

273
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,910
due to air traffic control.

274
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,120
The specific take-off time
will be announced later.

275
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,870
Hey, Xing.

276
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,030
There's a delay in our flight

277
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,200
due to air traffic control.

278
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,960
We don't know when it'll take off.

279
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,150
OK. I get it.

280
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,680
Don't worry.

281
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,240
- I'll think of a way.
- OK.

282
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,630
Miss Ji, what's wrong?

283
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,440
Their flight is delayed.

284
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,360
They can't get back in time.

285
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,510
What do we do?

286
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,790
We have to count on our own printer.

287
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,200
Yesterday, the directors
questioned your investment.

288
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,030
I didn't say too much.

289
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,200
We're a family, after all.

290
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,320
I can't appear to be too partial.

291
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,750
But after a problem like this,

292
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,600
shouldn't you be more careful

293
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,840
with the management and investment

294
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,750
in Xingchen?

295
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,500
(Retainer Agreement of Xingchen's Manager)

296
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,790
(Party A: Dongyang Medical
Party B: Liu Zhiling)

297
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,000
Liu Zhiling.

298
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,360
Your assistant?

299
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,910
Now, Xingchen needs

300
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,120
a talent of management.

301
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,000
Liu Zhiling graduated

302
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,990
from an Ivy League university.

303
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,150
He has the knowledge of management

304
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,390
and rich experience.

305
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,960
He also knows very well

306
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
about Dongyang Group.

307
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,270
I think he's the best manager for Xingchen.

308
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,390
It's almost five o'clock.

309
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,240
I know Xingchen

310
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,910
borrowed a printer from Jingxi.

311
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,200
Let's not say

312
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,120
whether the printed sample

313
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,600
can be qualified.

314
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,200
As far as I know,

315
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,390
the weather in Jingxi isn't very good.

316
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,480
The flight from Jingxi to Xinggang is delayed.

317
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,840
The sample hasn't arrived

318
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,600
in Xingchen, has it?

319
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,000
You'd better sign it now
on your own initiative.

320
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,960
Or you'll feel worse

321
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,240
when Grandpa forces you.

322
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,000
You can stand to lose, can't you?

323
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,630
It's not five yet, Yuan.

324
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,840
Don't be anxious.

325
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,300
(Retainer Agreement of Xingchen's Manager)

326
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,510
Mr. Han, I...

327
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,440
Ms. Yuan, I'm here to give the report.

328
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,150
Xingchen's intervertebral cage

329
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,240
has just passed Dongyang's inspection.

330
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,110
This is the report.

331
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,790
The sample can be tested
in the institute tomorrow.

332
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,680
We have to count on our own printer.

333
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,880
Obviously, we can't

334
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,920
really count on it.

335
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:16,950
The...

336
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,400
The scraper is fixed.

337
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,000
The printing restarted.

338
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,110
Really?

339
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,830
It won't stop halfway again, will it?

340
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,350
I'm sure it won't.

341
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,510
How did you make it?

342
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,830
Last night, I consulted Mr. Su.

343
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,920
Following his steps,

344
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,830
I fixed the scraper.

345
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,640
Surprisingly, I made it.

346
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,640
Great. Mr. Su gave remote guidance.

347
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,720
Awesome.

348
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,200
But even if it's fixed,

349
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
when the printing is done,

350
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,790
it'll be too late for the inspection.

351
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,340
(Dongyang Medical, Internal Inspection Report)

352
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,150
Good.

353
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,590
Yuan,

354
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,200
what do you think?

355
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,110
You're quite lucky, Miss Ji.

356
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,160
In such a short time,

357
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,720
you found a solution.

358
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,920
It's not only about luck.

359
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,960
We indeed had a plan B.

360
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,160
And when we were handling

361
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,440
this emergency,

362
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,640
we upgraded the reading of the data

363
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,160
and the calculating time.

364
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,960
We also accelerated the printing speed.

365
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,550
Or it would be too late for the inspection.

366
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,750
Looks like a messy management

367
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,920
isn't too harmful to you.

368
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Ms. Yuan, I'll improve company regulations

369
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,550
as soon as I can.

370
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,240
Through this incident,

371
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,400
our team has worked together

372
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,310
better and better.

374
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,110
we'll do the clinical test immediately.

375

We're listing the institutions

376
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,160
to cooperate with.

377
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,510
Why are you so sure

378
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,750
the similar problem won't happen again?

379
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,680
Luck only helps for a while, after all.

380
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,520
Tang Song!

381
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,410
Yes, boss.

382
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,030
Get me the application form of payment.

383
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,150
OK.

384
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,070
For the second payment,

385
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
I only gave you half.

386
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,790
Another four million to pay.

387
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,520
Han Ting,

388
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,110
the directors question you

389
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,030
and that's not serious.

390
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,680
I suggest you think of your pledge

391
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,340
before you sign this!

392
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,180
(Han Ting)

393
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,550
Ask our accountants to approve it

394
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,720
before they knock off.

395
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,910
OK.

396
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,960
Don't worry, Mr. Han.

397
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,640
You've invested in Xingchen.

398
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,590
I will do my best

399
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,790
to not let you down.

400
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,150
Yuan,

401
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,110
I guess you have a lot of things to handle.

402
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,350
I won't see you out.

403
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,720
Yuan, you're here.

404
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,150
Hi.

405
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,960
You look awful.

406
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,350
Did Ting bully you again?

407
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,350
I should go.

408
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,070
My nephew and niece

409
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,310
both have a bad temper.

410
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,070
They don't respect their uncle at all.

411
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,160
Mr. Lu,

412
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,440
Miss Ji is still in there.

413
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,350
Please wait for a while.

414
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,590
- Ji Xing?
- Yes.

415
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,800
Fine, then.

416
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,640
I'm sorry

417
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,790
for all this trouble.

418
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
Are you trying

419
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,720
to interfere with Xingchen's management?

420
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,070
In a couple of days in Shenzhen,

421
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,350
an AI Medical Trade Fair will be held.

422
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:30,950
Get well prepared.

423
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,750
(The 4th Shenzhen AI Medical Trade Fair)
I signed up for this fair,

424
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,920
but always failed.

425
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,030
It'll be Xingchen's first visual appearance.

426
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,920
Seize the chance.

427
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,390
I should go.

428
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,480
Thank you.

429
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,440
For what?

430
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
I didn't do anything.

431
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,030
Thank you for trusting me.

432
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,000
What, Ji Xing?

433
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,790
Is Ting in a good mood today?

434
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,550
Believe in yourself.

435
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,680
One came out, pulling a long face.

436
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,550
The other asked me to believe in myself.

437
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,270

I'll go modify it.

447
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,630
Approved.

448
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,750
I'll still modify it.

449
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,320
What did you say?

450
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,520
Approved.

451
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,960
Oh, Ting.

452
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,310
Stay away unless you want to rewrite it.

453
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,870
No, no, no.

454
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,400
You're a man of your word.

455
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,590
So, my proposal is approved.

456
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,830
Thank you, Ting.

457
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,560
Bye-bye.

458
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,960
You had a hard time, guys.

459
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,760
Xing,

460
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,400
luckily, you reprogrammed

461
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,350
the printing system.

462
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,200
I've always wanted

463
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,750
to speed up the printing.

464
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,920
But before,

465
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,550
I didn't have a chance to test it.

466
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,550
Luckily, you were foresighted

467
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,750
to have a plan B.

468
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
I can't take the credit alone.

469
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,920
This is what we get

470
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,400
through our joint efforts.

471
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,750
My improper operation

472
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,070
caused so much trouble.

473
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,320
I'm sorry.

474
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,110
It's OK. Invite us to karaoke.

475
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,550
I worked overtime with you.

476
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,960
I bought you breakfast.

477
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,030
You should buy me dinner, too.

478
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,680
Zuo, in this accident,

479
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,160
you're responsible without doubt.

480
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,880
But besides you,

481
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
more people

482
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,960
should be responsible, too.

483
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,590
The Purchasing Department.

484
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,030
Due to the negligence of the progress,

485
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,350
the material delivery was late.

486
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,200
The Technical Department.

487
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,790
The operation rule wasn't obeyed

488
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,790
that at least two operators should be present.

489
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,160
Su Zhizhou, head of the Technical Department,

490
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,200
approved an operation

491
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,550
without verification or signature.

492
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,240
Also, he didn't put up
the operating rules on the wall.

493
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,750
Do you have any objection to what I said?

494
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,280
No.

495
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,720
Besides them,

496
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,110
another guy should be more responsible.

497
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,960
As the general manager,

498
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,110
I didn't make

499
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,590
strict regulations.

500
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,640
So, I'm primarily responsible.

501
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,830
I will bear 50%

502
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,720
of the pay for our loss.

503
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,480
The rest will be deducted

504
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,960
from the pay of Miss Li, Mr. Su, and Zuo

505
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,640
in proportion to their responsibility.

506
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,000
Miss Ji,

507
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,550
I made the mistake.

508
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,440
I'm willing to pay for all the losses.

509
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,550
I just announced

510
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,400
the final penalty.

511
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,440
From this accident,

512
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,440
we've learned our lesson.

513
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,960
Before, we didn't have

514
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,440
perfect regulations.

515
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,790
From this day on,

516
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,550
rules must be established.

517
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,110
Later, I'll post an announcement.

518
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,920
If anything happens again

519
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,350
that will cause

520
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,720
financial damage to Xingchen,

521
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,200
the troublemaker will be responsible

522
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,640
strictly according to the rules.

523
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,200
In any case,

524
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,790
there should be traces

525
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,200
and rules to obey.

526
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,110
- Yes, Miss. Ji.
- Yes.

527
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,790
This is a big trouble

528
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,160
we've met.

529
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:29,960
But I've seen

530
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,030
the unity of us all.

531
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,590
I believe, after this,

532
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,550
our company

533
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,350
will be more orderly.

534
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,510
Now, I have some good news

535
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,350
to tell you.

536
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,310
(Invitation)
Mr. Han gave me this today.

537
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,350
Have a look.

538
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,110
What's this?

539
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,310
Invitation?

540
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,720
AI Medical Trade Fair?

541
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,510
Are we taking part?

542
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,280
Really?

543
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,110
At this trade fair,

544
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,270
we can get clinical institutions

545
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,550
and cooperate with them

546
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,160
on our intervertebral cage.

547
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,920
Awesome.

548
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,750
Mr. Su, let us have a look.

549
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,240
The point is, I heard

550
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,750
a lot of people would attend it.

551
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,720
Right.

552
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,200
Xing, what you just said

553
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,160
was rather inspiring.

554
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
Indeed, the professor of MBA

555
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,350
taught you very well.

556
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,350
Had known it, I would also have

557
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,240
attended some classes.

558
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,830
But you may not get

559
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,110
such a good professor.

560
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,640
OK. So much for today's meeting.

561
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,560
Everybody,

562
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,560
knock off.

568
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,030

569
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,240
in your face.

570
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,520
Thank you.

571
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,960
Thank you for giving me a chance

572
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,480
to correct my own mistake.

573
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,350
When I broke the printer,

574
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,640
I gave up all hope.

575
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,110
All the worst possibilities

576
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,240
went through in my mind.

577
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,510
But none of them happened.

578
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,880
Instead of denying me,

579
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,880
blaming me, or firing me,

580
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,350
you helped me fix the printer.

581
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,270
To me,

582
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,830
I felt like I had risen from hell to heaven.

583
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,560
Zuo,

584
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,680
everybody makes a mistake.

585
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,720
Besides, the fault of the printer

586
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,310
wasn't your problem alone.

587
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,070
You're a responsible man

588
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,110
who corrects himself and has an attitude.

589
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,030
Now, we've fixed the printer together.

590
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,880
So, you've made it up.

591
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,480
Miss Ji, don't worry.

592
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,680
I'll get familiar with the operation details.

593
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,880
I won't make a mistake again.

594
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,110
Good.

595
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,030
I trust you.

596
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,880
It's late.

597
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,270
You stayed up last night.

598
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,240
Go back home for some rest.

599
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,550
You stayed up all night, too.

600
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,950
Go get some rest early.

601
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,240
I should go.

602
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,590
(Honey)
When are you coming back?

603
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,200
Soon.

604
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,270
Wait for me at home.

605
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,820
What are you doing?
What's taking you so long?

607
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,640
Be right there.

608
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,880
You're in such a good mood.

609
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,030
Can I take them

610
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,030
as an offer for a long relationship?

611
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,590
You don't want that?

612
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,720
I do, of course.

613
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:19,870
Mr. Xiao,

614
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,720
I am quite sensitive.

615
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,510
Especially to smell.

616
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,070
If you kiss anyone you shouldn't touch,

617
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,240
brush your teeth before you get back in.

618
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,920
Don't bring back anyone else's smell.

619
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,750
I'm picky, too.

620
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,830
I've found

621
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,880
the most comfortable smell.

622
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,750
Why would I get someone else?

623
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,350
Come on.

624
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,550
I don't think I'm the only factor

625
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,030
of your happiness, huh?

626
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,750
Good news from work?

627
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,790
Today, we narrowly

628
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,030
went through a crisis.

629
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,590
No matter who solved that problem,

630
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,310
I'd like to thank him solemnly.

631
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,830
He made you so happy.

632
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,520

replying with "Mm"

652
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,400
sounds quite impolite

653
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,270
and cold?

654
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,030

(Ji Xing)
Yes, most of the day.

660
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,270
Sometimes, it's naughty.

661
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,960
I forgive it, though.

662
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,920

And she's my best friend.

You knew each other before?

689
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,160
She was a junior

690
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,000
in my college.

what you do.

I do investment.

697
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,590

Have you invested in any medical projects?

702

Yes, if it's a good one.

703
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,360

When we can finally date,

705
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,030

725
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,030
when I first knew Li had a boyfriend,

726
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
I felt terrible.

727
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:56,150
I also wanted to numb myself by working.

728
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,960
But later, I calmed down

729
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,280
and saw the difference

730
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,920
between her boyfriend and me.

731
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840

00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,320
You were working really hard.

758
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,480
When you can finally go out,

759
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,590
travel around the city.

760
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,070
I don't have time.

761
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,880
I need to make some preparations.

762
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:38,070
I must read about the guests.

763
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,480
Only by knowing about them

764
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,280
can I get the point of the forum faster.

765
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,760
Xing,

766
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,630
you should learn to relax.

767
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,110
Do you know who the guest is

768
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:48,950
for the opening?

769
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,990
Who is it?

770
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,440
Han Ting.

771
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,960
Mr. Han is so impressive.

772
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,360
Xing, we've got the right boss.

773
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,110
OK. I'll say no more.

774
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,110
I'll continue reading.

775
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,670
OK. Bye-bye, Xing.

776
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,070
Bye-bye.

777
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,150
Xing, what are you doing?

778
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,070
Checking stuff out.

779
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,550
I have a sore back

780
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,670
and a neck spasm.

781
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,230
I'm having a stretch.

782
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,230
Girls, have you had lunch?

783
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,630
I'm eating instant noodles.

784
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,200
Tu Xiaomeng,

785
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,190
you know what?

786
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,710
The chips you gave me helped.

787
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,840
I missed their lunch.

788
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,840
The chips filled my belly.

789
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,320
You seldom go on a business trip.

790
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,710
Don't get stuck in the room.

791
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,550
Taste some local food.

792
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,110
Having a meal in the canteen downstairs

793
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,960
will be better than having chips in the room.

794
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,550
That's right.

795
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,030
I've got some travel tips for you.

796
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,190
Beside your hotel

797
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,880
is an Internet-famous restaurant.

798
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,710
Spaghetti there is super delicious.

799
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,670
Xing, you need physical strength
to run a company.

800
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,800
Take good care of yourself.

801
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,670
OK. I'll go later.

802
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,760
Qiuzi, why have you been inactive lately?

803
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,230
Have you had blind dates?

804
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,110
I have no time for blind dates.

805
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,840
I'm so busy working, OK?

806
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,190
But your job is easy.

807
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,070
Why are you so busy?

808
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,630
All right, Xiaomeng. I'll say no more.

809
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,630
You should do live streaming.

810
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,070
Oh, yeah. I forgot that.

811
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,030
I should go. Bye-bye.

812
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,160
Bye-bye.

813
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,440
Excuse me. Pack this for me, please.

814
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,960
- Thanks.
- OK. A minute, please.

815
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,400
(Wei Qiuzi)
Yichen,

816
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,400
are you available tomorrow?

817
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,220
(Wei Qiuzi)

818
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,150
Yichen,

819
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,440
are you available tomorrow?

820
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,190
My friend gave me two drama tickets.

821
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,480
Shall we watch it together?

822
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,030
Qiuzi, I've been preparing

823
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,110
for the interview of Xinggang Hospital.

824
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,320
(Shao Yichen)
Sorry.

825
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,550
I can't watch it.

826
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,110
(Wei Qiuzi)
Fine. Come on.

827
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,030
I believe you'll succeed.

828
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,440
(Shao Yichen)
OK. Hope so.

829
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,540
(Mr. Wei De)

830
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,510
Hello, Uncle.

831
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,960
Are you available tomorrow?

832
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,800
I know. The decoration is done.

833
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,920
The devices and instruments

834
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,360
have been ordered and will be delivered.

835
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,480
When everything is ready, I'll open the bar.

836
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,880
OK. Bye-bye.

837
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,070
(Smart Lemon)
Thanks, sweethearts. Love you.

838
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,550
Thank you for your concern.

839
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,800
(Smart Lemon)
Thank you, friend,

840
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,030
(T gave a "Marry you".)
for your gift.

841
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,480
"Marry you?"

842
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,280
Someone said he wanted to marry me.

843
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,760
But I belong to all my sweethearts.

844
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,110
Marry you?

845
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,880
Thank you, Sour-Sweet Lemon.

846
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,280
Thank you, Lemon, Don't Cry.

847
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,320
Many thanks.

848
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,840
(12 hot-air balloons and 10 hearts from Mr. Lu)

849
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,630
(Welcome Mr. Lu to join us.)
Thank you, Mr. Lu, for your gifts.

850
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,400
Thank you for your support.

851
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,920
Thank you so much.

852
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,320
All right, sweethearts.

853
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,440
You can request some songs first.

854
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,400
Later, I'll check

855
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,840
what songs you request.

856
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:27,910
You're welcome.

857
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,320
Just some small gifts.

858
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,400
My nephew finally approved my proposal.

859
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,480
(Lu Linjia)
I have to thank you

860
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,880
for your kind advice.

861
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,440
Fine. Thank you for your gifts, too.

862
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,230
(Smart Lemon)
You can request a song.

863
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,320
Tell me. What song would you like?

864
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,030
Let me see

865
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:44,230
what songs you've requested.

866
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,510
(You sing beautifully. Adorable.)

867
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,510
You're so passionate today.

868
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,670
Are you available when it's over?

869
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,030
How about you go check

870
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,670
(Lu Linjia)
the live sound effects of my bar,

871
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:56,870
Miss Streamer?

872
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,230
Thank you, everybody.

873
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,440
Thank you for your continuous gifts.

874
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,510
Thank you so much.

875
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,670
Spaghetti, please.

876
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,000
OK. A minute, please.

877
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,990
See you.

878
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,480
What are you doing here?

879
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,070
I was in the middle of something.

880
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,840
Now, I'm here for lunch.

881
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,000
Went out for fun?

882
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,590
I didn't.

883
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,920
I was making preparations in my room.

884
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,230
Don't think

885
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,710
I'm here for a free vacation.

886
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,110
What preparations did you make?

887
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,710
It's a trade secret.

888
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,800
