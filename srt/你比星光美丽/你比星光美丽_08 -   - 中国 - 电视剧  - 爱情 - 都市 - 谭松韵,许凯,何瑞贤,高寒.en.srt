23
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,640
Sorry. I lost your money, too.

24
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,830
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,720
I just told you not to be stressed.

26
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,190
Your company isn't deregistered.

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,110
I'm waiting until you get financing

28
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,600
and carry me.

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,960
Don't think too much.

30
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,670
Are you hungry?

31
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,360
I'll go buy you something to eat.

32
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,670
You rest here.

33
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,510
I'll be right back.

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,260
(Yichen)

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,540
(Call wasn't answered)

36
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,620
(Xing, I need money for a family trouble.
Can you lend me some?)

37
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,300
(No need. The problem is solved.)

38
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,300
(Awaiting response, Yichen)

39
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,960
Hello, Yichen.

40
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,230
Xing.

41
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,960
What happened to your family?

42
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,870
My father vouched for someone

43
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,390
and got himself involved

44
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,430
in a repayment lawsuit.

45
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,080
He was forced to pay.

46
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,430
But it's OK.

47
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,670
A friend helped me.

48
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,760
The problem is solved.

49
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,870
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,200
- Today, I...
- Never mind.

51
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,640
I know you're busy.

52
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,200
I'm going back to my hometown
to deal with it.

53
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,320
I'll hang up.

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,600
Your rest more.

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,910
Boss, Miss Ji is out of the hospital.

56
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,230
Don't worry.

57
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,760
Xing is still sleeping.

58
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,200
Oh, Li.

59
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,910
Have you got a new job?

60
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,880
Li Li lost her job?

61
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,080
Xing? Why are you up so early?

62
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,190
I'll ask her.

63
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,120
Li Li, were you implicated

64
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,080
in Mr. Wu's case?

65
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,160
What are you talking about?

66
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,200
I offended Mr. Wu myself.

67
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,960
I resigned because I didn't want that job.

68
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,350
It has nothing to do with you.

69
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,960
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,200
I didn't know

71
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,710
it would get you in such trouble.

72
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,230
Don't always take the blame, OK?

73
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,470
Why are you always so stressed?

74
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,030
Why are you up so early?

75
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,030
Go get more sleep.

76
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,200
You should rest more.

77
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,760
I'll hang up.

78
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,270
Don't worry about Li.

79
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,560
Many headhunters want her.

80
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,320
I'll go get washed.

81
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,270
You just had the infusion yesterday.

82
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,030
The doctor said you needed more rest.

83
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,470
I can't rest.

84
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,910
I have a lot of work to do.

85
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,640
Anyway, you have to rest more

86
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,680
and recuperate.

87
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,910
You know what? The infusion will...

88
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,880
Hello, Mr. Liu.

89
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,470
This is Ji Xing from Xingchen Technology.

90
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,830
We talked before.

91
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,960
Mr. Lin, we talked before.

92
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,350
When we have the printer,

93
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,190
we promise you

94
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,120
we'll make the analog product immediately.

95
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,760
We have completed

96
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,880
a 3D model of the analog product.

97
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,000
OK, OK. Anytime will do.

98
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,680
Mr. Ma, if you need it,

99
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,000
we can deliver it to you.

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,520
Even if we do it late.

101
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,710
When you're done working,
I'll visit you and let's talk.

102
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,390
We can talk about the stock face to face.

103
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,960
We're absolutely sincere.

104
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,640
OK. Tell me when you have time.

105
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,480
I'll be waiting.

106
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,120
Sorry. Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Zhu.

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,830
Miss Ji, get some rest early.

108
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,230
Thanks.

109
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,960
Oh, Shang.

110
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,200
Zhizhou and I will take care
of the financing thing.

111
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,230
But you may get your wage

112
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,710
a bit late this month.

113
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,120
You'll get it, I promise.

114
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,470
Miss Ji, I trust you and Su.

115
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,120
Things must be tough
for a new startup company.

116
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,680
I totally understand.

117
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,680
Don't worry. I have no pressure from life.

118
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,080
I have enough money, too.

119
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,680
Anyway, you and Su

120
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,830
need to take more rest.

121
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,760
After all, health matters most.

122
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,710
I can't help very much with the financing.

123
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,640
But I'll do my best to find a way.

124
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,390
I believe our company

125
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,790
will get through this hard time.

126
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,720
We will.

127
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,520
Thank you, Shang.

128
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,350
I should go.

129
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,760
You take some rest early.

130
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,150
We've contacted all the investors.

131
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,680
Xing,

132
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,070
how about

133
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,710
we think of Mr. Han's offer?

134
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,680
We have the product.

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,390
Through Dongyang Medical,

136
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,830
we can also realize our dreams.

137
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,680
Actually, in my opinion,

138
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,320
we can't have a say

139
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,470
when working for Mr. Han.

140
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,830
But meanwhile,

141
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,110
we don't need to be so stressed.

142
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,540
(Unknown number)

143
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,400
Hello.

144
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,750
Hello. Is that Ji Xing?

145
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,710
Yes. And who is that?

146
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,920
This is Han Yuan from Dongyang Technology.

147
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,080
Shall we meet tomorrow morning?

148
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,800
OK.

149
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,740
(Dongyang Group)

150
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,160
Ms. Yuan, they're here.

151
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,510
- Ms. Yuan.
- Ms. Yuan.

152
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,560
Boss,

153
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,400
Ms. Yuan is meeting Miss Ji.

154
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,350
If she's smart enough,

155
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,280
she won't accept Han Yuan's investment.

156
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,160
Boss,

157
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,560
I just think Miss Ji

158
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,080
has been really desperate.

159
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,520
If...

160
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,160
If she still has no investment,

161
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,440
her company will fail.

162
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,710
I'm afraid...

163
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,110
To invest and to be invested

164
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,680
are a two-way selection.

165
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,960
If such little pressure

166
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,350
makes her lose her judgment,

167
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,680
my investment won't work.

168
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,680
And she will not succeed.

169
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,280
She had better give up sooner

170
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,560
in case she collapses too hard.

171
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,230
But once Ms. Yuan invests in Miss Ji,

172
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,470
Miss Ji will stand against you.

173
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,830
By then, will you really

174
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,710
ruin her company personally?

175
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,230
Let's get right to the point.

176
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,320
I read your proposal.

177
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,800
You have mature ideas.

178
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,830
According to our investment department,

179
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,920
you made the analog product

180
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,990
in a very short time.

181
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,550
Impressive.

182
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,080
Thanks for your recognition.

183
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,590
I think highly of the future of your company.

184
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,320
I want to cooperate with you.

185
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,590
We also hope

186
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,680
we can cooperate, Ms. Yuan.

187
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,510
What do you want from the investor, then?

188
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,320
Ten million in exchange for 15% of the stock.

189
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
We want the investor

190
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,870
to fully trust our company

191
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,110
and not to interfere too much

192
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,920
with our internal autonomy.

193
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,830
No management right, huh?

194
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,440
OK. I approve.

195
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,230
But I'll invest twenty million

196
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,470
for 33.4% of the stock.

197
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,470
After all, if your company develops well,

198
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,750
you'll get more rounds of financing.

199
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,320
15% of the stock

200
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,160
will be too little.

201
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,920
Don't worry.

202
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,200
I won't hold the 33.4% of the stock

203
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,470
all by myself.

204
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,400
If I find

205
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,710
excellent researchers

206
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,830
or teams,

207
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
I need to recruit them with the stock.

208
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,680
Miss Ji, what are you worried about?

209
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,510
Ms. Yuan, I want to make sure something.

210
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,960
Can you promise

211
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,400
the founding team of my company

212
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,280
will not be replaced?

213
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,320
Well,

214
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,350
isn't it too early to talk about this?

215
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,070
Besides,

216
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,350
do you have no confidence in your team?

217
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,470
I have confidence.

218
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,350
But I need to think about it.

219
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,550
I understand.

220
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,470
But I want everything to be quick.

221
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,280
I've been interested

222
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,350
in this field lately.

223
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,560
Of course, there are many more companies

224
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,630
to be invested in.

225
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,040
If you don't mind,

226
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,350
give me a final reply

227
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,750
at ten tomorrow morning.

228
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,440
I believe you're smart guys

229
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,230
and you'll make the right choice.

230
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,800
OK.

231
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,710
You don't want to reject her, do you?

232
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,870
Zhizhou, with 33.4% of the stock,

233
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,230
she will have the one-vote veto.

234
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,400
Then, we won't have much choice.

235
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,080
And when I asked her

236
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,040
if she could promise

237
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,990
our founding team wouldn't be replaced,

238
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,750
she didn't reply accurately.

239
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,920
But we can't let go of the existing savior

240
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,510
just in fear of some crises

241
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,590
that may happen in the future.

242
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,960
Even if there may be some crises,

243
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,040
we can do something to avoid them.

244
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,020
Check this.

245
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,500
(The founder resigned.
Dongyang had a new team.)

246
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,280
In the company she invested in,

247
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,960
even the founding team was made a figurehead.

248
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,590
I don't think our company can be an exception.

249
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,080
But if we lose this opportunity,

250
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,630
we won't get a second one.

251
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,280
When there's no hope now,

252
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,560

Or we would really fail.

256
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,590
I'll think it over.

She won't stop before running into a wall.

Ms. Yuan, thanks for thinking highly of us.

309
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,840
But I worry about something.

310
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,440
Worry?

311
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,030
Are you worried

312
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,840
you'll lose the control of your company?

313
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,550
Honestly, yes.

314
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,840
Isn't it very normal

315
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,230
in the business circles?

316
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,510
You have to know.

317
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,880
Those entrepreneurs,

318
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,270
before I invested in them,

319
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,550
had been penniless paupers.

320
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,710
When they quit, they were billionaires.

321
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,920
Instead of struggling,

322
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,470
they can just enjoy the rest of their life.

323
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,230
Entrepreneurs like you

324
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,640
want to be financially free, don't you?

325
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,680
I just help you reach your goal
ahead of schedule.

326
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,160
I do want to be financially free.

327
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,270
But I want more of a stage

328
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,270
where dreams can come true.

329
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,750
I know, in your eyes,

330
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,160
this is a naive idea.

331
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,470
But it's what has been supporting me.

332
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,960
Thanks, Ms. Yuan.

333
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,920
Hope we can cooperate somewhere else.

334
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,960
Let's talk.

335
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,520
Twenty million

336
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,920
for 33.4% of the stock.

337
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,750
Regularly report to me.

338
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,840
This is my bottom line.

339
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,960
No way.

340
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,270
With 33.4% of the stock,

341
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,680
you'll have the decision-making power.

342
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,310
I can't accept that.

343
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,840
Fifteen million

344
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,360
for 20% of the stock.

345
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,470
Xingchen has absolute autonomy.

346
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,120
Do you really think I'm an angel investor?

347
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,310
You have to know.

348
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,120
A reliable investor

349
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,550
can give you not only money

350
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,960
but also abundant

351
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,070
resources and connections.

352
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,030
Even in this case,

353
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,920
he isn't an angel
that realizes your wildest dream.

354
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,070
You're not an angel,

355
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,640
but it doesn't mean there aren't angels.

356
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,310
Someone gave the same offer.

357
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,160
Given the same offer,

358
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,640
I think I'll take the first proposer.

359
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,360
But of course, if you give me

360
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,510
a better offer...

361
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,160
A lower percentage of the stock, for example.

362
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,070
Maybe I'll think about it.

363
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,230
Under such circumstances,

364
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,270
there's no point in deceiving me,

365
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,110
is there?

366
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,070
Ji Xing,

367
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,360
I don't think

368
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,470
anyone will agree to your terms.

369
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,120
Especially Han Yuan.

370
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,510
You talked to her.

371
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,840
You should judge properly.

372
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Your proposal has only one highlight.

373
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,120
You propose to combine customization

374
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,840
with medical big data.

375
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,270
But as far as I know,

376
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,470
all the data you have now

377
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,790
were accumulated when you worked

378
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,630
in Guanghua.

379
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,760
What about later?

380
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,920
Can you get more up-to-date data?

381
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,960
Dongyang Medical has Doctorcloud

382
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,960
with inexhaustible data from home and abroad.

383
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,120
That alone

384
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,750
surpasses all the other investors.

385
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,750
But other investors

386
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,310
are nice and friendly.

387
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,470
Can that

388
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,600
solve your problem?

389
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,030
You look like it's hard to get along with you.

390
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,070
Not really.

391
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,880
It's literally hard to get along with me.

392
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,990
But compared to the future of Xingchen,

393
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,040
does it even matter?

394
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,120
I believe you have judgments.

395
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,710
Or you wouldn't have rejected Han Yuan.

396
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,520
You also said you wanted

397
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,710
to combine software and hardware.

398
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,070
Only by choosing Dongyang Medical and me

399
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,550
can your company have a bright future.

400
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,710
I can agree to your terms.

401
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,070
But I hope

402
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,310
Xingchen will not have

403
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,880
any other teams.

404
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,070
In terms of human resources,

405
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,510
I'll have full control.

406
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,440
Agreed.

407
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,230
Regularly report to me.

408
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,470
I want the surveillance power of two years.

409
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,480
May we work well together.

410
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,120
We will.

411
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,360
Boss, where are we going?

412
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,720
To see Ms. He.

413
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,960
I need her support
at tomorrow's voting meeting.

414
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,420
(Xingyue Club)

415
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,640
Boss, your guest is here.

416
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,680
Hi, Ms. He.

417
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,390
Thank you for waiting.

418
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,360
I arrived too early.

419
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,600
- Be seated, please.
- After you.

420
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,550
Mr. Han, why did you

421
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,510
invite me here?

422
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,160
I'd like to thank you

423
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,710
for speaking for me

424
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,030
at the last board meeting.

425
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,400
My pleasure.

426
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,750
I totally agree with your innovative ideas.

427
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,710
You built Dongyang Base in Germany

428
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,920
and that made you really convincing.

429
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,120
Thank you, Ms. He.

430
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,360
Mr. Han, you don't get me here

431
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,440
just to say thank you, do you?

432
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
I believe

433
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,920
you figured out why I invited you.

434
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,070
You want me

435
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,550
to give a yes vote

436
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,230
at tomorrow's meeting.

437
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,680
That's right.

438
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,310
I read Xingchen's proposal.

439
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,120
I don't mean to question your vision.

440
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,310
Its analog product is good.

441
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,440
But it has very few key technical guys.

442
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,120
Its founder Ji Xing...

443
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,990
She's never built a successful business.

444
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,310
Won't it be too risky to invest

445
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,360
in such a startup company?

446
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,680
Risk is usually proportional to benefit.

447
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,030
Ji Xing used to work for Guanghua.

448
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,710
She's familiar with our system.

449
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Something went wrong

450
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,550
with Doctorcloud in Xinggang Hospital

451
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,200
and she solved the problem in the first place.

452
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,200
She did?

453
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,550
Then she has

454
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,710
really good techniques.

455
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,750
Maybe you don't know one thing.

456
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,960
My cousin wanted to invest in her
in the name of Dongyang Technology.

457
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,440
But Ji Xing rejected her.

458
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,960
You and your cousin both
think highly of this company.

459
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
So, Ji Xing

460
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,960
does have something.

461
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,030
She accepted Dongyang Medical

462
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,230
instead of Dongyang Technology.

463
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,550
Ms. Yuan...

464
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,600
That's why I need your support.

465
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,840
I believe

466
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,790
you will support

467
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,680
any beneficial decision

468
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,310
to Dongyang Medical.

469
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,310
Don't worry.

470
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,030
I made a pledge.

471
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,160
I won't do anything I'm not sure of.

472
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,070
Have some tea.

473
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,070
No.

474
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,880
At today's meeting,

475
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,120
Dongyang Medical's investment

476
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,710
in Xingchen Technology was approved.

477
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,030
Are you not anxious?

478
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
For what?

479
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,680
Just an investment in Xingchen.

480
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,200
This company has good techniques.

481
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,920
But it's just a team of amateurs.

482
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,960
They won't make a difference.

483
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,360
Didn't you see?

484
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,120
Even Ms. He took the lead
in supporting Han Ting.

485
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,230
If it goes on like this,
the board meeting will have a new master.

486
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,470
Not to mention our chairman.

487
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,360
Now, he isn't in Xinggang.

488
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,920
When he's back,

489
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,360
if he also has Han Ting back,

490
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,400
we'll have a harder time.

491
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,680
Don't worry.

492
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,640
Grandpa only judges by our performances.

493
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,920
Then will we just let Han Ting grow?

494
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
I just think Xingchen

495
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
will be the breakthrough

496
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,400
where we take Han Ting down.

497
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,640
Are you saying...?

498
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,230
A disease won't attack until it grows.

499
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,360
You just wait.

500
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,880
Xing, have you arrived?

501
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,400
Yichen.

502
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,880
Didn't I ask you not to pick me up?

503
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,200
I missed you.

504
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,470
You're wearing the ring.

505
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,400
You know what? I got financing.

506
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,200
I'll go sign the agreement later today.

507
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,960
Congratulations.

508
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,160
- Let's go.
- Let me take it.

509
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
No need.

510
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,960
You have an agreement to sign, right?

511
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,200
You get to work.

512
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,030
I'll go home alone.

513
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,230
It's OK. Just a few minutes.

514
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,750
You really don't have to.

515
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,840
Are you mad at me?

516
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,600
- I'm not.
- You are.

517
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,880
I'm really not.

518
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,600
Xing, don't worry about anything.

519
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,270
Just go and sign the agreement.

520
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,640
We'll meet this weekend.

521
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,870
OK?

522
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,630
Fine.

523
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,750
I'll drive you home

524
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,880
before I go to work.

525
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,180
(Dongyang Group)

526
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,040
Assistant Tang.

527
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,960
Miss Ji,

528
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,840
Mr. Han is waiting in his office.

529
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,000
Come this way.

530
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,380
(Invitation of Wisdom Medicine)

531
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,070
Boss, Miss Ji is here.

532
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,110
Take your seat.

533
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,440
Come in, please.

534
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,830
Sit there.

535
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,230
The investment agreement in duplicate.

536
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,510
We've stamped it.

537
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,750
Don't you review it?

538
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,880
Mr. Han, you decided to invest in us.

539
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,880
You won't give us a hard time.

540
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,260
(Ji Xing)

541
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,070
Tomorrow, money will be transferred
to your company account.

542
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,280
OK.

543
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,960
Anything else?

544
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,510
Mr. Han, just now

545
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,440
on Assistant Tang's desk,

546
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,680
I saw the invitation of Wisdom Medicine.

547
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,000
Umm...

548
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,750
Since you've invested in Xingchen,

549
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,600
can we get an invitation, too?

550
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,030
It depends.

551
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,990
Thank you, Mr. Han.

552
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,990
Nice doing business with you, Mr. Han.

553
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,750
Me too, Miss Ji.

554
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,590
I should go.

555
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,510
The employees are gone

556
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,160
while the boss is working overtime alone.

557
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,480
What are you doing here?

558
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,790
I brought you some pastry.

559
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,790
Didn't you remind me

560
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,990
to think more about Bay's market expansion?

561
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,310
I have a new idea.

562
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,870
Check this.

563
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,470
Before, Guanghua was trying

564
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,600
to promote Bay in big hospitals.

565
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,960
Actually, in some primary hospitals

566
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,550
with poor medical resources,

567
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,790
Bay is in higher demand.

568
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,700
(Proposal of Dr. Bay's Healthcare in Villages)

569
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,790
To give people healthcare

570
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,960
and a better life...

571
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,600
This is my original dream.

572
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,040
Good idea.

573
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,400
I'll carry forward this proposal, then.

574
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,440
OK.

575
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,710
I bought the pastry
of several different flavors.

576
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,400
I wonder if you like it.

577
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,110
Oh.

578
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,720
I heard

579
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,200
you invested in your schoolmate.

580
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,600
Do you mean Ji Xing?

581
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,960
Back in college, the two of you took part

582
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,070
in a competition, huh?

583
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,680
I would never invest in a worthless company

584
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,440
for the sake of any private relationship.

585
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:24,990
This rule is for Ji Xing.

586
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,920
It's for Guanghua, too.

587
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,680
Carry out the proposal.

588
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,880
Phase II has to be accelerated.

589
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,030
It's slow because it's ascending.

590
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,600
But don't worry.

591
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,840
I won't let you down.

592
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,470
Thanks for the pastry.

593
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,240
I have work to do.

594
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,030
Don't stay up too late.

595
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,040
Take care of yourself.

596
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,600
Our first investment has arrived!

597
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,480
Look.

598
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,920
(Amount of Income)
Let me count.

599
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,440
Million!

600
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,960
- Six million!
- Six million!

601
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,230
We can finally do some great work!

602
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,720
Shang.

603
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,840
Let's figure out

604
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,120
the schedule of further work.

605
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,790
I've made a timetable.

606
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,680
It's on my computer.

607
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,550
Well done. You're foresighted.

608
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,750
Han Ting is awesome.

609
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,160
We've received

610
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,600
the first investment of great value.

611
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,520
Thank you, Mr. Han.

612
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,540
(Ji Xing)

613
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,600
It's efficient of you, Mr. Han.

614
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,980
(Ji Xing: It's efficient of you, Mr. Han.)

615
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,980
(Han Ting)

616
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,460
(Invitation of Wisdom Medicine,
Dear Miss Ji Xing)

617
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,150
Mr. Han got us an invitation

618
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,800
to the exchange meeting of Wisdom Medicine!

619
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,840
I heard Ren Jun from Youwei Technology

620
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,990
and Shen Li from Ruan Technology

621
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,280
would both be there.

622
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,720
If we can get to know these big shots

623
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,720
and have connections,

624
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,920
our company will be able

625
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,110
to have more resources and opportunities!

626
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,960
Our investor

627
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,240
is a big shot, too.

628
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,880
Look at Mr. Han.

629
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,630
He thinks of us for everything he has.

630
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,990
So, we should

631
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,800
work harder to advance the project.

632
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,920
I'm going to the Tax Administration
to submit something.

633
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,030
After that, I'm going home.

634
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,190
You get off early, too.

635
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,070
You had hard work.

636
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,990
- OK.
- OK, Xing.

637
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,920
Go ahead.

638
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,720
Yichen, the first investment for Xingchen

639
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,560
has arrived.

640
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,550
What about a celebration dinner this weekend?

641
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,400
(Ji Xing)

642
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,670
(Shao Yichen)
OK. Congratulations, Xing.

643
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,910
Love you.

644
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,500
(Ji Xing: Love you.)

645
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,160
Lock the door.

646
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,350
Li?

647
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,720
Where are you going?

648
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,990
Our first payment has arrived.

649
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,030
We're going to see a lawyer

650
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,990
for another verification of our capital.

651
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,400
Good.

652
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,960
After months of hard work,

653
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,070
you've finally got somewhere.

654
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,150
Li, what are you doing here?

655
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,190
I was seeing a headhunter nearby.

656
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,030
So, I brought some material to Xing.

657
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,840
Xing told me about your resignation.

658
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,960
Sorry to get you involved.

659
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,150
I wasn't happy to work there

660
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,510
and then left the company.

661
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,240
It has nothing to do with you.

662
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,440
Li, you're so cool.

663
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,280
Come on. Where's Xing?

664
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,510
She's out for business.

665
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,440
She said she would go home directly.

666
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,590
Li, we're not in a hurry.

667
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,430
You seldom come.

668
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,400
We'll show you a good time.

669
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,880
- Get in, please.
- No, no, no.

670
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,670
Take this.

671
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,840
It has two folders.

672
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,360
Sales figures for medical devices
in recent years

673
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,150
and some basic information about clients

674
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,320
just for your reference.

675
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,150
- Thank you, Li.
- Thank you.

676
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,840
I should go. You get back to work.

677
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,550
Let me walk you out.

678
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,840
Li, do you like watching movies?

679
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,240
I heard a newly released movie

680
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,240
was very fun.

681
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,470
Shall we watch it this weekend?

682
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,840
A lot of men want to invite me to a movie.

683
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,880
I won't go with all of them.

684
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,190
My car is there.

685
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,030
I should go.

686
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,110
Goodbye, Li.

687
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,190
Su, it's hard to chase a girl, huh?

688
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,640
Will you continue?

689
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,800
She's single and that's my biggest hope.

690
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,190
How do you know she's single?

691
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,470
When she rejected me,

692
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,800
she didn't mention a boyfriend.

693
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:05,990
Keep it carefully.

694
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,590
You wait and see.

695
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,030
What a coincidence!

696
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,200
It's not a coincidence.

697
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,550
I'm here for you.

698
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,760
How do you know I'm here?

699
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,440
The bar owner is my friend.

700
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,990
You took all the trouble to find me.

701
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,600
What for?

702
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,800
Because I missed you.

703
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,380
(Yushan Bypass No.3)

704
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,400
Who's that?

705
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,740
(Proposal Plan to Get Yichen)

706
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:46,960
Yichen?

707
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,630
Aren't you supposed to come this weekend?

708
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,280
I'm here to give you a treat.

709
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,990
Xing, the dishes are ready.

710
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,280
Come have dinner.

711
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,880
Be right there.

712
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,440
The dishes are getting cold.

713
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:01,950
Here I am.

714
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,880
Go wash your hands.

715
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,200
OK.

716
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:08,910
Where's Xiaomeng?

717
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,760
She has gone to another city

718
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,150
for offline live streaming.

719
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,550
She won't be back until tomorrow.

720
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,070
Smells so good.

721
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,320
Tastes great.

722
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,110
Slow down.

723
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,720
I won't grab your food.

724
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,670
You must been exhausted lately.

725
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,030
You must not

726
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,920
work overtime so hard.

727
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,880
I won't.

728
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,280
Today,

729
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,150
I was doing

730
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,880
a very important proposal.

731
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:58,910
Oh,

732
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,880
you know what?

733
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,840
Tomorrow, there will be an exchange meeting.

734
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,510
A new startup company like us

735
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,030
isn't qualified to attend it.

736
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,070
But I asked my investor

737
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,670
for an invitation.

738
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,440
A lot of big shots

739
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,510
will be there.

740
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,720
If anyone can

741
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,920
enlighten me a little bit,

742
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,880
maybe my company

743
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,630
will be successful overnight.

744
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,320
Anyway,

745
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,280
I have taken

746
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,030
my first step

747
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,240
towards the great future.

748
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:29,990
Xing,

749
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,510
your future is about to prosper.

750
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,880
Our future, actually.

751
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,120
Come on.

752
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,470
When you're busy,
you don't remember to eat.

753
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,070
It's bad for your stomach.

754
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,590
Xing, promise me.

755
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,670
You will have

756
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,470
three meals regularly, OK?

757
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,400
The soup tastes great.

758
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,280
You have some, too.

759
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,670
Don't let me have it alone.

760
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,590
Xing, still in the middle of something?

761
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,590
It's done.

762
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,080
Perfect.

763
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,150
You're working at the cost of your life.

764
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,760
However important it is, you should rest.

765
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,400
Don't worry. Look.

766
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,880
I have a source of strength.

767
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,440
Yichen, would you like to watch a movie?

768
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,440
We haven't watched one for a long time.

769
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,430
Last time,

770
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,360
you said you loved to watch...

771
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,150
Sit down here. Sit.

772
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,920
The movie you wanted to watch last time

773
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,360
has been downloaded.

774
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,470
Let me turn it on.

775
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,720
Last time, we didn't watch it

776
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,840
because I was too busy.

777
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,150
Now, we can watch it.

778
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,360
Come on. Get it up and you'll feel better.

779
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,760
Yichen,

780
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,760
when I'm done working,

781
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,670
let's go visit your parents.

782
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,510
I'll buy your father his favorite tea

783
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,320
and buy your mother some cosmetics.

784
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,510
