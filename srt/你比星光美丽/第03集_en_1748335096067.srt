1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to the top of the sky.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sure I won't be afraid.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll do my best in the future.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't fear the courage I don't fear.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'm going to the top of the sky.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I won't give up.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll be more and more happy.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Even if I don't know who I am.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The End

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Episode 1

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You're so rude.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Enough. Don't talk nonsense.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're crazy.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Stop.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What are you doing?

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What are you doing?

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Wait. I want to report to the police.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Report to the police?

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Everyone.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Everyone, you can see it.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's too much for a woman like you.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You must pay attention.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't be fooled.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Report to the police.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hello.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hello.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How are you?

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm Su Lan, a driver.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I have something to do.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm leaving.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm going to draw a prize.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll draw a prize for you.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Mr. Li, Mr. Zhao, I'll be back.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll make a reservation.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Mr. Zhang.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The police have reported.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
They said they're sorry.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The police are waiting for you.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hold them down.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Don't make things too serious.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Do your work.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Try not to make things too serious.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So he's lucky to have you.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yes.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Mr. Ji, don't make things too serious.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm warning you.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't talk nonsense.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Mr. Ji, it's him who seduced me.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Pay attention to your words.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Please describe the past of what happened just now.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He just took my butt here.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He even scolded me.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He's always been a coward.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't be so excited.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Since you're so serious,

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
you can also tell us

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
the past in detail.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Come on, Mr. Ji.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Actually, it's like this.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Ji.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This must be a misunderstanding.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We're all colleagues in the company.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We're almost there.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There are many big bosses and clients here.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
They're not kidding me.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's take a step back.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Mr. Ji, we'll solve this by ourselves.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Chen, thank goodness you're here.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You're the one who's under the ice.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're so mean to me.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Today, I'll tell you the face of you.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You don't have to give me any face.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Officer, I'm asking for a check.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Okay.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You two go to the office with me.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Boss.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Boss, we're running out of time.

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We have to go.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You stay and see the situation.

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll go by myself.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay.

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay, let's go.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What's the matter?

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Everyone, come here.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Next, we'll take the most aggressive

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
drawback session tonight.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Don't leave.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Because tonight, our special prize

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
will be a car.

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
From this point of view,

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
we can't judge his distance.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
My colleague has gone to the people who were in charge.

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He knows the situation.

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
If they don't testify to you,

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
we can't judge

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
if he's being violent.

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But he really...

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I was wronged.

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're so stupid.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Do you have evidence?

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Or who are you looking for?

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll prove it to you.

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Well,

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
we've made a step forward.

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We apologize to each other.

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The big car is gone.

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Why should I apologize to him?

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I want Zhu Lei to apologize to me openly.

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I was wronged.

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Officer Jin,

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm going to tell Ji Xing

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
that he's going to destroy my reputation

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
by defaming me.

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You...

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Just do as I say.

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay, boss.

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Ji Xing,

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
do you know

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
how much you've caused

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the reputation of the police

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
by today?

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
There are so many clients today.

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
How can we

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
deal with them in the future?

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Besides,

140
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
the reputation and economy of Guanghua

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
are all your fault.

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Stop being so rude.

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You're so rude.

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You're still being polite.

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Ji Xing.

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Zhu,

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
we're colleagues.

148
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We're not on the same page.

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're not being polite.

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Just give me a face.

151
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll let you go.

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay?

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay.

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Chen,

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll give you a face.

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I can't let him go.

157
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But, Ji Xing,

158
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
you must apologize to me.

159
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And apologize openly

160
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
at the company tomorrow.

161
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
At least I'm a director.

162
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I want a face, too.

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You're so rude.

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Ji Xing,

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
apologize to Director Zhu.

166
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's okay.

167
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You want to take the adjustment?

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You're going to review it later?

169
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I don't accept the adjustment.

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Comrade Qin Shao.

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Hello.

172
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Hello.

173
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm the special assistant of Director Dong Yi.

174
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Tang Song.

175
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I was nearby

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
when he was just released.

177
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Did you see

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
what happened just now?

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm a little far away.

180
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I didn't see it clearly.

181
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But Comrade Qin Shao,

182
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
although I didn't see it clearly,

183
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
there are service robots

184
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
in this hotel.

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The internal camera

186
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
should have taken all the scenes

187
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
of Ji Xing's being harassed.

188
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This...

189
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
This...

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is impossible.

191
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I also informed the technical staff

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
of the company

193
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
to drop the surveillance video.

194
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Director.

195
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The surveillance video is coming out soon.

196
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you have any harassing robots?

197
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
If you do,

198
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
you'd better apologize immediately.

199
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Otherwise,

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
when the surveillance video is in front of you,

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
it's not just a lie.

202
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's so simple.

203
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I...

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You!

205
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's you!

206
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't hesitate.

207
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't be nervous.

208
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Who's this?

209
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's me.

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This guest

211
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
let's give him a round of applause.

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Welcome him to the stage.

213
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The surveillance video is coming out soon.

214
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay.

215
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's get in the car

216
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:28,600
of the hotel's

217
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
security guards.

218
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
We're not going to let you

219
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
take the risk.

220
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Since he has already

221
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
admitted his actions,

222
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
I'll leave it to you.

223
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Okay.

224
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Then you can go with us.

225
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Okay.

226
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Ji Xing.

227
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
You've suffered a lot.

228
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Don't worry.

229
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I'll give you an answer.

230
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
From now on,

231
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
the assistant

232
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
won't be our staff.

233
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Song Lin.

234
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Get a car

235
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
and send Ji Xing back.

236
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Okay.

237
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Go back and rest.

238
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Thank you, Mr. Song.

239
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Let's go.

240
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

241
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Mr. Cheng, thank you.

242
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
I'll leave first.

243
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Okay.

244
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
I just met a friend who is in trouble.

245
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
He is delaying me.

246
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Friend?

247
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Didn't you go to Guanghua's celebration party?

248
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Did Ji Xing's friend

249
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
say that?

250
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Okay.

251
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
I'll be there soon.

252
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
I'll hang up.

253
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
How is it?

254
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
According to your method,

255
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
the assistant is out.

256
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Where's Ji Xing?

257
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Ji Xiao Jing is fine.

258
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Mr. Cheng has arranged

259
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
to take the car

260
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
and send it back.

261
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
I know.

262
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Mr. Han,

263
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
the medical doctor of your Dong Yi

264
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
has been developing for many years.

265
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
It's a shame.

266
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
The medical doctor of Dong Yi

267
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
used to be responsible for Dong Yi's AI.

268
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
He has been doing this for many years.

269
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
I'm sorry.

270
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
I'm sorry.

271
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
I'm sorry.

272
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
I'm sorry.

273
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
I'm sorry.

274
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
I'm sorry.

275
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
I'm sorry.

276
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm sorry.

277
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm sorry.

278
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
I'm sorry.

279
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
The development of the medical doctor is very slow.

280
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
The progress is always very slow.

281
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
But I've already

282
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
returned to the接種 Dong Yi.

283
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
I will switch the team next.

284
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
The development of the big interest will be in the medical life.

285
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Isn't the development of the big interest

286
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
of the big interest in the air-conditioned?

287
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
That's natural.

288
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Have a look at this.

289
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
This is...

290
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,120
The information on the treatment of the patient's white skin

291
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,120
and the wide-angle technology of the development of white skin

292
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
is my investment.

293
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,080
I'm going to combine the wisdom doctor and white skin

294
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,560
and the 3D treatment printing technology.

295
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,280
Once the steps are complete,

296
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,000
the future can help the doctor through white skin

297
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,880
to quickly get the results of the treatment and treatment plan.

298
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,440
It can also be done through 3D treatment printing technology.

299
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,240
It can achieve the personal and fixed quality of the treatment.

300
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,400
Is there a plan for this platform's application scene?

301
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,920
In addition to the hospital,

302
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,240
Dongyi is preparing more to cooperate with the patient

303
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,160
to get the treatment of the white skin.

304
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,600
He helps to strengthen the basic construction of the treatment.

305
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,000
He is also making up for the lack of resources for the treatment.

306
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,760
To be honest,

307
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,520
this is also the reason why I want to improve the development of the white skin.

308
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,880
Now,

309
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,400
the country is developing the development of the white skin treatment

310
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,600
in a hurry.

311
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,400
Is Mr. Han willing to do this?

312
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,720
If he can get the help of Dr. Jiang,

313
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,520
the wisdom doctor's plan will definitely be realized faster.

314
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,680
Teacher, it's time to register.

315
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,000
Dr. Jiang, I know that

316
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,920
there are many companies and institutions that want to cooperate with you.

317
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,080
I dare not say that Dongyi is the most powerful in it.

318
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,720
But I promise that

319
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,520
the conditions we give you are the best.

320
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,040
In addition to the sufficient funding support,

321
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,360
in the direction of development,

322
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,800
you can have sufficient self-assertion

323
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,040
to the construction of the team members.

324
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,320
Dr. Jiang,

325
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,600
you have a dream about the treatment of the white skin.

326
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,360
I, Han Ting,

327
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,080
wish you a long life.

328
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,240
We will succeed in each other.

329
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,640
Let's work together.

330
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,640
Let's work together.

331
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,480
Actually,

332
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,480
ended leaving Chenan

333
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,120
after he had left the company.

334
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,440
Mr. Guan,

335
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,280
I was thinking when to accept

336
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,640
Mr. Guan's return to the company,

337
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
000 yuan in expiry date.

338
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,920
Yan Yu,

339
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,000
I willので with you for a long time,

340
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,280
I don't end up living on the same boat.

341
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,960
If made a big mistake,

342
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,400
I know you won't commit it.

343
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,840
I don't want to work.

344
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,640
Yes, it's her who's working.

345
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,080
But I'm afraid you'll be unhappy tomorrow.

346
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,360
I don't want to work.

347
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,560
I don't want to work.

348
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,240
If you don't want to work,

349
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,320
we won't work.

350
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,760
No one will support you.

351
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,560
No.

352
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,480
She wants to buy a house.

353
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,320
For our house.

354
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,440
Go back.

355
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,680
I'll get back to work.

356
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,800
I don't want to work tonight.

357
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,400
I'll be back now.

358
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,760
Fall asleep now.

359
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,480
Good night.

360
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,560
Good night.

361
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,800
Good night.

362
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,560
Hello.

363
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,600
I'm the species of branch wife,

364
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,400
Tang Song.

365
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,240
After that, I'll contact you,

366
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:22,520
در ادا او ام اداcida اضفغت delek

367
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,440
it's lettuce

368
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,860
sigh

369
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,980
Hey, alien!

370
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,660
Lian Lian, the TV station.

371
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,860
Laila Chong Chong Bian, the TV station.

372
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,860
Laila Chong Chong Bian, the TV station.

373
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,460
Laila Chong Chong Bian, the TV station.

374
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,460
Laila Chong Chong Bian, the TV station.

375
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,860
The water from the TV station, the first place in the country.

376
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,860
Tang Tengzhu, hello.

377
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,860
Thank you for helping me out today.

378
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,860
Don't mind.

379
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,860
Don't mind.

380
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,860
Is Tang Tengzhu your mom?

381
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,860
No, I'm Han Ting.

382
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,860
How could this be?

383
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,860
Han Ting!

384
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,860
How could this be?

385
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,860
Han Ting!

386
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,860
You're so mean!

387
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,860
Mr. Han, good night.

388
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,860
The End

389
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,860
You're so sweet.

390
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,860
Don't look at me.

391
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,860
Good morning.

392
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,860
The boss is a good guy.

393
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,860
He can't afford to get into trouble.

394
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,860
He can just take it easy.

395
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,860
Work.

396
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,860
The End

397
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,860
Go to the bathroom with me.

398
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,860
The End

399
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,860
The pigs were fired.

400
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,860
The sales department was very angry.

401
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,860
Plus, the president of the Ren'an Hospital

402
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,860
sent you flowers a few days ago.

403
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,860
Mr. Han's special assistant helped you yesterday.

404
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,860
Someone said on the Internet

405
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,860
some words about you.

406
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,860
It's hard to understand.

407
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,860
Don't look at me.

408
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,860
I'm blind.

409
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,860
I was harassed.

410
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,860
How could I get the wrong idea?

411
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,860
There's no right and wrong in the workplace.

412
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,860
It's just a profit.

413
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,860
Zhu Lei is the director of the sales department.

414
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,860
The department's business guarantee.

415
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,860
He's gone.

416
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,860
The KPI of the sales department can't be completed.

417
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,860
The whole department can't get the prize.

418
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,860
It must be not cool.

419
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,860
I can understand their department.

420
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,860
But the people in our department

421
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,860
I just met Mr. Chen.

422
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,860
He and Zhu Lei have a good relationship.

423
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,860
Zhu Lei has been fired.

424
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,860
Mr. Chen must be upset.

425
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,860
Our prize

426
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,860
is all in his hands.

427
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,860
How dare he?

428
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,860
Then I have to be completely isolated.

429
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,860
Don't be too sad.

430
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,860
I'm standing here.

431
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,860
It's just that we must contact

432
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,860
the WeChat at this time.

433
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,860
I'll give you the message.

434
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,860
No need.

435
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,860
I'm leaving.

436
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,860
Mr. Han.

437
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,860
Hello?

438
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,780
Hello,

439
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,540
What's wrong?

440
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,980
Mr. Han,

441
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,860
Mr. Han,

442
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,860
Mr. Han,

443
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,860
Mr. Han,

444
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,860
Mister Han.

445
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,820
Mr. Han,

446
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,860
Can Ji Xing still be on the stage?

447
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,180
If Han didn't take care of it himself,

448
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,020
could Tang Sezhu be on the stage yesterday?

449
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,940
Now, the news is spreading in the Internet.

450
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,860
No wonder.

451
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,540
I said yesterday was not a little bit dizzy.

452
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,380
He just opened the door.

453
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,060
The photos of the Internet are really clear.

454
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,420
On the day of the celebration,

455
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,620
Han was chatting with Ji Xing outside.

456
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,620
Oh, my God.

457
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,620
I thought

458
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,300
Mr. Han and Mr. Zeng are the same team.

459
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,620
I didn't expect that.

460
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,420
The boss's name is Xi Hao.

461
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,620
Don't guess.

462
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,420
Come in.

463
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,620
Mr. Zeng, you want to see me?

464
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,740
The news of the department

465
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,620
seems to be not good recently.

466
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,220
He is a bit shy.

467
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,220
No one expected that

468
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,820
he would make things so big.

469
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,820
He is so stubborn.

470
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,220
Zhu Lei was fired from the market.

471
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,220
But there were so many smooth cooperation methods that day.

472
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,020
It made the smooth image very affected.

473
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,620
Now, the company's content

474
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,620
is actually spreading the iron of the arrangement of Mr. Han.

475
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,220
Tell me.

476
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,820
How should I explain to Mr. Han?

477
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,820
Mr. Zeng, I am Ji Xing's leader.

478
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,420
I have the responsibility for this.

479
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,420
Ji Xing is Ji Xing, you are Ji Xing.

480
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,420
I can see your pay for the company.

481
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,420
I can't just leave the responsibility

482
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,420
because of a soldier's uniform.

483
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,020
But

484
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,420
you should think of something

485
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,220
to manage the staff.

486
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,220
So you mean...

487
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,020
Ji Xing,

488
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,420
Xiaobai is going to take the scene.

489
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,420
You take responsibility.

490
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,420
The speed is also going to be mentioned.

491
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:57,820
Okay.

492
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:58,620
Sit.

493
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,020
By the way,

494
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,420
recently,

495
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,620
everyone is busy with their work.

496
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,620
There are some work to be done in the first period.

497
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,820
You should go out.

498
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,620
Out?

499
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,820
You should go to the New Hong Kong Hospital.

500
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,820
Take Xiaobai's daily life as a nurse

501
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,820
and do the work of reducing the salary.

502
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,420
Mr. Chen, I am not done with my work.

503
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,220
And the maintenance should be done by the Ministry of Revenue.

504
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,020
The work of the Ministry of Revenue

505
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,220
is not easy to get over.

506
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,220
You know Xiaobai the best.

507
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,820
You should do this work.

508
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,420
It's not suitable for you.

509
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,020
You are colleagues.

510
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,620
You should help each other.

511
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,820
The company has given me such a high salary to do the research.

512
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,020
Now, I just have to run away.

513
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,820
Will it be not a good idea?

514
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,820
I am doing this for your own good.

515
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,420
If you do this work well,

516
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,220
it will be your job.

517
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,420
Okay, go back to work.

518
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,020
The data is all wrong.

519
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,620
You are not smart enough.

520
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,820
Do it again.

521
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,020
Tonight,

522
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,820
put the data in the mailbox as soon as possible.

523
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,620
Qi Xing,

524
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,020
organize it.

525
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,220
But everyone should hurry up.

526
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,620
Keep an eye on it.

527
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,220
Mr. Chen,

528
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,820
Xiaobai's plan

529
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,620
is not over yet.

530
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,620
I want to ask you about the advantages of these two things.

531
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,020
It's all important.

532
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,020
I told you to bring everyone here.

533
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,420
You didn't say you would do it yourself.

534
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,820
There are so many people here.

535
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,620
Just divide them into two.

536
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,220
It's your turn.

537
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,420
Mr. Chen told me a few days ago

538
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,420
that he would have a meal with some clients.

539
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,620
I am really not happy.

540
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,820
Mr. Chen.

541
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,020
Next time,

542
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,020
I will stay here

543
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,220
and work overtime with everyone.

544
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,620
Qi Xing.

545
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,020
Thank you.

546
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,220
You...

547
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,020
I have told the kids

548
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,620
not to work overtime and go out with him.

549
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,620
Besides,

550
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,020
it's not my fault.

551
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,020
Why do you want to work overtime?

552
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,420
I really don't understand.

553
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,020
Why do I have to

554
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,620
work overtime and go out with everyone?

555
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,620
The company doesn't give me the money.

556
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,220
Even the town is gone.

557
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,620
Why do we have to stay here?

558
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,220
The data and the calculation

559
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,420
are complicated.

560
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,220
Why do we have to work overtime with everyone?

561
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:04,820
That's right.

562
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,220
Why?

563
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:05,620
Why?

564
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,220
Why?

565
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,020
I am sorry.

566
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,420
We are all in the same team.

567
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,220
If there is a problem, we can solve it together.

568
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,020
If we don't care about it,

569
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,820
the project won't be promoted.

570
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,020
How about this?

571
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,220
Help us to divide the work.

572
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,620
Leave the data and the work to me.

573
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,020
Oh, oh, oh.

574
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,820
Some people

575
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,220
really regard themselves as the owner of Guanghua.

576
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,020
Why do you have to work overtime?

577
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,020
What are you talking about?

578
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,820
What if someone tells you about the company again?

579
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,820
What do you do?

580
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,620
Oh,

581
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,020
I have to work overtime again.

582
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,820
I am alone.

583
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,220
If the project can't be promoted,

584
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,020
the project will be promoted.

585
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,020
We can't get it.

586
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,820
This, this, this.

587
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,420
Everyone, stop talking.

588
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,420
Stop talking.

589
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,020
Stop talking.

590
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,420
If you didn't calculate the data,

591
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,020
how could you have a family?

592
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,620
I don't know.

593
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,620
I don't know.

594
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,620
I don't know.

595
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,620
I don't know.

596
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,620
I don't know.

597
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,620
I don't know.

598
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,620
I don't know.

599
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,620
I don't know.

600
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,620
I don't know.

601
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,620
I don't know.

602
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,620
I don't know.

603
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,620
I don't know.

604
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,620
I don't know.

605
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,620
I don't know.

606
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,620
I don't know.

607
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,620
I don't know.

608
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,620
I don't know.

609
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,620
I don't know.

610
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,620
I don't know.

611
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,620
I don't know.

612
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,620
I don't know.

613
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,620
I don't know.

614
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,620
I don't know.

615
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,620
I don't know.

616
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,620
I don't know.

617
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,620
I don't know.

618
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,620
I don't know.

619
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,620
I don't know.

620
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,620
I don't know.

621
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,620
I don't know.

622
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,620
I don't know.

623
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,620
Hurry up.

624
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,580
Ji Qing, we're done.

625
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,580
I'll send you a mail.

626
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,580
I'm leaving then.

627
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,220
Okay.

628
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,460
Ji Qing,

629
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,940
we'll send you a mail too.

630
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,660
Okay.

631
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,140
I'll send you one too.

632
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,500
Xiaotang, hurry up.

633
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,060
Okay.

634
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,980
I'll wait for you downstairs.

635
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,460
Xinxin,

636
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,980
I've finished my work.

637
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,180
If you're not done,

638
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,420
give me another part.

639
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:43,660
No,

640
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,620
you send me a mail and I'll handle it together.

641
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,460
Okay.

642
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,380
I'll stay with you for a while.

643
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,380
I'll be faster on my own.

644
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,700
You can go.

645
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,500
Okay.

646
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,220
I'm leaving.

647
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,700
Goodbye.

648
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,080
Dealing with Xiaodong

649
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,500
is the only option.

650
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,200
Please send me a letter that needs a sleep,

651
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:27,820
not me.

652
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:29,900
Okay.

653
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:30,660
Okay.

654
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,100
I'll arrive home after holding the mail.

655
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,740
What are you doing here?

656
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,820
Moved off work?

657
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,580
No,

658
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,460
we can still work at home.

659
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,220
not bad.

660
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,120
It's too late.

661
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,680
Too much work job.

662
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,940
I drag the project for a long time.

663
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,580
Go back and tell me

664
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,640
I'll wait for you.

665
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,740
But I will break away.

666
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,020
I don't need your permission.

667
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,260
All right.

668
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,220
Like for now,

669
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,900
let's go for a hike.

670
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,980
Stop.

671
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,660
Seven-leave Garlic Lemon yummys are yummys

674
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,400
It's a mine

675
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,920
it is my Union

676
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,280
Have you checked the skin out?

677
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,920
Yes.

678
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:12,440
You're not yet GW

679
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,160
years old yet have yet feedback from your dad?

680
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,040
Yes.

681
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,880
Now, remember that

682
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,800
dinner or match is a me所.

683
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,840
Waiter.

684
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,280
My lord.

685
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,080
Understand me.

686
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,060
Yes,uuu..

687
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,440
Congratulations

688
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:02,980
Congratulations

689
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,140
Ah

00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:04,520

Yeah you're welcome.

695
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,740
Du Hai,

696
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,420
I'm here to see you.

697
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,360
Manager Han,

there was no WORK base

701
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,280

702
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:25,860
Get ready!

Yes, I like it.

711
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,760
I can't take this.

712
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,520
I really don't like.

713
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,560

00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,660
If only four in the capital city

717
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,640
One person is not present

718
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,820
Be careful

719
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,760
Don't follow the project

Thank

721
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:33,480

723
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,580
OK

724
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,400
Thank you

725
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,880
Where should I go next?

726
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,000
Don't beil

727
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,720
Don't go

728
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,440
Don't go

729
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440

730
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
cries

731
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,960
engaged

732
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
They are

733
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,960
sending her to otherBalances

734
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,960

Ya wei

736
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,000
said

737
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,800
There are not enough evidence to prove the difference between the two parties.

738
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,200
The most annoying thing is that

739
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,000
they are all crazy.

740
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,300
What's the point of getting the evidence and just standing here and arguing?

741
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:36,400
I don't know if it's your intention to set up this man's new residence.

742
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,000
I didn't mean anything else.

743
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,200
You said that this kind of thing is not about public opinion,

744
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,900
it's not about public opinion.

745
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,300
But I heard that the ad was about

746
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,900
the woman.

747
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,500
What's the problem with her?

748
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,700
She was harassed by the wrong person.

749
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,300
I heard that you were investigating.

750
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,400
Just now, the ad was about having no evidence.

751
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,200
There was not enough evidence.

752
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,500
If there was a problem with the man, he would have been beaten up.

753
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,100
He could have asked everyone here to discuss it in the ad.

754
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,700
There's a saying that

755
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,000
the warehouse is big and the house is full of people.

756
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,100
I run around and pull the customers.

757
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,800
The food street, the bar, the street.

758
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,500
The woman is wearing the same clothes.

759
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,700
She's so cold.

760
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,400
She's so cold.

761
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,500
Isn't that the chance for the new residence to be a man?

762
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,500
When did the woman's clothes become the standard of the judge?

763
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,200
A man can't control himself. Why is he still a victim?

764
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,900
No, Miss, don't be angry.

765
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,900
We're discussing this matter.

766
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,300
I'm not talking about you.

767
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,200
You're just a witness.

768
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,500
I'm just saying that if this happens again,

769
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,700
there will be 50 big cases.

770
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,700
It's wrong for a man to take the case.

771
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,800
You're also wrong.

772
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,400
Stop the car.

773
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,100
Stop the car? It's raining. You can't stop the car.

774
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,600
Stop the car.

775
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,700
Hey.

776
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,200
If you don't stop, I'll complain about you.

777
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,400
Stop, stop, stop.

778
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,800
You're still running? You're still running?

779
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,000
What are you looking at?

780
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,400
What are you looking at?

781
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,200
What are you looking at?

782
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,600
What are you looking at?

783
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,800
What are you looking at?

784
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,200
What are you looking at?

785
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,400
What are you looking at?

786
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,800
What are you looking at?

787
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,200
What are you looking at?

788
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,400
What are you looking at?

789
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,600
What are you looking at?

790
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,200
What are you looking at?

791
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,600
What are you looking at?

792
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,200
What are you looking at?

793
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,400
What are you looking at?

794
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,800
What are you looking at?

795
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,200
What are you looking at?

796
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,400
What are you looking at?

797
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,000
What are you looking at?

798
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,600
What are you looking at?

799
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,200
What are you looking at?

800
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,000
What are you looking at?

801
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,600
What are you looking at?

802
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,000
What are you looking at?

803
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,400
What are you looking at?

804
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,800
What are you looking at?

805
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,400
What are you looking at?

806
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,000
What are you looking at?

807
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,800
What are you looking at?

808
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,600
What are you looking at?

809
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,400
What are you looking at?

810
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,000
What are you looking at?

811
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,800
What are you looking at?

812
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,600
What are you looking at?

813
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
What are you looking at?

814
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,600
What are you looking at?

815
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,800
What are you looking at?

816
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,600
What are you looking at?

817
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,000
What are you looking at?

818
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:29,020
ディヨ secret

819
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,600
You're drafty.

820
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,800
Now you come here.

821
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,600
Can you still forget

822
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,840
It's been ten years

823
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,760
No need.

824
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,360
Rel taste of myself.

825
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,880
She is shopping in a unruly luxury adjuster.

826
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,980
Tell them to this place to take a trip.

827
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,040
All the money for the repairs is

828
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,140
from my account.

829
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,340
Can I get it back?

830
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,940
I changed it when I was in college.

831
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,940
What's wrong?

832
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,820
Nothing.

833
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,460
Mr. Li,

834
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,300
Xiao Bai has been rescheduled.

835
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,540
There's nothing wrong with that.

836
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,980
Didn't your company just send people to come here a few days ago?

837
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,300
They sent people here again today.

838
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,140
Can't we finish them off in one go?

839
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,740
We're very busy in the hospital.

840
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,940
I'm sorry.

841
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,460
Next time, we'll be careful.

842
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,820
Ding Qi rescheduled Xiao Bai

843
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,940
just to get a job.

844
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,940
I'm sorry.

845
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,940
I'm sorry.

846
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,940
I'm sorry.

847
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,940
I'm sorry.

848
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,940
I'm sorry.

849
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:40,940
I'm sorry.

850
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,940
I'm sorry.

851
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,940
I'm sorry.

852
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,940
I'm sorry.

853
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,940
I'm sorry.

854
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,940
Ding Qi rescheduled Xiao Bai

855
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,940
just to get a better job in the hospital.

856
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,940
And it can also prevent

857
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,540
the loss of food when the second period is in the data collection.

858
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,540
I told your company before

859
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,540
that you wouldn't provide data for the second period of the second period of the machine.

860
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,940
Didn't you pass the test?

861
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,740
I'm from our technical department.

862
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,140
I didn't take responsibility for data collection work before.

863
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,540
Maybe some information hasn't been given to me yet.

864
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,340
Then may I ask

865
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,940
if there's any problem with the product in the process?

866
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,340
You can give it back to me directly.

867
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,140
I can adjust the problem.

868
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,940
That's good.

869
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,940
It's not a problem.

870
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,940
Then why...

871
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,140
Hello?

872
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,540
What?

873
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:27,940
Okay.

874
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,740
I'll report the problem right away.

875
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,140
Our hospital system has been in a critical condition.

876
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,740
I have to deal with it.

877
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,740
I won't send you off.

878
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,740
You can go back and talk to your leaders.

879
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,740
We won't cooperate with the second period of the machine.

880
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,740
Mr. Han, I didn't want to disturb you.

881
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,140
But we have personally assigned the operation to Hanmen.

882
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,740
Xingang Hospital is the first market hospital

883
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,740
in the world of medical doctors in the world.

884
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,740
Now that there's a problem,

885
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,740
the cooperation in the subsequent work is not good.

886
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,740
The engineer of Dr. Jiang Huai's office

887
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,940
is on his way back.

888
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,740
I'll be there soon.

889
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,740
Go to Xingang Hospital.

890
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,740
Okay.

891
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,940
Auntie, look here.

892
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,740
Let's get in here.

893
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,940
Bro, please wait here.

894
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,540
Look, we are here.

895
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,340
Hey, come over here.

896
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,540
Are you okay?

897
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:36,140
Grandma, are you okay?

898
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,540
Are you okay?

899
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,340
Little girl, thank you.

900
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,340
It's so hard to see the teeth.

901
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,340
It's been two hours.

902
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,340
It's a waste of time.

903
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,340
What should we do?

904
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,340
My teeth.

905
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,340
Director An Li,

906
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,340
the doctor's system is broken.

907
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,340
Can I go and have a look?

908
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:16,340
Let the understanding become a kind of adventure.

909
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:23,340
We are a couple.

910
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,340
We can't stop.

911
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,340
We are afraid that we will be pushed back.

912
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:33,340
We are afraid that we will be lost.

913
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:39,340
Let each other be fresh and safe.

914
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:45,340
We are strangers.

915
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:50,340
We can't stop.

916
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:57,340
We are afraid that we will be lost.

917
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,340
Let's not be afraid.

918
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:07,340
We are afraid that we will be lost.

919
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:17,340
Let's not be afraid.
