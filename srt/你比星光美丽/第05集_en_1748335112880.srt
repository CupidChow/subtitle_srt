1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I can't stand it anymore.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm afraid of the stars in the night sky.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I want to go to the end of my own life.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I forget myself.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I want to go to the sky.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I want to go to the ground.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sure I won't be afraid.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm afraid of the future.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid of the courage.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm afraid of the land in the sky.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sure I won't give up.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I will always believe in the miracle.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Even if I don't know, I'll follow.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Love Rem차

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,960
The爆 aa

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Night sky

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The End

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Episode 19

19
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,800
You're still up?

20
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,000
You're blowing the wind here?

21
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,000
I can't sleep. I'm out of breath.

22
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,160
What about you?

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,600
I can't sleep. I'm out of breath.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,920
You talk so imminently.

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,640
I was talking and though I was using voice service,

26
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,000
and thought cleverly,

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
everyone wasüyorum

28
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
to be with me.

29
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:32,760
Good Chinesere obtaining

30
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,520
primera means

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,640
artificial intelligence.

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,360
The only certainly

33
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,520
sense of belonging

34
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,800
is that

35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
But as long as you have a new dream,

36
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,800
even if you can make a little contribution to this world,

37
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
it's meaningful and extraordinary.

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Let everyone have a better life.

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,800
I think this is the meaning of developing medical science.

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
It's also the goal of our team's initial and final.

41
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
No matter how big the universe is,

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,800
it will become different because of this little effort.

43
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Thank you.

44
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
You still remember?

45
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
I also remember the smile of you at the award ceremony.

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,800
That was really good.

47
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,800
We were able to get a clear goal.

48
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,800
We could just take a direction and walk.

49
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Sometimes, it's too far away to walk.

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
You will forget the path you came from.

51
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
It's easy to have dreams at first.

52
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
But it's hard to hold on.

53
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,800
You only have to forget your original dream.

54
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,800
In the end, you can get what you want.

55
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,800
I will never forget you.

56
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
I've made up my mind.

57
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
You've made up your mind?

58
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,800
It's better for everyone to have a better life.

59
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
This is my original intention.

60
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Since you've made up your mind,

61
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
you can do it.

62
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Let's go.

63
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
It's getting late.

64
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
You also have to rest early.

65
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
It will get colder here later.

66
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Okay.

67
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Why didn't you come to the restaurant that day?

68
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
I was in a hurry.

69
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Then at least call me.

70
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
My fault.

71
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Bye-bye.

72
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Mr. Han.

73
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Why didn't you take Ms. Ji with you?

74
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
You can have a chat on the way.

75
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
It's okay.

76
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
We will have time to chat.

77
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Let's go.

78
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Okay.

79
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
How is it?

80
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
What do you mean?

81
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Did the hunt succeed?

82
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Mr. Han is not here to find you.

83
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
He is not here to find you.

84
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Mr. Han went to the fishing village

85
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
to find lazy people.

86
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Did he decide to accept your invitation?

87
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
He is still in the house.

88
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
I'm glad he didn't have any trouble.

89
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
He is very honest recently.

90
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
I think he was in Hong Kong Hospital

91
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
and solved the problem so quickly.

92
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
He is in a critical state.

93
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
He is in the hospital now.

94
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
I'll see you when you come back.

95
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Okay.

96
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Ms. Ji.

97
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Are you really going to

98
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
have a business with me?

99
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
No.

100
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
No?

101
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
I'm so happy.

102
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
I used to think that

103
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,800
as long as you pay for your technical work,

104
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
you can get as much return as possible.

105
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Then I realized

106
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
that's not all.

107
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
I went to the fishing village this time

108
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
and thought a lot about it.

109
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I think I've chosen the right person.

110
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
I think it's more important to choose the right person.

111
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
You're using my style again.

112
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Why are you so bright when you come back?

113
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Ji Qing wants to help you work.

114
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
He wants you to work hard.

115
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
You're not good at it.

116
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
You're looking for excuses, right?

117
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
You're smiling so happily.

118
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Ji Qing called you, right?

119
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
He should have received the notice of HR.

120
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
He's not in the hospital.

121
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
He's in the hospital.

122
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
He's in the hospital.

123
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
He's in the hospital.

124
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
He should have received the notice of HR.

125
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
He's not in the hospital.

126
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Hello?

127
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Mr. Han.

128
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
How is it?

129
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Did you receive the offer?

130
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Yes.

131
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Dong Yang's treatment is great.

132
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Thank you.

133
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,800
But I've decided to create my own business.

134
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Create your own business?

135
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
No matter what,

136
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
I'm grateful to you

137
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
and Dong Yi for your recognition.

138
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
I see.

139
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
You're going to start your own business?

140
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
This girl is interesting.

141
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Mr. Han went to Qingtian and Yucun

142
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,800
to exchange his business with his new business.

143
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
He started his own business.

144
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
Interesting.

145
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Go on.

146
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Hurry up.

147
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Sister Xing.

148
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
This is Dong Yi's outfit.

149
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
It's still Mr. Han's

150
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
hairpin.

151
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Are you sure you want to marry him?

152
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Since I made the choice,

153
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
I won't move.

154
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Sister Xing.

155
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
I won't let you down.

156
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Let's do this together.

157
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Let's do this.

158
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
By the way,

159
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
did you tell Yichen

160
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
about our business?

161
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
No. He hasn't come back yet.

162
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
He'll definitely support me

163
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
if I tell him

164
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
when he comes back.

165
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
What are you laughing at?

166
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
I thought you would be back in a minute.

167
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
I'll see you

168
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
as soon as I finish my work.

169
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Why didn't you pay for the hairpin?

170
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
I bought you a hairpin.

171
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
You've been on a business trip for too long.

172
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
You should come back later.

173
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
He doesn't pay for you.

174
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Let's eat at home tonight.

175
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Call Lili and them over.

176
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
I'll pick you up.

177
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Okay.

178
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
I think you're doing well.

179
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
I'm relieved.

180
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
I thought you'd be down

181
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
after you resigned.

182
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
I really want to talk to you about this.

183
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
I know.

184
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Are you going to

185
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
find a job

186
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
to do the treatment for the third brother?

187
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Half of it.

188
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
I'm going to do the treatment for the third brother.

189
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
But I want to start my own business.

190
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Xingxing.

191
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
It's not an easy thing to do.

192
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,800
I don't want you to

193
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
be impulsive

194
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
because of your consciousness.

195
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Yichen, don't worry.

196
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
I'm not impulsive.

197
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
I'm not impulsive.

198
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
I've thought about it very seriously.

199
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Xingxing.

200
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
You resigned just now.

201
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
I hope you can

202
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
rest at home for a while.

203
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
I'll think about it carefully.

204
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Okay?

205
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
I know it's not easy to start a business.

206
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
But it's not easy

207
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
to go to other companies to work.

208
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
It's not easy.

209
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
It's okay.

210
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Just do it slowly.

211
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
At least,

212
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
you can do what I want to do.

213
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
You...

214
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Xingxing.

215
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
You have to know

216
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
that no matter what decision you make,

217
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
I will support you unconditionally.

218
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
After all, your boyfriend

219
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
is a promising doctor.

220
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
He should be able to help you a lot.

221
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
But I hope

222
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
you can decide after you think about it.

223
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Or

224
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
you can think about our future.

225
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Maybe

226
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
you will have other ideas.

227
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
He really...

228
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
He really doesn't care about me.

229
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
You...

230
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
I...

231
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
I...

232
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
I...

233
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
I...

234
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
I...

235
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
I...

236
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
I...

237
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
I...

238
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
I...

239
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
I...

240
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
I...

241
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
I...

242
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
I...

243
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
I...

244
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
I...

245
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
I...

246
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
I...

247
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
I...

248
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
I...

249
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
I...

250
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
I didn't eat

251
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
the sour and spicy fish you made for a long time.

252
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Then you have to eat more later.

253
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
It smells so good.

254
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
It looks so good.

255
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Qiu Zi is here.

256
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Here you are, Qiu Zi.

257
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
Long time no see.

258
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Yichen is here.

259
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
You can come in.

260
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
I have some cooking in there.

261
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Okay.

262
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Qiu Zi, why are you so late?

263
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Aren't you working overtime

264
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
for the food?

265
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
I recently opened a new course

266
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
in the yard.

267
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
I will change my high score

268
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
and report it to you.

269
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Here, take it.

270
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800
I will bring you something to eat.

271
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
I will put it in the plate.

272
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Okay.

273
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
That's great.

274
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
It's okay.

275
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
You don't have to, Qiu Zi.

276
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
Just put it here.

277
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
I can do it myself.

278
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
It's okay.

279
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
I will help you.

280
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Qiu Zi, please bring me

281
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
the plate.

282
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Okay.

283
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Thank you.

284
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Cheers!

285
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Didn't you say

286
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
you have something to announce?

287
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
What is it?

288
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Are you going to announce it now?

289
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Okay.

290
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
This is very important.

291
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
I am 28 years old this year.

292
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
If I am in the swimming pool,

293
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
I might not be able to make it.

294
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
I am going to prepare

295
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
a wedding for you.

296
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
I am going to prepare

297
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
a wedding for you.

298
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
A wedding?

299
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
A wedding?

300
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
A wedding?

301
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
I thought you were going to announce the wedding.

302
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
I am going to prepare a wedding.

303
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
A wedding is not worth a wedding.

304
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,800
You forgot that I have a business experience.

305
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
Besides, I don't want to go.

306
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
No.

307
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
You can rest.

308
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
You don't have to go to the business.

309
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
I told you

310
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
I went to the Qingtian Fish Village last time.

311
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
I saw an old lady

312
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
who was delayed

313
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
because she didn't need to be booked.

314
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
She was delayed for a lifetime.

315
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
For a lifetime,

316
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
if you can book a place

317
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
for three-dimensional medical treatment,

318
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
you can make these people live better.

319
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
That is the meaning and goal of my business.

320
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
I am going to prepare a wedding for you.

321
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
I am so tired.

322
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Hey, Alien.

323
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
Alien, Alien.

324
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Alien, Alien.

325
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Alien, Alien.

326
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Alien, Alien.

327
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Alien, Alien.

328
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Alien, Alien.

329
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Alien, Alien.

330
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Alien, Alien.

331
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Alien, Alien.

332
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
The top of the national sum.

333
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,160
I think this ooze directly from the day before that there are forced to plead

334
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,760
But you essentials are important

335
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,360
Blood is still water

336
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:45,920
I am nothing

337
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,880
no

338
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,280
Just think about it

339
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,640
I just want to try

340
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,720
and whose background,

341
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,520
my friends would leave.

342
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,720
I understand

343
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,240
only your between will andなら's what you meant while the other one helps you.

344
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,200
Didn't you say

345
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,440
the other person supported you

346
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,320
to do well?

347
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,280
XIRU.

348
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,080
Y whom you lost

349
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,840
just now

350
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,280
was bought a new one for her

351
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,200
after you Stress 적.,

352
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,360
You haven't really

353
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,560
become so important yet.

354
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,800
Not even a great achievement

355
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,840
can pull one hair

356
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,160
in a woman's hair?

357
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,640
Because

358
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,320
you are a narrow-minded girl.

359
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,400
Genius.

360
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,360
When did you

361
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,760
I don't want to die there.

362
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,760
Besides,

363
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,040
what if I'm alive?

364
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,960
Since you've decided,

365
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,440
I have no conditions.

366
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,840
It seems no one can persuade you.

367
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,560
How's my talk with your junior?

368
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,040
We'll talk about the general plan in the future.

369
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,320
If you have any questions

370
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,600
about the market or the sales,

371
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,440
just ask me.

372
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,320
If you have any questions about the materials,

373
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,160
just ask me.

374
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,000
Xinxing,

375
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,560
if your company needs

376
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,600
the representative of the main department,

377
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,640
I'll be there in 24 hours.

378
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,360
You're always in need of the representative.

379
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,320
I'm sure

380
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,760
I've never done anything bad in my life.

381
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,920
I can only meet you.

382
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,080
Cheers.

383
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,240
Cheers.

384
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,760
Cheers.

385
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,440
Here.

386
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:18,760
Here.

387
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:18,920
Here.

388
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,120
Here.

389
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,560
My angel-like group

390
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,920
is my blessing.

391
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
My blessing.

392
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,360
And Yichen.

393
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,600
Cheers.

394
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,760
Xinxing,

395
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,840
you're lucky

396
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,080
to have a boyfriend like him.

397
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,800
He can support you

398
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,840
in both skill and spirit.

399
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,160
Wait a minute.

400
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,360
My dear.

401
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,800
You should support him

402
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,920
on the money.

403
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,560
He's supposed to pay for it.

404
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,520
Use it first.

405
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,600
Every successful woman

406
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,640
has a man who's lonely.

407
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,840
Xinxing,

408
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,360
do you have to show him?

409
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,240
A man like him

410
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,040
can give me a man like him.

411
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,120
No.

412
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,880
He only has one.

413
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,040
He's mine.

414
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,280
But he seems to have a long-haired cousin.

415
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,800
He's so handsome and handsome.

416
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,880
You'll like him.

417
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,240
I...

418
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,000
You can arrange one for me.

419
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Do you want to drink with me?

420
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,920
We'd better drink.

421
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,720
Cheers.

422
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,440
Do you have so many siblings?

423
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,000
Yes.

424
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,280
Hurry up.

425
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,560
Let's go.

426
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
Come on.

427
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,880
We're all gone.

428
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,120
How many did you drink just now?

429
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,320
Yichen.

430
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,200
Okay.

431
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,720
Put it here.

432
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,040
Yichen.

433
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,880
Do you really only do business?

434
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
I don't think Xinxing can do it.

435
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,880
I'm just worried that she'll have a hard time.

436
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,880
She can't walk well before she starts.

437
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
I've been doing it for a long time

438
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
after I've been through a lot.

439
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,880
Xinxing is very busy.

440
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,880
It's good to find something for her.

441
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
If she's gone,

442
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,880
it's okay.

443
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,880
I'll keep it for her.

444
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
So, Yichen.

445
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,880
You think Xinxing won't succeed in her business.

446
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,880
You just want her to do something.

447
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
You don't know Xinxing's personality.

448
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,880
She's not strong and not dead.

449
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,880
Why don't you let her try it?

450
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
If she has this obsession,

451
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,880
she can't calm down.

452
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
You know, you're so thoughtful.

453
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,880
It's really happy to be with you today.

454
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
Just say it.

455
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Boss.

456
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,880
Miss Ji is downstairs to help you.

457
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Do you want to come up and have a look?

458
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,880
No need.

459
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Boss, come on.

460
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Who said I'm going to find her?

461
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

462
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
No need.

463
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,880
I'll send all the files to the office.

464
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,880
I'll send them to the office.

465
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
I'll send them to the network.

466
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
If you don't understand anything,

467
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
you can call me anytime.

468
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Don't worry.

469
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
I'll miss you.

470
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
What should I do?

471
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
I can't talk to you.

472
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
Of course you miss her.

473
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
After she left,

474
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
no one will give you a ride.

475
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Speaking of this,

476
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
someone should be more reluctant than me.

477
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880
You're a big deal.

478
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,880
A big deal?

479
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
Weiwei,

480
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
remember to give me the new one,

481
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Xiaobai's application plan to the leader.

482
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,880
I know.

483
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,880
I just want to say

484
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Xiaobai needs to be in the hospital

485
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
more than the hospital.

486
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
She's leaving.

487
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
She's still thinking about work.

488
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
She's going to make us pay for this.

489
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
This is some of Xiaobai's new income

490
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,880
in my three years.

491
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
I hope you can keep her company.

492
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
Xiaobai is leaving it to you.

493
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Ji Qing, you have a long term job.

494
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
You can do whatever you want.

495
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
Take care of yourself.

496
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
I'll be back.

497
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Goodbye.

498
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
Hello.

499
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Hello, Xiaoxiang.

500
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Why did you put the bank card back?

501
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,880
I've calculated it before.

502
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Now

503
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,880
my savings can be paid here.

504
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880
That card is stored there now.

505
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
I'll look for it.

506
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
When you need it,

507
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
tell me anytime.

508
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Okay.

509
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Xiaoxiang,

510
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,880
I'll always be your strongest partner.

511
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
Then you can go ahead.

512
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
Okay.

513
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,880
Bye.

514
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
Want a piece of strawberry cake?

515
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,880
You haven't changed.

516
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
You're in a bad mood.

517
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Mr. Han.

518
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
Liao Liao.

519
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Thank you.

520
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,880
You're welcome.

521
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
Are you sure you're going to start your business?

522
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
Which direction are you going to go?

523
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,880
I'll go with the 3D1.

524
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Mr. Han, what's your name?

525
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
I'm not going to call you.

526
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,880
You just need to go to the creative industry.

527
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,880
You can't get up and go to the heaven if you don't call me.

528
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
I know.

529
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,880
I rejected Dongye.

530
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,880
I'm not good at it.

531
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
No.

532
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,880
The choice of the career is your freedom.

533
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
I'm here to see

534
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,880
how you'll fail.

535
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,880
I want to give the creative companies

536
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
a little bit of confidence.

537
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
What's wrong with you?

538
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
How do you know I'll fail?

539
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
First, with your current financial strength,

540
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,880
it's difficult to be a better office worker.

541
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
Plus, the daily sales and sales are high.

542
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
The employees' salary will also be high.

543
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,880
Although I don't have money for you,

544
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,880
I'm still a little impatient

545
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,880
for so many years.

546
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
I can still support you for a while.

547
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
The creative industry is like

548
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,880
participating in a competition.

549
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
Once you start, you can't stop.

550
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,880
How long can your money last?

551
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
Money.

552
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
Then just have the money.

553
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,880
You've talked to the investors.

554
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
The investors are all fools.

555
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
There are many people who are fools.

556
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,880
You don't have anything now.

557
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
What kind of money do you take?

558
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
I'm confident in my partner.

559
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,880
I've been doing treatment for the machine.

560
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,880
I suddenly transferred to the 3D treatment.

561
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
Why do I think you'll succeed?

562
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,880
Mr. Han,

563
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,880
did you also have a sharp tongue before you left the country?

564
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,880
People will change with the environment.

565
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
I'm leaving.

566
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
I'm leaving.

567
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,880
Hello.

568
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,880
Boss,

569
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
Dr. Jiang called me to ask

570
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
when Miss Ji was working at the company.

571
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
I can't tell her.

572
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
Tell her

573
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,880
I'll find someone else who is suitable.

574
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,880
You're just talking about the house.

575
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
Yes.

576
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
This is the living area of our company.

577
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
When did you find it?

578
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
Is it expensive?

579
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,880
Don't worry. No house.

580
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,880
My dad's house was here in the early years.

581
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
For him,

582
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,880
this house has a special meaning.

583
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
For me,

584
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
our business here

585
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,880
is a success.

586
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
Thank you, uncle.

587
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,880
This house looks like a water treasure.

588
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
I think so too.

589
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,880
Let's open the door for the company.

590
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
Let's go.

591
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,880
Okay.

592
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
Are you okay?

593
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
It's quite big.

594
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
It's just a little messy.

595
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
It used to be a dry office.

596
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,880
It's not much.

597
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,880
It's okay.

598
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,880
Just clean it up.

599
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
Zhizhou,

600
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,880
I saved some money these years.

601
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
There are 400,000 yuan here.

602
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
Let's start the fund together.

603
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
No.

604
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
We agreed before.

605
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
I'll take care of the fund.

606
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,880
You've provided the office location.

607
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,880
I have to do something, right?

608
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
And since I decided to do it,

609
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,880
I didn't want to leave a mark on myself.

610
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
I'm sorry.

611
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
I didn't want to leave a mark on myself.

612
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
Xing,

613
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,880
I understand what you mean.

614
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,880
But this money is your payment for the house, right?

615
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,880
My dad used it first.

616
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
It's been a few months.

617
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
And my dad said

618
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
he prepared a surprise for me.

619
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,880
Let me find it.

620
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
Zhizhou's relative.

621
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
My dad's name.

622
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
It's quite thin.

623
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,880
I guess it's a paper.

624
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
Zhizhou,

625
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
I won't give you money.

626
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
I'm ready for you.

627
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,880
All the things in this house

628
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,880
are for your dad's creation.

629
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
I'll support you.

630
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
Please protect them.

631
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
If you ever start a business,

632
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
you'll be given up.

633
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
If you can't bear it,

634
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,880
come back and do the storage.

635
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
I'll call you.

636
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
I won't answer your call.

637
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
What's this?

638
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,880
I'm paying for the fund.

639
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
I'm paying for the fund.

640
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
I'm paying for the fund.

641
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
I'm paying for the fund.

642
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
I'm paying for the fund.

643
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,880
How long can you take this?

644
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
No, Xing.

645
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,880
My dad really said

646
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
he'd support me.

647
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
Otherwise,

648
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
I wouldn't have pulled your business.

649
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
No, no.

650
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
I can't take this money.

651
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
How about this?

652
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
When I was in college,

653
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
I often wrote a small letter to Zhuang Ai Kuan.

654
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,880
I made money while

655
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
I was maintaining the company's reputation.

656
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
How can you support a company

657
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,880
by only relying on Zhuang Ai Kuan?

658
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,880
Just listen to me.

659
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,880
Your dad has already supported you.

660
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,880
This is the fund.

661
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
If you think you have a burden,

662
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,880
we'll work harder in the future.

663
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
Otherwise,

664
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
we'll lose the money.

665
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
Xing.

666
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
I'll work hard with you.

667
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Okay.

668
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,880
Let's start from cleaning.

669
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
Go.

670
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
My god.

671
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Be careful.

672
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
It's a lift.

673
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
Okay.

674
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
This is a big deal.

675
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,880
Okay.

676
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,880
I'll buy a new machine.

677
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,880
This is the factory.

678
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
Which one do you want?

679
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
I'll do this.

680
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
I'll work here.

681
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,880
Okay. I'll do this.

682
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
Xing.

683
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,880
Now you're our manager.

684
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
Stop.

685
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
Although we don't have a office,

686
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
we still have a office.

687
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
You'll see.

688
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,880
This one will be yours.

689
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
We'll work hard in the future.

690
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,880
You can sit here.

691
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
Sit here.

692
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
This is the big deal.

693
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,880
I'll do this.

694
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,880
I'll give you a massage.

695
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
I'll do this.

696
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,880
Hello, Zhizhou.

697
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
I'll do this myself.

698
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
Come here.

699
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,880
Xing.

700
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
Right.

701
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
This is the price.

702
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
I'll buy a big one.

703
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
A big one.

704
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
A big one.

705
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
A big one.

706
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
A big one.

707
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
What's the name of the shop?

708
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,880
It's a small shop.

709
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
It's a beautiful shop.

710
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,880
We might have more customers.

711
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,880
We'll make it for you.

712
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,880
The shop is over there.

713
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,880
There's a meeting room here.

714
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,880
This is the bed.

715
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,880
You can take a break and rest.

716
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,880
You can stay here.

717
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
I'm not resting.

718
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
I'm working.

719
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
I hope you can sit here.

720
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,880
Oh, right.

721
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
There's another place.

722
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
Take off your clothes.

723
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
Xing.

724
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Come here.

725
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
Come here.

726
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
I'm here.

727
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
Right here.

728
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,880
Xing.

729
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
Are you tired today?

730
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
Yes.

731
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
I'm tired.

732
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
I'll go to the market today.

733
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
But I'm very busy.

734
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,880
And happy.

735
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
You should take a break.

736
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,880
Your body is the signature.

737
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,800
Yichen, you know what?

738
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,000
Our company has a big rooftop.

739
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,200
It's so beautiful.

740
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,520
After cleaning up today,

741
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,080
I saw

742
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,920
the city lights and the stars.

743
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,840
At that moment, I felt

744
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,120
that was where my dream started.

745
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,680
Next time, I'll invite you to our company

746
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,000
to see the stars, okay?

747
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,560
I don't need to go to other places

748
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,480
because I can see

749
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,200
the most beautiful stars every day.

750
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,160
Boss.

751
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,440
It's hard to pretend that you don't know.

752
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,680
Xing, here comes someone.

753
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
This is Shang Gao Feng.

754
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,400
This is Xia Lan.

755
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,280
They are my junior colleagues.

756
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
This is Xing,

757
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,920
the founder of Xing Chen Technology,

758
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,920
who I often mention to you.

759
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,280
Hello, Mr. Ji.

760
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,080
Hello, Xia.

761
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:16,880
Hello, Xia.

762
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,480
Hello, Mr. Ji.

763
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,520
Welcome.

764
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,080
Xing Chen is the founder of Xing Chen Technology.

765
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,600
We'll work hard in the future.

766
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,160
Don't be so formal.

767
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,280
We'll be

768
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,640
a little partner in the future.

769
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,320
This is your position.

770
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,000
You can choose.

771
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,920
I'll sit here.

772
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,480
Okay.

773
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,880
Can we drink this soda water?

774
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,400
Of course.

775
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,320
I prepared it for you.

776
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:36,960
Thank you.

777
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,120
Okay.

778
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,560
Now, it's time to serve.

779
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,960
We need two hands to work.

780
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,800
I'll go to the financing with Zhizhou.

781
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,040
You two should study

782
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,400
the concept of our main product.

783
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,480
Then, we'll come up with a design plan for a model product.

784
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,200
Okay.

785
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,640
If you don't know anything about technology,

786
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,120
you can ask me and Xing at any time.

787
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:53,960
No problem.

788
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,440
No problem.

789
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,960
Zhizhou, I've collected some

790
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,680
investment companies and investors' information.

791
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,400
Come here and take a look.

792
00:33:59,520 --> 00:33:59,960
Okay.

793
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,200
how about hieroglyphical chicluk?

794
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,280
Are you having a heart type thatHD here?

795
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,040
how about hieroglyphics?

796
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,680
What you mean is

797
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,000
How did you get this fort?

798
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:22,480
What you mean was

799
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,480
what you mean by

800
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,840
how I got thispetaculate chicluk.

801
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:25,800
Money to be used for investing

802
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,400
comes from a business plan.

803
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,120
How Gritサs

804
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,640
comes in thispetaculate chicluk?

805
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,800
You're a investor, right?

806
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,640
Don't know예요

807
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:32,780
However,

808
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,000
what I want and what you want,

809
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,920
I'm asking you.

810
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,960
I'm a investor

811
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,520
and has an exhaustive type.

812
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,200
I can enable you

813
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,240
to make you use my 100%

814
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,560
to get the human pulse.

815
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,840
After all,

816
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,760
my resources are still very rich.

817
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,240
Don't go.

818
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,280
Don't go.

819
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,640
Come back.

820
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,840
Do you have any sand?

821
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,840
The empty hand is white.

822
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,400
When the scout is in the key room,

823
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,960
we can see the clothes' position.

824
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,680
Then we can upgrade the color.

825
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,800
We can see the specific position of the clothes

826
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,080
in the air.

827
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,160
Including the whole operation process.

828
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,240
The general manager.

829
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,600
What are you doing?

830
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,920
Give me the phone.

831
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,440
What?

832
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:20,880
Give it to me.

833
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
What are you doing?

834
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:24,880
Kill him.

835
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,880
The opportunity is on the line.

836
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,040
I like your project.

837
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,120
As long as you find the leader,

838
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,720
I'll steal 100 million.

839
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,680
If you find the leader,

840
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,760
call me.

841
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,160
Okay, okay.

842
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,760
Goodbye.

843
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,600
Take care.

844
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
The emergency reality.

845
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,440
Hello.

846
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,440
Hello.

847
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,160
It's been four hours.

848
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,920
Can you ask President Liu

849
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,280
when you have time?

850
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,840
Okay, let me ask you.

851
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,680
Hello.

852
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,400
Is President Liu free now?

853
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,640
The technology of the Star City.

854
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,440
Okay.

855
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,200
Sorry, President Liu is having a meeting now.

856
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,680
How about this?

857
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,760
Can you give this to President Liu

858
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,360
when he is free?

859
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,480
Please take a look at it.

860
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:29,920
Okay.

861
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,440
Okay.

862
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:30,880
Thank you.

863
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,920
You must teach me.

864
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:32,800
Okay.

865
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,560
Thank you.

866
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,760
You two are so perfect.

867
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,760
One just proposed to make a soft-witted combination.

868
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,200
The other one started to create a 3D printing.

869
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm trying to make up for it.

870
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,120
Do you want to consider making a bet?

871
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,720
Let's talk about it.

872
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,120
Miss Qi.

873
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,080
The Star City is a business that is out of business.

874
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,800
The flow is not enough.

875
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,680
According to the rules of our bank,

876
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,040
it's impossible to force the loan.

877
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,160
Okay, okay.

878
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:19,920
I see.

879
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,160
The business is like a competition of a competition.

880
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,320
Once it starts, it can't stop.

881
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,720
How long can your money last?

882
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,240
I've seen the model product plan of Xiaoshan and Xiaoxia.

883
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,440
Xiaoxia is completely optimistic about technology.

884
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,080
She can directly apply for the model product.

885
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,080
Xiaoshan is not as good as Xiaoxia.

886
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,560
But she is very good.

887
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,600
I think

888
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,800
she can help Xiaoxia

889
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,280
to make some basic assistance,

890
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,760
including a single-day job.

891
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,200
It's just that our investment is not in place.

892
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,360
We can't buy a machine.

893
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,960
Even if the model product is made,

894
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,960
you can't push it forward to work.

895
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,800
Zhizhou, I think we...

896
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,560
I'll call you back.

897
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,200
Hello.

898
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,840
Miss Ji, I'm Tang Song.

899
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,480
Mr. Han wants to ask you to meet him at 11 a.m. tomorrow.

900
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,800
Do you have time?

901
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,440
I have something to do tomorrow.

902
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,720
I can't come.

903
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,440
Please tell Mr. Han.

904
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,640
Okay.

905
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,720
Thank you.

906
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,000
Who is this?

907
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,480
The assistant of Han Ting.

908
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,360
He wants to meet us.

909
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,360
Han Ting?

910
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,400
Is he Dong Yi's Han Ting?

911
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,720
My goodness, Xing.

912
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,040
Why didn't you go?

913
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,480
What if Mr. Han wants to invest in us?

914
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,760
I don't know.

915
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,560
He wants me to go to Dongyang.

916
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,520
I refused him.

917
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,600
He still wants to fight.

918
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,640
I'm quite good at it.

919
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,800
Xing.

920
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,760
Dong Yi.

921
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,040
Han Ting.

922
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,440
How about this?

923
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,240
We'll go to him and ask him to invest.

924
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,480
We are in this situation now.

925
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,240
Can you give it a try?

926
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,600
You try.

927
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
What if Han Ting changes her mind?

928
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,520
If not, I'll go to him.

929
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,320
Thank you.

930
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,520
I just refused.

931
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,080
What's the matter?

932
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,080
You just said

933
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,680
we thought about it and still want to go.

934
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,200
Xing.

935
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,360
Think about the Star Ocean.

936
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,680
I'll go to Dong Yi at 11 a.m. tomorrow.

937
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
Okay.

938
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,360
Okay.

939
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,040
See you at 11 a.m. tomorrow.

940
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,560
Oh, yeah.

941
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,560
I'll go there too.

942
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
You said you can fight like a city.

943
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,960
I hope so.

944
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,360
It's so hard.

945
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,560
Please come this way.

946
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,320
Please wait here.

947
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,520
Mr. Han will be here soon.

948
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,360
Please sit.

949
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,160
Okay. Thank you.

950
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:17,760
Thank you.

951
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
Xing.

952
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,840
This office is bigger than the Star Ocean.

953
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,600
It's so high.

954
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,160
If my office is this big,

955
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,560
I wouldn't dare to think about it.

956
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,320
Xing.

957
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,160
His Weibo is so big.

958
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,600
His Weibo is a sea hotel.

959
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
Look.

960
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,960
Why does our company like this place?

961
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,960
It's so empty.

962
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,160
Mr. Han.

963
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,160
Mr. Han.

964
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,160
This is...

965
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,200
This is our partner.

966
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Mr. Han.

967
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
There are lots of peaches in the newspaper.

968
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,760
You can't see what части those leaves look like

969
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,480
from the newspaper.

970
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,920
Because we need a newming member

971
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
Just you and me

972
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,100
What's this

973
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,540
My first word is

974
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:53,500
This is a gong

975
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,380
Buy车

976
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,520
Hurry up

977
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,320
You don't have a gong

978
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,340
Or everyone will sound เด่ gö

979
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,940
Come on

980
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,900
Everybody next door

981
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,660
Come on

982
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,300
Everybody here

983
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,180
Say it

984
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,420
But now, we need less money.

985
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,300
You want to make money with this PBT?

986
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,220
As a investor, you're a angel.

987
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,220
I don't mean your ability.

988
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,460
But if you want to show off,

989
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,940
why don't you come to Dongyi to do a 3D treatment?

990
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,380
Dongyi is going to build a special

991
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,300
3D treatment department.

992
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,580
You're the project director.

993
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,740
Lock the company's buildings

994
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,820
and the streets to develop projects for them.

995
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,780
Once you came to the Answers,

996
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,700
issues areQué

997
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,340
re-се 빵 khai.

998
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,180
I know the dream is to becentralized.

999
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,740
But dream must be fulfilled

1000
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,900
as long as we are around.

1001
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,580
You can't create a business.

1002
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:15,580
Then, where do you think our problem is?

1003
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,580
Even if you have technology and talent,

1004
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,580
you can also pretend that your equipment and funds are in place.

1005
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,580
It's a problem that is as famous as it is.

1006
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,580
You need to run, manage, and get a loan.

1007
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,580
You lack the management experience.

1008
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,580
You don't have the people in the industry.

1009
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,580
You don't have sales and get a loan.

1010
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,580
You didn't get to use what to make the product into the market.

1011
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,580
Mr. Han.

1012
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,580
Thank you for reminding me.

1013
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,580
I have already written it down.

1014
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,580
I will reflect and make up for it when I go back.

1015
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:50,580
I also thank you for your great help in the delivery.

1016
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,580
You can see that this is your focus and concern for me.

1017
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,580
But since Mr. Han doesn't want to take the lead,

1018
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,580
I won't bother you.

1019
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,580
I hope we can work together in other places.

1020
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,580
After all, it's a joke.

1021
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,580
If you don't want to be a lover, you can be one.

1022
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,580
No love.

1023
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,580
Business is not a friend, it's an enemy.

1024
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:06,580
If you can get closer to me,

1025
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:13,580
can you remember the beginning and end of the memory?

1026
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,580
Time goes by so fast,

1027
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,580
let the lonely light be safe,

1028
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:28,580
don't let the understanding become a adventure.

1029
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:35,580
We are a couple,

1030
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,580
we can't stop,

1031
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:42,580
we are afraid of being separated,

1032
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,580
we are afraid of being separated,

1033
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,580
let the other person be trusted,

1034
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,580
let the other person be trusted,

1035
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:57,580
pretend to be innocent,

1036
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:02,580
let us stay as a couple,

1037
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:07,580
let our love be a part of it,

1038
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:12,580
let's not be afraid,

1039
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,580
let the other person be trusted,

1040
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,580
let the other person be trusted,

1041
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:24,580
let the other person be trusted,

1042
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:29,580
let's not be afraid.
