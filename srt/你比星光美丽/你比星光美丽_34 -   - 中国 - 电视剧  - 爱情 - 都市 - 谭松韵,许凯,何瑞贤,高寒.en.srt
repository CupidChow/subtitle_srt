00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,230
Ms. Han, how about I take care of you?

24
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,120
OK.

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,790
Linjia, I don't need a carer

26
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,870
for 24 hours a day.

27
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,120
When she doesn't do live streaming,

28
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,510
she can come and help me.

29
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,120
Thank you, Miss Xiaomeng.

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,680
Not at all, Ms. Han.

31
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,710
I can do live streaming any time I want.

32
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,560
Now, nothing matters

33
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,150
more than your health.

34
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,480
You're such a kind girl.

35
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,760
It is our luck

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,430
to have known you.

37
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,310
Really? You can come?

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
No problem.

39
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,150
Thank you, then.

40
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,710
Not at all.

41
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,800
How about this? You go downstairs and talk.

42
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,120
See which day she will come

43
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,560
and make the schedule.

44
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,520
Off you go.

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,430
Take more rest, Ms. Han.

46
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,470
OK. Thanks.

47
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,310
You're welcome.

48
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,910
Come when you have time.

49
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,270
Have more rest.

50
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,590
Close the door.

51
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,430
OK.

52
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,240
I didn't expect Liu

53
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,800
to look so real.

54
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,360
I even believe her.

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,580
(Dongyang Group)

56
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,360
(Hanhai Xingchen)
OK. I'll find another way.

57
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,360
Thanks anyway.

58
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,080
Give me the last packet.

59
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
Mr. Su, it's the last packet.

60
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,870
- I can't give it to you.
- What are you doing?

61
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,920
Li.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,840
Miss Li.

63
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,400
Miss Li.

64
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,840
You guys stayed here all night?

65
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,520
Why are you here so early?

66
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Miss Li, let me tell you some good news.

67
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,910
Led by Mr. Su,

68
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,710
we've worked out

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,870
a secret weapon.

70
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,520
What secret weapon?

71
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,150
It's the secret

72
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,310
I told you about.

73
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,360
Xing upgraded the printer

74
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,680
and improved the printing speed.

75
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,150
So, I thought

76
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,750
we should start with hardware.

77
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,710
Mr. Su,

78
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,520
don't understate it.

79
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,800
Miss Li,

80
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,080
this is something really great.

81
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
Now, Hanhai

82
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,470
prints the products

83
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,310
with two laser heads.

84
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,280
When Mr. Su led us

85
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,430
to do maintenance work outside,

86
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,680
we found that some companies

87
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,150
were using four laser heads

88
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,560
to have better efficiency.

89
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,910
But the stability is poor.

90
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,150
The cooperation of the X
and Y axes is low, too.

91
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,120
The yield then declines.

92
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,710
But Mr. Su led us

93
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,840
to have upgraded the hardware

94
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,400
with engineers of Beidi.

95
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,470
Now, we're able

96
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,150
to print as stably as before

97
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,840
with four laser heads.

98
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,800
To put it simply,

99
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,430
the printing time

100
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,680
has been reduced by at least a third.

101
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,870
Based on the original schedule,

102
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,390
it would be completed the day after tomorrow.

103
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,230
But Miss Li,

104
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,720
you have a batch of products

105
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,160
to be printed urgently, right?

106
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,800
So, Mr. Su worked overtime with us.

107
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Working all night long,

108
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,430
we upgraded

109
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,480
our printers.

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,430
I negotiated with Mr. Qian.

111
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,680
We have a maximum extension of one day.

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,560
When the printers are upgraded,

113
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,720
can the products be printed

114
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,120
before the date of delivery?

115
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,870
After we have a meeting

116
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,000
with Division 1,

117
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,160
we can first upgrade

118
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,190
some equipment.

119
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,630
If the commissioning succeeds,

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,040
I think we can.

121
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,560
Well done, Mr. Su.

122
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,480
You've not only helped my department

123
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,870
but also increased the profits

124
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,240
by a third.

125
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,190
If it succeeds,

126
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,830
you'll be meritorious to the company.

127
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,160
Mr. Su should take the credit.

128
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,600
We only cooperated with him.

129
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,880
Mr. Su,

130
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,000
will we just give them

131
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,950
what we've achieved?

132
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,830
What about the nights we stayed up?

133
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,600
My coffee would be wasted.

134
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,830
Hanhai Xingchen is a whole company.

135
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,360
We must not hide anything.

136
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,160
If we even do an internal blockade

137
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
of techniques,

138
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,510
our company

139
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,600
will fall apart.

140
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,600
Moreover, our sales problem

141
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,630
must be solved urgently.

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,070
We can't

143
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,510
disgrace Xing in front of Hanhai Xingchen

144
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,000
or Mr. Han, can we?

145
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,120
If Xing knows it,

146
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,950
she'll be so moved and fly back from Germany.

147
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,230
Come on.

148
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,800
You want coffee, don't you?

149
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,000
There's a lot in my coffee.

150
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,390
- Come.
- Let's take more.

151
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,480
Li, I want some, too.

152
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,600
- Two packets.
- Thanks, Miss Li.

153
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,680
Mom, Xiaomeng is here to see you.

154
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,830
There you are, Miss Xiaomeng.

155
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,270
Ms. Han.

156
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,390
How do you feel today?

157
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,880
Be seated.

158
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,750
I feel much better.

159
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,240
Because my son has been

160
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,360
taking good care of me.

161
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,600
Look at the dishes.

162
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,920
He made them.

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,120
And the soup.

164
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,190
He made it, too.

165
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,430
You can make soup?

166
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,360
It's nothing.

167
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,000
Tastes good.

168
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,160
Before,

169
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,270
I used to make soup for him.

170
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,870
But now,

171
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,070
it's the other way round.

172
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,390
He makes soup for me.

173
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,600
Oh, Linjia.

174
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,390
There's plenty of soup.

175
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,430
Get some for Miss Xiaomeng.

176
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,630
Let her taste some.

177
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,920
No need, Ms. Han.

178
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't bother.

179
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,430
Make yourself at home.

180
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,950
It's OK. You talk to my mom.

181
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,160
Since I fell sick,

182
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,160
my son

183
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,920
has been more obedient.

184
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,440
He knows better now.

185
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,720
Before,

186
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,560
he kept calling me Ms. Han

187
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,270
instead of Mom. I was so pissed off.

188
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,950
But now, he keeps saying,

189
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,750
"Mom, have some food.

190
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,950
Mom, have some soup."

191
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,870
He's really changed a lot.

192
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,040
Speaking of this,

193
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,950
he cooked all this.

194
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,070
You know.

195
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,190
Now, very few men

196
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,680
can cook.

197
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,160
Don't go.

198
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,600
Ask him to make some dishes for you.

199
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,070
You can taste some.

200
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,430
Make a small request to him, though.

201
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,040
Don't make such light dishes.

202
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,480
A strong flavor will be better.

203
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,320
OK.

204
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,950
- Have some soup.
- OK.

205
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,270
With you around, I almost recover.

206
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,390
(Third Quarter Financial Statements)
Mr. Han,

207
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,750
the overall sales of Hanhai Xingchen

208
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,720
have grown by 40%

209
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,360
compared to the last quarter.

210
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,670
Good job.

211
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,030
Thanks for your hard work.

212
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,310
How's the integration going

213
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,800
between Hanhai and Xingchen?

214
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,680
I was about to tell you this.

215
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,000
We owe this great quarterly report

216
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,160
to those guys

217
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,430
from Xingchen.

218
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,360
Su Zhizhou led Division 2

219
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
to have upgraded the printing software.

220
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,390
It has brought a third

221
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,000
more profits for Hanhai Xingchen.

222
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,480
Such a technological innovation

223
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,160
is really worth its weight in gold.

224
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,240
And Miss Li of the Sales Department.

225
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,830
She's also got many new clients

226
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,630
for our company.

227
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,200
And her sales performance

228
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,360
has remained the best in her department.

229
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,870
Miss Ji had

230
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,080
elite subordinates.

231
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,360
Everyone in Xingchen

232
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,480
is a talent cultivated by her.

233
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,240
Talents are always rare.

234
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,710
Oh, Mr. Han.

235
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,480
Last time, you mentioned

236
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,430
nurturing and establishing

237
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,750
the AI talent pool.

238
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,550
That's very necessary, I think.

239
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,440
But in China,

240
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,360
there hasn't been a precedent.

241
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,030
How should we start and push it?

242
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,480
I'm still confused.

243
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,870
There's no rush.

244
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,840
In a couple of days, I'll fly to Germany

245
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,270
to check up on Dongyang Base.

246
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,200
Meanwhile,

247
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,840
I'll discuss it with Prof. Meng Xin.

248
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,560
OK.

249
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,550
Mr. Han, I'll get back to work.

250
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,790
Boss, the presents are ready.

251
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,200
You can leave from Mr. Lu's.

252
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,150
What is Ms. Han's problem?

253
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,150
Is it figured out?

254
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,630
No.

255
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,510
Don't worry too much.

256
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,670
She will be fine.

257
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,870
Thanks for coming to see her.

258
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,320
Don't say that.

259
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,720
Ms. Han cares about me, too.

260
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,870
All right. You go back.

261
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,230
OK.

262
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,630
Ride safe.

263
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,470
I will.

264
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,390
Bye-bye.

265
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,180
(Spicy Sticks)

266
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Glad I have you.

267
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,720
Every day,

268
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,270
I have three light meals.

269
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,080
I have to count on you.

270
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,510
Oh, he's back.

271
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,440
So soon?

272
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,600
Mom, Xiaomeng has gone back home.

273
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,390
Why are you back so soon?

274
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,750
You didn't drive her home?

275
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,720
I have to take care of you.

276
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,670
Son,

277
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,480
a patient needs some space, too.

278
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,910
What's the smell?

279
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,110
Smell?

280
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,200
I think it's the smell

281
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,480
of spicy sticks.

282
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,720
Really?

283
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,600
Why do I not smell it?

284
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,870
Have I lost my sense of smell

285
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,840
just because of the disease?

286
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,910
- Mom.
- I can't smell anything.

287
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,120
Mom, don't be sad.

288
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,910
It takes some time to recover.

289
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,550
Take some good rest.

290
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,700
By the way,

291
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,910
Ting will be here to see you.

292
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,240
You told him I was sick?

293
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,910
What did I tell you?

294
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,270
Don't let anybody else know

295
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,960
I am sick.

296
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,510
Everybody is busy working.

297
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,720
Ting isn't anybody else.

298
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,150
And everybody cares about you.

299
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,510
How... How about this?

300
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,750
Ting is really busy.

301
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,600
You call him

302
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,000
and ask him not to come.

303
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,200
He's arriving, I think. I'll go get him.

304
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,960
Fine, fine.

305
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,960
Come, then.

306
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,080
Everybody can come.

307
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,270
Where's Grandaunt?

308
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,480
Upstairs. I'll take you to her.

309
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,470
Leave them to me.

310
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,960
Grandaunt,

311
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,510
how is your health?

312
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,720
You're way too busy.

313
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,510
You needn't have come.

314
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,910
You should have spent this time

315
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,080
taking more rest.

316
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,600
Grandaunt, I should check on you.

317
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,910
What exactly is wrong?

318
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,870
Why is there no known cause?

319
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,000
How about another hospital?

320
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,550
No need.

321
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,670
I know

322
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,870
my own health condition.

323
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,630
Here.

324
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,350
You guys talk.

325
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,790
Ms. Liu isn't here lately.

326
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,270
I'll go downstairs to wash the clothes.

327
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,080
Thank you, son.

328
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,120
I think Linjia is more sensible now.

329
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,320
He is.

330
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,360
Since I fell sick,

331
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,750
he's been so obedient.

332
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,800
Grandaunt,

333
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,360
we should contact the...

334
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,200
Ting,

335
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,270
how's everything going

336
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,360
between you and Miss Xing?

337
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,800
We...

338
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,750
We broke up.

339
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,200
I knew it.

340
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,720
Ting,

341
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,670
you're more excellent than Linjia

342
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,150
and you're smarter.

343
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,720
But just because of this,

344
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,150
I worry more about you.

345
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,080
Think of Linjia.

346
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,200
He's always straightforward.

347
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,080
He never keeps a secret.

348
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,870
He says whatever he means.

349
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,510
So, he isn't usually aggrieved.

350
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,550
But you...

351
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,790
You're the other way around.

352
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,360
Whatever happens,

353
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,670
you keep it to yourself.

354
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,320
Speaking of this,

355
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,360
you and Yuan

356
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,080
are really alike.

357
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,360
But Yuan

358
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,910
has been living

359
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,390
with her parents.

360
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,750
Her mother Zhou Ying

361
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,320
has always spoilt, protected, and favored her.

362
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,270
But you, poor little guy.

363
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,720
Since you were a child,

364
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,670
you've been carrying everything alone.

365
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,630
Grandaunt,

366
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,120
do you still

367
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,750
eat spicy food?

368
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,670
What are you talking about?

369
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,480
Considering my health condition,

370
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,870
from this day on,

371
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,150
I'll have to say goodbye

372
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,390
to spicy food,

373
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,600
cold food,

374
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,150
or the seafood

375
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,200
I always love.

376
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,000
I see a packet of spicy sticks.

377
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,560
Forget it.

378
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,750
I'll stop pretending.

379
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,960
Actually, your grandaunt

380
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,910
has no problem.

381
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,390
I'm as strong as cattle.

382
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,510
I'm just worried about Linjia.

383
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,000
He's pursuing that girl.

384
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,270
Miss Xiaomeng, I mean.

385
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,150
He's so slow

386
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,390
that I'm anxious.

387
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,600
I'm just trying

388
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,910
to help him move forward.

389
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,030
Young guys like you

390
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,080
love to wait.

391
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,670
That's ridiculous.

392
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,870
You'll only regret it.

393
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,670
I've been there.

394
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,870
So, I'll tell you what.

395
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,360
No one should close himself off.

396
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,910
He must open his heart instead.

397
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,240
Only when he opens his mind

398
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,390
can the sunlight shine in.

399
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,350
Understand?

400
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,080
Actually, I always think

401
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,080
Miss Xing

402
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,480
is the one who can open your heart.

403
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,390
Besides,

404
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,630
I somehow think

405
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,720
the two of you

406
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,320
are destined to be together.

407
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,800
I'm serious.

408
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,240
The two of you will get back together.

409
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,080
Trust my intuition.

410
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,510
Since you were little,

411
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,360
I've been nice to you, huh?

412
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,440
This...

413
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,560
This stuff.

414
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,920
And the fact

415
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,000
that I'm pretending to be sick...

416
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,630
Don't tell Linjia.

417
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,790
Keep it to yourself.

418
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,160
Got it.

419
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,360
Good boy.

420
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,270
Come on. You have some.

421
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,440
- No.
- Have some.

422
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,600
Oh, young man.

423
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,870
Take it easy on this food.

424
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,480
You know what? I'm so tasteless.

425
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,320
I nearly...

426
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,390
Tastes so good.

427
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:14,680
I should go.

428
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,000
Not until you have some soup I made.

429
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,400
You have indeed inherited

430
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,310
Grandaunt's cooking skills.

431
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,310
Maybe my family

432
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,880
have the gene for making soup.

433
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,720
All right. Take care of Grandaunt.

434
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,000
Tell me if you need anything.

435
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,110
I will. Go back to work.

436
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,680
You're sensible now.

437
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,160
Ting,

438
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,270
you've been more mature, too.

439
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,280
I'll get...

440
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,960
More soup for my mother.

443
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,190
Prof. Meng.

444
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,270
There you are, Ji Xing.

445
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,700
Take your seat.

446
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,920
- Here.
- OK.

447
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,750
I reviewed your final thesis.

448
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,960
That's really good.

449
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,160
It has novel points of view

450
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,510
and a lot of data from practical applications.

451
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,750
I'm inspired a lot.

452
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,240
Because you taught me very well.

453
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,160
Actually, our research

454
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,790
will end up being applied

455
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,790
in business development.

456
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,880
Lately, Hanhai Xingchen's new product

457
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,510
has won an international gold medal.

458
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,900
Xingchen is meritorious

459
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,270
for its technical support.

460
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,910
Thanks.

461
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,920
I'll convey your congratulations to them.

462
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,720
You no longer have a problem

463
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,510
with the merger thing, huh?

464
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,310
Before, I was being petty.

465
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,070
I only focused on the company and myself

466
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,680
instead of the macroscopical problem.

467
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,160
Actually, AI medicine in China

468
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,550
has been developing fast.

469
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,590
But compared to some developed countries,

470
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,510
there are still some gaps.

471
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,880
Resource integration is necessary.

472
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,400
Xingchen or Hanhai,

473
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,960
without the merger,

474
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,750
couldn't have emerged internationally so fast.

475
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,750
Looks like you've learned

476
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,400
to think macroscopically.

477
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,000
This is good.

478
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,310
You can see the problems
of our nation and people

479
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,720
and analyze things

480
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,960
from an international perspective.

481
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,880
Isn't that exactly why

482
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,070
you came here for a study tour?

483
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,000
Meng,

484
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,480
who do you want me to meet today?

485
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,350
You're also here, Ji Xing.

486
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,550
I'm going back to China tomorrow.

487
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,960
I'm here to say goodbye to Prof. Meng.

488
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,480
You're leaving?

489
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,560
- Yes.
- Yes.

490
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,270
Go back and work hard.

491
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm optimistic about your future.

492
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,350
I will. And I'll learn more from you.

493
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,190
No problem.

494
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,070
You're arriving soon, huh?

495
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,270
Just come over.

496
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,110
Qin Li is also here.

497
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,510
I'll let you work, Prof. Meng.

498
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,590
I should go.

499
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,070
- OK.
- See you.

500
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,520
Bye.

501
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,280
Wait, Ji Xing.

502
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,230
Hey, Qin Li.

503
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,440
I can meet that guy any time.

504
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,400
Maybe another day.

505
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,790
You didn't tell me you would leave.

506
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,000
- Hey you.
- I insist

507
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,030
bidding you farewell.

508
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,160
- Let's go.

Where's Qin Li?

514
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,720
A student of mine is going back to China.

515
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,680
He wants to bid a farewell with her.

516
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,000
You don't mind, huh?

517
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,110
He's indeed as casual as before.

518
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,480
Yeah.

519
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,110
He's a genius, anyway.

520
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,200
And he's the man you need now.

521
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,270
He specializes in AI.

522
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,590
In the international academic circle

523
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,680
and among overseas Chinese,

524
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,830
he's famous, too.

525
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,200
Also, he's an outgoing

526
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,110
and natural socializer.

527
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,160
He will be

528
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,720
the best consultant

529
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,160
for your AI talent pool.

530
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,000
I know.

531
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,680
That's why I came personally.

532
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,040
Han Ting,

533
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,440
it's not easy

534
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,160
to build a talent pool.

535
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,920
I never do anything I'm unsure of.

536
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,510
You're ambitious. Do a good job.

537
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,400
I'll leave you alone.

538
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
Hope you can

539
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,920
get me to see him tomorrow.

As far as I know him,

543
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,510
when you have a genuine attitude,

544
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,350
he will do his best to help you.

545
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,000
Thank you, then.

546
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,320

Sorry.

I only ordered for two.

- Schoolmates.

00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,160
someone wanted to see me.

00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,480
It can't be you, huh?

573
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,680
What do you want me for?

574
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,440
When you were in college,

575
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,030
you did well in the programming

576
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,030
of academic robots.

577
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,350
Prof. Meng said you would go back to China

578
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,350
and continue your research.

579
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,590
He recommended you to me,

580
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,000
expecting you to work with me

581
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,960
with your talent

582
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,270
to make effort

583
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,310
for China's talent business.

584
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,270
How will you establish

585
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,200
the AI talent pool?

586
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,680
How will you offer
a better research environment?

587
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,960
By giving a high pay

588
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,160
to get overseas talents

589
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,070
back to China?

590
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,160
Besides enlisting talents,

591
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,720
the talent pool also serves
as a cultivation platform.

592
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,750
I want to establish

593
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,680
an AI talent pool

594
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,920
that can improve itself.

595
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,550
Dongyang Medical will work

596
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,920
with other domestic giant companies

597
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
to invest heavily.

598
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,750
In a number of ways such as scholarship

599
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,400
and academic exchange,

600
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,640
we will cooperate

601
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,000
with the universities

602
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,030
and leading tech companies.

603
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,680
We'll share resources

604
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,240
to help those capable young guys

605
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,590
who are interested in AI

606
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,440
to grow fast.

607
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,920
We'll also attract overseas scientists

608
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,880
and financially support

609
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,240
their research in China.

610
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,440
Then will these talents

611
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,110
be monopolized by Dongyang Medical?

612
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,110
They don't belong to Dongyang Medical.

613
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,960
They don't need to work for it exclusively.

614
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,200
How much can Dongyang Medical do?

615
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,200
I think you know

616
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,400
what a huge investment

617
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,000
a talent pool requires.

618
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,240
If something stands in the way,

619
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,790
will Dongyang Medical give up halfway?

620
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,590
Han Ting,

621
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,480
I checked up on Dongyang Medical.

622
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,000
Personally, I don't think

623
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,110
it is powerful enough

624
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,880
to start this plan now.

625
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,750
Prof. Meng once mentioned

626
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,440
that many countries have started

627
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,640
the cultivation and reserve

628
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,480
of AI talents.

629
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,640
Some countries

630
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,310
even do a talent blockade on China.

631
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,200
If we don't sharpen our gun
until the war starts,

632
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,240
that will be too late.

633
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,400
So, however big

634
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,290
the upfront investment is,

635
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,400
or whatever trouble there is later,

636
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,960
Dongyang Medical will not quit.

637
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,590
I'll think about it.

638
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,160
The robot in the lab

639
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,880
suddenly babbled

640
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,350
and did verbal abuse to my colleague.

641
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,680
I have to go back.

642
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,110
I'll leave, too.

643
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,040
Ji Xing.

644
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,240
I have something to tell you.

645
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,830
Han Ting,

646
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,400
do you discover Ji Xing's talent

647
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,720
and try to recruit her?

648
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,720
But anyway, when I'm back in China,

649
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
if Ji Xing can be my colleague,

650
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,590
I'll be happy about that.

651
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,790
Stop joking.

652
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,110
All right, then.

653
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,680
I have to go.

654
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,750
I'll come to you when I'm back in China.

655
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,760
Let's talk.

656
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,790
Thank you for defending me.

657
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,070
When will you go back to China?

658
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,840
Tomorrow.

659
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,590
What's your plan after that?

660
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,480
Still mad at me?

661
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,790
About the merger,

662
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,310
I understand you now.

663
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,480
I should also thank you

664
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,680
for bringing Xingchen

665
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,720
to the point where it is now.

666
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,590
But Han Ting...

667
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,590
If you loved me,

668
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,110
you wouldn't have cheated me

669
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,480
or used me as a pawn.

670
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,960
In my position,

671
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
I have my crosses to bear.

672
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,880
In my life, love isn't everything.

673
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,480
I can't sacrifice Dongyang's layout

674
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,510
for my personal affection.

675
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,400
I can't promise

676
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,300
you're everything in my life.

677
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,160
But I give you my word.

678
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,070
In love,

679
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,800
you're my one and only.

680
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,750
Do you think

681
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,920
being fit for each other is love?

682
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,070
Love, as far as I see,

683
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,270
is gradually accumulated

684
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,590
day by day.

685
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,310
It grows slowly.

686
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,480
To me, it's not a rapid move,

687
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,920
but a slow process.

688
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,070
I guess I can't completely define it

689
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,920
before I look back

690
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,000
at the end of my life.

691
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,350
Thanks.

692
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,030
Excuse me.

693
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,680
May I change the seat?

694
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,920
You like to sit

695
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,960
with your girlfriend?

696
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,510
No. I'm not his girlfriend.

697
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,680
Not yet.

698
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,800
So...

699
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,720
Oh, yes.

700
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,350
Why?

701
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,620
(Development Strategy)

702
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,400
I shouldn't review this.

703
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,760
It's OK.

704
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,160
You're a shareholder of Hanhai Xingchen.

705
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,350
With Hanhai Xingchen,

706
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,200
Dongyang Medical will establish a talent pool.

707
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,680
You'll be needed

708
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,520
in many cases.

709
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,830
If you only mind

710
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,000
that I'm your ex-boyfriend

711
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,270
and turn down the offer,

712
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,880
it will be a pity, I believe.

713
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,270
I hope you can seriously consider

714
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,270
joining Hanhai Xingchen.

715
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,110
OK.

716
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,270
I'll think about it.

717
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,070
Will you get your seat back?

718
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:03,100
(Development Strategy of Hanhai Xingchen)

(Development Strategy)

720
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,640
At this time,

721
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,000
Xing just got off the plane, I think.

722
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,110
We're not late.

723
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,550
Don't look over there.

724
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,200
What if she sees us?

725
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,830
We'll surprise her, won't we?

726
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,440
That's right.

727
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,520
There she is.

728
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,790
Turn your head.

729
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,670
Why?

730
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,720
How come she's with Han Ting?

731
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,350
Mr. Han?

732
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,110
They...

733
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,200
What do we do?

734
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,240
Don't say anything.

735
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,400
Don't let them see us.

736
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,400
Get closer. Closer.

737
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,160
What is going on?

738
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,720
Tang Song,

739
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,230
how's Dahuang doing lately?

740
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,150
Don't worry, boss.

741
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,670
I check on it every day.

742
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,960
Do you want to see Dahuang?

743
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,070
Here.

744
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,360
It's chubbier.

745
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,110
Don't feed it too many snacks.

746
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,760
Feed less.

747
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,200
Got it.

748
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,910
Oh, Miss Ji.

749
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,670
Dahuang misses you.

750
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I guess it knew you would come back.

751
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,110
Yesterday, it was waiting at the door.

752
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,390
It was?

753
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,160
Miss Ji,

754
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,550
if you miss Dahuang,

755
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,880
let my boss know.

756
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,550
We'll get you to see it.

757
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,880
Yeah. If it's not convenient,

758
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,710
I can send you its photos regularly.

759
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,390
OK.

760
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,870
OK.

761
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,720
Thank you.

762
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,760
Take some good rest.

763
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,280
I'll wait for you in Hanhai Xingchen.

764
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,350
Boss,

765
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,190
you haven't been this happy for a long time.

766
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,150
Tell the HR Department

767
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,760
to send an offer to Ji Xing.

768
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,760
I get it.

769
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,280
I can finally have a hotpot.

770
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,960
I've been missing it for a long time.

771
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,880
Eat more and get more nutrition.

772
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,070
Xing,

773
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,190
did you get back to Han Ting?

774
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,320
Why would you ask that?

775
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,880
Earlier today, Su Zhizhou and I

776
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,320
went to the airport for you.

777
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,480
But I didn't see you.

778
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,030
You were with Han Ting.

779
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,320
Why would we show up?

780
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,360
To annoy you?

781
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,760
Is that true?

782
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,000
Yes. I saw that with my eyes.

783
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,880
I came across him in Germany

784
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,510
and we flew back together.

785
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,190
You forgave him?

786
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,320
In Germany, I've learned a lot.

787
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,920
I've realized

788
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,800
Han Ting made that decision

789
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,920
for a bigger layout.

790
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,800
Hanhai Xingchen develops very well, too.

791
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,590
I have no reason to blame him.

792
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,390
Boil some vegetables.

793
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,900
(Hanhai Xingchen's offer
for the vice president)

794
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,590
What's up, Xing?

795
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,320
Hanhai Xingchen sent me an offer.

796
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:53,990
Xing,

797
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,150
I know you always care about Xingchen.

798
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,950
Come back.

799
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,880
We all need you.

800
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,590
Come on, girls.

801
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,510
Eat some more.

802
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,280
When you were abroad these days,

803
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,760
you must have wanted this, huh?

804
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,880
Enjoy the hotpot you were expecting.

805
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,140
(Dongyang Group)

806
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,420
(Dongyang Group)

807
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,510
Boss, Miss Ji has joined Hanhai Xingchen.

808
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,070
I get it.

809
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,280
Miss Ji, this is your office.

810
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,380
(Ji Xing, Vice President)

811
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:12,300
(Vice President's Office)

812
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,060
(Ji Xing, Vice President)

813
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,540
(Welcome back.)

814
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:56,780
(Welcome back.)

815
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,600
Miss Ji.

816
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,710
Ask Su Zhizhou and Li Li

817
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,840
to come to my office.

818
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,870
OK.

819
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,540
(Hanhai Xingchen)

820
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,150
I didn't expect so many things

821
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,280
to have happened these days.

822
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,070
Now, things are better.

823
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,030
After Zhizhou led Division 2

824
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,320
to upgrade the 3D printing hardware,

825
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,480
they won back control of techniques.

826
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,070
Well done, Mr. Su.

827
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,760
Strength proves all.

828
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,320
Xing, you're back.

829
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,510
The three of us

830
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,800
are complete, then.

831
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:41,920
Qin Li?

832
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,280
When did you come back?

833
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,840
Surprised, huh?

834
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,470
Yes,

835
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,480
but only a little bit.

836
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,070
I knew you would accept Han Ting's invitation.

837
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,360
Are you available after work?

838
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
Shall I invite you to a movie?

839
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,280
Take your seat.

840
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,600
Let me introduce you.

841
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,840
This is Qin Li,

842
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,710
the consultant I get back

843
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,550
from Germany.

844
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,590
This is Luo Ping, president of Hanhai Xingchen.

845
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,670
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Mr. Qin.

846
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,150
Now, Mr. Luo is working

847
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,590
on steadily developing projects.

848
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,480
I want the two of you

849
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,670
to take charge

850
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,640
of the talent pool thing.

851
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,160
OK.

852
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,480
Together with Ji Xing,

853
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,960
we'll do a good job.

854
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,350
No problem.

855
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,190
Thank you, Miss Ji

856
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,070
and Mr. Qin.

857
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,480
If you need my support,

858
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,320
let me know.

859
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,280
Next, let's talk

860
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,630
about pushing the talent pool plan.

861
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,320
This is Mr. Han's proposal.

862
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,280
