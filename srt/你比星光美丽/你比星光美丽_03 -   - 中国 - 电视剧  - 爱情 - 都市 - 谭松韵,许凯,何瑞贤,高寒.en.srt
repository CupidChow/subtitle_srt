Come on. Don't be ridiculous.

25
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,610
You must be insane!

Stop!

What are you doing?

You just wait.

00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,610
I'll call the police.

31
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,850
Call the police?

32
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:01,930
Funny.

33
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,210
Everybody.

34
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,280
Everybody, you saw that.

35
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,120
A woman dressed up like this

36
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,400
is really scheming.

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,560
You must stay alert

38
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,930
in case you fall for it.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
Call the police.

40
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,890
Do it!

41
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,330
Cheers.

42
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,330
Really good.

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,680
Dr. Jiang is at the airport.

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,520
Come quickly.

45
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,720
I have things to do. I should go.

46
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,210
It's about the lottery time.

47
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,720
How about you do it before leaving?

48
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,770
No. Mr. Li and Mr. Zhao,

49
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,610
I'll meet you later.

50
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,810
- OK.
- Anytime.

51
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,490
Cheers.

52
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:43,810
Miss Zeng,

53
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,530
Ji Xing called the police,

54
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,000
accusing Zhu Lei of sexual harassment.

55
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,490
The officers are out there.

56
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,400
You steady them.

57
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,050
Don't make a big scene.

58
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,000
Try to persuade Ji Xing

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,120
to settle that privately.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,840
OK.

61
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,720
So, he sexually

62
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,930
harassed you.

63
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,370
Yes.

64
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,440
Officer, don't trust her.

65
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,090
Ji Xing, I warn you not to talk nonsense.

66
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,400
Officer, she actually seduced me.

67
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,930
Watch your words!

68
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,770
Please tell me

69
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,440
what happened.

70
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,330
Right here just now,

71
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,330
he touched my fanny.

72
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,330
He even cursed me

73
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,370
and pushed me.

74
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,120
She's slandering me.

75
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,000
Calm down.

76
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,930
Since you deny this,

77
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,810
you can also tell us in detail

78
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,210
what exactly happened.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,840
Officers,

80
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,250
here is the thing.

81
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,600
Sorry, officers.

82
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,490
It must be a misunderstanding.

83
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,160
Come on.

84
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,530
You're colleagues.

85
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,370
Don't push it.

86
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,120
Today, many bosses

87
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,090
and clients are here.

88
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,530
They'll laugh at us.

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,050
You each take a step back.

90
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,810
All right, officers.

91
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,250
We'll take care of this by ourselves.

92
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,890
Chen.

93
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,210
Glad you're here.

94
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,680
Look at your subordinate.

95
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,250
She slanders and frames me.

96
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,000
Fine.

97
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,480
For your sake,

98
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,240
I won't sue her.

99
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,840
For nobody's sake.

100
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,600
Officers,

101
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,130
I apply to check the monitoring.

102
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,560
OK.

103
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,530
You go to the monitor room with us.

104
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,090
- Come on.
- Boss, you're running out of time.

105
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,050
You have to go.

106
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,010
You stay and see what will happen.

107
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
I'll go alone.

108
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,000
OK.

109
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,780
Come on. Let's leave.

110
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,090
(Robot positioning, Recharge me)

111
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,160
Such a funny case.

112
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,010
Ladies and gentlemen,

113
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,130
we're coming

114
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,690
to the most exciting part,

115
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,090
the lottery.

116
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,210
Do not walk away.

117
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,720
Because tonight,

118
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,130
our special award will be

119
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,450
a car.

120
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,010
From this perspective,

121
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,130
we can't see what he actually did.

122
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,570
My colleague has gone

123
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,570
to talk with the onlookers

124
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,410
for some information.

125
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,090
If they don't testify for you,

126
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,570
we really

127
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,410
can't confirm

128
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,840
his sexual harassment.

129
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,400
But he really...

130
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,840
I'm innocent.

131
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,090
Nonsense!

132
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,160
Do you have evidence, then?

133
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,720
Or who could you have

134
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,800
testify for you?

135
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,410
How about this?

136
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
You each take a step back

137
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,360
and apologize to each other.

138
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,840
Then it's over.

139
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,530
Why would I apologize to him?

140
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,970
I request Zhu Lei apologize in public.

141
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,330
I am innocent.

142
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,410
Officer,

143
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,280
I'm now suing Ji Xing

144
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,240
for slandering me

145
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,570
and ruining my reputation.

146
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,760
You...

147
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,040
Just do what I told you.

148
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,090
OK, Boss.

149
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Ji Xing, do you know

150
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,240
what a negative effect

151
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
you've had

152
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,720
by calling the police?

153
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,040
So many clients are here.

154
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,690
How will my department

155
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,720
make contact with them?

156
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,090
And the loss of Guanghua's reputation

157
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,400
and economic damage...

158
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,090
Can you be responsible?

159
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,650
Don't play that game.

160
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,130
You think you're right to do sexual harassment?

161
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:34,970
Ji Xing!

162
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,120
Zhu,

163
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,280
you're colleagues.

164
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,480
You nearly meet every day.

165
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,610
Don't push it.

166
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,480
For my sake,

167
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,770
let go of this.

168
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,120
Will you?

169
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,090
OK, Chen. For your sake,

170
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,690
I will not sue her.

171
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,690
But Ji Xing,

172
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,530
you have to apologize to me.

173
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,770
Tomorrow, apologize to me in the office!

174
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,280
I'm a director, huh?

175
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,330
I have a reputation.

176
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,720
In your dreams!

177
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,840
Ji Xing,

178
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,650
apologize to Director Zhu.

179
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,570
Then this is over.

180
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,840
What do you want,

181
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,240
mediation or a legal process?

182
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,890
I don't accept mediation.

183
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,200
Officer.

184
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,480
- Hello.
- Hello.

185
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,770
I'm Tang Song, the assistant

186
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,130
of the CEO of Dongyang Medical.

187
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,130
When that happened,

188
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,040
I was nearby.

189
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,650
So, did you see what happened

190
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,530
just now?

191
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,840
I was a little farther away

192
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,040
and didn't see clearly.

193
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,480
Officer,

194
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,890
I didn't see clearly.

195
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,840
But in this hotel,

196
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,690
there's a service robot.

197
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
I guess its built-in camera has filmed

198
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
how Miss Ji Xing

199
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,240
was sexually harassed.

200
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,240
That...

201
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,650
That's impossible.

202
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,570
I've informed our technicians

203
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,690
to get the surveillance video.

204
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:55,970
Zhu Lei,

205
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,970
the video will be extracted.

206
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,890
Did you or did you not harass Ji Xing?

207
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:01,840
If you did,

208
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,970
apologize immediately.

209
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,040
Otherwise, when the video is presented,

210
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,280
you'll be accused

211
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,530
of more than lying.

212
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,680
I...

213
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,240
You. It's you.

214
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,890
Don't hesitate. Don't be nervous.

215
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,880
Whose profile photo is this?

216
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,170
It's mine.

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,880
This gentleman,

218
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,840
let's applaud

219
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,240
to get him up here, OK?

220
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,760
He's really lucky.

221
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,880
OK. Now,

222
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,720
I'm giving you

223
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,570
the key to this light and power-efficient

224
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,810
electric bike, OK?

225
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,930
(Chen Songlin)
Miss Zeng, Tang Song helped.

226
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,170
Zhu Lei confessed his sexual harassment.

227
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,690
After the first prize,

228
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,970
I'm going to show you

229
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,050
the special prize.

230
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,360
Keep your eyes open.

231
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,570
Thank you, officers.

232
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,970
Our company won't shelter him

233
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,810
for what he did.

234
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,330
Since he confessed

235
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,170
his misbehavior,

236
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,570
I'll leave him to you.

237
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,680
OK.

238
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,930
You go with us.

239
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,080
Ji Xing,

240
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,050
sorry for that.

241
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:23,930
Don't worry.

242
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,240
I'll satisfy you.

243
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,170
From this day on,

244
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,450
Zhu Lei is no longer our employee.

245
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,170
Songlin,

246
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,360
get Ji Xing a car.

247
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,520
- OK.
- Get back for some rest.

248
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,330
Thank you, Miss Zeng.

249
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,130
Let's go.

250
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,570
Thank you, Assistant Tang.

251
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,120
You're welcome, Miss Zeng.

252
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,290
I should go.

253
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,250
OK.

254
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,090
A friend of mine was in trouble

255
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,290
and I was held up.

256
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,580
(Smile)
Friend?

257
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,450
Didn't you go

258
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,690
to Guanghua's party?

259
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,680
Are you talking

260
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,810
about Ji Xing?

261
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,330
Come on. I'll be right there.

262
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,290
I'll hang up.

263
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,940
(Tang Song)

264
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,810
What?

265
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,520
I did what you told me to

266
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,240
and tricked Zhu Lei into a confession.

267
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,320
What about Ji Xing?

268
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,720
Miss Ji is fine.

269
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,330
Miss Zeng had her

270
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,410
sent back home.

271
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,010
I get it.

272
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,260
(Chapter 3 Business Model)

273
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,960
Mr. Han,

274
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,840
the Doctorcloud

275
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,120
of your company

276
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,760
has been developed for years, huh?

277
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,640
I'm ashamed to say this.

278
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,450
Doctorcloud was developed

279
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,760
by the AI Department

280
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,720
of Dongyang Medical.

281
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,690
Stuck in bottlenecks,

282
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,640
the progress was rather slow.

283
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,520
But I've taken over Dongyang Medical.

284
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,840
I will set up a new team

285
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,330
to greatly advance Doctorcloud.

286
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,170
Greatly advance...

287
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,170
You can't just mouth empty slogans.

288
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,330
I won't, of course.

289
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,940
(Report of Dr. Bay Phase I)

290
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,120
Please review this.

291
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,960
What's this?

292
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:29,970
It's the file of Bay,

293
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,120
a medical robot.

294
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,970
Guanghua Technology that invented Bay

295
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,050
is an investment of mine.

296
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,290
I'm going to combine Doctorcloud,

297
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,130
Bay,

298
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,600
and 3D medical printing.

299
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,290
Once it's done,

300
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,930
Bay will be able to assist the doctors

301
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,570
to get a quick diagnosis

302
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,760
and treatment.

303
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,330
3D medical printing can also realize

304
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,210
the personalized and customized

305
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,090
intelligent medicine.

306
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,810
Do you have a plan

307
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,360
for its application?

308
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,050
Besides big hospitals,

309
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,050
Dongyang Medical will work

310
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,090
with primary hospitals

311
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,240
to promote Doctorcloud

312
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,570
to help with rural medical infrastructure

313
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,210
and make up for insufficient

314
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,760
medical resources in remote regions.

315
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,720
To be honest,

316
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,050
this is why

317
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,480
I'll greatly advance Doctorcloud.

318
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,810
Now,

319
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,410
the government is also

320
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,520
accelerating the primary smart medicine.

321
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,360
It's indeed on trend.

322
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,450
I'm glad you have this good idea.

323
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,640
If I can get your help, Dr. Jiang,

324
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,450
the blueprint of Doctorcloud

325
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,520
will be realized sooner.

326
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,880
Mr. Jiang, it's the boarding time.

327
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,010
Dr. Jiang,

328
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,200
I know

329
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,720
a lot of companies and institutions

330
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,170
want to cooperate with you.

331
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,840
Among them, I don't dare to say

332
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,120
we're the best company.

333
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,760
But I promise you

334
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,360
we'll give you

335
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,640
the best offer.

336
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,120
Besides the adequate support

337
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,970
in finance,

338
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,410
in either the R&D direction

339
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,880
or the team members,

340
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,240
you will have

341
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,080
full autonomy.

342
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,440
Dr. Jiang,

343
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,570
you have a dream of smart medicine.

344
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,090
I'm willing to help you.

345
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,290
We'll help each other.

346
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,720
Hope we'll work well together.

347
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,690
We will.

348
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,330
Xing, I'm sorry.

349
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,290
When such a thing happened,

350
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,450
I wasn't there for you.

351
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,130
It's OK.

352
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,930
It's settled, anyway.

353
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,360
Oh, Xing.

354
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,050
In today's case,

355
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,970
your boss made her mark

356
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:44,810
in front of her employees.

357
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,210
Then you're the one

358
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,410
who is unnatural.

359
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,210
I'm afraid you'll have to suffer

360
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,680
when you work tomorrow.

361
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,450
But Zhu Lei did the wrong thing.

362
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,410
How come I...?

363
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,090
How come I'm unnatural?

364
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,760
That's right. He deserved that.

365
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,200
I'm just worried

366
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,290
you'll be upset at work tomorrow.

367
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,570
I don't want to go to work.

368
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,000
I just don't.

369
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,480
Then, you just don't go to work.

370
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,970
I'll raise you, anyway.

371
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,760
No way.

372
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,970
We have a flat to buy.

373
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,690
For our flat,

374
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,970
I'll continue to work.

375
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,760
After I'm with work here,

376
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,410
I'll get back to you immediately.

377
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,810
Get to sleep early.

378
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,810
Have a sweet dream.

379
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,760
- Good night.
- Good night.

380
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,170
- Hello.
- Hello.

381
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,880
I'm Tang Song, the assistant

382
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,330
of the CEO of Dongyang Medical.

383
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,090
I'll contact you after damage assessment.

384
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,050
(Ji Xing)
Hi, Assistant Tang.

385
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,930
Thank you for helping me out today.

386
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,630
(Creditor)
Not at all.

387
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,320
(Creditor)
Not at all.

388
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,600
Assistant Tang, is that you?

389
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,500
(Ji Xing: Assistant Tang, is that you?)

390
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,170
(Creditor)
No. I'm Han Ting.

391
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,140
(Creditor: No. I'm Han Ting.)

392
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,100
(Car Damage
Ji Xing: Hello.)

393
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,020
(Everything was just fine.)

394
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,340
(Glad to know it. How much shall I pay?)

395
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,940
(Boss is nice.
He won't extort your money.)

396
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,780
(Thank you. A great boss like him
will always be rich.)

397
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,570
How could it be true?

398
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,930
How could it?

399
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
Han Ting?

400
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,210
I'm so ashamed.

401
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,320
(Ji Xing)
Hi, Mr. Han.

402
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,570
Good night, Mr. Han.

403
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,860
(Dongyang Group)

404
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,170
Did you hear about Zhu Lei's case last night?

405
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,050
It's known everywhere.

406
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,410
It's Ji Xing and Mr. Han.

407
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,240
- They stood really close.
- Look.

408
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,290
They really did.

409
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,050
Stop looking. There she is.

410
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,050
Morning.

411
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,560
Boss backs you up
and we can't mess with you.

412
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,760
We're on our own.

413
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:26,770
I'd work.

414
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,040
Come to the toilet with me.

415
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,890
Zhu Lei was fired.

416
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,130
Everyone in the Sales Department is angry.

417
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,410
Besides,

418
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,720
Mr. Zhao from Ren'ai Hospital

419
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,890
sent your flowers the other day.

420
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,800
Last night, Mr. Han's assistant

421
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,130
helped you like that.

422
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,170
Then on the intranet,

423
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,520
someone said something dirty

424
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,280
about you.

425
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,170
Don't read the comment.

426
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,690
It'll hurt your eyes.

427
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,690
I was harassed.

428
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,280
Why does it look like I was wrong?

429
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,610
In the workplace, there's no right or wrong,

430
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,080
but only pros and cons.

431
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,930
Zhu Lei is the sales director

432
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,450
who assures the sales of his department.

433
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,690
When he's gone,

434
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,560
their performance can't be completed.

435
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,520
The whole department can't get their bonus.

436
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,080
They must be upset.

437
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,850
They complain about me

438
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,130
and I can understand.

439
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,560
But those of our department

440
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,000
- just now...
- Director Chen

441
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,280
is very close to Zhu Lei.

442
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,450
When Zhu Lei is fired,

443
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,610
he must be feeling very bad.

444
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,890
He decides

445
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,170
how much bonus we can get.

446
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,480
Who dares to...?

447
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,520
So, I have to be

448
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,930
completely isolated, huh?

449
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,890
Don't be too sad.

450
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,800
I'm on your side.

451
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
But recently,

452
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,800
let's keep a low profile

453
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,040
and contact on WeChat.

454
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,760
When I hear of anything,

455
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,280
I'll tell you.

456
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,450
No need.

457
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,210
I should go.

458
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,720
Mr. Han Ting?

459
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,130
Ji Xing can get in with him?

460
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,610
Without Mr. Han's order,

461
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,370
how would Assistant Tang help her last night?

462
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,450
On the intranet,

463
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,370
the rumor is going all about.

464
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,210
Oh, I see.

465
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,760
I wondered why Miss Zeng

466
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,930
fired Zhu Lei last night

467
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,760
without hesitation.

468
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,890
The photo on the intranet

469
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,480
is really clear.

470
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
At the celebration party,

471
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,610
Mr. Han and Ji Xing

472
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,000
were chatting out there.

473
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,650
Oh, God.

474
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,320
I thought

475
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,930
Mr. Han and Miss Zeng were a couple.

476
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,280
What a surprise!

477
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,280
Don't try to guess who Boss really likes.

478
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,280
(Xinggang University students won 2023 National
College Student AI Creative Competition)

479
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,250
Come in.

480
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,800
Miss Zeng, you wanted to see me?

481
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,170
Ji Xing of your department

482
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,890
seems to have a bad comment lately.

483
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Well, she's a little bit fiery.

484
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,130
No one thought she would make

485
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,130
such a big scene.

486
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,320
In this case,

487
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,560
Zhu Lei's being fired isn't important.

488
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,690
But many of our business partners were there.

489
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,040
Our company image was damaged.

490
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,080
And now, on our intranet,

491
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,040
there are even posts

492
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,890
about Mr. Han's gossip.

493
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,410
Tell me.

494
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,000
How can I explain that to Mr. Han?

495
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,000
Miss Zeng, I'm Ji Xing's superior.

496
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,560
I'm responsible, too.

497
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,720
You and Ji Xing are different guys.

498
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,370
I've seen

499
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,720
what you've done for our company.

500
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,080
I can't blame you

501
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,610
just because one of your subordinates

502
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,610
remains disobedient.

503
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,010
But anyway,

504
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,520
in controlling

505
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,930
your subordinates,

506
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,560
you should do more.

507
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,610
What is your advice?

508
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,560
Ji Xing,

509
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,650
Bay Phase II

510
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,720
should be advanced.

511
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,890
You'll do the proposal.

512
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,800
Remember to do it fast.

513
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,330
OK.

514
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,210
Sit.

515
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,560
Oh,

516
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,720
everybody has been very busy

517
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,000
with work.

518
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,930
There's some finishing work with Phase I.

519
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,170
You do some fieldwork.

520
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,930
Fieldwork?

521
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,280
You go to Xinggang Hospital

522
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,890
to do the routine maintenance

523
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,320
and repair work

524
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,250
for Bay.

525
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,650
Director Chen, I'm not done

526
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,690
with my work.

527
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,370
And isn't that the work

528
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,520
of the Maintenance Department?

529
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,170
The Maintenance Department

530
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,480
is too busy to go.

531
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,610
You know Bay best.

532
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,130
So, you're perfect

533
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,690
for this job.

534
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,210
We're colleagues, huh?

535
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,720
Let's help each other.

536
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,130
I'm given a very high pay

537
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,080
for the research work.

538
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,370
Is it not cost-effective

539
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,080
to send me on fieldwork?

540
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,210
I'm doing this for your own good.

541
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,610
If you do this job very well,

542
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,610
that'll be your work performance.

543
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,760
OK. You get to work.

544
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,650
All the data calculations are wrong!

545
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,170
Are you working without a brain?

546
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,130
Recalculate the date!

547
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,610
Email me the calculated date

548
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,450
right tonight!

549
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
As early as you can!

550
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,520
Ji Xing, you team them up.

551
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,760
Get the work done with them.

552
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,080
Focus.

553
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,010
Director Chen,

554
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,170
I'm still working on the proposal

555
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,800
of Bay Phase II.

556
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:01,930
I'd like to ask

557
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,890
about the priority.

558
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,280
They're both important.

559
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,130
I'm asking you to work together

560
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,930
instead of working alone.

561
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,080
So many colleagues are here.

562
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:11,970
You can just

563
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,930
share the mission.

564
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,410
You waste no time.

565
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,690
The other day, Director Chen asked

566
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,800
to have dinner with some clients tonight.

567
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,970
I'm really tied up.

568
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,290
How about this?

569
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,360
Next time.

570
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,000
Next time, I'll stay

571
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,210
and work overtime with you.

572
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,880
Ji Xing,

573
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,360
thanks for that.

574
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,040
I had promised my child

575
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,800
to play with him
instead of working overtime.

576
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:48,770
Besides,

577
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,210
it's not my fault.

578
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,170
Why do I have to work overtime?

579
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,560
Well, I really don't understand.

580
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,280
Why does someone
always get everybody involved

581
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,800
when she makes a mistake?

582
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,930
I don't get an extra pay.

583
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,480
Lin Zhen is gone.

584
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,890
Why do we have to stay?

585
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,280
Data accounting

586
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,560
is Weiwei's job, huh?

587
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,320
Why do we all have to be involved?

588
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,210
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

589
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,480
- Why?
- Why?

590
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,280
I'm sorry.

591
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,720
We're a team.

592
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,560
Let's solve the problem together.

593
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,080
If nobody helps,

594
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,890
the project can't be advanced, right?

595
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,370
Well, let's share the mission.

596
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,930
You can leave the data combination to me.

597
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,930
Someone

598
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:29,480
really takes herself
as the owner of Guanghua.

599
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,280
Don't talk like a boss!

600
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,280
What are you talking about?

601
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,130
If someone complains to Boss,

602
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,130
what will you do?

603
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,080
Oh, another guy will be fired.

604
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,520
If the project can't be advanced,

605
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,370
none of us can get the bonus.

606
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,170
That's right.

607
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,450
Please stop, guys.

608
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,450
Say no more.

609
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,320
You should say no more.

610
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,720
If you didn't make a mistake,

611
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,410
we wouldn't be working overtime.

612
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:24,380
(Dongyang Group)

613
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,240
Why can this not be matched?

614
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,480
- Oh, this.
- Hurry.

615
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,560
Just change the order.

616
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,400
Be quick.

617
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,760
Ji Xing, we're done.

618
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,890
I've emailed it to you.

619
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:56,890
I should go.

620
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:57,730
OK.

621
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,730
Ji Xing,

622
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,170
we emailed it to you, too.

623
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,160
OK.

624
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,410
Umm, I also emailed you.

625
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,320
- Tang, hurry.
- OK.

626
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,160
I'll wait downstairs.

627
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:41,770
Xing,

628
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,370
I'm done with my part.

629
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,370
If you're not done,

630
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,890
give me some.

631
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,930
No need. Email it to me.

632
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,970
I'll handle the date together.

633
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:49,970
OK.

634
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,720
Shall I keep you company for a while?

635
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,760
I'll be faster when I work alone.

636
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,920
You can leave.

637
00:28:58,970 --> 00:28:59,890
Fine.

638
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,370
I should go.

639
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,050
Goodbye.

640
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,890
(Shao Yichen)
What are you doing? Are you off work?

641
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,560
No. Working overtime in the office.

642
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,940
(Ji Xing: No. Working overtime in the office.)

643
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:58,370
(Shao Yichen)
It's late.

644
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,890
You're working so hard.

645
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,850
(Ji Xing)
For the bonus, I'll bear it.

646
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,800
(Shao Yichen)
Tell me when you're home.

647
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,930
I'll wait for you.

648
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,460
(Revolution over a century
with brilliant miracles)

649
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,890
(This is a pledge.)

650
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,690
(As your cousin, I should remind you.)

651
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,370
(It's good to have confidence.)

652
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,690
(But you should do what you really can.)

653
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,720
(Last night, Mr. Han's assistant)

654
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,080
(helped you like that.)

655
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,760
(Then on the intranet,)

656
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,480
(someone said something dirty)

657
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,520
(about you.)

658
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:58,580
(Dongyang Group)

659
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:24,970
Mr. Han.

660
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,640
Worked overtime?

661
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,160
Mr. Han,

662
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,170
for Zhu Lei's case,

663
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,010
thank you.

664
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,000
Later, I checked it.

665
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,410
The robot of the hotel

666
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,930
doesn't have a camera.

667
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,450
It's not a problem.

668
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,210
Pick me up on the ground floor.

669
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:49,780
(Han Ting: Pick me up on the ground floor.)

670
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,360
Shall I drive you?

671
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,600
No, thanks. I called a taxi.

672
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,600
Did you call the taxi?

673
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:35,730
Yes.

674
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,330
Mr. Han, I should go.

675
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,640
Ning, have you heard about what happened

676
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,480
in Hefeng Group?

677
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,850
Of course. Lately, a female employee

678
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:15,700
of Hefeng Group

679
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,480
revealed her real-name story on the Internet.

680
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,450
Sexually harassed by an executive,

681
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,330
she called the police.

682
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,970
But due to insufficient evidence,

683
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,120
it ended up with nothing definite.

684
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,850
They have their word against each other.

685
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,770
I hate such news.

686
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,200
Full of negative energy.

687
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,480
Without evidence,

688
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,560
what's the point

689
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,410
of arguing?

690
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,770
I wonder whether the woman

691
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,840
set a trap

692
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,480
or the man had an evil intention.

693
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,730
I didn't mean anything, Miss.

694
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,200
Think about this case.

695
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,890
There are always two sides

696
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,290
to every question.

697
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,810
But from the radio,

698
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,850
I think the woman has a problem.

699
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,330
What problem?

700
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,080
She has a problem from being harassed?

701
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,080
Let me analyze it.

702
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,080
The radio just said

703
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,120
there wasn't evidence, right?

704
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,600
The evidence was insufficient.

705
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,120
If the man had really done something,

706
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,450
he would have been arrested.

707
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,600
How would he

708
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,810
still be discussed on the radio?

709
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,410
As the saying goes,

710
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,680
"Nothing happens for no reason."

711
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,850
Every day, I drive a taxi for passengers.

712
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
The food street

713
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,730
and the bar street, come on...

714
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,370
The girls wear revealing clothes.

715
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,520
Way too revealing.

716
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,290
Really, really revealing.

717
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,600
Isn't it convenient for those evil men?

718
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,000
Since when are girls judged

719
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,290
by their physical appearance?

720
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,730
A man can't restrain himself.

721
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,200
How can it be the victim's problem?

722
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,850
Come on, Miss. Take it easy.

723
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,560
This is just a discussion, huh?

724
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,290
I'm not complaining about you.

725
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,520
You look... You're a decent girl, obviously.

726
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,160
Hey, if this case

727
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,290
happens again,

728
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,680
blame the two parties equally.

729
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,810
They both have a problem.

730
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:45,770
Stop the car.

731
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,250
Why? You can't get a taxi in the rain.

732
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,090
Stop the car.

733
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:50,570
Come on.

734
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,080
Or I'll complain about you.

735
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,520
I'll stop, then.

736
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:55,930
A discussion annoys you.

737
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,120
So emotional.

738
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,500

You recognized me?

753
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,080
Umm...

No need.

757
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,290
When did you get a new phone number?

Nothing.

761
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,220
(Xinggang Hospital)

762
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:34,290
Director Li, Bay has been examined.

763
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,130
Nothing is wrong.

764
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,520
The other day, your company

765
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,890
just sent a maintenance guy.

766
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,290
Why are you sent again?

767
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,290
Can't you finish the work

768
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,130
at one stroke?

769
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:43,480
We're quite busy.

770
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,000
Sorry.

771
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,370
We'll do better next time.

772
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:48,930
We examine Bay regularly

773
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:49,850
to make it

774
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,480
better serve your hospital

775
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:52,850
and avoid

776
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,410
wrong data acquisition

777
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,250
for Phase II.

778
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,330
I told your company about this.

779
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,330
We'll no longer provide data

780
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,170
for Bay Phase II.

781
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,680
Haven't you communicated?

782
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,680
I'm from the Tech Department

783
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,810
and I wasn't involved

784
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:08,810
in data acquisition.

785
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,890
Maybe I'm not

786
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,000
well informed.

787
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,330
May I ask if there's something wrong

788
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,770
when you use Bay?

789
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,120
You can give me feedback.

790
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,970
If something's wrong,
I'll make adjustments.

791
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,040
It's good.

792
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,880
I don't have a problem.

793
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,730
Then why...?

794
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,000
Hello.

795
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,400
What?

796
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,770
OK. I'll report this problem

797
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:32,610
right away.

798
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,930
There's an emergency with our system.

799
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,290
I have to take care of it.

800
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,570
I won't see you out.

801
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,520
You go back and tell your superior.

802
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,080
We won't cooperate on Phase II.

803
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,330
Mr. Han, I didn't mean to bother you.

804
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,000
But you got our cooperation personally.

805
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,810
Xinggang Hospital is the first pilot hospital

806
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,330
for the implementation of Doctorcloud.

807
00:41:58,770 --> 00:41:59,640
When there's a problem,

808
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,810
our further cooperation can hardly be advanced.

809
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,450
Dr. Jiang Huai's engineer

810
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,890
is on his way to your hospital.

811
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,000
I'll be right there, too.

812
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,560
To Xinggang Hospital.

813
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,570
OK, Boss.

814
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,200
What takes so long?

815
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:33,200
We can't do anything now.

816
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:35,480
Why do we have to wait?

817
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,320
Oh, granny.

818
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,850
Granny, are you OK?

819
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,090
I'm fine.

820
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,120
Thank you, young girl.

821
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,930
Why is it so hard to have a dental check?

822
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,160
It took me two hours to get here.

823
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,850
But my trip will be wasted.

824
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,640
What do I do?

825
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,040
Oh...

826
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,450
The dental department...

827
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,090
Director Li,

828
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,970
the Doctorcloud broke down.

829
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
