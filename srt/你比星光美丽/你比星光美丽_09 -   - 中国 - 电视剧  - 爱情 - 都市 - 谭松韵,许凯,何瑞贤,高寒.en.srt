let's go visit your parents.

27
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,190
I'll buy your father

00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,600
his favorite tea

29
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,470

Yichen, when we're old,

32
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,390
let's move to such a beautiful place,

33
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,230
OK?

34
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,360
Do you remember we said

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,080
we would run a guesthouse in Yunnan?

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,880
Yeah.

37
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,920
You said I cooked very well.

38
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,550
So, I could be a chef

39
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,590
and you could be a receptionist.

40
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,200
But you also said

41
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,670
you didn't want me to work too hard.

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,590
We would rather

43
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,390
hire some local employees.

44
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,110
Then we could go fishing,

45
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,360
climb the mountains,

46
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,520
and go anywhere we want to be.

47
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,920
When we were fed up with somewhere,

48
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,710
we could move to another place.

49
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,670
And when we grew old,

50
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,200
we would sit in the rocking chair
in front of our house,

51
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,520
waddling and waddling.

52
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,110

172
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,990
I'm here

173
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,710
just to communicate with peers.

174
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,590
What about you, Miss Ji?

175
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,960
My company has just started

176
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,400

177
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,400
I'm not going.

178
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,160

179

You're not what you used to be.

180
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,440
When you were an employee,

181
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,400
you could avoid social intercourses.

182
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,320
Now, you're a boss.

183
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,680
You have to contact more people

184
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,470
in case you lose some opportunities.

185
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,560
When work is done perfectly,

186
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,920
there will be opportunities.

187
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,230
Without strength,
even the best opportunities won't help.

188
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,350
Here's the thing.

189
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,800
I have a speech to make.

190
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,710
I'll go get ready.

191
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,870
You come with me.

192
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:28,660
(Sign-in Reception)

193
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,470
You've been absent-minded all day.

194
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,590
What's bothering you?

195
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,470
Nothing.

196
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,590
You asked me for the invitation.

197
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,750
But now, you're negative.

198
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,350
This isn't the right attitude.

199
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,920
Maybe I have low sugar blood

200
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,750
when I eat nothing in the morning.

201
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,710
I'll be OK this afternoon.

202
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,470
What on earth happened?

203
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,320
Nothing.

204
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,470
I'll adjust myself.

205
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,600
Adjust your mood

206
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,960
and cheer up,

207
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,590
Ji Xing.

208
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,360
Done comforting her?

209
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,360
You didn't have to be so competitive, huh?

210
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,510
Oh, I was?

211
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,920
I just tried to remind her.

212
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
I don't want others to think

213
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,790
a former employee of Guanghua

214
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,160
has no social etiquette.

215
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,400
Anything wrong?

216
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,390
No.

217
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,960
Don't worry. I'll instruct her.

218
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,070
Then, she should work hard.

219
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,470
You have high standards, after all.

220
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,710
(Lu Linjia)
Ting, how about you check up

221
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,550
on my bar tonight?

222
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,960
Get in the car.

223
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,160
No need, Mr. Han. I called a taxi.

224
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,640
Don't waste time.

225
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,870
Thanks.

226
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,510
Mr. Han,

227
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,200
sorry for today.

228
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,470
I behaved poorly.

229
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,160
I won't do it next time.

230
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,440
Since you know you feel bad

231
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,680
when you don't eat anything,

232
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,920
you must have meals regularly.

233
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,960
The choice is yours.

234
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,750
Think it over.

Hello.

252
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,520
Open the door.

253
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,400
Look, Yichen.

254
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,120
This is our agreement with Dongyang.

255
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,710
It has the stamps and the signatures.

256
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,880
Look.

257
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,230
Look at it.

258
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,160
And here.

259
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,510
(Han Ting, Ji Xing)
Their first payment

260
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,350
has arrived, too.

261
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,000
Look.

262
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,860
(Details)

263
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,310
Soon.

264
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,680
Soon, Xingchen will develop
along the right lines.

265
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,000
Xing.

266
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,790
Congratulations.

267
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,390
Xing,

268
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,990
no other girl.

269
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,880
Only you.

270
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,400
I only had you all the time.

271
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,990
Xing, stop crying.

272
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,360
I'm no longer your girlfriend.

273
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,600
It's none of your business.

274
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,170
Can't you wait for me?

275
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,790
I told you I would soon succeed.

276
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,920
Wait for me, will you?

277
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,880
Could you please wait for me?

278
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,310
- Could you?
- No.

279
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,270
I can't only

280
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
keep you company

281
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,790
when you need me.

282
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,880
And when you don't,

283
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,230
I'm only the background.

284
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,220
Sorry. It's my fault.

285
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,510
Sorry.

286
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,710
I won't do this again.

287
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,680
I just won't.

288
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,160
Sorry, Yichen.

289
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,070
Sorry.

290
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,870
Xing,

291
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,510
we can no longer

292
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,470
stay in each other's life.

293
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,880
I'm to blame.

294
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,920
You failed to get financing,

295
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,990
failed to buy a printer,

296
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,680
and you had research problems.

297
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,880
Every day, you have terrible troubles,

298
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,640
big or small.

299
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,920
But all I can give you

300
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,510
is pale and useless comfort.

301
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,680
I can't give you anything.

302
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,070
I don't need anything from you.

303
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,510
That's all about work.

304
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,880
I don't need that from you, Yichen.

305
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,680
But I do, Xing.

306
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
I can't only be an onlooker

307
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,200
to watch your life

308
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,200
while I can't get involved at all.

309
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,790
So, stop saying sorry.

310
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,200
You've done nothing wrong.

311
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,960
Xing, we'll just go different ways.

312
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,070
Actually, last night,

313
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,070
I saw your proposal plan.

314
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,920
But Xing,

315
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,790
I can't accept it.

316
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,710
Sorry.

317
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,120
Because what I want

318
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:17,270
is a simple life
where the couple stays together.

319
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,550
But what you want

320
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,160
is to realize your value in life.

321
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,990
So, our relationship

322
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,400
really can't sustain.

323
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,550
Xing,

324
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,680
I want you to do very well.

325
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,120
I want you to be happy,

326
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,270
healthy,

327
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,990
and successful.

328
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,920
I want you to get everything

329
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,880
you want to have.

330
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,900
(Don't Be Afraid of the Wind)

331
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,680
I bought two opera tickets.

332
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,990
Let's watch it

333
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,360
to celebrate our fourth anniversary.

334
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,230
OK. I'll come and pick you up.

335
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,920
You keep the tickets.

336
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,270
I don't need to go anywhere.

337
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,310
Because every day, I can see

338
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,070
the most beautiful star.

339
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,070
Xing,

340
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,790
will you marry me?

341
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
I'll keep the ring.

342
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,310
When I get financing,

343
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,880
I'll propose to you.

344
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,200
OK?

345
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,520
Pinky promise.

346
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
There it goes.

347
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,880
(Lu Linjia)
Ting, where are you?

348
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,270
Hurry. I've been waiting for you.

349
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,600
What smells so good?

350
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,960
What have you cooked?

351
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,510
Oh, seafood porridge.

352
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,550
Every time you're in trouble, you cook.

353
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,400
Today, you cooked something so complicated.

354
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,070
Are you in some big trouble?

355
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,830
What happened?

356
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,120
Did Ji Xing send you

357
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,270
a wedding invitation?

358
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,750
She broke up.

359
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,070
It's a good thing.

360
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,640
Go get her now.

361
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,750
She's in urgent need of comfort.

362
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,120
What are you doing here?

363
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,920
Stop being arrogant.

364
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,880
Just do what I tell you.

365
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,230
Now, go give her

366
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,120
proper care and comfort.

367
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,070
Then you'll get her.

368
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,120
I never allow myself

369
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,440
to swoop in.

370
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,760
Come on.

371
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,640
To get what you want,

372
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,600
never mind how you get it.

373
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,070
OK. I have something else to do.

374
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,960
I'm going out.

375
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,960
After all this trouble,

376
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,990
you won't taste any?

377
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,110
You enjoy it.

378
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,880
Clean the kitchen for me.

379
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,680
What I just told you,

380
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,880
think carefully about it.

381
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,120
That's a shame he isn't a chef.

382
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:11,380
(Tell Mother)

383
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,520
Lemonade, please.

384
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,280
Thanks.

385
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,400
Ting, there you are, at last.

386
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,280
She's been sitting there

387
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,670
and drinking for more than one hour.

388
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,960
Don't worry.

389
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,360
She must be drinking alone

390
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,470
for something she's sad about.

391
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,320
Look. She can even dance.

392
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,280
More hyper than me.

393
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,600
Rest assured.

394
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,990
Let me show you around the cabins.

395
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,240
- I have ideas for design.
- I'd like...

396
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,190
Go check it for me.

397
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,510
I'm OK.

398
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,030
I'm OK. Don't be scared.

399
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,190
I'd like

400
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,670
a Bloody Mary.

401
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,960
OK.

402
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,400
Awesome.

403
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,280
Thank you.

404
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,440
Who are you?

405
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
Who do you think I am?

406
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,670
Han Ting?

407
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,030
Come on. Drink with me.

408
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,880
I'll drive you home.

409
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,590
- I'm not going home.
- Bill, please.

410
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,960
- Take her coat.
- What are you doing?

411
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,990
Put me down!

412
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,840
I'm not done drinking!

413
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,880
- The bill is on him.
- I can drink more!

414
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,510
I'm not drunk.

415
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,630
I... I can even swim.

416
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,400
I can swim in backstroke and freestyle.

417
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,240
All kinds.

418
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,840
I can swim.

419
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,960
Ting, where are we going?

420
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,470
Driver her home first.

421
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,990
Boss, I only know which community

422
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,320
Miss Ji lives in.

423
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,960
But I don't know

424
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,800
which room it is.

425
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,070
Call Wei Qiuzi.

426
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,190
That's right. It's smart of you.

427
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,920
Tang Song, open the window.

428
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,080
Don't.

429
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,920
Cold air may make her feel worse.

430
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,430
OK.

431
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,360
Wei Qiuzi is asleep, I think.

432
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,280
She doesn't answer.

433
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,430
Keep calling.

434
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,070
Boss, shall I contact the HR of Guanghua

435
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,550
and ask about Miss Ji's address?

436
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,430
No need.

437
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,920
She still doesn't answer.

438
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,880
Ji Xing has another best friend.

439
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,670
That's right.

440
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,550
Tu Xiaomeng.
She must be doing live streaming.

441
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,390
Let me ask her.

442
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:33,360
(You're silenced.)
Happy birthday to you!

443
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,960
Happy birthday to this sweetheart!

444
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,580
- (Oh, I forgot. I'm silenced.)
- Thank you for your support.

445
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,360
Please give me a like.

446
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,470
Thank you, everybody.

447
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,630
The Coolest Mr. Lu

448
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,630
has entered the live room.

449
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,960
(Why is he using his alt account here?)

450
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,510
I have your roommate now.

451
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,510
Text me back.

452
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,920
Room 201, Building No.17,

453
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,280
(Smart Lemon)
Meigang Community.

454
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,190
Tu Xiaomeng texted me back.

455
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,240
Turn around.

456
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,320
I'm just saying

457
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,510
Tu Xiaomeng sent me the address.

458
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,280
Tang Song, let's go.

459
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,400
Closer, please.

460
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,350
Come in here.

461
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,600
Be careful.

462
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,360
Well, you take care of her.

463
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,720
- We should go.
- Thanks.

464
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,360
Don't go.

465
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,070
I feel bad.

466
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,070
Get a basin.

467
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,280
Wait a minute.

468
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,070
Why is she so drunk?

469
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,110
Is there any honey?

470
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,240
Honey?

471
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,030
I... I'll go buy some.

472
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,440
It's dangerous to go out alone so late.

473
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,030
Fine.

474
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,880
- Then...
- I'll go with you.

475
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,760
Thirsty.

476
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,550
Thirsty.

477
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,720
I'm thirsty.

478
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,150
Here. Be careful.

479
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,680
Drink slowly.

480
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,590
Don't go.

481
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,320
You must not leave.

482
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,470
You must not.

483
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,550
Don't move.

484
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,670
Fine. I won't move.

485
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,510
Don't move.

486
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,470
Cold.

487
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,110
I'm cold.

488
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,470
Don't go. Don't.

489
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,590
Don't go.

490
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,590
