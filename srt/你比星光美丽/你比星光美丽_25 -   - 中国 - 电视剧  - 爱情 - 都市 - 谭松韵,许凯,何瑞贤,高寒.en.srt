I just want to see

what it is like

29
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,310
when our names are together.

30
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,080
Not only our names will be together,

31
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,280
(Ji Xing, Han Ting)
but also you and I will be.

32
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,380
(Han Ting, Ji Xing)

33
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,270
Good morning,

34
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,520
boyfriend.

35
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,560
Hello. What's up?

36
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,000
Shall we talk?

37
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,960
When?

38
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,230
Now.

39
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,760
Say it.

40
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,000
Li Li,

41
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,360
these days, I've thought a lot

42
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,190
about our relationship.

43
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,600
I always think

44
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,750
we both know

45
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,830
what the other wants.

46
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
But now, I'm not sure.

47
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,040
You want to keep the sense of boundary

48
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,750
instead of breaking it.

49
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,240
I can understand.

50
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,750
But the senses of security and boundary

51
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,800
are always incongruous.

52
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,870
Every day, I'm worried

53
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,950
about losing you.

54
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,160
I don't want this anymore.

55
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm already trying hard.

56
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,120
I meet your expectations as far as I can.

57
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,310
I think you can feel

58
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,800
how hard I try and change.

59
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,720
You know what I want,

60
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,510
but you just don't give it to me.

61
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,950
How about what I want?

62
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,360
Can you give it to me?

63
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,430
I certainly want you to be happy.

64
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,680
You know clearly

65
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,120
if I really care about you.

66
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,160
Just because we care,

67
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,240
I want to face our relationship

68
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,430
more seriously.

69
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes.

70
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,800
In the beginning, we got together

71
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,120
just for some fun.

72
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,510
But this is what people are like.

73
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,070
Once they love, they can't control themselves.

74
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,750
They'll expect more.

75
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,630
Think about it before you reply.

76
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,680
Xing, bad news.

77
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,200
What is it?

78
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,120
Did you not read the news?

79
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,380
(Xingchen's Illegal Behaviors Are Shielded.)

80
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,040
(Yesterday, there was trouble.
Due to lumbar disc protrusion,)

81
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,100
(Zhang used the intervertebral cage
from Xingchen Technology.)

82
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,390
(Later, her spine deformed and displaced.)

83
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,600
(She wasn't properly handled.)
They should compensate the victim!

84
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,910
(Xingchen is to blame!)
Her life is ruined!

85
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,750
(Shouldn't they care for the disabled victim?)

86
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,750
This is outrageous!

87
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:50,460
(Big News! The New Startup's Illegal Behaviors
Are Shielded by Dongyang Medical.)

88
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,460
(We don't need such a merciless company.)

89
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,530
(With a backer, Ji Xing is just outrageous.)

90
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,380
(Can anybody help them? They look helpless.)

91
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:03,380
(Big News! The New Startup's Illegal Behaviors
Are Shielded by Dongyang Medical.)

92
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,870
It's the moment that begins a chain reaction.

93
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,870
Netizens figured out

94
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,670
when Xingchen Technology was established,

95
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,960
it got the investment

96
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,320
from Dongyang Medical, the industry giant.

97
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,120
Due to this scandal,

98
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,440
the stock price of Dongyang Medical

99
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,390
has been affected, too.

100
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,550
A limit down by the closing bell.

101
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,200
Dongyang Medical has just had a new CEO.

102
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,630
The new CEO Han Ting
is adventurous and resolute.

103
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,870
In this trouble,

104
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,550
(The stock price of Dongyang Medical declined.)
how will Dongyang Medical respond?

105
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,120
I've heard

106
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,120
even your grandpa is aware of this.

107
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,320
What do you want?

108
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,480
I want

109
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,320
what Han Ting is up to.

110
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,480
We're interested
in acquiring Zhu's Medical Instrument.

111
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,600
I want to know his offer.

112
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,920
Ms. Yuan.

113
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,030
Thanks, Ms. Yuan.

114
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,910
Mr. Zhou, what do you want me for?

115
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,870
You watched the news, huh?

116
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,630
I didn't expect Han Ting

117
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,960
to make this big mistake.

118
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,240
I told you.

119
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,390
Xingchen is what we can use

120
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,960
to knock Han Ting down.

121
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,240
Ms. Yuan, you always know.

122
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,120
Since this incident

123
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,550
has affected our company,

124
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,870
how about we add some fuel?

125
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,480
Got it.

126
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,790
I'll contact your grandpa now.

127
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,910
The problem was solved.

128
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,150
Why did someone bring it up again

129
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:41,990
to make a fuss?

130
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,320
It's just like a trap.

131
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,720
Someone must be pushing it from behind.

132
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,910
Who would it be?

133
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,630
Xingchen has some competitors.

134
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,840
But they have no reason

135
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,200
to destroy us.

136
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,390
Let's get the motivation from the result.

137
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,440
So far,

138
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,750
what has the result been?

139
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,720
Xingchen is defamed.

140
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,550
Dongyang Medical is involved.

141
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,840
The stock price has been declining.

142
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,360
Whoever is the biggest beneficiary

143
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,910
must be behind all this.

144
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,800
Don't worry.

145
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,720
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

146
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,960
Opportunities come with challenges.

147
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,360
Boss, the board meeting is about to begin.

148
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,550
Your grandpa has come, too.

149
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
I'll go with you.

150
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,560
No need.

151
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,200
When the board meeting is held,

152
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,390
it won't be coming for you alone.

153
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,320
I can handle that. Don't worry.

154
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,630
But this all began with me.

155
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,470
Do as you're told.

156
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,720
The most important thing

157
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,360
is not to be desperate.

158
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,060
(Xingchen Technology)

159
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,550
When Xingchen was mentioned,

160
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,510
it was a "dark horse".

161
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,320
Now, when it's mentioned,

162
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,720
it's "darkness".

163
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,750
I contacted some PR companies.

164
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,390
Their proposals aren't good enough.

165
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,360
We still have to think

166
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,320
about some other solutions.

167
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,160
Xing.

168
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,720
No matter what,

169
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,600
you have to hold steady these days.

170
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,600
I want to see Zhang Fengmei.

171
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,200
Xing, I'll go with you.

172
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,160
I'll go, too.

173
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,790
No. You don't go.

174
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,630
Or she may get nervous

175
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,720
and the problem can't be solved.

176
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,390
These days,

177
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,510
a lot of people may call.

178
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,840
Just handle them normally.

179
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,360
Look, Mr. Zhou.

180
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,840
These days, the stock price of Dongyang

181
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,720
has declined sharply.

182
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,790
What did I say?

183
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,360
He's so young and stubborn.

184
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,720
I warned him at every meeting.

185
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,320
But it still happened.

186
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,240
We warned him a long ago.

187
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,270
You're right.

188
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,030
As seniors, we made our points.

189
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,240
But he just didn't listen.

190
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,910
As if we wanted to hurt him.

191
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,800
Han Ting,

192
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,440
if this meeting

193
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,790
goes on like this,

194
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,510
it won't mean much.

195
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,390
Tell us.

196
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,000
What is your solution?

197
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,800
Three days.

198
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,630
Give me three days.

199
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,910
I'll remove the negative effects

200
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,080
and stabilize the stock price.

201
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,600
You all heard him, huh?

202
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,150
He promised.

203
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,600
If he fails in three days,

204
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,840
hold him responsible.

205
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,840
That's it, then.

206
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,200
Han Ting, come with me.

207
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,320
Miss Han, Miss Zeng is here.

208
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,960
Yuan.

209
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,960
There you are, Di.

210
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,080
What's wrong?

211
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,750
I heard you didn't feel very well.

212
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,630
So, I came to check on you.

213
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,600
I'm fine.

214
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,910
Grandpa went to the company

215
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,750
to blame Han Ting.

216
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,510
If I had also gone,

217
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,840
it would be like our whole family

218
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,910
were pushing him.

219
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,510
So, I just didn't go.

220
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,870
How have you been?

221
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,120
Everything is fine.

222
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,390
But Han Ting...

223
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,960
He's been burned pretty bad.

224
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,390
Xingchen has a huge scandal.

225
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,150
Even the stock price
of Dongyang Medical declined.

226
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,390
I really didn't expect that.

227
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,870
I told him

228
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,910
to have risk control

229
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,550
over such a rootless startup.

230
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,240
Yuan, you look so calm.

231
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,510
Looks like

232
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,910
Dongyang Technology won't be involved.

233
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,870
Dongyang Technology is under my supervision.

234
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,240
It's been very cautious

235
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,360
in either daily operations

236
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,590
or outward investments.

237
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,350
It won't get in trouble.

238
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,640
Dongyang Medical and Technology
are sister companies.

239
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,590
You're the vice chairwoman of Dongyang Medical.

240
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,880
You sink or swim together.

241
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,630
Yuan,

242
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,790
Han Ting sometimes acts on impulse.

243
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,440
But this time, please let him go.

244
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,640
Oh, Di.

245
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,640
Are you saying

246
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,240
I'm adding fuel to this trouble?

247
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,400
Yuan, that's not what I mean.

248
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,790
You're cousins.

249
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,270
You would never trap him.

250
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,480
I'm just worried about Han Ting.

251
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,400
He's strong-willed.

252
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,550
Even when he should beg for help,

253
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,240
he won't unless he has to.

254
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,720
Under such circumstances,

255
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,000
nobody but you can help him.

256
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,830
Come on.

257
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,160
If you were concerned about your career

258
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,270
instead of Han Ting,

259
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,720
you would be

260
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,590
a really powerful career woman.

261
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,000
Why can't you just get over

262
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,400
my heartless cousin?

263
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,480
He's obsessed with Ji Xing.

264
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,960
Han Ting has his ideas

265
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,550
and his own plans.

266
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,310
Di, let me remind you.

267
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,880
A man will never remember

268
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,070
a soft-hearted woman who pleads for him.

269
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,640
But in this case,

270
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,030
Han Ting's crisis

271
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,880
is an opportunity for you.

272
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,350
Opportunity?

273
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,160
Robot Bay Phase II

274
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,720
is going very smoothly, isn't it?

275
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,960
Xingchen disgraced him.

276
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,440
You can win glory for him

277
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,830
with Guanghua.

278
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,790
Then he will know

279
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,720
who he should get.

280
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,030
OK, Yuan.

281
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,840
I get it.

282
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,800
You...

283
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,350
Nothing to say to me?

284
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,310
I understand what you're worried about.

285
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,400
But since Xingchen was established,

286
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,160
this hasn't been the first crisis.

287
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,790
It will be solved.

288
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,590
Even without your help,

289
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
the problem will be solved?

290
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,110
Yes.

291
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,400
In every crisis, people of Xingchen

292
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,270
solved the problem by themselves.

293
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,840
Grandpa,

294
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,720
I think she's in this trouble because of me.

295
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,080
Fine.

296
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,830
In three days,

297
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,880
I'll see what you can do.

298
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,520
Here.

299
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,800
Say thank you.

300
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,440
- Say it.
- Thank you.

301
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,510
This is your last chance

302
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,750
to get a surgery.

303
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,350
If you agree, sign this.

304
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,590
You also have to be our witness

305
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,920
to prove the relapse of your old injury

306
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,830
has nothing to do with us.

307
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,960
Will you really give me

308
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,830
another surgery?

309
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,550
I really want to help you.

310
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,590
Or I could have left you alone.

311
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,000
I can pay your relatives and make them leave.

312
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,550
Who would really care about you?

313
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,830
You think those guys instigated you

314
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,030
for your own good?

315
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,350
They're actually throwing you under the bus.

316
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,510
I'm sorry.

317
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,960
I bit the hand that fed me.

318
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,960
But...

319
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,110
If my husband knows it,

320
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,720
he won't let me go.

321
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,680
Even if you have enough money,

322
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,000
your waist problem may not be solved.

323
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,110
Now, you finally

324
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,240
get this opportunity.

325
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Instead of cherishing it,

326
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,350
you're ruining it.

327
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
I'm not lying.

328
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,310
If you go on like this,

329
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,200
you'll be paralyzed in bed

330
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,720
for the rest of your life.

331
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,160
Look what a lovely daughter you have.

332
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,920
She's so little.

333
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,240
Even if you're OK

334
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,640
with your future paralysis,

335
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,830
have you thought about her?

336
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,200
How will she live?

337
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,510
You picked such a bad father for her.

338
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,440
Can anybody but you protect her?

339
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,310
You're back, Xu.

340
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,830
He's back. Just go.

341
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,200
If he sees you,

342
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,350
he won't let me go.

343
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,000
You think carefully about it.

344
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,310
I'll come again tomorrow.

345
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,510
I know. I know.

346
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,350
Just leave.

347
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,920
♪I love it when you travel alone in the dawn♪

348
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,920
♪I love it when you never kneel♪

349
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,750
Boss, Miss Zeng is here.

350
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,440
For your information,

351
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,350
Bay Phase II is developing very well.

352
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,400
Phase I and Doctorcloud

353
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,640
have combined smoothly, too.

354
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,550
It's good news.

355
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,830
If it's reported,

356
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,160
I think it can

357
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,880
cover the negative news.

358
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,740
(Progress Report of Robot Bay Phase II)

359
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,800
Han Ting,

360
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,830
actually you and I

361
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,830
know exactly.

362
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,550
The most immediate solution

363
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,270
is to cut the relationship

364
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,590
between Dongyang and Xingchen.

365
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,440
I don't mean anything by it.

366
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,880
But in this case,

367
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,070
too many parties are involved.

368
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,270
- If...
- My cousin taught you?

369
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,200
It doesn't matter who taught me.

370
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,790
- The point is you can't...
- Zeng Di.

371
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,830
Why did Zhang Fengmei's husband

372
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,920
make a scene here?

373
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,790
You know clearly about it, don't you?

374
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,720
I clearly warned you

375
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,720
not to do anything harmful

376
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,920
to Dongyang Medical or Xingchen.

377
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,550
Just be yourself.

378
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,960
You didn't listen, huh?

379
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,110
I didn't reveal that to the media.

380
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,720
You know.

381
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,590
I would never do anything to hurt you.

382
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,310
Ji Xing has held you back again and again,

383
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,510
but you've never blamed her.

384
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,000
Ji Xing and I are in a relationship.

385
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,310
I'll transfer

386
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,720
my share of Guanghua to you.

(Dongyang Group)

388
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,400
Don't pull a long face, guys.

389
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,720
I've brought you some pastry.

390
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,190
Come on, Shang.

391
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,750
Come on, Zuo.

392
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,110
Share it with everyone.

393
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,920
You will all have some.

394
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,240
Take some rest.

395
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,000
Get stuffed before you work.

396
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,760
Thanks, Mr. Su.

397
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,960
Not at all.

398
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,870
Hi, Li.

399
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,830
Take a break.

400
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,920
Have some pastry. Here.

401
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,080
Thank you.

402
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,000
You're welcome.

403
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,750
So many?

404
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,000
I just need one box.

405
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,160
You share the rest with them.

406
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,200
No, no, no. They're all for you.

407
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,200
Different favors. Taste them.

408
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,790
If you can't finish them, keep them.

409
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,720
Take them slow.

410
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,720
No, thanks.

411
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,920
It's a waste.

412
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,440
It's not. Not at all.

413
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,750
Everyone has some.

414
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,750
There's plenty of pastry.

415
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,800
- Not a waste.
- Zhizhou.

416
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,510
I'm not only talking about the pastry.

417
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,790
Don't waste your time on me.

418
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,920
We talked about it last time.

419
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,590
I don't think it's a waste of time.

420
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,790
Think about it.

421
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,000
The three of us

422
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,510
started from the rooftop office

423
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,790
and have been working so hard

424
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,790
until we're in this office.

425
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,400
You and I

426
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,920
are kind of comrade-in-arms, huh?

427
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,240
Actually, I'm grateful to you.

428
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,830
Because I like you,

429
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,240
I'm aware of my shortcomings and defects.

430
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,440
Most importantly, I'm immature.

431
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,790
Because I like you,

432
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,590
I'm motivated enough to grow

433
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,960
and make progress.

434
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,480
Don't worry.

435
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,960
I won't embarrass you anymore.

436
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,720
So...

437
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:56,870
You and I

438
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,750
will just be friends, OK?

439
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,870
OK.

440
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Just friends.

441
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,440
Great. I'll get back to work.

442
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,000
Bye-bye.

443

(Xingchen Technology,

444
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,430
Yichen.

445
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,350
Oh, you're back.

446
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,750
Have you watched the news of Xingchen?

447
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,830
I have.

448
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,160
It's quite a big scandal.

449
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,640
I'm worried about Xing.

450
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,040
Don't worry.

451
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,440
Xingchen's products

452
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,280
are of very high quality.

453
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,510
All the previous clinical tests

454
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,350
taken in our center

455
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,760
have been successful.

456
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,350
I'm summarizing

00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,590

458

Oh.

462
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,030
Email me the data

of Xingchen's product.

464
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,270
I'll show it to the experts of my institute.

465
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,550
Maybe they can help.

466
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,640
I have it. I'll email it.

467
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,480
OK.

468
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,390
It's over there.

469
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,240
OK.

470
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,240

Before the result comes out,

478
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,750
why is Xingchen Technology to blame?

497
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,440
she'll be even prouder.

498
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,920
This is the way she gets more fans.

499

00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,160

00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,000
on the Internet.

521
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,000

522
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,350
Ignore those comments.

523
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,350
Those gloomy guys

524
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,920

00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,110

During a talk,

527
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,720
the foreigner sneezed.

528
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,000
The interpreter happened to sneeze, too.

529
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,590
The boss said,

530
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,240
"You don't need to translate this.

531
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,080
I can understand."

532
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,790
When a hunter shot at a fox,

533
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,440
he was shot to death instead.

534
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,110
The fox said proudly,

535
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,590
"I'm the reflex fox."

536
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,350
A fisherman caught a squid.

537
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,830
The squid begged,

538
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,830
"I beg you. Let me go."

539
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,640
The fisherman said, "I'll grill you
some questions."

540
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,200
The squid asked, "Questions?"

541
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,790
The fisherman said, "Stop gibbering."

542
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,960
"Bring it on, then."

543
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,800
Then,

544
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,550
the fisherman grilled the squid.

545
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,400
(Lu Linjia)
Smart Lemon, do you feel better?

546
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,480
Don't be sad.

547
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,320
If you really can't stand it, cry out.

548
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:12,990
(Tu Xiaomeng)
Thank you.

549
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,510
I think she's still unhappy.

550
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,150
I have to try something else.

551
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,400
Oh, my mother has made

552
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,240
some new types of soup.

553
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,240
She wants you to taste it.

554
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,280
OK. I'll go in a few days.

555
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,360
Thank Ms. Han for me.

556
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,580

557
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,670
I stroke Dahuang while you stroke me.

558
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,070
Xing.

559
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,920
I saw what happened.

560
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,000
Are you OK?

561
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,760
I'm fine.

562
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,550
Aren't you supposed to be live streaming now?

563
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,440
I'm tired.

564
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,920
So, I ended it early.

565
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,760
You must be very sad.

566
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,710
Shall I talk with you for a while?

567
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,840
No need.

568
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,920
Thank you, pretty.

569
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,590
Just leave me alone.

570
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,150
OK. Take some rest.

571
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,440
I'll go take off my makeup.

572
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,760
Let's order some food for dinner

573
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,710
and have a drink.

574
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,550
OK.

575
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,760
- Things good?
- Do you miss me?

576
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,110
Thanks.

577
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,190
You can make me laugh now.

578
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,920
Promise me one thing.

579
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,000
When I can't see you,

580
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,840
take good care of yourself.

581
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,400
Come on. Go to bed early.

582
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,240
Bye-bye.

583
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,590
Xu, I beg you.

584
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,400
We can't earn the money

585
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,590
with this unconscionable lie.

586
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,000
I took some money, so what?

587
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,880
Didn't I take the money

588
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,510
for our family?

589
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,720
But...

590
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,840
People in Xingchen are nice guys.

591
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,280
We can't slander them

592
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,710
just for some money.

593
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,480
I beg you.

594
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,510
Give the money back.

595
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,550
Nonsense. I've used it up.

596
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,400
Or you go ask Mr. Chang for the money.

597
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,760
Here, boss.

598
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,320
It's from Mr. Xiao.

599
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,710
It contains Xu Zhuang's profile

600
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,320
and the investigation report.

601
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,320
(Investigation Report)

602
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,260
(Zhang Fengmei had a relapse
due to Xu Zhuang's violence.)

603
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,510
Let's go to Xu Zhuang's home.

604
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,440
Then you go...

605
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,510
Go talk to the media.

606
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,360
Tell them

607
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,710
I wasn't injured

608
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,070
because of Xingchen's product.

609
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,760
But because of your husband, huh?

610
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,840
You want me to tell them

611
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,230
I hit you like this, right?

612
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,590
You want to put me in prison, huh?

613
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,030
Xu Zhuang!

614
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,400
What are you doing here?

615
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,360
Don't hurt her, or I'll call the police.

616
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,960
What are you doing?

617
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,000
You told her where we lived?

618
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,710
Answer me!

619
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,920
How could you hit a patient?

620
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
Are you an animal?

621
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,720
Give me your phone.

622
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,840
Don't be silly.

623
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,920
I've recorded everything.

624
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,760
Give it to me!

625
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,360
Miss Ji, run!

626
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Go away!

627
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,280
Miss Ji!

628
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,550
Stop!

629
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,680
Stop!

630
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:33,960
Give me the phone!

631
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,030
Han Ting!

632
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,230
What? Are you OK?

633
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,920
I've got the evidence.

634
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,440
No one can give you a hard time anymore.

635
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,670
You must not do anything so dangerous again.

636
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,030
Do you hear?

637
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,920
(Dongyang Group)
Good news.

638
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,400
Xu Zhuang has been taken away

639
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,360
for interrogation.

640
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,550
Yes.

641
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,110
Great. This family bully is such an animal.

642
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,230
He deserves to be punished.

643
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,800
Yeah. He deserves to be in jail!

644
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,840
Xing is awesome.

645
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,320
She not only turned the corner,

646
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,150
but also attracted attention to our company.

647
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,840
Our products were advertised.

648
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,440
What do we call this? A blessing in disguise!

649
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:43,150
Mr. Su, you've had a hard time.

650
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,250
- Not at all.
- Miss Ji,

651
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,920
Zhang Fengmei's surgery is scheduled.

652
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,920
In three days.

653
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,200
Good.

654
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,960
We've helped Zhang Fengmei

655
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,550
to get a second chance to stand up.

656
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,590
I feel much better now.

657
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,550
Well, let's check on her later.

658
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,880
Her rehabilitation cost

659
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,000
will be covered by us.

660
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,880
Oh, her daughter

661
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,510
is being raised by her parents.

662
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,550
She's safe now.

663
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,920
This incident

664
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,920
has finally ended up well.

665
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,710
We've been through a lot. Really a lot.

666
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,350
Miss Ji,

667
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,670
shouldn't we

668
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,400
be grateful to someone?

669
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,440
Yeah.

670
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,440
Luckily, Mr. Han arrived in time.

671
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,590
He is like Miss Ji's knight.

672
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,630
This is really enviable.

673
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,320
Come on, don't make fun of me.

674
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,400
Go back to work. Dismissed.

675
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,470
Wait, Xing.

676
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,030
This problem has been perfectly solved.

677
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,630
Shall we celebrate it?

678
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,320
How about another day?

679
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,000
I have a date tonight.

680
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,920
Come on.

681
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,440
So, tonight,

682
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,920
we won't disturb you and Mr. Han.

683
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,840
How about this?

684
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,840
This Sunday,

685
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,510
I'll invite you to dinner and karaoke.

686
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,510
- Good.
- Nice.

687
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,960
All right. Get back to work.

688
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,880
Guys, go to work.

689
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,720
Mr. Su,

690
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:55,960
can you help me check

691
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,800
the data of this product?

692
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:57,950
OK.

693
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,420
(Xiao Yixiao)

694
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,110
This one is correct, too.

695
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,360
The data are accurate.

696
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,600
Good job.

697
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,760
Thanks, Mr. Su.

698
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:13,990
Come on.

699
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,960
Then you go...

700
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,000
Go talk to the media.

701
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,960
Tell them I wasn't injured

702
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,630
because of Xingchen's product.

703
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,400
But because of your husband, huh?

704
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,030
Any other doubts?
