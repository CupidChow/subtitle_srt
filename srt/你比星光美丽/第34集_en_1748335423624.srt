1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to go to the sky and object heaven.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We won't meet again.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll have a future, but I'm afraid.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll have no doubt in my life.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'm going to go to the sky and object heaven.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't give up either.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,160
I will always believe in the miracle

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,160
Even if I have no idea who I am

17
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,320
How about I take care of you?

18
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,920
Okay

19
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,040
Jia Jia

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,800
I don't need 24 hours of people to take care of me

21
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,040
When she is free

22
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,520
I can help her sometimes

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,120
Please, teacher Xiaomeng

24
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,640
It's okay, aunt

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,720
I can do it whenever I want

26
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,000
Nothing is more important than your health

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,280
This child is so kind

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,480
I'm so lucky to know you

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Really?

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,360
It's okay

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,760
Thank you

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,200
It's okay

33
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,440
How about you go down and talk

34
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,920
See which day she comes

35
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,160
Make time

36
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,160
Go down, go down

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Take a rest, aunt

38
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,840
Okay

39
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,000
Thank you

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,880
It's okay

41
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,480
Come when you are free

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,040
Take a rest

43
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,240
Close the door

44
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,800
Okay

45
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,440
I...

46
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,880
I didn't know

47
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,200
the Wu Zheng nearly dreamed of development

48
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay, I will figure it out

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,560
Thank you

50
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,560
My night bag

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,400
All in aÐ´

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,160
I don't have it

53
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,960
I can't give it to you

54
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,160
What are you doing?

55
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,040
why

56
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,320
Xie

57
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,040
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,160
Mr. Li.

59
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,920
You haven't gone back for a while.

60
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
Why are you here so early?

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,560
Mr. Li,

62
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,000
I have good news for you.

63
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,920
Under Mr. Su's guidance,

64
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,800
we developed a secret weapon.

65
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,040
A secret weapon?

66
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,440
What secret weapon?

67
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,240
The secret thing I told you about.

68
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,440
Xingjie upgraded the printing equipment

69
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,600
and improved the printing speed.

70
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,280
So I thought of

71
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,720
getting it from the hardware.

72
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,520
Mr. Su,

73
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,240
you're too naive.

74
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,320
Mr. Li,

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,720
we did a big thing this time.

76
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,880
Now, Hanhai

77
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,040
uses the printing method of double-edged-head.

78
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:03,800
Mr. Su,

79
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,360
during the process of bringing us out,

80
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,600
found that some companies

81
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,840
have used four-edged-head printing methods

82
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,280
to pursue the speed of the speed.

83
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,720
But the stability is poor.

84
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,080
The combination of X and Y-axis is not high.

85
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,000
The product rate has dropped.

86
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,120
But Mr. Su,

87
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,640
with the construction of the North Pole,

88
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,200
has upgraded the hardware.

89
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,320
Now we can do

90
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,040
the stability

91
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,760
of the four-edged-head.

92
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,480
To put it simply,

93
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,280
the printing time

94
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,360
is at least one-third of the speed.

95
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,760
In the end,

96
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,240
we have to complete it in the day after tomorrow.

97
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,080
But Mr. Li,

98
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,600
don't you have a batch of

99
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,840
high-quality products?

100
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,600
Mr. Su has added a class for us.

101
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,920
He added the extra points

102
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,400
and upgraded the equipment.

103
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,200
I talked to Mr. Qian.

104
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,400
The final day can only be delayed.

105
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,280
After you upgrade,

106
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,640
can you produce this batch of products

107
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,080
before the day after?

108
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,680
Later, after we have a meeting

109
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
with the technical department,

110
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
we can upgrade the equipment

111
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,920
for the parts first.

112
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,440
If we succeed,

113
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,760
I think it's okay.

114
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,400
Okay, Mr. Su.

115
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,880
You are not only helping

116
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,280
our sales department,

117
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,800
but also adding

118
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,080
one-third of the profit to Han Xin.

119
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,920
If this is done,

120
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,880
you are all

121
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,640
Han Xin's great accomplices.

122
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,080
Mr. Su has done all the work.

123
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,480
Why should we do it?

124
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,880
Mr. Su,

125
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,360
we have to

126
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,880
submit our research results.

127
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,680
We are all wasted.

128
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,480
I think we are wasted.

129
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,680
Han Haixing is a single-body company.

130
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,120
We can't hide our secrets.

131
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,240
If we still

132
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,920
make a batch of technical seal,

133
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,440
the company will be waiting for the separation.

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,600
And the sales department

135
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,520
will be more resolved.

136
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,000
We can't

137
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,320
let Han Xin

138
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,560
be embarrassed by Mr. Han

139
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,880
in front of Han Xin.

140
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,080
If Xin Xin knows,

141
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,800
she will be moved back from Germany.

142
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,960
Okay,

143
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,680
don't you want to have coffee?

144
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,960
I have a lot of work to do.

145
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,080
Come on.

146
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,400
Where is the coffee?

147
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,520
I want it too.

148
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,520
Here you are.

149
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,280
Mom,

150
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
Xiaomeng is here to see you.

151
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,800
Xiaomeng is here.

152
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
Auntie.

153
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,200
How do you feel today?

154
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,680
Here.

155
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,920
Sit down.

156
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,680
Auntie, you feel better.

157
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,280
You are more than good to my son.

158
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,640
Look at this table.

159
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,000
It's all he made.

160
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,040
And this soup.

161
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,280
He made it himself.

162
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,400
You can still make soup?

163
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,280
Is it okay?

164
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,920
It tastes good.

165
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,040
You said that

166
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,240
I used to make soup for my son.

167
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,760
Now,

168
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,960
he is back.

169
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,560
He made soup for me.

170
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,640
By the way, Jiajia.

171
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,400
He has so many dishes.

172
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,320
He made it for Mr. Xiaomeng.

173
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,680
He needs to try it.

174
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
No, no, no.

175
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,920
Auntie, it's too troublesome.

176
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,360
Don't be polite.

177
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,840
It's okay.

178
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,880
You can talk to my mom.

179
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,040
Since I was sick,

180
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,040
my son

181
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,960
was filial to me.

182
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,480
He is a sensible man.

183
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,880
He always

184
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,360
had a long and short

185
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,280
relationship with a child.

186
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
He is so polite.

187
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,800
Now,

188
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,680
he is a mother.

189
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,800
Have some.

190
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,960
Have some, mom.

191
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,720
He has changed a lot.

192
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,000
He said that

193
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,040
he made it.

194
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,080
You know that, right?

195
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,280
Now, a boy can cook.

196
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,840
He is really a little girl.

197
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,120
Come on.

198
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,080
Don't go.

199
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,760
He will make you some dishes.

200
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,160
You should try it.

201
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,520
Just give him a small request.

202
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,160
Don't be so polite.

203
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,480
It's better to have a heavy taste.

204
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,200
Okay.

205
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,120
You drink soup.

206
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay, okay.

207
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,360
You are the best for me.

208
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,280
Mr. Han.

209
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,720
Han Xing's sales

210
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
has increased by 40%

211
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,280
compared to last season.

212
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,760
You did a good job.

213
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,880
Thank you.

214
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,560
How is Han Hai and Xing Chen

215
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,800
doing?

216
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,600
I was thinking of telling you about it.

217
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,960
The new record is so beautiful.

218
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,440
It's really thanks to Xing Chen's high-ranking.

219
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,240
Su Zhizhou has led the company to

220
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,760
upgrade the audio software.

221
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,360
He has brought

222
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,920
one-third of Han Xing's power.

223
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,480
Such a technical innovation

224
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,080
is really incredible.

225
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,200
And the sales director of the department,

226
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,840
he has also brought

227
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,920
many new customers to Han Xing.

228
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,360
And his career

229
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,840
has always been the first in the sales department.

230
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,000
Mr. Ji is a great man.

231
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,320
Xing Chen's every one

232
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,440
is his favorite talent.

233
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,120
He can't be called a talent.

234
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,080
By the way, Mr. Han,

235
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,480
the talent you mentioned last time

236
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,960
was created by Peiyu and AI talent.

237
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,000
I think it's very necessary.

238
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,520
But in China,

239
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,240
there is no such talent.

240
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,000
How to develop and promote it,

241
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,400
I'm still a bit confused.

242
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,640
No rush.

243
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,840
I'll go to Germany in a few days

244
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,280
to check the local supply.

245
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,760
And discuss with Professor Meng Qing.

246
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,280
Okay.

247
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,320
Mr. Han, I'll get back to work.

248
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,720
Boss,

249
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,800
Li Ping is ready.

250
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,040
He can go to the local market.

251
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,280
What's your problem, auntie?

252
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,240
Did you find it out?

253
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,360
No.

254
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,560
Don't worry too much.

255
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,600
I'll be fine.

256
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,920
Thank you for coming to see my mom.

257
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,440
What are you talking about?

258
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,760
I'm very nice to you.

259
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,480
Okay.

260
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,000
All right.

261
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,720
Go back.

262
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,880
Okay.

263
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,400
Be careful.

264
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,120
Okay.

265
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,080
Bye.

266
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:57,760
However,

267
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
everyral day is easier,

268
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,440
different life are better for you.

269
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:30,120
I've changed my mind.

270
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,240
What's wrong with me?

271
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,080
It's a bone.

272
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,320
What?

273
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,480
It's a

274
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,720
spicy taste.

275
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,880
Really?

276
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,720
I can't do it.

277
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,040
It's not because I got this disease

278
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,120
that I lost my sense of smell.

279
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,080
I can't do it.

280
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,320
Mom, don't be sad.

281
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,040
We'll be back in time.

282
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,760
Have a good rest.

283
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,720
By the way,

284
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,080
I'll come to see you later.

285
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,320
Did you tell her I'm sick?

286
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,120
Didn't I tell you?

287
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,240
Don't be so arrogant

288
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,000
when I get this disease.

289
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,600
We're all so busy.

290
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,920
You're not an outsider.

291
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,160
We care about you.

292
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,880
How about this?

293
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,040
If she's so busy,

294
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,920
call her.

295
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,720
Don't bother her.

296
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,600
It's time.

297
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,280
I'll pick her up.

298
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,960
Let's go.

299
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,840
Come on.

300
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,680
Come on.

301
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,720
She's coming.

302
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,840
Where's your grandma?

303
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:52,420
Uh-huh.

304
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,500
How are you?

305
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,180
So bad.

306
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,600
Doing that

307
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,360
on my watch?

308
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,080
What?

309
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,160
You're so busy with work

310
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,800
and you're here to see me.

311
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,240
You should leave this time to yourself.

312
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,400
Have a good rest.

313
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,320
Grandma,

314
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,800
I should be here.

315
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,280
What's wrong?

316
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,160
Why can't you find the cause?

317
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,600
How about we change the clothes?

318
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,080
No need.

319
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,400
I know my body.

320
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,880
Come.

321
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,320
You guys talk first.

322
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,720
I'll go wash the clothes

323
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,160
since auntie is not here these days.

324
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,960
You're working so hard.

325
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,080
You seem to be a sensible person.

326
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
No, I'm not.

327
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,680
I'm a funny person since I was born.

328
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,560
Grandma,

329
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,280
we should still be together.

330
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,120
Xiao Ting,

331
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,080
how have you been with that Miss Xing Xing lately?

332
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,600
We...

333
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,520
separated.

334
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,040
I knew it.

335
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,480
Xiao Ting,

336
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,520
you're better than Jia Jia.

337
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
You're smarter than her.

338
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,520
But because of that,

339
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,120
I'm more worried about you.

340
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,920
You see, Jia Jia is a stubborn girl.

341
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,720
She can't hide anything from you.

342
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,520
She can't say anything.

343
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,320
So she won't be wronged.

344
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,320
But you...

345
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,520
have been with her for a long time.

346
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,320
You're always in her heart.

347
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,120
You're not like Xiao Yuan.

348
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,720
She's quite similar.

349
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,120
But Xiao Yuan,

350
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,320
she's been with her parents since childhood.

351
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,720
She has her mom, Zhou Ying,

352
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,120
who's always with her.

353
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,120
It's a pity that you've been

354
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,520
all alone since you were little.

355
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,520
Grandma Kun,

356
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,720
are you still eating spicy food?

357
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,520
What are you talking about?

358
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,320
I'm just a body.

359
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,720
From now on,

360
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,120
I'm not eating spicy food,

361
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
but cold food.

362
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,120
And the fresh food I love.

363
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,320
I'm done eating.

364
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,120
Then I'll get you some spicy food.

365
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,720
I won't pretend to be with you.

366
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,720
Actually, your grandma has no spicy food.

367
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,320
I'm just like a cow.

368
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,320
I'm worried about Jia Jia.

369
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,920
She's chasing after that girl,

370
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
that little teacher.

371
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,920
She's so impulsive.

372
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
She's so anxious.

373
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
I just want to help her

374
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,720
to push her forward.

375
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,920
You young people now

376
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,920
like to

377
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,920
guard her.

378
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,520
Guard her?

379
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
You'll regret it.

380
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,520
I'm just a person.

381
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
Listen to me.

382
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,120
You can't hide yourself.

383
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,920
You have to open your heart.

384
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,120
Open yourself.

385
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
Only then can you get in.

386
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,120
Understand?

387
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,720
Actually,

388
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
I always think

389
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,920
that Miss Xingxin

390
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,520
can open her heart.

391
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,320
And, dad,

392
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
I always think

393
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
you're a kind of

394
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,320
born-in-love person.

395
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,520
Really.

396
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,320
You'll be with her in the end.

397
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,120
I believe in your grandma's intuition.

398
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
She's been so nice to you since she was little.

399
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,120
This.

400
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,920
I'm in bed

401
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,920
and I can't tell you

402
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,920
what happened.

403
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,320
Jia Jia, keep it.

404
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:16,920
I see.

405
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,320
Zhao Yu.

406
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
Come on.

407
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,120
Have some.

408
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:21,720
No.

409
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,520
Come on.

410
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,520
This kid.

411
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,920
Don't eat these.

412
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,520
I'm telling you.

413
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,320
I'm dying.

414
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,120
I'm dying.

415
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,320
I'm coming.

416
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,320
Let's go.

417
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,920
I'll take the soup.

418
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,320
You've made a good memory

419
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,320
to your grandma.

420
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Maybe I have

421
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
a memory of the soup.

422
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,520
You're not going to eat?

423
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,520
No.

424
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,120
Okay.

425
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Take care of her.

426
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,120
If you need anything,

427
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,120
just tell me.

428
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,920
I will.

429
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,920
I'll do my best.

430
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,520
You're sensible.

431
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,120
I'm sorry.

432
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,720
Mr. Cheng,

433
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
you've matured a lot.

434
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,920
Uncle.

435
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,920
Give your grandma the soup.

436
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,120
Uncle.

437
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:27,920
Dr. Meng.

438
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,120
You're back.

439
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,320
Sit down.

440
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,120
Here.

441
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:32,920
Okay.

442
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:37,720
I think

443
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,520
the way you wrote

444
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
your conclusion is really good.

445
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,920
The point is,

446
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,920
you've included many data

447
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
in the actual application.

448
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,520
You gave me a lot of inspiration.

449
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,920
You taught me well.

450
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,920
In fact, our research

451
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,320
is still going to be used

452
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
in business development.

453
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,520
Recently,

454
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,720
Han Xing's new products

455
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,320
have won the gold medal in the international competition.

456
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,720
Your support for Xing Chen

457
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,120
is very hard work.

458
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,520
Thank you.

459
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,720
I'll transfer your congratulations to them.

460
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,320
What's the problem

461
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,320
with Xing Chen and Han Hai?

462
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,320
You don't have a place to be now, do you?

463
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,120
I was blinded by it.

464
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,520
I only saw the master of

465
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,120
personal and corporate.

466
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,520
I didn't see the problem.

467
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,320
In fact, our country's

468
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,320
smart medical development

469
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
is very fast.

470
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,520
But compared to some developed countries,

471
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,320
there are some differences.

472
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,720
The whole resource is inevitable.

473
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,320
If it's the star of independence

474
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,920
or the Han Hai of independence,

475
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,120
there's no way to

476
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,720
be so fast on the international road.

477
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,320
It seems like you've learned

478
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,920
the Hongguan's thinking problem.

479
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
It's good.

480
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,920
You can see the problem of the nation and the nation,

481
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,520
and analyze the business of the international project.

482
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,920
Isn't this your purpose of studying abroad?

483
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,520
Meng,

484
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,120
who are you asking me to meet today?

485
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,920
Xing is here, too.

486
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
I'm going back tomorrow

487
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,520
to say goodbye to Professor.

488
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,120
You're leaving?

489
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,120
Yes.

490
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
Go back and do your job.

491
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,520
I'll take care of your progress.

492
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,520
I will.

493
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,920
I'll have to ask you for a leave later.

494
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,720
No problem.

495
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
You're almost there, right?

496
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
You can come over directly.

497
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
Qin Li is here, too.

498
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
Then Professor, you go ahead.

499
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,120
I'll go first.

500
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,720
Okay.

501
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,520
See you.

502
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,720
Goodbye.

503
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,720
Wait, Ji Xing.

504
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,720
Qin Li.

505
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
I can see him anytime.

506
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
I'll talk to him another day.

507
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,120
I'm leaving.

508
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,720
I'm leaving.

509
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,120
You must leave.

510
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,920
Professor.

511
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,520
You're here.

512
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,520
Sit down.

513
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,120
Where's Qin Li?

514
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,720
I have a student who wants to go back to China.

515
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,520
He wants to say goodbye.

516
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
You won't mind, right?

517
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,120
He's still the same as before.

518
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,320
Yes.

519
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,120
But he's indeed a talent.

520
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,120
He's also in charge of your current needs.

521
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,320
He knows the skills of the staff,

522
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,720
and is also well-known in the international academic world and Chinese.

523
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,120
He's also a self-proclaimed scholar.

524
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,720
It's the best to be a consultant for AI talent.

525
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,720
I know.

526
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,520
That's why I came here.

527
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,720
Han Ting.

528
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,920
It's not easy to be a talent.

529
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,720
I've never been so sure.

530
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,320
You're welcome.

531
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,320
Have a good job.

532
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,120
I won't bother you.

533
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,920
I hope you can help me with the appointment tomorrow.

534
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,920
He's thinking about the school's results.

535
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,520
As far as I know him,

536
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,320
as long as you're sincere,

537
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,320
he'll do his best to help you.

538
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
Then I'll trouble you.

539
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,120
No problem.

540
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,720
Ji Xiu.

541
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,720
Is it strawberry cake?

542
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,520
Yes.

543
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,720
I'm back.

544
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
Han Qing.

545
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,120
When did you come back?

546
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,520
I'm sorry.

547
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,520
I didn't know you were here.

548
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
I just ordered our food.

549
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,520
Come, sit down.

550
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Do you know each other?

551
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,320
We are...

552
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,120
Xia You.

553
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,320
What a coincidence.

554
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,720
Han Ting and I are also Xia You.

555
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,120
She's two years older than me.

556
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:32,920
Hello.

557
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,720
Professor Meng said

558
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
someone wanted to see me.

559
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
Could it be you?

560
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,120
What's the matter?

561
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
When you were in college,

562
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,320
the academic and mechanical engineering

563
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,520
you studied was very good.

564
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,920
Professor Meng said you wanted to go back to China

565
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
and continue to do science.

566
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,920
I recommend you.

567
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,520
I hope you can use your expertise

568
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,320
to work hard

569
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,720
for the country.

570
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,520
Then how are you going to

571
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,720
make up for the people?

572
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,120
How to provide better science environment?

573
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,720
Are you happy to

574
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
attract foreign talents to the country?

575
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,920
In addition to online talents,

576
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,920
this talent group

577
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,320
is also a talent training platform.

578
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,520
I hope I can build a

579
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,720
AI talent group that can grow by myself.

580
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,720
East medicine will connect other

581
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
giant companies in the country

582
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
and invest in giant funds.

583
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,720
With the help of scholarship,

584
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
academic exchange,

585
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,120
and many other ways,

586
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,320
work with all the high-profile

587
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,720
and technology-oriented companies

588
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
to develop cooperation.

589
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,520
Provide shared resources

590
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,920
to help the young people

591
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,120
who are interested in AI

592
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,320
grow quickly.

593
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,320
At the same time,

594
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,920
attract foreign scientists to return to the country

595
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,920
and make research for them to return to the country

596
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,120
to provide funding.

597
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,520
Will these talents

598
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,920
be interrupted by East medicine?

599
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,120
These talents are not East medicine.

600
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,920
They don't need to be used for East medicine.

601
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,120
But what can East medicine do?

602
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
You should know

603
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,520
how much funding it needs to be invested

604
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,920
to build a talent group.

605
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,120
If they meet the group,

606
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,720
will East medicine be wasted?

607
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,320
Han Ting,

608
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,320
I checked the information of East medicine.

609
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,920
I personally think

610
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,920
that the current strength of East medicine

611
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
is not the previous one.

612
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,520
I heard Professor Meng mention it before.

613
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,120
Many countries have started to

614
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,120
open AI talent cultivation and cultivation.

615
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
Some countries

616
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,120
even blocked the talent for my country.

617
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,320
If we wait until the battlefield,

618
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,920
we will be in a hurry.

619
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,920
So no matter how hard it is to invest in a previous one,

620
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,120
no matter what difficulties we face in the future,

621
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,720
East medicine will not be wasted.

622
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,520
I'll think about it again.

623
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,720
The robot in the lab suddenly started to talk nonsense.

624
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,320
He said that he had a colleague in the department.

625
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,720
I might have to go back.

626
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,720
I'm leaving, too.

627
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,720
Ji Qing.

628
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
I need to talk to you.

629
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,720
Han Ting.

630
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,920
Did you find out that Ji Qing

631
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,320
wanted to pull him down?

632
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
But if I can

633
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
go back and be Ji Qing's colleague,

634
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,320
I'm still quite pleased.

635
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,520
Stop it.

636
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,720
Okay.

637
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,320
I'll go now.

638
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,720
I'll see you after I go back.

639
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,320
Liao Liao.

640
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,720
Okay.

641
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,120
Thank you for your attitude.

642
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,120
When are you going back?

643
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:57,720
Tomorrow.

644
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,440
Are you still angry with me?

645
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
I've already understood

646
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,120
what you're doing.

647
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,160
I'm also grateful

648
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,520
for bringing Xing Chen to this high school.

649
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,520
But Han Ting,

650
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,400
if you love me,

651
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,880
you won't lie to me

652
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,240
and treat me as your wife.

653
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,720
I'm in this position

654
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,160
with my own bitterness.

655
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,800
My life is full of love.

656
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,400
I can't sacrifice

657
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,720
my whole Dongyang University

658
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,520
because of my personal feelings.

659
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,600
I can't guarantee that

660
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,000
you're the only one in my life.

661
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,960
But I can guarantee that

662
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,920
you're the only one

663
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,720
in my life.

664
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,240
Do you think

665
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,040
really love each other?

666
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,320
My love

667
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,400
lasts from day to day.

668
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,840
When it's a rush in the wild,

669
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,720
Xing Chen blows slowly

670
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,660
and effortlessly.

671
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,640
He doesn'tANT to me

672
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,840
but realized that

673
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,140
It's said that,

674
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,300
the mirror for the prospect of life

675
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,460
should be Parked.

676
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,560
Thank you.

677
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,800
Excuse me.

678
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,440
May I change the seat?

679
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
You like to sit next to your girlfriend?

680
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,840
No.

681
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,440
I'm not his girlfriend.

682
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
Not yet.

683
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
So...

684
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
Yes.

685
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
So...

686
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Yes.

687
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
What are you doing?

688
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,840
I don't like this.

689
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
It's okay.

690
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
You're Han Qing's shareholder.

691
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
Dong Yi is going to join Han Qing

692
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,840
to start the construction of the talent pool.

693
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
There will be a lot of places to learn from you.

694
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,840
If you just mind,

695
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,840
I'm your ex-boyfriend.

696
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
I'm sorry

697
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,840
to give up this opportunity.

698
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,840
I hope you can think about it seriously.

699
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,840
Join Han Qing.

700
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,840
Okay.

701
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,840
I'll think about it seriously.

702
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840
Do you want to mix with your ex-boyfriend?

703
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,840
No.

704
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
Don't think about it.

705
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,840
What is your feeling?

706
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,840
No need to think.

707
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,840
The moment is certain.

708
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,760
Maybe you want to be her boyfriend?

709
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
No.

710
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,840
I really don't think she will be

711
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,840
marrying her.

712
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,840
Why?

713
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,840
Why should I ask her?

714
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,840
What is wrong?

715
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
She told me to stop thinking about herãã planet.

716
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
What is wrong?

717
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
Let's just talk the whole world down.

718
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,840
It's okay.

719
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,840
Song Xiaowa,

720
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,160
What if he finds out?

721
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,960
Didn't we say we'd surprise him?

722
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,400
Yes, yes, yes.

723
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,240
He's out.

724
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,600
Turn him around.

725
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,400
What's wrong?

726
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,640
Why is he with Han Ting?

727
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,360
Mr. Han.

728
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,000
Well, well, well.

729
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,200
Then, what should we do?

730
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,120
Don't talk.

731
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,400
Don't let them find out.

732
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,400
Don't let the others see you.

733
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:09,960
What is it?

734
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Do you wanna fight?

735
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,360
Come, come, come.

736
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,480
Don't touch the dark secreté»¨.

737
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,600
Use its strength to protect us.

738
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Let's go, let's go.

739
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,240
From this point,

740
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,200
they might have nothing better to do.

741
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,960
Find us tomorrow morning.

742
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,120
I'll send you there.

743
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,560
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

744
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,520
Yes, sir.

745
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,000
Yeah, yes, yes.

746
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,080
I'm really sorry.

747
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,900
Luo Yu.

748
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,180
I've done all the work before hasn't changed.

749
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,580
Tang Song, how is the prince lately?

750
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,580
Don't worry, boss.

751
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,860
I'll visit him every day.

752
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,220
Do you want to see the prince?

753
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,020
Here.

754
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,500
I'm so fat.

755
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,300
Don't feed him so much snacks.

756
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,900
Be careful.

757
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,180
I got it.

758
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,060
By the way, Mr. Ji,

759
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,580
the prince misses you a lot.

760
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,060
He should know you're coming back.

761
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,260
He was waiting for you at the door yesterday.

762
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,140
Really?

763
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,340
Mr. Ji,

764
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,740
if you miss him,

765
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,900
you can come to me anytime.

766
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,900
I'll be waiting for you.

767
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,900
I'll be waiting for you.

768
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,900
I'll be waiting for you.

769
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,140
Boss said

770
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,900
we can pick you up and go see him.

771
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,620
Yes.

772
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,100
If it's not convenient,

773
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,140
I can also send you a picture of the prince.

774
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,300
Okay.

775
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:17,900
Okay.

776
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,020
Thank you.

777
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,140
Have a good rest.

778
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,460
I'll wait for you in Han Xin.

779
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,340
You seem to be submit.

780
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,900
You are almost here.

781
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,660
I've been waiting for you there for a long time.

782
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:22,900
Wait.

783
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,820
Boss,

784
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,740
Inform the staff to send the application to the press.

785
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,500
Yes.

786
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,220
Finally, I can eat hot pot.

787
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,900
I've been missing you for a long time.

788
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,900
Eat more and you'll feel better.

789
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:02,860
Xin Xin.

790
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,060
You're back with Han Ting?

791
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,260
Why are you asking?

792
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,340
I went to the airport with Su Zhi Zhou today.

793
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,260
I'm here to pick you up.

794
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,420
I didn't see you.

795
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,980
You're with Han Ting.

796
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,180
Why are we going up?

797
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,220
I'm sorry.

798
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,740
Really?

799
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,740
Really?

800
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,060
I saw you with my own eyes.

801
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,780
I came back with her

802
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,340
in Germany.

803
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,180
Okay.

804
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,180
You've forgiven her?

805
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,340
I learned a lot this time.

806
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,900
I found that Han Ting's decision

807
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,820
was more relevant to her.

808
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,700
Han Xin is doing well now.

809
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,660
I have no reason to blame her.

810
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,260
Have a seat.

811
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,060
Here.

812
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,820
What's wrong, Xin Xin?

813
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,340
Han Xin sent me the application.

814
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,980
Xin Xin.

815
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,340
I know you've been caring about Xing Chen.

816
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,020
Come back.

817
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,740
We need you.

818
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,900
Here, take this.

819
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,540
All right.

820
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,180
Come on.

821
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:32,940
Help yourself.

822
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,700
It's been a long time since you've learned.

823
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,740
Maybe we should start a new relationship.

824
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:39,580
Eat.

825
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,700
ÑÑ ÑÑÐ°Ð·Ñ Ð²ÑÑpel measures crouching

826
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,660
before you swing them.

827
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,860
My baby.

828
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,300
Boss,

829
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:09,860
President Ji

830
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,580
has entered Zhihanpresan.

831
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:12,980
Iå£° coaster.

832
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,740
Mr. Ji, this is your office.

833
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,900
Mr. Ji, let Su Zhizhou and Lily come to my office.

834
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,700
Okay.

835
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,300
I didn't expect so many things to happen in this period of time.

836
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,140
The situation is much better now.

837
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,060
After Zhizhou's second step with technology

838
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,420
upgraded the medical three-digit response,

839
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,500
they have returned the technical control.

840
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,020
Good job, Mr. Su.

841
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,700
You proved your strength.

842
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,260
Xin, you're back now.

843
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,700
Our iron triangle is finally complete.

844
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,860
Qin Li,

845
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,180
when did you come back?

846
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,820
I don't know.

847
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,460
You don't know?

848
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,980
I know you'll accept Han Ting's invitation.

849
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,260
Do you have time for work?

850
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,460
I invite you to watch a movie.

851
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:20,940
Sit.

852
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,100
Okay.

853
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,580
Let me introduce you.

854
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,540
This is Qin Li, the consultant I invited from Germany.

855
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,820
Mr. Han Xin is Luo Ping.

856
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:33,820
Hello.

857
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,700
Hello, Mr. Qin.

858
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,660
Mr. Luo has the project that is no longer recommended.

859
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,740
I want to give you two the project of the government's stock.

860
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,780
We'll be in charge of it together.

861
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,020
Okay.

862
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,500
We'll do well

863
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,940
to be able to fight against Ji Xing.

864
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,140
Okay.

865
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,980
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Ji and Qin Gu.

866
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,100
I hope you can support me to open the shop anytime.

867
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:55,940
Next,

868
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,660
let's talk about the proposal for the stock.

869
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,180
This is the proposal made by Mr. Han.

870
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,140
Take a look.
