1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to forget the past.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sure I won't be able to meet you.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll have the future.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to forget the past.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't give up.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll be lost in the dark.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Star of the Moon

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Are you going out?

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're going out to run around the sea in the New Year.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you think Grandpa can agree?

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You should leave first.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll go up and talk to Grandpa.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I can still help you to make him happy.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Thank you.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Han Ting.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Happy New Year.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Happy New Year.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Happy New Year.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're almost there.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You're sitting in the dining table.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why are you still playing with your phone?

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're not working all day.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why are you still looking at girls?

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't worry.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If there's no girl, I'll be with you.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm happy to have a family with a smile.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Brother, don't say that.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm really in trouble.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's go.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm going to go to the kitchen.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm going to go to the kitchen.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hello.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's so late.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Where's Xiaoting?

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Didn't you go to ask her to eat?

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
She has something urgent to do.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What's wrong with this kid?

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's New Year.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
She's not leaving after eating.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It seems to be about Xing Chen.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Xing Chen?

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I've invested 20 million in a company.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's okay if the money is transferred.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Now even people are transferred.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Xiao Yan.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You should help Xiaoting more in the future.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
She just returned.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Don't let her lie to you.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I know.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Mom.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Take care of yourself.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Xiaoting.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
She has her own business.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
She has a share.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's eat.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Eat.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Ji Song.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Ji Song.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I've packed the food you want.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Take it.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Thank you.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Have a seat.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Why didn't you answer the phone?

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The phone is out of battery.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You're looking for me?

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm going back now.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Don't worry about it.

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You're a big-time fan.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Why are you so scared?

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If it weren't for Xiaohan,

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
we wouldn't have been able to find you.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I know.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll go back and talk to you.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't know why my dad came here.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Sorry for bothering you.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's okay.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You can just leave me alone.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Dad.

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Mom.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Mom.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Mom.

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Mom.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Wake up.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's not your mom.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
She didn't want to surprise you.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Wake up.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Xiaohan.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Uncle and aunt.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Thank you.

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You're welcome.

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Mr. Han, give it to me.

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm sorry for bothering you.

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Go home.

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Xinxing.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Xiaohan has been looking for you for a long time.

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's too late.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We can't go home hungry.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Exactly.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You know it's a long time.

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Mr. Han is going home to eat your dinner.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Xinxing.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Xiaohan, didn't you arrange dinner?

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I didn't arrange anything.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's great.

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We can eat together.

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's so hot.

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Exactly.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Just so happen that you can drink with me.

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Thank you.

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Go to the door.

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Let's go.

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's go.

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let me help you.

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Thank you.

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You're welcome.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll do it.

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Don't move.

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Come.

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Come on.

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'll do it.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm too young to have a job.

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Just treat yourself.

138
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Xinxing.

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Take care of Xiaohan.

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You guys can sit here.

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,500
Okay.

142
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
I'll have a meal with him.

143
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Okay, I'll call you.

144
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
So pitiful.

145
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
What's the name of the song?

146
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
It's called The Yellow.

147
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
It's a good name for raising.

148
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
This is the Yellow.

149
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

150
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

151
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

152
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

153
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

154
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

155
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

156
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

157
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

158
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

159
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

160
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

161
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

162
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

163
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

164
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

165
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

166
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

167
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

168
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
He's so fat, you can recognize him.

169
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
I'm so fat, you can recognize him.

170
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Zhizhou, the show is about to start.

171
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
What are you doing in the house?

172
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Mom, I'm coming.

173
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,500
I'm coming.

174
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
What's my job?

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,980
Sister Li,

176
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,860
Happy New Year.

177
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
I celebrate him a hundred years.

178
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,500
Something is strange.

179
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,080
What I said

180
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,580
has something impossible,

181
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,440
even from scratch.

182
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,300
Guan Huai constantly talentless self-insiruption

183
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,980
Too dumb

184
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,580
Sister Li

185
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,440
Which one of you

186
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,340
Here

187
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,340
Your takeaway.

188
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,740
Thank you.

189
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,480
Hello.

190
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,180
Hello, Sister Li.

191
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,500
Happy New Year.

192
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,460
Are you hurt by the taste of the egg?

193
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,540
I got it.

194
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,840
Why are you brainwashed on me?

195
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,400
I saw some pictures of you

196
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,340
at your girlfriend's store

197
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,580
and the logo on a cup cup.

198
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,200
I checked it.

199
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,360
When are you going to eat salmon rice ?

200
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,760
We must eat dumplings

201
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:23,620
during the New Year.

202
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,680
Meaning our two of us

203
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,640
agreed it won't help even a matter of years.

204
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,240
Take two.

205
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,840
Thanks.

206
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,380
I mean,

207
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,460
I'll pay you back.

208
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,260
Yes.

209
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,460
Thank you.

210
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,620
You're welcome.

211
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,060
Sister Li,

212
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,980
why didn't you go home

213
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,060
for dinner last year?

214
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,300
You're the one who's got the dinner here.

215
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,140
I'll leave it to you.

216
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,940
Happy New Year, Zuzhizhao.

217
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,300
Happy New Year, Sister Li.

218
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:55,860
Bye.

219
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
Happy New Year, Zuzhizhao.

220
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,740
Happy New Year, Zuzhizhao.

221
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,740
Happy New Year, Zuzhizhao.

222
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,740
Happy New Year, Zuzhizhao.

223
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,220
Are you awake?

224
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:43,780
Yes.

225
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,260
How do you think of Han?

226
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,580
He's a good guy.

227
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,380
He's a good guy.

228
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,100
Yes, he's a good guy.

229
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,100
I like Han more.

230
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,620
I think he's more happy

231
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,500
with us.

232
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,100
Welcome.

233
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,100
You're really a good guy.

234
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,220
Although Han looks like

235
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,660
no boss,

236
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,500
he's also a big boss.

237
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,100
Is it appropriate to be with him?

238
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,900
Our Xinxin is not bad either.

239
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,700
At least he's a female boss now.

240
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,260
Being alone in the new room,

241
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,620
being able to be with Han

242
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,460
is because of someone.

243
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,460
I don't know.

244
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,300
You're really

245
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,300
thinking about it.

246
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,300
It's true.

247
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,900
We really have to see the fate.

248
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,500
Besides,

249
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,300
we don't care about it.

250
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,100
What matters

251
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,900
is how the kids think.

252
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
He's the same.

253
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,500
You've never met him

254
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,700
for so many years.

255
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,300
You're so obedient.

256
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
That's because of my personality.

257
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,300
That's a good thing to remember.

258
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,300
Why didn't you see him last time?

259
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,700
Last time?

260
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,500
Come on.

261
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,700
Let's keep drinking.

262
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,100
Let's sing a song for everyone.

263
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,900
Come on.

264
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,300
Grandma, let me help you.

265
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:16,900
Come on, come on.

266
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,900
Come on, come on.

267
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,300
Come on.

268
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,300
Come on.

269
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,500
Let's play.

270
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,900
I don't know.

271
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,300
Maybe he doesn't want to see you.

272
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,900
I'm here to see you.

273
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,100
I'm here to see you.

274
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,900
I'm here to see you.

275
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,900
I'm here to see you.

276
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,900
I'm here to see you.

277
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,100
Didn't you say you'd been home for a year?

278
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,500
Now that the ability of the householder

279
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,700
is getting higher and higher.

280
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,900
If it weren't for Uncle and Auntie,

281
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,500
what are you going to do today?

282
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,700
I'm working overtime

283
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,500
and eating New Year's Eve dinner.

284
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,100
How do you know I'm waiting for breakfast on the New Year's Day?

285
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,700
Thank you for today.

286
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,700
Da Huang is getting fatter now.

287
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,900
He's so heavy.

288
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,300
You left when you said you'd leave.

289
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,300
If it weren't for me,

290
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,300
he would have gone to the New Year's Eve now.

291
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,700
Ten years.

292
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,900
I didn't expect to see you again.

293
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,900
Everything is fine.

294
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,700
It is.

295
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,900
Look at him.

296
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,300
He's so fat.

297
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,500
He knows how to eat every day.

298
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,900
He's so lucky.

299
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,100
Xin Xin, it's time to eat.

300
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,100
Coming.

301
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Have a seat.

302
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,700
It's the 12 dishes.

303
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,100
They're both so good.

304
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,300
I didn't order so much.

305
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,100
Most of them were sent by President Xiao.

306
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,700
It looks like Mr. Han's face.

307
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
Come on, don't be so cold.

308
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,900
Let's eat.

309
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,500
Han, don't be shy.

310
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,100
Just eat at home.

311
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,300
Thank you.

312
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,100
That's right.

313
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,900
There are no rules in our family.

314
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,700
Be more casual.

315
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,100
Try this.

316
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,700
It's the best beef bowl in the world.

317
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
My dad made it.

318
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,900
You're a little boy.

319
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,500
Come on, Xiao An.

320
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,900
Come on.

321
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,100
Have a drink.

322
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,900
Uncle, I'm sorry.

323
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,100
I'm allergic to alcohol.

324
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,900
You don't drink alcohol?

325
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
If you don't drink alcohol, that's great.

326
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,300
Then drink it yourself.

327
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,500
Yes, I'll drink it myself.

328
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
I'll drink it for you.

329
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,700
Okay, drink it.

330
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,500
Come on.

331
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,500
This dish is delicious.

332
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
It tastes good.

333
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,700
But I don't think it's good last time.

334
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,300
Maybe it's the holiday.

335
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,700
They'll have a rest in turn.

336
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,900
If you want to eat,

337
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,900
tell me.

338
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,700
I'll contact the chef and make it myself.

339
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,500
Okay, okay.

340
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,300
Thank you, Mr. Han.

341
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,300
The family's holiday is so good.

342
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,500
Last year, we were with that...

343
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,300
So many dishes.

344
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,300
Eat it.

345
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,100
Here.

346
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,100
Let's start a new year.

347
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,300
Let's drink it together.

348
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Yes, yes, yes.

349
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,300
Here.

350
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,100
Happy New Year.

351
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,700
Happy New Year.

352
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,300
Happy New Year.

353
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,300
Thank you for your work.

354
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,900
You made me look for it every morning and evening.

355
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,700
It's been a long time.

356
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,500
I'm so worried.

357
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,300
I'm doing well now.

358
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,700
Very good.

359
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,300
That's right.

360
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,900
I believe my daughter

361
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,300
will meet the right person.

362
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,500
That's right.

363
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,100
The right person is still behind.

364
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,300
Let's have another one.

365
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,700
Here.

366
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,900
Welcome Mr. Han to our house.

367
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,700
Thank you.

368
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,100
Try this.

369
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,500
My dad made it himself.

370
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,300
And this.

371
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,900
The old Chen Ji's vegetables over there are so delicious.

372
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,300
My dad brings them to me every time.

373
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,300
Try it.

374
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,300
It's delicious.

375
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,300
Here.

376
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,700
Xin Xin.

377
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,100
I heard that our new job

378
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,700
has a firework show on the weekend night.

379
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,500
After eating, you take Xiao Han to see it.

380
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Don't stay at home.

381
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,700
I'll clean up your dad and watch TV.

382
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,900
We'll watch the show at home.

383
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:34,900
Yes.

384
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,900
I'll have a second-person meeting with your mom.

385
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,900
You go play.

386
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,300
Mr. Han, don't you go home to celebrate?

387
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,700
I celebrate with you.

388
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,700
Same.

389
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,100
Okay.

390
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,500
Okay.

391
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,100
Come on.

392
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,100
This is Xin Xin's favorite,

393
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,700
the best.

394
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,300
Try it.

395
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,900
Thank you.

396
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,900
You have one too.

397
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,500
Let's have another one.

398
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,700
Welcome Mr. Han to celebrate with us.

399
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,300
Thank you.

400
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,700
Welcome.

401
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,700
Come on.

402
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,300
Hello, the mother-in-law of the live broadcast room.

403
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,300
Hello.

404
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,900
Welcome to my live broadcast room.

405
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,300
I'm your smart girl.

406
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,500
I'm your host, Zhu Dajia.

407
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
Congratulations on your big success.

408
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,900
Today, we're singing a special show.

409
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,300
We're going to introduce

410
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,900
the new year's dinner.

411
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,700
Dumplings.

412
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,900
These are all from Guo Guo.

413
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,900
This is carrot skin.

414
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,700
This is spinach skin.

415
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,300
This is the original flavor.

416
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,700
Guo Guo's buns are so great.

417
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,500
Yes, the buns are so beautiful.

418
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,500
Thank you for your praise.

419
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,700
If you're interested,

420
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,100
go to Guo Guo's special channel

421
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,100
to watch some videos to teach you how to make dumplings.

422
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,900
Ms. Han, why are you so scared?

423
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,500
Everyone is in the restaurant.

424
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,900
You're hiding here and playing with your phone.

425
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,900
Do you think it's appropriate?

426
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,100
It's so beautiful.

427
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,100
And...

428
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,700
Mr. Xiaomeng.

429
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,700
So you're watching Mr. Xiaomeng's live broadcast.

430
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,900
I'm not going to watch it myself.

431
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,300
It's from Ruan Jin.

432
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,700
Okay, I know.

433
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,300
I don't know Mr. Xiaomeng.

434
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,900
Do you think he's still in the live broadcast room?

435
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,500
Zhezhe Yan.

436
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,300
Zhezhe Yan.

437
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,500
Listen to me.

438
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,100
I've never seen him live broadcast.

439
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,100
You go get me some hot water.

440
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,700
Go.

441
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,100
You're still going to watch it?

442
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,100
Just watch it for a while.

443
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,700
Go.

444
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,500
I haven't had a good son for a long time.

445
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,300
Go.

446
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,100
Don't take me.

447
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,500
Don't move.

448
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
I know.

449
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,900
So cute.

450
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,100
You can't see me.

451
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,900
If you're in love,

452
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,300
you must have this sugar.

453
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,100
Love is sweet and beautiful.

454
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,300
If you want to do business,

455
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,700
you must have this rice cake.

456
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,700
Do you know what it means?

457
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,900
It's a great opportunity.

458
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,100
There's also a cleaning bag.

459
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,700
It's detailed.

460
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,100
It's very professional.

461
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
This is the bag.

462
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,100
You must use the hard-to-use water

463
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,900
to disinfect the medicine.

464
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,100
Then you can put it in.

465
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,300
Can I get a paper?

466
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,300
Paper is not enough.

467
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,100
Baby, it's hard-to-use water.

468
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,900
Here,

469
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,700
you can have a good photo.

470
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
You can have a good photo.

471
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,500
I wish you all the best.

472
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
In a new year,

473
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,300
you can earn more money

474
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,500
by managing the garden and the garden.

475
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,100
It's like my secret.

476
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,100
Are you all busy?

477
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,700
It's late.

478
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
I'm not free to visit聰明.

479
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,700
There are few people in the live broadcast room.

480
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
It's not a bad thing.

481
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,900
It's a big New Year.

482
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,900
I'll give you a gift.

483
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,500
I'll give you a good rainbow.

484
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,700
Tell me about the gift.

485
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,900
It's okay.

486
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,500
I'm here.

487
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,300
I'm here.

488
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,100
Go ahead.

489
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,500
I'm here.

490
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Wow!

491
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,500
It's so fair.

492
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Thank you.

493
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,700
Thank you for the gift

494
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,500
Mr. Lu gave me.

495
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,500
I wish you all the best in a new year.

496
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,500
It's so nice.

497
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
So cute.

498
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Thank you.

499
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Thank you for

500
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
thanking Mr. Lu again.

501
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Thank you for the gift.

502
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Thank you.

503
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,500
In a new year,

504
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
you can earn more money

505
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,500
by managing the garden and the garden.

506
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,500
I'm so happy.

507
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Okay.

508
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
It's late now.

509
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
We have to go to the drama with the family.

510
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,500
I'm going to play the game.

511
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
Bye.

512
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,500
See you.

513
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Okay.

514
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Thank you.

515
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,500
Happy new year.

516
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Happy new year, boss.

517
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Thank you.

518
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
I remember when I was in college,

519
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,500
I liked to buy the red-tripped food

520
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
at the entrance of the school.

521
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
Have you thought about where to move the new city?

522
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Not yet.

523
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
I've found some places

524
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,500
that are full of rent.

525
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Come again.

526
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Dongyang?

527
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
You're kidding me.

528
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
The village is full of money.

529
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
I can't afford it.

530
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
There's a company

531
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
that invests in Dongyang

532
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
to invest in the city.

533
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
They're going to expand the economy.

534
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
You can use their previous office

535
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
to pay for rent.

536
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
You can take the loan.

537
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Really?

538
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
Thank you, boss.

539
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,500
The work attitude of you

540
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
is good recently.

541
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
The original one is 8 million yuan.

542
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
You can pay me

543
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
the new one first.

544
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
I'll give you 4 million yuan.

545
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,500
Shen Deyin will pay you

546
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
to pay me

547
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
to pay you to pay me.

548
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
You're my angel investment.

549
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,500
I have a request.

550
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Don't worry.

551
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,500
I'll make the product experiment

552
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
in a certain time.

553
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,500
I believe you.

554
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
I won't let you down.

555
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,500
I'm not afraid.

556
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
I'm not afraid.

557
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
I hope you can

558
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
be more and more successful.

559
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
It's more important to be a fire-cracker.

560
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,700
Firecrackers are the most like

561
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,500
the firecrackers.

562
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,500
You can do everything

563
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
you want

564
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Ji Qing.

565
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
I wish you a happy life.

566
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Thank you, Mr. Han.

567
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Don't call me Han Tian in the future.

568
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
Call me Han Ting.

569
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Happy New Year, Han Ting.

570
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
So nice.

571
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
I just gave Mr. Xiaomeng

572
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
some gifts.

573
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
What's your expression?

574
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
Son,

575
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
look at Xiaomeng

576
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
receiving so many gifts.

577
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
How happy he is!

578
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Ms. Han.

579
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,500
Who?

580
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Who called me?

581
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Why didn't you call me?

582
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Who?

583
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,500
This house.

584
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
I can't do it.

585
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
I'm coming.

586
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
Who is it?

587
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
What's going on?

588
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Don't you think

589
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
I'm interesting to him?

590
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Don't misunderstand.

591
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
Will it get darker and darker?

592
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
It's a long story.

593
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
What do you want?

594
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,500
What do you want?

595
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,500
What's wrong with the car?

596
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,500
No.

597
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
I have to put my hand down first.

598
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,500
Don't be anxious.

599
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
I understand.

600
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
I know you're upset.

601
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,500
You'll regret it.

602
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
I'll give you the gift.

603
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
You're just

604
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
looking down on me.

605
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
You're so funny.

606
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
You don't have to return.

607
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
I'm happy.

608
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Mr. Xing Xing,

609
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,500
the King is back.

610
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Yes.

611
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
The King is still young.

612
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
He can't be sure.

613
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Mr. Han.

614
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Mr. Han.

615
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Why don't you go upstairs?

616
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
I'm waiting for my colleague.

617
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
You go upstairs first.

618
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
You have to open the door.

619
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,500
I'll wait for them here.

620
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
It's okay.

621
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
I'll go.

622
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,500
Okay.

623
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
You're in a good mood.

624
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,500
After all,

625
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,500
I came back

626
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,500
after all.

627
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
It's different from the previous months.

628
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,500
You're out of breath.

629
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,500
A little.

630
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,500
Since I moved to Dongyang,

631
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
I've gained a lot of experience.

632
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,500
It should be

633
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
the newbie or the newbie.

634
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
But there's also a newbie.

635
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
It's full of dreams and energy.

636
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
And there's no bad news.

637
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,500
So the newbie

638
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
is the newbie.

639
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500
He's a trainee.

640
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
What's this?

641
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
That's...

642
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Fu Yangfei from 10 years ago.

643
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,500
After her life,

644
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
we'll have the half-gone course.

645
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,500
No, no.

646
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
I can raise a person like you.

647
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,500
You can raise a person like me.

648
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
I'll send him a life照.

649
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
I'll know his life condition.

650
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,500
Okay.

651
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Wait a minute!

652
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,080
Okay.

653
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,220
Wan'er.

654
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,180
This way.

655
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,420
This way.

656
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,380
That way.

657
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,760
이죠.

658
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:52,780
This way.

659
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,400
A little more.

660
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,740
Wait.

661
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,480
Wait a minute.

662
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,140
Everyone admires you.

663
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,220
The legend is too exaggerated.

664
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,660
It's just your luck.

665
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,540
We're so close now.

666
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,780
We'll have a month-long break.

667
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,380
Okay.

668
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:07,940
I'm here.

669
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:08,780
Bye.

670
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,420
Bye.

671
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,380
See you, Han Song.

672
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,220
Okay.

673
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,100
Han Song, bye.

674
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,380
Have a good day.

675
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,100
Sister,

676
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,180
why are you calling so early?

677
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,980
We're moving to a new house today.

678
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,820
Let me show you.

679
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,500
Is it big?

680
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,260
Right?

681
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,980
That's my office.

682
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,540
You have a great office.

683
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,700
It's so great.

684
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,660
Sister, come here.

685
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,940
It's your breakfast.

686
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,420
Come here.

687
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,140
What?

688
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,500
Your daughter's office.

689
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,300
It's so small.

690
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,820
Let's go there later.

691
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,620
Okay.

692
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,100
But Xinxin,

693
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,340
remember,

694
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,260
you must be careful.

695
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,660
Don't put the little thread on the ceiling.

696
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,820
We can't afford to pay Han Song.

697
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,580
Right?

698
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,260
Okay, I got it.

699
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,340
Who are you looking at?

700
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,980
Hello, aunt.

701
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,220
Hello, Lili.

702
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,980
You look good, too.

703
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,020
Thank you, aunt.

704
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,500
You two need to take care of each other.

705
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,900
We're at ease

706
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,180
if you can help Xinxin.

707
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,820
Xinxin is the CEO now.

708
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,060
She's the one who helps me.

709
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,540
We're helping each other.

710
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,700
Okay, I'll get back to work.

711
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,620
Bye, uncle.

712
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,420
Okay.

713
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,060
Bye.

714
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,940
Bye.

715
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,340
Here's a new office for you.

716
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,700
Blue Wind Spirit, Xinxin.

717
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,900
Lili,

718
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,700
how do you know what I want?

719
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,780
Don't be so excited.

720
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,580
I bought a ticket for Su Zhizhou.

721
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,940
He's the one who sent it.

722
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,340
Why did you buy a ticket for him?

723
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,580
He didn't give you a gift

724
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,780
when he was in the New Year.

725
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,140
He gave you a bag

726
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,380
and gave me such a expensive bottle.

727
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,300
I don't want to owe him any money.

728
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,740
I'll give him a memory card

729
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,220
and a suggestion card.

730
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,540
It's useless to use it.

731
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,380
He should understand what I mean.

732
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,260
He won't waste time on me.

733
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,300
It's just pity on us.

734
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,980
Why don't you pity me?

735
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,260
Do you need pity?

736
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,340
I do.

737
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,540
You're so much more pitiful

738
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,300
than others.

739
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,420
That's right.

740
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,340
Get out of the street.

741
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,940
I'll go back to my new office.

742
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,780
Okay.

743
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,140
I feel like I'm dreaming.

744
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,140
I have my own office.

745
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,340
It's so big.

746
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,340
This is the dream.

747
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,740
Sister Li.

748
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,580
Mr. Li.

749
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,060
You guys talk.

750
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,140
I'll go back to work.

751
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:03,900
Give it to you.

752
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,100
My skincare products were too expensive.

753
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,940
Don't give me such expensive stuff.

754
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,740
This is your gift.

755
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,940
Thank you, Sister Li.

756
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,140
You're so thoughtful.

757
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,940
It's a suggestion card.

758
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,540
You...

759
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,940
Why did you tell me?

760
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,540
I should have guessed.

761
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,540
The most important thing in the gift is Li Shang.

762
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,940
It's not a surprise.

763
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,940
I'll go back to work.

764
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,940
Okay.

765
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,940
Thank you, Sister Li.

766
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,940
I'll go back to work.

767
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,540
Okay.

768
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,540
Thank you, Sister Li.

769
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,340
I'll go back to work.

770
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,940
The first gift card.

771
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,940
Sister Li, this is for my health.

772
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,340
Look who's here.

773
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,740
Xia.

774
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,740
Hello, everyone.

775
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,940
I'm back.

776
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,740
Sorry.

777
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,540
I was in trouble

778
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,740
when I left the most difficult time in Xing Chen.

779
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,740
Xing Chen is in a bad mood now.

780
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,740
Xing Jie is willing to take me back.

781
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,540
I invited Xia to come back.

782
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,540
She's in a good position in the big city.

783
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,340
But she's still willing to go back to Xing Chen

784
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,140
and start a new business with us.

785
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:14,740
Okay.

786
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,740
Welcome Xia to come back.

787
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,540
You're our technical consultant.

788
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,540
You'll be the top again.

789
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,540
Xia, hello.

790
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,540
I'm Li Li.

791
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,340
Welcome back.

792
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,540
Hello, Sister Li.

793
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,540
Xia.

794
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,940
You're still by my side.

795
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,340
We'll fight together.

796
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,340
Here, let me help you.

797
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,140
Thank you.

798
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,340
Here.

799
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,740
Okay.

800
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,340
We're in a good working environment now.

801
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,940
What else do we need?

802
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,740
To buy the soldiers.

803
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,340
Right.

804
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,340
Those who rejected our candidates

805
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,540
if they knew we changed

806
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,740
such a high-ranking shop,

807
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,540
they would have regretted it.

808
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,940
Actually, some candidates were pretty good back then.

809
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,740
They were professional.

810
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,540
How about we contact them?

811
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,740
What do you want to contact?

812
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,540
The job is to adapt to the environment.

813
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,940
Not to adapt to the environment.

814
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,940
They used to be a big fan of Xing Chen.

815
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,940
Now Xing Chen is a big fan of them.

816
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,540
That makes sense.

817
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,540
But I still have to ask you.

818
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,940
Don't use the talent of others

819
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,340
because of this little thing.

820
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,740
Use what you have.

821
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,540
Okay.

822
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,340
Remember.

823
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,740
Now you're getting more and more like a boss.

824
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,740
Let's look at the functions of each of us.

825
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,740
I'm mainly in charge of

826
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,940
the overall operation management of our company.

827
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,140
We're in charge of the technology.

828
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:29,940
We're small in size.

829
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,940
We're in charge of the technical support

830
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,940
to the intelligence report.

831
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,140
We're in charge of the acquisition of the power.

832
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,140
When we get the product,

833
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,140
we'll transfer it to the sales department.

834
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,340
Xing,

835
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,740
I'll take the company to the laboratory first.

836
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,340
Okay.

837
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,940
I'll go to the company first.

838
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:44,540
Okay.

839
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,540
Let's split up.

840
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,140
Okay.

841
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:46,540
Let's go.

842
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,540
Did you hear that?

843
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,540
The company is in the field of technology.

844
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,340
They've helped Dongyang to get a big job.

845
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,340
They're on our floor.

846
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,540
Ji Xin is now a big boss.

847
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,540
I'm still giving people a big job.

848
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,540
Xing Chen got the investment of Mr. Han.

849
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,140
Ji Xin is Li Yu.

850
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,340
He's been born.

851
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,340
He's been doing business with our Mr. Zeng.

852
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,340
This is called the 30-year contract.

853
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,940
The 30-year contract.

854
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,940
The contract is also changing at any time.

855
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,140
Who can be sure?

856
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,940
It may not be the same as the first time.

857
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,540
Who?

858
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,340
Who?

859
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,340
Mr. Zeng.

860
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,340
Ji Xin.

861
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,340
I should call you Mr. Ji now.

862
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,740
Congratulations, Xiaoxian.

863
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,740
Thank you.

864
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,340
You're welcome.

865
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,340
Xing Cui Pingye.

866
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,340
The original material.

867
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,540
Do you know who he is?

868
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,140
I don't know.

869
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,740
The new boss.

870
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,340
The famous Zeng Di.

871
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,140
He's the boss of the company.

872
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,540
He's the boss of the company.

873
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,140
Come to see us now.

874
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,740
Okay.

875
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,140
Take a seat, Zeng.

876
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,140
Kowtow to you.

877
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,140
No, I'm here to add oil to you.

878
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,140
Do it well.

879
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,540
It's from our Guang Hua department.

880
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,940
Don't touch our Guang Hua company's face these days.

881
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,340
I'll work my heart out

882
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,340
and never let you down.

883
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,540
I'm sincere.

884
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,540
Then I'll pretend to stand by.

885
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,540
Sure.

886
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,540
I'll send you.

887
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,940
Zhou Zhou.

888
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,540
Go and check this painting.

889
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,540
Xing Xing.

890
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,940
Is this painting real?

891
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,540
It should be real by Han Ting, right?

892
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,940
This painting's author is very rare.

893
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,540
This is his golden dance.

894
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,940
This painting's author is very rare.

895
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,540
This is the painting he bought for me as a father in the past five years.

896
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,940
Xing Cui Ping.

897
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,140
The price of the purchase of this painting is

898
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,740
70,000.

899
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,540
70,000.

900
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,940
I knew this painting would be so expensive.

901
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,340
We need money to sell it.

902
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,740
We can sell it right away.

903
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,140
Why are you writing it?

904
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,740
Well,

905
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,540
I'm just saying why I'm doing this.

906
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,740
Well,

907
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,740
don't touch it.

908
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,740
What if it's dirty?

909
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,140
Han is the one who sent it.

910
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,940
It's a flower.

911
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,940
It's love.

912
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,540
It's so nice.

913
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,340
Don't talk nonsense.

914
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,540
Well,

915
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,740
I don't have anything with Han Ting.

916
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,540
I don't think so.

917
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,540
Han.

918
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,940
Han, you want to see me?

919
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,740
Sit down.

920
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,740
How long have you been in the company?

921
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,140
It's been 13 years, Han.

922
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,340
I've been a assistant to Zhang Xing Hua for seven or eight years.

923
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:34,940
Ten years.

924
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,140
You have a good salary and a good career.

925
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,740
If you were the sales director,

926
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,740
what would you suggest to the management of the sales department?

927
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,540
Han,

928
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,740
I'm not a good person.

929
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,740
I'm quite jealous of my current state.

930
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,740
As long as I can contribute for the company,

931
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,140
I don't care about the quality of the goods.

932
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,740
The water is not a good thing.

933
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:05,740
I think you really have the ability to be a father for a lifetime.

934
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,940
Han,

935
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,340
thank you for your recognition of me.

936
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,740
But Zhang Xing Hua has a sense of honor for me.

937
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,740
Even if I resign,

938
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,140
I don't want to stand in his way.

939
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,540
I hope you can understand.

940
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,940
Han,

941
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,940
how are you going to deal with this?

942
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,740
Since he has a good person like you,

943
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,540
I think you should know

944
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,940
what to do to get the best result for him.

945
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,740
I see.

946
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,940
Thank you for your recognition, Han.

947
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,140
I'm sorry.

948
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,540
I'm sorry.

949
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,940
I'm sorry.

950
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,140
I'm sorry.

951
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,540
I'm sorry.

952
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,140
I'm sorry.

953
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,540
I'm sorry.

954
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,740
I'm sorry.

955
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,140
I'm sorry.

956
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,540
You have to understand.

957
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,940
My suggestion is not to harm him.

958
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:15,940
On the contrary,

959
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,140
I'm giving him a way out.

960
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,740
I believe that after you sit in his seat,

961
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,140
you can continue to act like a car.

962
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,140
You won't make the same mistake.

963
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,340
I...

964
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,540
If I agree to you,

965
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,140
Zhang Ke is in the east.

966
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,140
He forced me to leave.

967
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,340
He's been working in the east for 15 years.

968
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,740
As long as it doesn't affect the company,

969
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,340
I'll give him a comprehensive solution.

970
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,940
Lin, come here.

971
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,340
Come and take a look.

972
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,140
Look at this bag. It's so pretty.

973
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,340
What bag?

974
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,140
Look.

975
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,140
This one.

976
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,540
I bought it before.

977
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,140
It's a good one.

978
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,340
It's so good.

979
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,140
Yes.

980
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,140
This bag is so pretty.

981
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,140
It's so expensive.

982
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,140
I used it to make money.

983
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,540
It's not expensive.

984
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,940
It's all good for you.

985
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,540
Brother Su,

986
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,540
I can only help you here.

987
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,140
Hello.

988
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,740
How much is this bag?

989
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,540
It's a little bit more expensive.

990
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,740
I'll send you a gift.

991
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,140
What does a high-tech goods mean?

992
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,540
Is food and pictures the same?

993
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,140
Don't worry.

994
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,540
We're all craftsmen.

995
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,340

996
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,340
Are you sure your bag

997
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,740
is the one I sent to the customer?

998
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,340
Dongqian, don't worry.

999
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,740
We've got the package and the certificate.

1000
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,540
We'll be able to compare them.

1001
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,140
How much is it?

1002
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,940
So expensive.

1003
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,740
It's the lowest price.

1004
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,540
You'll know when you see our shop's sales.

1005
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,740
The quality is guaranteed.

1006
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,940
Okay, I'll go get the bill.

1007
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,940
I'm afraid I'll be too scared to leave.

1008
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:43,140
I'm afraid I'll be too scared to leave.

1009
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:50,140
I'm afraid I'll be too scared to leave.

1010
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:56,140
I'm afraid I'll be too scared to leave.

1011
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:00,940
We'll leave half of it.

1012
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:05,540
I'll give myself a full-time visit.

1013
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:10,540
I won't be afraid to leave.

1014
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,340
I'll have a hard time against the wind.

1015
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,540
I'll break the law.

1016
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:23,540
I'll be able to exchange feelings for the past.

1017
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,540
I won't be able to leave.

1018
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:35,540
I'll be able to exchange feelings for the past.

1019
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:40,540
I'll be able to exchange feelings for the past.

1020
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:45,540
I'll be able to exchange feelings for the past.
