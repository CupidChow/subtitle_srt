1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to go to the sky, to the ground.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
There's no need to be firm.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll remember and be proud.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll have courage.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'm going to go to the sky, to the ground.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I won't give up.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll be careful and remember.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Even if I don't know how to be careful.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 1

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I've done all the emergency cases.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not nervous anymore.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You should relax.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'll be by your side.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Thank you.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't want to thank you.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll wait for your safety.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Episode 1

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll send you to the company later.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll see Grandpa.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What are you looking at?

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
News.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Guang Hua is building a independent data library.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why are you interested in this?

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I think Chang He and Zeng Di are thinking about it.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They just want to compete with Dong Yi.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
There are too many small things that are not good.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
When will the day when the medical technology you're interested in will come?

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So Dong Yi will have a big news in two days.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's go.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Grandpa.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Are you done?

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm back.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What's up?

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What's up?

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You've decided to do this?

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Do you know what this team of East Yang means?

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Maybe it means that we've been in the past ten years.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
All advantages are in the past.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But I believe that this will last for ten years.

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We will be in the future.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We will be in the future.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It seems that my grandson is going to be a big wife.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You can sit down if you want to.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Thank you, Grandpa.

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Our industry is very different.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You and Xiao Yuan, you are the best.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You have your own ideas.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He has his own experience.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Look, I don't want to interfere with you.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You have to take good care of your sister.

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't worry, Grandpa.

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll discuss this with my sister later.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
By the way, there's one more thing.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Before your data account is open,

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
hurry up and take the time to do it.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What is it?

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You're so stupid.

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Do you really think that it's a good deal to be with you?

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
She's a good girl.

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Hurry up and take the time to get married.

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't let her run away.

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I want to have a good time with her.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Finally.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We've just released a secret of AIisetum.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:33,360
It Cause additional exposure to

90
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,000
edonsia.

91
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,160
All of our colleaguesL corrections

92
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,660
can be thoroughly Berufke.

93
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,660
and exchange of technology.

94
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,660
Eastern Medicine will provide

95
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,660
the research materials

96
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,660
that are free and exclusive to the public.

97
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,660
The public opinion

98
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,660
is a university student

99
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,660
who is interested in artificial intelligence

100
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,660
and a science expert

101
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,660
who is a research participant.

102
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,660
In the future,

103
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,660
in artificial intelligence,

104
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,660
can we help the country

105
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,660
to see the future

106
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,660
of all of you?

107
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,660
To be able to help the country

108
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,660
to achieve its internal revenge

109
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,660
faster and better.

110
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,660
To share the benefits of the society.

111
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,660
Hello, Mr. Han.

112
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,660
Congratulations.

113
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,660
When I return to Hong Kong,

114
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,660
you and Ji Xinyi will treat me to dinner.

115
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,660
I'll be sure to wait for you.

116
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,660
I've been looking for you.

117
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,660
Why are you here?

118
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,660
When I was in the heart of the world,

119
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,660
I liked to come here

120
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
and have a meal.

121
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
I can also open many new books.

122
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,660
I just want to understand

123
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,660
some things that I don't understand.

124
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,660
What should we do next?

125
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,660
Mr. Han,

126
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,660
Han Ting has never treated me

127
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,660
as his opponent.

128
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,660
His goal is to make the whole medical world

129
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,660
to be a common prosperity.

130
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,660
I've always underestimated

131
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,660
his heart and songs.

132
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,660
So you admit defeat?

133
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,660
Since it's a common prosperity,

134
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,660
I can't say no.

135
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,660
Han Ting has opened up the wisdom of the doctor.

136
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,660
He asked us to invest in the data department

137
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,660
and make a water ticket.

138
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,660
But from a long distance,

139
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,660
the common prosperity

140
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,660
will still be meaningful.

141
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,660
I'm still not willing to do it.

142
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,660
I know.

143
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,660
You agreed to join me

144
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,660
in the game against Han Ting.

145
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,660
It's because you can't let him go.

146
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,660
Even if you don't want to admit it.

147
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,660
No matter if it's Bo Yi in the mall

148
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,660
or Jun Feng in the emotional field,

149
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,660
it's better to be willing to give up.

150
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
We are not people who can't give up.

151
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,660
Your life is still very long.

152
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,660
I hope you can let Han Ting go

153
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,660
and see the outside world

154
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,660
and see the people in the front.

155
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,660
The End

156
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,660
Mr. Han, I believe Dong Yi

157
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,660
will be the leader of the national wisdom treatment field.

158
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,660
Thank you.

159
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,660
We are looking forward to Dong Yi's future.

160
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,660
Dong Yi is also looking forward to working with you.

161
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,660
Mr. Han, we'll leave first.

162
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,660
Take care.

163
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,660
Why are you here?

164
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,660
I'm here to deliver the work document.

165
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,660
I'm here to tell you

166
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,660
to participate in the donation ceremony of Zhizhou.

167
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,660
When is he leaving?

168
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,660
Tomorrow.

169
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,660
Don't look now.

170
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,660
Don't be so anxious.

171
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,660
Go and see the outside world.

172
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,660
Look good.

173
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,660
You've been too busy these days.

174
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,660
You should rest in the afternoon.

175
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,660
Dong Yi is a good person.

176
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,660
He's got a good news.

177
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,660
Many companies are looking for our delivery project now.

178
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,660
Not only that.

179
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,660
A few days ago,

180
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,660
the media did a survey in the high school.

181
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,660
Dong Yi is the first few people

182
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,660
who are looking forward to working with us.

183
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,660
I think Dong Yi and Han Xing

184
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,660
will be the best time to win.

185
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,660
We are the same.

186
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,660
Mr. Han.

187
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,660
Mr. Ji.

188
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,660
Li Di.

189
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,660
Hello.

190
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,660
I need to go out for something.

191
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,660
You can go.

192
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,660
What are you doing?

193
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,660
I'm going to put it down.

194
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,660
Zhizhou is going to Germany tomorrow.

195
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,660
I'm going to Germany tomorrow.

196
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,660
I'm going to Germany.

197
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,660
I'm going to Germany.

198
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,660
I'm going to Germany.

199
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,660
I'm going to Germany.

200
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,660
I'm going to Germany.

201
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,660
I'm going to Germany.

202
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,660
I'm going to Germany tomorrow.

203
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,660
What do you want to say?

204
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,660
It's been so long.

205
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,660
I've seen Zhizhou's feelings for you.

206
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,660
What do you want?

207
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
I don't want to delay his progress.

208
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,660
A good relationship

209
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,660
will make two people better together.

210
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,660
No one is to delay anyone.

211
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,660
Okay, I got it.

212
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,660
Don't worry.

213
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,660
I'll take care of it.

214
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,660
Okay.

215
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,660
Let's go.

216
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,660
Have a good meal.

217
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,660
Don't be polite.

218
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,660
It's my big brother-in-law who bought the bill.

219
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,660
Don't give him money.

220
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,660
By the way,

221
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
Lili, you two are late.

222
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,660
Let's have a show.

223
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,660
Dares, Xifeng, come here first.

224
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,660
You go first.

225
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,660
Li Di, come here first.

226
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,660
Li Di is not feeling well.

227
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,660
No one is to make her suffer today.

228
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,660
Look,

229
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,660
Xiaomeng is more considerate than the other men.

230
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,660
I'm not.

231
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,660
I'm all for your service.

232
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,660
You should be considerate.

233
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,660
Why do some people

234
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,660
always get jealous?

235
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,660
Let's have a few more days.

236
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,660
Put down the bill.

237
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,660
I'm going to meet Xingxing's parents tomorrow.

238
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,660
I'm going to be the last one

239
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,660
to be born in Xingyuan.

240
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,660
What are you talking about?

241
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,660
I heard everything.

242
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,660
What's Xingyuan?

243
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,660
Xingyuan.

244
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,660
It's romantic, right?

245
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,660
Don't make fun of me.

246
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,660
You don't understand.

247
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,660
I understand.

248
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,660
Of course, you understand Xingyuan.

249
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,660
I'm just a romantic thing

250
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,660
between a ex-girlfriend.

251
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,660
Xiaomeng,

252
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
what's your wish?

253
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
I'll fulfill it for you.

254
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,660
I'm your wish man,

255
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,660
Xingyuan Xia.

256
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,660
My wish,

257
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,660
I hope

258
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,660
I can be a super old man.

259
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,660
I'm a fan of Xingyuan.

260
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,660
Su Sheng,

261
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,660
what's your wish?

262
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,660
I...

263
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,660
You should fulfill Xiaomeng's wish.

264
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,660
What's your wish?

265
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,660
Yes.

266
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,660
Why are you replying my wish?

267
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,660
No.

268
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,660
You can have me

269
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,660
as long as you have the fans.

270
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,660
I can do it.

271
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,660
I love you.

272
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,660
That's enough.

273
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,660
What do you mean?

274
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,660
Are fans still the same as you?

275
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,660
Fans should love me.

276
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,660
You still have to love me.

277
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,660
Boss,

278
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,660
Chang He and Zeng Di

279
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,660
were investigated by

280
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,660
Zhang Fengmei and

281
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,660
the Chinese brand

282
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,660
and the service car.

283
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,660
I don't know if I'm right.

284
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,660
People always pay for their mistakes.

285
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,660
Yes.

286
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,660
What's wrong, Xing?

287
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,660
The meeting is over.

288
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,660
Love is real.

289
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,660
SK2 is coming to the right side.

290
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,660
Chang He and Zeng Di

291
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,660
were investigated.

292
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,660
It's because of

293
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,660
Zhang Fengmei

294
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,660
and the previous fan.

295
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,660
It's called evil man with evil hug.

296
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,660
The name on the letter

297
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,660
of Han Xing

298
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,660
is a happy ending.

299
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,660
And Xiaomeng

300
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,660
was interviewed by the staff

301
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,660
and helped us a lot.

302
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,660
It's a perfect

303
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,660
achievement

304
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,660
for our Han Xing.

305
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,660
That's good.

306
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,660
Anyway,

307
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,660
I always got the black fans

308
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,660
from my live broadcast.

309
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,660
I don't dare to touch them now.

310
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,660
Okay, let's stop talking about it.

311
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,660
Zhizhou,

312
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,660
what time is your flight tomorrow?

313
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,660
11 o'clock tomorrow.

314
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,660
11 o'clock.

315
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,660
There's a time difference between Germany and this side.

316
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,660
You might not be used to it.

317
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,660
Anyway,

318
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,660
if you need help,

319
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,660
you can tell me.

320
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,660
I can help you with Han Xing.

321
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,660
Yes.

322
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,660
I've already told the staff there.

323
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,660
He'll take care of you.

324
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,660
Thank you, Mr. Han.

325
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,660
Thank you, Sister Xing.

326
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,660
Then I'll be...

327
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,660
I'm not polite.

328
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,660
You're not polite?

329
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,660
After Su Xiong comes back from Germany,

330
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,660
he will be promoted to

331
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660
a new and successful man.

332
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,660
Brother,

333
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,660
you're so generous.

334
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,660
Don't forget.

335
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,660
Don't worry.

336
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,660
I won't forget.

337
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,660
You're so...

338
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,660
That's enough.

339
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,660
Su Zhizhou,

340
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,660
I wish you a good luck.

341
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,660
Thank you.

342
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,660
Thank you for your advice.

343
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,660
I'll treat you to a toast.

344
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,660
Come on.

345
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,660
Come on.

346
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,660
Cheers.

347
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,660
Cheers.

348
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,660
Cheers.

349
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,660
I'm thirsty.

350
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,660
Cheers.

351
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,660
But you can't bear to do that, right?

352
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,660
He likes you so much.

353
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,660
As long as you say it,

354
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,660
he will stay for you.

355
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,660
Maybe the temporary stay

356
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,660
can't be compared to

357
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,660
Mr. Su's feelings.

358
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,660
Instead,

359
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,660
he will be more considerate.

360
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,660
So,

361
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,660
do you want to give him another chance?

362
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,660
Mr. Su is very kind.

363
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,660
He's very kind.

364
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,660
He's very kind.

365
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
He's very kind.

366
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,660
He's very kind.

367
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,660
He's very kind.

368
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,660
He's very kind.

369
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,660
He's very kind.

370
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,660
Mr. Su is different from the person

371
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,660
he met before.

372
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,660
You've been drinking so much.

373
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,660
Do you want to come?

374
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,660
You drink a lot every day.

375
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,660
Why do you tell me that?

376
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,660
Hello.

377
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,660
Please get me a bottle of water.

378
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
Thank you.

379
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,660
Okay.

380
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,660
Your friend's status is advised.

381
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,660
Drink less.

382
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,660
Especially, Mr. Su.

383
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,660
Thank you.

384
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,660
Or get me a bottle of water.

385
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,660
Thank you for your kindness.

386
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,660
I came here to drink.

387
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,660
To drink

388
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,660
is to forget about

389
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,660
the unhappy things.

390
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,660
After you sober up,

391
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,660
you will be more and more happy.

392
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,660
If you want to,

393
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,660
tell me.

394
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,660
If you have a hearing,

395
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,660
you will be better.

396
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,660
Brother He.

397
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,660
Hello.

398
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,660
Your express delivery.

399
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,660
Thank you.

400
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,660
You're welcome.

401
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,660
Bye.

402
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,660
Li.

403
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,500
Sister Li,

404
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,340
why do you eat three meals a year?

405
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,260
In our hometown,

406
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,700
we must eat dumplings every year

407
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,980
to represent the meaning of the Yuan Bao.

408
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,260
To make money and to keep it safe.

409
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,900
You can't be so arrogant.

410
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,300
But to represent the sincerity of Xing Chen,

411
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,660
I'll drink for you.

412
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,620
You want it?

413
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,860
I wanted to give you some gifts.

414
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,220
I heard that

415
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,180
you don't like it when I give you a blind date.

416
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,100
I thought you'd come here to pick me up.

417
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,340
Don't worry.

418
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,340
I'm not a good cook.

419
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,100
Maybe,

420
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,460
you rejected me in the past

421
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,900
because I was childish and impulsive.

422
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,180
But I'm willing to be better

423
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,700
for you.

424
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,860
Can you give me another chance?

425
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,100
Li Li,

426
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,620
I like you.

427
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,540
Li Li,

428
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,620
when I part이pe you,

429
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,100
I always wonder

430
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:56,740
what changes

431
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,900
in our relationship

432
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,340
or how we met.

433
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,780
I'll never give in before,

434
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,540
but

435
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,100
I lost my courage

436
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,580
on the day we met.

437
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,260
and pursue love.

438
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,940
Too many concerns

439
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,180
and too many things to be ignored.

440
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,260
That's how I lost you.

441
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,460
Although I don't want to admit it,

442
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,900
but

443
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,220
Su Zhizhou's feelings for you

444
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,020
are indeed more than mine.

445
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,300
Li Li.

446
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,220
Don't let go of the person you love.

447
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,260
You still have a chance.

448
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,580
If you really like Su Zhizhou,

449
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,460
don't leave a trace on yourself.

450
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,780
Please take it.

451
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,620
Thank you.

452
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,220
You're welcome.

453
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,820
Su Zhizhou.

454
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,180
Su Zhizhou.

455
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,060
Su Zhizhou.

456
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,900
Su Zhizhou.

457
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,860
Su Zhizhou.

458
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,900
Su Zhizhou.

459
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,900
Su Zhizhou.

460
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,900
Su Zhizhou.

461
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,900
Su Zhizhou.

462
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,900
Su Zhizhou.

463
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,900
Su Zhizhou.

464
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,900
Su Zhizhou.

465
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,900
Su Zhizhou.

466
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Su Zhizhou.

467
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
Su Zhizhou.

468
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
Su Zhizhou.

469
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Su Zhizhou.

470
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,900
Su Zhizhou.

471
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,900
Su Zhizhou.

472
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,900
Su Zhizhou.

473
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,900
Su Zhizhou.

474
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,900
Su Zhizhou.

475
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,900
Su Zhizhou.

476
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,900
Su Zhizhou.

477
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,900
Su Zhizhou.

478
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,900
Su Zhizhou.

479
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,900
Su Zhizhou.

480
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,900
Su Zhizhou.

481
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,900
Su Zhizhou.

482
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,900
Su Zhizhou.

483
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,900
Su Zhizhou.

484
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,900
Su Zhizhou.

485
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,900
Su Zhizhou.

486
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,900
Su Zhizhou.

487
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,900
Su Zhizhou.

488
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,900
Su Zhizhou.

489
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,900
Su Zhizhou.

490
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,900
Su Zhizhou.

491
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,900
Su Zhizhou.

492
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,900
Su Zhizhou.

493
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,900
What's going on?

494
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,900
He finally comes back.

495
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,900
I think I'm going to have my share.

496
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,900
We won't...

497
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,100
get married first.

498
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,900
What?

499
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,900
Good thing.

500
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,900
But of course it's our first.

501
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,900
How about it?

502
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,900
Let's find her.

503
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,900
It's not the time to make a decision.

504
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,900
Of course you have to be more serious when you see your parents.

505
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,900
Are you afraid that they will make you feel bad?

506
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,900
Even if they make me feel bad,

507
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,900
I will marry them.

508
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,900
After all,

509
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,900
I will marry their daughter.

510
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,900
Okay.

511
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,900
Then can you see Mr. Han

512
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,900
if you can succeed?

513
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,900
I will use my sincerity to make them happy.

514
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,900
Before that, you have to learn from them first.

515
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,900
Otherwise, you will be in trouble.

516
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
I will give you a little bit more.

517
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,900
Help you choose.

518
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
What is the character of Uncle and Auntie?

519
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,900
A pair of fish and a lion.

520
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,900
Then what do they like to eat?

521
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,900
What do they like?

522
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,900
Do you want to make it for them?

523
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,900
Of course.

524
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,900
What's wrong?

525
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,900
Are you so nervous?

526
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,900
No.

527
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,900
Who is nervous?

528
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,900
Okay.

529
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,900
You can say no.

530
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,900
I can't smell it.

531
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,900
You are so anxious.

532
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,900
You eat while I cook.

533
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,900
Don't be nervous.

534
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,900
What do you mean?

535
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,900
I can't even eat.

536
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
Okay.

537
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,900
By the way,

538
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
have you called them?

539
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,900
When did they arrive?

540
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,900
They have arrived.

541
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,900
They are almost here.

542
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,900
Tell me the problem between them.

543
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,900
How about the solution?

544
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
I don't know.

545
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,900
I don't know.

546
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,900
I don't know.

547
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,900
I don't know.

548
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,900
The problem between them is solved.

549
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,900
I'm so afraid.

550
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,900
If I do it again,

551
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,900
I will be in trouble.

552
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,900
Xingxing.

553
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,900
She is not a confused child.

554
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,900
Since she agreed to

555
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,900
meet Han Qing,

556
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,900
I think it over.

557
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,900
We will talk with her later.

558
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,900
Okay?

559
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,900
Okay.

560
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,900
They are here.

561
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,900
Bye.

562
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,900
You are back.

563
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
Good morning, aunt.

564
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,900
Xiaohan is here.

565
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,900
Come in.

566
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
Han Qing is here.

567
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,900
Uncle.

568
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,900
Hello.

569
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
Have a seat.

570
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,900
We will have dinner later.

571
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,900
Okay.

572
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,900
Do you want to change your shoes?

573
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,900
No.

574
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,900
We will talk later.

575
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900
Come in.

576
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,900
Hurry up.

577
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,900
Have some tea.

578
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,900
Thank you, aunt.

579
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,900
Sit down.

580
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,900
Aunt.

581
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,900
I brought you some small business.

582
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,900
It's good that you are here.

583
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,900
No.

584
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,900
I'm done.

585
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
Let's have dinner.

586
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,900
Come on.

587
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
Wash your hands.

588
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,900
Wash your hands.

589
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,900
The black towel is for you.

590
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,900
Thank you, aunt.

591
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,900
No problem.

592
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,900
I prepared it for you last year.

593
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,900
Okay.

594
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,900
Let's wash our hands.

595
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,900
Let's go.

596
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,900
Xiaohan.

597
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,900
You are the first to come to my house.

598
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,900
I don't know your taste.

599
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,900
Today is your favorite dish

600
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,900
of your uncle's greatest dish.

601
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,900
You are the one who loves to eat.

602
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,900
Come on.

603
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Try the chili chicken first.

604
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,900
Okay.

605
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,900
Thank you, aunt.

606
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,900
Come on.

607
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,900
One more.

608
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,900
Okay.

609
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,900
Thank you.

610
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,900
Xiaohan.

611
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,900
Let me tell you.

612
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
This dish of potato noodles

613
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,900
is my unique secret.

614
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,900
It's spicy and spicy.

615
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,900
It's delicious.

616
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,900
It's spicy and delicious.

617
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,900
When we were young,

618
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,900
we could have a big dinner

619
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,900
with just one dish.

620
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,900
Come on.

621
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,900
Try it.

622
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,900
Thank you, uncle.

623
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,900
It's okay.

624
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,900
It's okay.

625
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,900
How is it?

626
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,900
It's okay.

627
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,900
Don't eat it.

628
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,900
Xiaohan.

629
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,900
We have talked about

630
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,900
the principle problem.

631
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,900
We won't talk about it today.

632
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,900
But look.

633
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,900
You and Xingxing

634
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,900
can't eat

635
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,900
the three meals a day.

636
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,900
You can't eat it.

637
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,900
You can't eat it.

638
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,900
You can't eat it.

639
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,900
You can't eat it.

640
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,900
It's a long time

641
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,900
since we met.

642
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,900
How could you

643
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,900
live together?

644
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,900
It was all my fault.

645
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,900
Uncle and aunt.

646
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,900
Xingxing told me

647
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,900
that she will stand by me

648
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,900
and behind me.

649
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,900
I will do everything for her.

650
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,900
I won't be sad

651
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,900
when I die.

652
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,900
I want to

653
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,900
live with Xingxing

654
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,900
for the rest of my life.

655
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,900
I hope uncle and aunt

656
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,900
can give me Xingxing

657
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,900
with ease.

658
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,900
I and Ji

659
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,900
don't object to your return.

660
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,900
You don't have to

661
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,900
do anything for us.

662
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,900
Young people

663
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,900
can't do anything

664
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,900
when they are in love.

665
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,900
We understand.

666
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,900
But

667
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,900
dating is different

668
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,900
from living together.

669
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,900
You two

670
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,900
must learn to understand each other

671
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,900
and be tolerant.

672
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,900
You must understand each other

673
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,900
and be more tolerant.

674
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,900
Otherwise,

675
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,900
you will be in a relationship

676
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,900
and you won't live together.

677
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,900
Do you understand?

678
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,900
Yes.

679
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,900
I have a bet

680
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,900
on breaking up.

681
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
But I have grown up.

682
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,900
No matter what happens,

683
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
we will communicate more

684
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,900
and be tolerant.

685
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,900
We will be good.

686
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,900
Communication is important.

687
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,900
Good.

688
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,700
What's wrong?

689
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,900
Let me see.

690
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,900
These

691
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,900
are all prepared for you.

692
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,900
I'll take them.

693
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,900
Xingxing has ordered them for you.

694
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,900
I told you.

695
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,900
I've given them to you.

696
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,900
Thank you, aunt.

697
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
Thank you, uncle.

698
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,900
Come on.

699
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,900
Thank you. Eat it.

700
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,900
Come on.

701
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,900
Eat more.

702
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,900
Come on.

703
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,900
Come on.

704
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,900
Eat.

705
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,900
Eat.

706
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,900
Come on.

707
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
You.

708
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,900
Come on.

709
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,900
Eat more.

710
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,900
Okay.

711
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,900
This chicken.

712
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,900
Come on.

713
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,900
This is not spicy.

714
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,900
This is chicken.

715
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,900
Thank you.

716
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,900
You should try this.

717
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,900
Try this.

718
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,900
It's so delicious.

719
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
It smells good.

720
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,900
What?

721
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,900
Beef.

722
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,900
I've liked this since I was a kid.

723
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,900
Don't fool me like that.

724
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,900
But this is not easy.

725
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,900
I like it.

726
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,900
Thanks, aunt.

727
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,900
Good job.

728
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
You're out.

729
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,900
Thank you, aunt.

730
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,900
I need to pick it up.

731
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,900
Give them.

732
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,420
Mom, Xin Xin is done.

733
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,060
All right.

734
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,820
I won't call you.

735
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,060
I'll help you.

736
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,620
It's okay.

737
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:32,860
Come on.

738
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,420
Mom wants to talk to you about a few things.

739
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,700
I want to tell you

740
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,660
you don't have to be so anxious to get married.

741
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,340
You still don't trust her?

742
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,460
That's not it.

743
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,900
I think the child of Xiao Han

744
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,060
is quite good.

745
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,020
But their family is big.

746
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,020
The relationship between people is complicated.

747
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,860
I don't know if you'll be bullied

748
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,020
if you get married.

749
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:02,980
Don't worry.

750
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,180
I've seen their family.

751
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,180
They're all good.

752
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,180
They treat me well.

753
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,980
And I have a lot of money now.

754
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,180
Who can bully me?

755
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,980
I used to urge you.

756
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,980
I wanted you to find a person who loves you and loves you.

757
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,980
Now I want to keep you more.

758
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,940
I want to make you enjoy your time as a daughter.

759
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,940
You know what?

760
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,940
There are many roles in this life.

761
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,940
In all roles, only a daughter is the best.

762
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,140
It's the same.

763
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,540
I married a woman and I'm your daughter.

764
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,940
I'll call you mom when I have a child.

765
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,180
You're always your burden.

766
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,140
You can't hide from me.

767
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,140
You're a girl.

768
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,300
You're a girl.

769
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,300
How are you waiting for me?

770
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,300
Are you okay?

771
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,300
It's all good.

772
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,140
I'm at the restaurant

773
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,900
that Xing Jie recommended to me.

774
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,900
Look.

775
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,900
The German beer.

776
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900
The only bad thing is...

777
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,100
What's wrong?

778
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,300
It's a history.

779
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,500
The German is a history.

780
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,500
What do you mean?

781
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,900
I miss you so much.

782
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,300
I just went to work a few days ago.

783
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,900
I just made soup.

784
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,300
I put the lotus root you gave me.

785
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,900
I'll make a video for you

786
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,900
after I finish my meal.

787
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,300
You're like a worker.

788
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,900
I'll eat well.

789
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:50,900
Here you are.

790
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,300
By the way,

791
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,700
the German Du Sa Erdorf

792
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:06,140
will hold a international medical

793
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,700
and medical exam.

794
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,900
The company sent me there.

795
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,900
I'll go to the movies to look for you.

796
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Really?

797
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,900
Du Sa Erdorf is quite far away.

798
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,900
How about this?

799
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,900
I'll ask for a leave to look for you.

800
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,900
We'll have a meeting together.

801
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,900
We'll discuss it later.

802
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,900
German beer.

803
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,660
German beer.

804
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,660
I'll hang up now.

805
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,260
Bye.

806
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,260
Bye.

807
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,140
Why are you so busy?

808
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,140
You're leaving in a whole night?

809
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,660
I'm busy.

810
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,260
The company is busy.

811
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,300
Yes.

812
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,460
We'll come to see you again

813
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,460
when the New Year comes.

814
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,260
Han.

815
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,260
Open the box.

816
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,860
This is my own sesame and chili.

817
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,860
Take it back to eat.

818
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,100
Thank you, uncle.

819
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,460
Don't take too much.

820
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,460
I'm pretending to be lucky.

821
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,460
It's gone.

822
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,060
You want to eat it,

823
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,060
but it's gone.

824
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,460
If you want to eat it again,

825
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,460
I'll give you a chicken.

826
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,460
Okay.

827
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,460
Let's do another big thing.

828
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,020
Okay.

829
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,620
You can leave when you're done.

830
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:23,720
Come on.

831
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,220
Take a picture.

832
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,220
All together.

833
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,220
Okay?

834
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,220
One, two, three.

835
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,220
Xin Xin.

836
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,220
I'll take you to a place tonight.

837
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,220
Okay.

838
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,020
Why are you taking me here?

839
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,020
I've never thought about it before.

840
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,020
I'd like to spend a day with someone.

841
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,020
I'd like to care about her joy and joy,

842
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,020
and consider her future.

843
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,020
So,

844
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,020
I want to be under the supervision of our starry sky,

845
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,020
and complete the dream.

846
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,020
I want to be with her.

847
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,020
I want to be with her.

848
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,020
I want to be with her.

849
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,020
I want to be with her.

850
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,020
I want to be with her.

851
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,020
I want to be with her.

852
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,740
I want to be with her.

853
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,020
Ji Xin.

854
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,020
Are you willing to marry me?

855
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,020
I want to be with you for the rest of my life.

856
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,020
I could never be with you.

857
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:33,020
I will never leave you.

858
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,900
No matter how long it takes, I'll hold your heart

859
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,660
I'm afraid of pain, but I'll say it's painful

860
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,860
I'm willing to run away in the wind

861
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,580
Find the bridge on the cliff

862
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:00,060
That moment of eyes, I'm red

863
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,660
Because you're still by my side

864
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,500
Everything you want made to me

865
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,420
Try to let it be my destiny

866
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:13,140
Just like a shot through the day and night

867
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,140
And I see

868
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:21,020
Hold my hand across the land and see

869
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,660
Call my name from this sky, can't read

870
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,460
We are the ones that keep flipping

871
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,260
Rise and see

872
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,260
You are my repair

873
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:44,300
I'm willing to run away in the wind

874
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,380
Find the bridge on the cliff

875
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:52,260
That moment of eyes, I'm red

876
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,060
Because you're still by my side

877
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,940
Everything you want made to me

878
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,940
Try to let it be my destiny

879
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:12,300
I'm willing to run away in the wind

880
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,300
Mr. Lu!

881
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,300
Yay!

882
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,780
You let me have a look!

883
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,340
I'll take a look at his clothes and put it on the Internet.

884
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,340
Hey, hey, hey!

885
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,260
You want to hit me?

886
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,100
Come on, let's have a look!

887
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,660
No, we agreed at the beginning.

888
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,700
The name of the smart fruit and Mr. Lu are our lovers' accounts.

889
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,060
Why are they all on it now?

890
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,500
Speaking of which, I have an idea recently.

891
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,180
I'm going to change the name to

892
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,100
Smart Fruit, Limei and Mr. Lu.

893
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,620
That's great!

894
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,220
You're not happy?

895
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,540
Okay, come on.

896
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,940
Let's take a photo of the account number of three people.

897
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,780
Bigger!

898
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,500
What you looking at?

899
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,860
Get the whole advertisement.

900
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,580
Take a look.

901
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,100
This account is pretty good.

902
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,980
Not just represents me well,

903
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,420
But also marks me well as history's heritage.

904
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,140
Not only did you guarantee me,

905
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,500
but also you guaranteed me that I wouldn't touch Dongyang's roots.

906
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,940
You won't have this day.

907
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,540
Are you sure it's me?

908
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,340
What?

909
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:04,140
You said that love is getting more and more difficult.

910
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,140
How come you're sure you'll fall in love with me every day?

911
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,340
I've already fallen in love with you.

912
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,020
Then you'll bully me in the future.

913
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,900
How?

914
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,460
For example, scolding me, scolding me.

915
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,020
You're so stubborn.

916
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,540
It's not bad if you don't bully me first.

917
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:31,060
Then will you be a ghost?

918
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,740
You're not annoying enough.

919
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,300
How can I be annoying?

920
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,340
You're not annoying enough.

921
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,900
Do you have any expectations and demands for me after marriage?

922
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,500
No. What about you?

923
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,100
No.

924
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:53,380
Yes.

925
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,540
For me?

926
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,500
As long as I love you.

927
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,020
Sure.

928
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,100
Ms. Tan's nature is too much.

929
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:21,740
It's too high.

930
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,740
You've given me so many likes and comments.

931
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,340
Do you still remember this place?

932
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,260
How about this?

933
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,380
When you get your loss,

934
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,140
I'll compensate for the amount of money you gave him.

935
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,140
Tang Song.

936
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,140
Leave a message.

937
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,140
Let them go.

938
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,140
Boss is not that good.

939
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,140
He still made me feel bad.

940
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,140
I didn't ask you to compensate.

941
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,140
Why not?

942
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,140
I've compensated for you.

943
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:29,300
Well,

944
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,980
do you think Shan Blick's

945
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,980
are suitable for Li Meng?

946
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,300
I'll take the responsibility.

947
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,620
아

948
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:40,980
I'll try.

949
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,940
What're you looking at?

950
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,060
Come.

951
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,140
Look here.

952
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:02,700
