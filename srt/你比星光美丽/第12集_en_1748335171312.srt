1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I forget myself.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll go into description.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Don't hesitate,

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Don't hesitate try not to fear fear of fear.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hence, I'll go into description.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but don't give up.

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I said you were so cruel.

15
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,000
In the future,

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
if others say anything more difficult,

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
can you say it?

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Tao Se Fei Wen doesn't care about me.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But it will hurt you.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If you can't bear the consequences,

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
don't go to the airport.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Go to the airport?

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Go to the airport.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It will pay the price.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If you don't mind,

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
continue.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Be careful.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Be careful.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I know, aunt.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
See you next time.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
See you next time.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Send me a WeChat when you get home.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Bye.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Be careful.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This kid is so cute.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Ms. Han.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Why are you here?

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You beat me?

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I was scared to death.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You beat you?

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You got a face, right?

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Where did you go?

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Ms. Han,

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
how can you talk to Qing Er like this?

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I can't stand her anymore.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You can't stand her anymore?

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Do you feel sorry for her?

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's late.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm so lucky.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't know

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
if I'm a son or a pervert.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Come in.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's getting cold.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm a pervert.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm not a pervert.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Do you want me to give you a massage?

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No, thanks.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
My dear,

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
it's the third time you've been in trouble.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If you don't want to eat,

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
don't order.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
How long have you been back from Germany?

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You still don't get it.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I've been so sure

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
that I'll be a part of

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
the show.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Tonight,

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
the little princess

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
is looking for a place

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
to live.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm not sure.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll go there.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Look,

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
the little princess is looking at me

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and is crying and making a fuss.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I've been in trouble for a long time.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What's wrong?

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Tell me what's on your mind.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll analyze it for you.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Tao Se Fei Wen doesn't care about me.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But it will hurt you.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
If you can't bear the consequences,

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
don't go to the capital.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Going to the capital

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
will pay the price.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Mr. Lin,

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm glad to meet you.

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I just have a misunderstanding

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
that needs to be explained to you.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Mr. Han is a new investor.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
His relationship with me

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
is just a simple top-down.

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm afraid I can't

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
make a cooperation

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
between the North and East.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're willing to give us a discount.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We're grateful.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But we're not paid.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We're so kind to you.

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm sorry to trouble you.

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Qiu Zhi,

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
she wants to say

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
that she's a part of you.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
She's not a part of you.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Hu Jia Hu is a father.

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Who needs such a fake love?

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Fake love

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
can change

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
between true love and false love.

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How many people are fake to be true?

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
People are always changing.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This world is the same.

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I didn't change.

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I won't change.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You're worried about the situation.

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Why are you so angry?

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
She doesn't know

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
how fast the rumors spread in this circle.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Once she opens her mouth,

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
rumors will spread

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and all her efforts will be gone.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I guess so.

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You're just concerned.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
People,

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
when they meet someone they care about,

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
they'll be in a mess.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay, Mr. Han.

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's okay.

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll go first.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Just buy it yourself.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Hello, Mr. Lin.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Mr. Ji,

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
it's me.

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Mr. Han is in the restaurant today.

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You've already told me about his idea.

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Tang Tu told us

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
that you were also

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
accused of being a part of Mr. Han.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's not because of the school's relationship.

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's our misunderstanding.

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I also want to say

145
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
that I'm not a part of you.

146
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm just concerned about the situation.

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm not a part of you.

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm just concerned about the situation.

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I also want to apologize to Mr. Ji.

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This won't affect

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
our cooperation.

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You're so sincere today.

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I believe

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
our cooperation in the future

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
will be very successful.

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't be discouraged by your torture.

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Just take it as

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
the long-term cooperation.

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You'll see.

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm really sorry.

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay.

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
We'll be happy to see you again.

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
See you.

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I was nearing the office.

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I had a problem in the office before yesterday.

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,880
Thank you for letting Tang Tu

168
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,880
contact Mr. Lin.

169
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Hello, everyone.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:59,080
Let me

171
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,160
happy

172
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,960
Sister Qing,

173
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,640
why don't you go to work first?

174
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,320
I'll take care of it.

175
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,280
Okay.

176
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,840
I'll leave this flower to you for now.

177
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Okay. Sister Li, this way please.

178
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,320
This is your palace after this.

179
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,400
This is the best place

180
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,040
for the whole city

181
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,280
to be protected by the wind and water.

182
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,960
I've been talking to you.

183
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,000
Right, Mr. Su?

184
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
Isn't this whole house yours?

185
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,040
I have a lot of work.

186
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,600
Sister Li is here.

187
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,960
She can help me to take care of the people.

188
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,840
What are you doing?

189
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,400
Hurry up.

190
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,200
I thought about it yesterday.

191
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,400
But I swear

192
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,720
I don't want people to misunderstand our relationship.

193
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,120
How can you explain?

194
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,000
The eyes of the people are full of blood.

195
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,600
They are just a few eyes.

196
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,680
Why are you talking so much?

197
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,800
Is your work not enough to protect the river?

198
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,000
There's a chair.

199
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,480
Hurry up.

200
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,400
You need to act.

201
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,320
Sister Li.

202
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,560
I'm sorry for what happened yesterday.

203
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:24,140
Never Russel started

204
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,480
I'm sorry.

205
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,600
Who are you with?

206
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,480
I've been wondering who you are.

207
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,960
Han Ting.

208
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,960
I don't know how to face

209
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,520
what happened yesterday.

210
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,080
Han Ting is quite interesting.

211
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,120
He was the one who invested in you.

212
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,280
She's so cunning now.

213
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,440
Sister Li,

214
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,080
which one do you like?

215
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,680
You should choose one in front of the computer.

216
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,840
Okay.

217
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,880
You can do it yourself,

218
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,000
I'll go in first.

219
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,920
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,200
I shouldn't have made a mess

221
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,560
with your name.

222
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,560
I'll be a good actress.

223
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,680
I won't be a criminal again.

224
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,480
Thank you.

225
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,400
Grandpa.

226
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,480
What did you buy?

227
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,560
I've been chatting in the crowd

228
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,080
all the time

229
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,420
found my son.

230
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,020
And your sisters

231
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,020
fool by them day in night.

232
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,320
First she needs to do something.

233
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,100
She doesn't need to be so modest.

234
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,080
And she should save others' life.

235
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,220
She should particulier for her own.

236
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,520
I claimed an heirloom

237
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,160
in the elder.

238
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,820
Canon Guild

239
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,520
isきます.

240
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,500
In youricing,

241
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,820
I can't say more.

242
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,580
But there's something

243
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,820
that I don't want to hurt Dongyang's roots.

244
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,100
Don't worry, Grandpa.

245
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,220
I understand.

246
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,380
I heard

247
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,420
you hired a little girl

248
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,580
called Ji Xing.

249
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,620
Are you a college student?

250
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,460
Grandpa,

251
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,780
I invested in her

252
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,580
because I recognized her.

253
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,860
At least this official statement,

254
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,100
I think you like her.

255
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,100
Yes.

256
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,780
What's your success?

257
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,820
She doesn't know I like her

258
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,380
and she's not my girlfriend.

259
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,340
She's not even a hit.

260
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,700
She invested 20 million.

261
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,020
This girl is really capable.

262
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,860
Remember,

263
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,020
investing is not a loss.

264
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,980
Grandpa, I believe in her.

265
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,140
The responsibility of our Han family's granddaughter

266
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,980
is not what ordinary girls can bear.

267
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,180
This love is easy for ordinary people.

268
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,860
But for you,

269
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,300
you need to be capable of this.

270
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,260
The creation is a bridge between thousands of horses.

271
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,020
How far can it go?

272
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,700
It's a unknown place.

273
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,780
If you don't support Han personally,

274
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,860
how many days can he go?

275
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,580
How confident can he be

276
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,860
with you?

277
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:50,980
Grandpa,

278
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,580
the machine is not ordinary.

279
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,340
I just don't know if he's willing to

280
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,660
support me.

281
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,500
Anyway,

282
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,180
I won't give up on her.

283
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,580
I can only give the machine two days.

284
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,300
If she doesn't succeed,

285
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,060
you need to listen to me.

286
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,660
Find a girl who can take care of the team

287
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,700
and get married.

288
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,060
She will succeed.

289
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,780
You

290
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,500
don't think you can succeed

291
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,740
with the investment of Dongyi.

292
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,700
It's not that easy to succeed.

293
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,100
Hello, Mr. Lin.

294
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,860
Today is the new technology.

295
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,220
Engineer Xiankong pork de訴 we have beenaudite.

296
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:57,620
Excuse me.

297
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,620
When is the second elae over?

298
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,220
Your company is in a hurry.

299
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:02,660
Unlike regular ones,

300
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,940
those are plastic bags.

301
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,660
Wait, not plastic bags.

302
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,140
Hello?

303
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,460
Hello?

304
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,260
Boss Xia,

305
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,860
I am ordinary tuskatically.

306
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,180
Can you give me a call?

307
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:19,780
Hello?

308
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,620
So you managed to fix the problem

309
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,620
What's wrong, Xiao Shang?

310
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,940
Yesterday, we met a financial engineer

311
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,940
who told us

312
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,380
that we're not like a regular company

313
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,100
that offers half-finished work.

314
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,300
It's okay.

315
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,380
It's like looking for a new employee

316
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,660
and looking for a boyfriend.

317
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,700
We can meet a few people.

318
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,140
We can meet the right person.

319
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,060
Yes.

320
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,620
It's a good idea.

321
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:42,980
It's okay.

322
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,180
We have another interview

323
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,460
at ten o'clock.

324
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:46,900
Right.

325
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,780
It's already ten o'clock.

326
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,780
Where are you?

327
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,500
Ms. Lin.

328
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:52,740
Hello.

329
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,060
Turns out I'm here with Xin Cheng.

330
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,220
We arranged our interview at ten o'clock.

331
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,540
Where are you now, please?

332
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,500
Hi?

333
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,340
CEO Su.

334
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,180
He said he thought

335
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,820
our company was a writing shop,

336
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,220
then we came but came

337
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,380
to the entrance of an empty room

338
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,700
to have a full or empty room.

339
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,540
I think we're in a very Christmasy

340
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,500
and very serious way.

341
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,500
Also

342
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,900
It's even more serious.

343
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,900
Although the printing machine is well-prepared,

344
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,300
we still need to find a laboratory

345
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,220
and expand the technical staff of the printing machine.

346
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,780
Otherwise, we can't reach the experimental stage of the product.

347
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,740
But our working environment now

348
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,340
is actually quite similar to the one in the morning.

349
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,300
How about

350
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,260
I rent this out first?

351
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,780
Let's put a little more money

352
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,900
and change it to a bigger one, a better one.

353
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,740
No, I've already calculated.

354
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,180
The deposit of the printing machine, the printing machine's maintenance,

355
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,860
we still need to find a laboratory in the future.

356
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,100
We still need to keep some daily flow funds.

357
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,540
We don't have money to replace them.

358
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,660
We still need to find a way to make some money.

359
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,020
We can borrow some small work first.

360
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,340
For example, give the hospital some small procedures.

361
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,060
The printing machine is still small.

362
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,060
Then we can also think of other ways.

363
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,260
I'll go out for a bit.

364
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,860
Let's see what kind of project we can do first.

365
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,020
I'll contact the people who are working in other interviews.

366
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,140
Okay.

367
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,180
Go out and buy some company.

368
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,940
I can send in over the next hour.

369
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,300
Okay.

370
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,060
Say it.

371
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,940
Brother, Jia Jia andoke wrote on the Day of thegiving.

372
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,660
Sister.

373
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,860
He even went to your place to jump.

374
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,220
He can't be a daughter-in-law of Han family.

375
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,900
Brother, listen to you.

376
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,420
How can you be so kind?

377
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,620
Just like the soldier who just came out of the army.

378
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,460
He's so stubborn.

379
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,900
What age are you?

380
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,900
Why are you still talking about being a guard?

381
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,820
I'm ashamed of you, brother.

382
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,300
Look at the operation law.

383
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,660
I have to jump up

384
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,820
if I don't press it.

385
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,020
Besides,

386
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,020
this girl is so close to us.

387
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,140
We are all 50 years old.

388
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,820
As Han family's daughter-in-law,

389
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,980
besides some important names,

390
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,420
she has to be responsible for more things.

391
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,180
I used to think that Xiaodi is good.

392
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,500
But now I only have one.

393
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,980
Anyway,

394
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,660
I won't take back what I said.

395
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,620
Brother,

396
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,780
you are getting old and stubborn.

397
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:40,980
Okay.

398
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,580
I'm warning you.

399
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,700
Don't be angry.

400
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,140
I'll ask your grandson to marry you.

401
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,820
Okay, okay.

402
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,900
I don't have any problems with him.

403
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,500
Okay, I'll hang up.

404
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,260
You know that.

405
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,300
I'll hang up if I can't.

406
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,460
You're so annoying.

407
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,140
Have you changed clothes?

408
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:18,980
I want a оч friendly text.

409
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,260
I have before you.

410
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,380
What are you talking about?

411
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,140
Your nephew,

412
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,780
please help me with this.

413
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,380
Okay, sister-in-law.

414
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,620
No need to excuse,

415
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,020
bear it with my head.

416
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,860
I'm going to show you the nuptial string.

417
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,140
You cannot cry.

418
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,020
Dong Lan,

419
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,820
the report time for Mr. Ji is really good.

420
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,820
I have a adjustment.

421
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,820
You can see an hour.

422
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,620
Mr. Ji's statement.

423
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,020
Don't you know it?

424
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,060
Two hours.

425
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,380
I'll arrange it right now.

426
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,900
It's 3.30 in the afternoon.

427
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,020
Come to my office

428
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,460
and report the latest news.

429
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,620
Okay.

430
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,660
Hello, Lili.

431
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,500
Xin Xin.

432
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,380
A student told me

433
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,620
he knows the director of Li Quan An,

434
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,540
the director of Xin Gang Hospital.

435
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,020
He's in the hospital today.

436
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,940
But I have something else to talk about.

437
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,860
I'm afraid I can't go there.

438
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,580
Do you want to go there to talk with him

439
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,180
and talk about the future?

440
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,500
Okay.

441
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,540
I'll go to Director Li.

442
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,780
Okay. Bye.

443
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,900
Bye.

444
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,460
Mr. Su.

445
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,860
Mr. Tian Jiang Jiang.

446
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,900
Mr. Sha.

447
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,460
The new worker of the company,

448
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,620
Yuan Lang,

449
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,300
is going to report the work

450
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,420
of Mr. Han

451
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,220
to you this afternoon.

452
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,340
What are you laughing at?

453
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,540
I'm going there.

454
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,900
Xin Xin.

455
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,540
Please forgive me.

456
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,220
I'll go to the office

457
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,300
when I see Mr. Han.

458
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,620
Besides,

459
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,140
you used to report it to me.

460
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,380
If Mr. Han asks,

461
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,700
how can I explain it to him?

462
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,940
You said I went to the director of Li Quan An,

463
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,260
the director of Xin Gang Hospital?

464
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,980
No, no, no.

465
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,740
He must say

466
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,180
I can't manage my time.

467
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,500
You said I was sick.

468
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,580
Sick?

469
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,700
What kind of illness are you talking about?

470
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,500
Whatever.

471
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,340
I'll do it myself.

472
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,260
I'll do it myself.

473
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:46,980
Bye.

474
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,020
Keep going.

475
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,780
What kind of illness?

476
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,580
What do you want to drink?

477
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,540
I've been out of love for a while.

478
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,060
The coffee is almost at the end of the day.

479
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,500
Let's talk about it.

480
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,740
You want me to do it for Xin Xin?

481
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,660
Is she doing well recently?

482
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,740
Which aspect do you know?

483
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,740
The company is now

484
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,220
the key period of development.

485
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,060
She has already reached her work.

486
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,980
She's much better than before.

487
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,820
opponents

488
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,980
of 사람

489
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,460
please give this to him.

490
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,220
Where can you get money from?

491
00:24:49,220 --> 00:25:07,300
You should Several

492
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,620
Do you think he will want it?

493
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,220
You can not tell him

494
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,740
that this money is mine.

495
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,220
Shao Yichen,

496
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,620
are you trying to be a famous hero?

497
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,140
You know it.

498
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,260
The money that comes to the public

499
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,540
will not be taken back.

500
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,420
Shao Yichen,

501
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,540
I have been thinking about something.

502
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,700
You were so small before.

503
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,380
Why did you break up?

504
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,500
You fell in love with someone else?

505
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,020
Even so,

506
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,300
I still love him.

507
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,940
But we are not suitable for each other.

508
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,820
You bought a house and got married.

509
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,820
Now you realize that you are not suitable for each other?

510
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,340
In the past, I thought

511
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,580
as long as I love him more,

512
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,500
as long as I hold on to him,

513
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,660
as long as I change him,

514
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,260
we can be suitable.

515
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,380
But I realized that I was wrong.

516
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,460
What Xing Xing wants is the stars and the sea.

517
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,060
And what I can give him

518
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,700
is only a blink of an eye.

519
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,820
I do not want to be his burden.

520
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,380
I do not want to be his burden.

521
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,460
I am not that great.

522
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,180
I am not just good for him.

523
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,940
I am even better for myself.

524
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,060
I am leaving now.

525
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,380
Shao Yichen.

526
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,140
I say it again.

527
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,700
Thank you for your soft depression.

528
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,820
I normally really feel like

529
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,540
I belong to here.

530
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,500
If it is of any need,

531
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,420
please tell me.

532
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,900
Thank you.

533
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,880
He is here

534
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,240
Brainless

535
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,520
Who is it?

536
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,480
Boss

537
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,080
It's the manager

538
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,760
Boss

539
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,160
How are you

540
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,820
The Star God Su Zhizhou.

541
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,820
Hello.

542
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,820
This is the recent report from the Star God.

543
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,820
Please take a look.

544
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,820
The Star God Su Zhizhou.

545
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,540
Please come out.

546
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,300
The disaster is coming.

547
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,460
Within three months,

548
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,300
Not enough.

549
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:32,860
What?

550
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,380
I'll arrange someone for you.

551
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,300
No, no.

552
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,460
It's...

553
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,460
It's our office environment.

554
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:39,500
It's too bad.

555
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,980
It's really a matter of people coming here.

556
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,180
What's the solution?

557
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,060
So you guys

558
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,460
are going to do this?

559
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,100
Let you report to the office.

560
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,220
Xing is sick today.

561
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,020
What?

562
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,100
fever.

563
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,420
Can't you report seriously?

564
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,180
Well...

565
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,220
He

566
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,140
has fever and has a fever.

567
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,340
His head is feverish.

568
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,860
His head is feverish.

569
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,540
It's very hard to talk to him.

570
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,660
When he speaks,

571
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,140
he'll report to me.

572
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,420
Where is he now?

573
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,980
He's at home.

574
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,860
He's resting.

575
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,860
Do I have to tell them to tell them?

576
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,300
If you want to report to me,

577
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,780
I'll report to them by speech.

578
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,540
Wait.

579
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,420
Maybe he will go to see me.

580
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,700
Boss Han.

581
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,860
Go back.

582
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,860
Thank you, Mr. Han.

583
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,860
Mr. Han, goodbye.

584
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,860
Li Quan'en.

585
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,860
Chief Tan, I'm leaving.

586
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,860
Goodbye.

587
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,860
Goodbye.

588
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,860
Five minutes is over.

589
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,860
Boss,

590
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,860
your schedule is really not reasonable.

591
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,860
I'll bring the meeting room first.

592
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,860
Follow me.

593
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,860
Sister Xing,

594
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,860
as long as you're not in the high-end,

595
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,860
I'll never report to Mr. Han.

596
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,860
What's wrong?

597
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,860
Why did he scold me?

598
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,860
He just said that he can't control me.

599
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,860
He's so angry that he's trying to fool me.

600
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,860
You're a broken heart.

601
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,860
I'll take a break and eat something.

602
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,860
I'll go talk to you.

603
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,860
Hello, Director Li.

604
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,860
I'm Xing Chen's new engineer.

605
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,860
Sorry to trouble you.

606
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,860
Hello?

607
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,860
I heard you're sick.

608
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,860
Two.

609
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,860
What's the disease?

610
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,860
It's just that I...

611
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,860
I'm a little...

612
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,860
You should be cold.

613
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,860
Mr. Han, what a coincidence.

614
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,860
Well,

615
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,860
I've reported to you.

616
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,860
You still want to report to me?

617
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,860
Of course.

618
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,860
I'm sick.

619
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,860
I'll give you the fever.

620
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,860
You're so sad.

621
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,860
Come to Li Quan.

622
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,860
I'm not listening to you.

623
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,860
Mr. Han.

624
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,860
What a coincidence.

625
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,860
I've been looking for you.

626
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,860
I've made an appointment with your assistant.

627
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,860
But you're full of your luggage.

628
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,860
Do you have time now?

629
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,860
Let's talk in the office.

630
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,860
Okay.

631
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,860
Wait for me.

632
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,860
Li Quan, you're here.

633
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,860
Where's Wang Zhen?

634
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,860
Li Quan,

635
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,860
I've been running around.

636
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,860
I bought it on the way back.

637
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,860
Have a try.

638
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,860
Thank you.

639
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,860
I'll replenish the sugar powder.

640
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,860
I'll increase the firepower.

641
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,860
Here.

642
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,860
I'll give you the rest.

643
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,860
I'll buy it.

644
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,860
Okay.

645
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,860
Okay.

646
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,860
Sweet, right?

647
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,860
Sweet.

648
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,860
It's so sweet.

649
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,860
And this.

650
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,860
The sour juice is really good for your eyes.

651
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,860
It's delicious.

652
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,860
Then I'll tell you later.

653
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,860
Right, Li Quan.

654
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,860
Do you have anything to do after work?

655
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,860
I'll treat you to dinner.

656
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,860
No, I have other plans.

657
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,860
Okay, okay.

658
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,860
See you next time.

659
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,860
See you.

660
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,860
Water.

661
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,860
Water.

662
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,860
I'm really sorry, Mr. Han.

663
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,860
I have something to do.

664
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,860
I won't see you off.

665
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,860
See you tonight.

666
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,860
Okay.

667
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,860
See you tonight.

668
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,860
Li Quan.

669
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,860
Mr. Li.

670
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,860
Where did you go?

671
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,860
I went to the convenience store.

672
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,860
I'm going to the convenience store.

673
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,860
I'm going to the convenience store.

674
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,860
Can you walk?

675
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,860
Yes.

676
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,860
I'll go to handle some things first.

677
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,860
I'll pick you up tonight.

678
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,860
I'll go to the dining room.

679
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,860
Auntie.

680
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,860
Why don't you sing a song for me?

681
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,860
Sing a song?

682
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,860
Then what should I sing?

683
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,860
You can sing whatever you want.

684
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,860
I'll sing the song Liu Yang He.

685
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,860
I'll sing you that song.

686
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,860
Okay.

687
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,860
Liu Yang He.

688
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,860
Play the national anthem.

689
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,860
Yes.

690
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,860
I can't even get over it.

691
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,860
I'm dizzy.

692
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,860
Auntie, I think your voice is good after listening to you sing.

693
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,860
Yes.

694
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,860
We need to adjust the way of singing.

695
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,860
The way of singing?

696
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,860
We need to use the breath.

697
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,860
Breath?

698
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,860
Yes.

699
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,860
We need to use the breath of the abdomen.

700
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,860
The abdomen?

701
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,860
Like this.

702
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,860
Mi Mi Mi Mama.

703
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,860
Mi Mi Mi Mama.

704
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,860
Relax.

705
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,860
Mi Mi Mi Mama.

706
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,860
Up.

707
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,860
Mi Mi Mi Mama.

708
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,860
Up.

709
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,860
Mi Mi Mi Mama.

710
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,860
Relax.

711
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,860
Mi Mi Mi Mama.

712
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,860
Mom.

713
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,860
Mom.

714
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,860
Mom.

715
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,860
Are you okay?

716
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,860
Why are you here?

717
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,860
Miss Xiaomeng,

718
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,860
please drink some water.

719
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,860
Thank you, Auntie.

720
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,860
How do you know each other?

721
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,860
I've met her before.

722
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,860
I don't know her.

723
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,860
Why is she at home?

724
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,860
I don't know.

725
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,860
It's like this.

726
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,860
I didn't tell you.

727
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,860
Next month,

728
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,860
I'm going to participate in the singing competition.

729
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,860
This is my new student,

730
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,860
Mr. Sheng Yue,

731
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,860
who taught me to sing.

732
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,860
Miss Xiaomeng,

733
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,860
let me introduce you to him.

734
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,860
He's my son, Lu Ling Jia.

735
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,860
Don't look at him like that.

736
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,860
He's handsome.

737
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,860
He's a little bit cute.

738
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,860
It's okay, Auntie.

739
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,860
I understand.

740
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,860
It's probably because

741
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,860
Mr. Lu hasn't seen me for a long time.

742
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,860
He's happy.

743
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,860
He's a good singer.

744
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,860
Right?

745
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,860
Hi, Mr. Lu.

746
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,860
What are you doing?

747
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,860
Why didn't you say hello?

748
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,860
Why didn't you listen to me?

749
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,860
I didn't say hello.

750
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,860
I was in the hurry.

751
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,860
What are you talking about?

752
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,860
Do you want to buy a phone?

753
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,860
He's so...

754
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,860
Hello.

755
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,860
Well,

756
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,860
go and cut some fruit for us.

757
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,860
We've been practicing for a long time.

758
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,860
I'm hungry.

759
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,860
Didn't Liu Yi come?

760
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,860
He's making it up.

761
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,860
No, you...

762
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,860
Auntie,

763
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,860
where's your kitchen?

764
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,860
I'll go get it.

765
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,860
No, no.

766
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,860
How can you do it by yourself?

767
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,860
No need.

768
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,860
Go.

769
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,860
I'm sick.

770
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,860
Why did you get sick?

771
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,860
You're not pregnant.

772
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,860
You haven't married your wife yet.

773
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,860
You forgot your wife.

774
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,860
She's pregnant.

775
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,860
She's not pregnant.

776
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,860
It's okay.

777
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,860
Okay.

778
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,860
My queen.

779
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,860
I'll do it right now.

780
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,860
Stop.

781
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,860
Two more cups of fat.

782
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,860
Okay.

783
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,860
Go, go, go.

784
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,860
Mr. Xiaomeng,

785
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,860
my son is very filial.

786
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,860
He's not very kind.

787
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,860
You're so humorous.

788
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,860
I'll have some water first.

789
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,860
Then I'll have some more water.

790
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,860
Then you can take some time

791
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,860
to know me.

792
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,860
I'll be very kind.

793
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,860
Really?

794
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,860
Yes.

795
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,860
Mi Mi Mi.

796
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,860
Mom.

797
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,860
Are you boiling soup?

798
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,860
The smell seems to be gone.

799
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,860
Did I boil soup?

800
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,860
I forgot.

801
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,860
Hurry up.

802
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,860
Hurry up.

803
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,860
Turn off the fire.

804
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,860
What do you mean?

805
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,860
Didn't you see it?

806
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,860
Didn't she want to talk to you?

807
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,860
Didn't she say she could come here?

808
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,860
What's the matter?

809
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,860
Later,

810
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,860
help her.

811
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,860
Help me with the WeChat on the way to the factory.

812
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,860
What a liar.

813
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,860
No, no, no.

814
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,860
Don't misunderstand.

815
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,860
I don't like her.

816
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,860
I only discuss things with her.

817
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,860
My son is young.

818
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,860
I'm not a good son.

819
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,860
I'm not a good son.

820
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,860
I'm not a good son.

821
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,860
I'm young.

822
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,860
I'm a good son.

823
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,860
I'm not a good son.

824
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,860
I'm not a good son.

825
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,860
I'm not a good son.

826
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,860
I'm not a good son.

827
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,860
Well,

828
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,860
I'm so confused.

829
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,860
Miss Xiaomeng.

830
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,860
Bye.

831
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,860
Bye, auntie.

832
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,860
Miss Xiaomeng.

833
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,860
Are you still not playing with my son's WeChat?

834
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,860
You two add a WeChat.

835
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,860
In this case,

836
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,860
he'll be fine if you trouble him.

837
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,860
No need, auntie.

838
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,860
It's okay.

839
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,860
Don't be polite.

840
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,860
Add a WeChat.

841
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,860
Add a WeChat.

842
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,860
Okay.

843
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,860
Come on.

844
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,860
Well...

845
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,860
Please scan it.

846
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,860
Okay.

847
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,860
Thank you, auntie.

848
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,860
You're welcome.

849
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,860
You can pass it.

850
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,860
By the way, Miss Xiaomeng.

851
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,860
When you're on the live broadcast,

852
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:21,860
tell me.

853
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,860
I'll go to your live room to support you.

854
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,860
I'll help you defeat the poachers.

855
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,860
And the apple.

856
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,860
And the...

857
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,860
Mi.

858
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,860
Mi.

859
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,860
Mi.

860
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,860
Is Xiaomeng looking for a place?

861
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,860
Yes.

862
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,860
Mom.

863
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,860
Mom.

864
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,860
Mom.

865
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,860
She's leaving.

866
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,860
Oh, right.

867
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,860
Sorry.

868
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,860
It's okay.

869
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,860
Yes, auntie.

870
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,860
That person.

871
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,860
Miss Lu.

872
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,860
Miss Lu.

873
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,860
Lu Xiaoxiao.

874
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,860
Okay.

875
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,860
Your mom promised you.

876
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,860
She won't admit it.

877
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,860
Yes.

878
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

879
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,860
I'm afraid that

880
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,860
I'll be too lazy to be with you.

881
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,860
I'm afraid that

882
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,860
I'll be too lazy to be with you.

883
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,860
I'm afraid that

884
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:12,860
I'll be too lazy to be with you.

885
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,860
I'm afraid that

886
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,860
I'll be too lazy to be with you.

887
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,860
I'm afraid that

888
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:23,860
I'll be too lazy to be with you.

889
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,860
I'm afraid that

890
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,860
I'll be too lazy to be with you.
