1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to pass through the water

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Even if I encounter a miracle

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll be lost in the mist

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the mist

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I can't see the crowd

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to go to the end of my life

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Forget the original self

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to go to the end of the road

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sure I won't hesitate

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll remember the future

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm afraid of the unwavering courage

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I want to go to the end of the road

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But I won't give up

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll always believe in the miracle

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Even if I'm lost in the mist

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Han Tian, how much flour do you need?

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
A little flour

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A little flour

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, this is a small gap in your thin teeth

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't think about it when it's solved

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay, just do it

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay, Miss Xin

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hello, Mr. Su

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Miss Xin

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Huang Weiwei has come to the Li's Bureau

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The action is quite fast

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Miss Xin, it's my fault

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I didn't talk well at the beginning

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I didn't talk well at the beginning

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I didn't talk well at the beginning

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But I didn't think he would be a bad person

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's okay

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's good that the new person is gone

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't be too shy

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Sit down

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Miss Xin, what should we do?

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Although he's the one who took the initiative to resign

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I think we should compensate him for his kindness

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But the business ban in the labor contract

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Must be delayed

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I see

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Miss Xin, I think you're really different from before

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why different?

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you were before

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You would have hesitated and hesitated

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But now you are so weak

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Enough, don't wear high-skirt

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm serious

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
There are people outside the rules

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But this person must be used to the right person

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Otherwise, it's a bad person

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
There's nothing good about the management company

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I see

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
How do I feel

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Your sofa-like appearance

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's like Han Zong

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're not busy now, right?

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm busy

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Open the door

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Boss, Zhu Ouyi was taken away by the police

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The owner wants to rest

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He's investigating the situation

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I see

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You can leave now

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
There are thousands of employees

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's go

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Where are we going?

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
To eat with my girlfriend

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let's go

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Go

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm going to the hospital

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
No

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Have you got off work?

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm off work

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll come to you

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Should we talk down last?

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We'll see on the Dog- sharp

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Don't conflict with her in the future

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's clear that Han Ting is working as a model

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I will eat with you next time

87
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,360
That is Tan Yuni?

88
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,120
Yes.

89
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,640
you still know Dai Mingxing, Mr. Han?

90
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,600
What?

91
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,480
Did he get jealous?

92
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,840
He's a MostlyJoc

93
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:06,400
of the East

94
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,800
Item, a moving face person.

95
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,640
Never mind.

96
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,240
I believe you.

97
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,920
they discussed what happened in the orchestral próp日 press conference.

98
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,280
They told me the促产

99
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,480
got a relationship

100
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,280
with assistant general.

101
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,560
Here.

102
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,720
What do you think about that case?

103
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,520
The ち sort of crackdown was bad luck.

104
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,040
Besides, the Vas started

105
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,680
and I remember.

106
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
souvenirs?

107
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,820
I know

108
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:58,820
although you

109
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,320
like them.

110
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,620
If one day

111
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,000
I have added

112
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
your own interests.

113
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,280
Will you do the same to me?

114
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,240
No.

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Are you afraid?

116
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,320
You've found it.

117
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,400
Is it pretty?

118
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It looks good.

119
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,000
You look good no matter what.

120
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's go.

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's go home.

122
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,000
What's wrong?

123
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,200
You've been staring at me?

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,960
Why am I laughing?

125
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:32,600
Men often get

126
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,920
canceled sex when they drive.

127
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:50,280
toا

128
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,780
She did not tell me

129
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,480
Y Ten

130
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,080
Xixi

131
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,560
you are my most important friend

132
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,560
I really don't want to lose you.

133
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,560
I really hope that you will come to our wedding.

134
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
So you are getting married?

135
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
Are you going?

136
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Yes.

137
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,560
I think I should marry you.

138
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
I will be with you.

139
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
What do you want to do tomorrow?

140
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,560
How can we live together?

141
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
What are you looking at?

142
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,560
This is the last time I will be with my parents.

143
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
That day was my eight years old birthday.

144
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,560
After they left,

145
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,560
I never had a birthday.

146
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
I will be with you.

147
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
I will be with you.

148
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Thank you, auntie.

149
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,560
Aunt,

150
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
Mom, you are happy to see the little poster.

151
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
Happy?

152
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,560
Let's go.

153
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,560
I will ask your dad to take a picture of you and the real poster.

154
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Okay, I want one of the poster.

155
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Sorry, Miss.

156
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
That one has been sold out.

157
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,560
My son is having a birthday today.

158
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
I wanted to buy one for him to give as a gift.

159
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Then, thank you.

160
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
I will take a look.

161
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Aunt, aunt.

162
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,560
I bought another one for you.

163
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
How can you be so embarrassed?

164
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
You can keep it.

165
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,560
I will take one.

166
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
Thank you, dear.

167
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
I will thank you for my son.

168
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
I am so embarrassed.

169
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
I will give you the money.

170
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,560
No, no.

171
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
Take it.

172
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,560
Aunt, don't be so polite.

173
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
I will give you the birthday gift.

174
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Wish him a happy birthday.

175
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Mrs. Shou Xin, are you ready?

176
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,560
Soon.

177
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,560
I have to dress up today.

178
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
Is it beautiful?

179
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Yes.

180
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Are you ready to win today's surprise?

181
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,560
So, what is a surprise?

182
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
Of course, I can't tell you.

183
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,560
You will close your eyes when you get in the car.

184
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
I will drive.

185
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,560
Just follow me.

186
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
Okay.

187
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
Let's go.

188
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Lily, Xiaomeng.

189
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
I will eat somewhere with Han Ding.

190
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
It's late.

191
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
You can go now.

192
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
See you at the bar later.

193
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
Why are you here?

194
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
Are you free?

195
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,560
I have a meeting later.

196
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
I will make an appointment with Mr. Xiao next time.

197
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,560
Don't rush.

198
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Bei Bei asked me to invite you.

199
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
Mrs. Lily.

200
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,560
Mrs. Lily, can you go with me to see the baby?

201
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,560
Other children have a baby mama with them.

202
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
Bei Bei doesn't want to have a baby mama with them.

203
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Mrs. Lily, can you come here?

204
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
Come in.

205
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Xiaomeng, I have something to do.

206
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
I won't go today.

207
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,560
Tell me something.

208
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,560
Have a good time.

209
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
Are you asleep?

210
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
No.

211
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Are you curious where we are going?

212
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,560
I believe you.

213
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
Listen to me.

214
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,560
I played a game in college.

215
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
It's called blinding.

216
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
It's a person closing his eyes

217
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
and being dragged away by another person.

218
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,560
All the emotions at that time

219
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
were exposed by the wireless.

220
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,560
The road was not familiar.

221
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,560
I was not familiar with it.

222
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
I played half of it.

223
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
I didn't dare to play.

224
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
Later...

225
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,560
What happened later?

226
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,560
I suddenly felt that

227
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
the road I was working on

228
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
was like you were holding me and walking on a blind path.

229
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,560
I was walking on a road that I wasn't familiar with.

230
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
There was no difference between the blindfold and the closed one.

231
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Then this time,

232
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
you won't play half of it, right?

233
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
I don't think so.

234
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
I was holding my person

235
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,560
and I didn't pay attention to it.

236
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,560
I stepped on it several times.

237
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
But following you,

238
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
I felt very comfortable.

239
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
Then you should be more careful about me later.

240
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,560
Don't worry.

241
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,560
I will protect you well.

242
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,560
I will make you feel comfortable.

243
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
I will protect you well.

244
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
I will protect you well.

245
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,560
Two more steps.

246
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Okay. You can open your eyes now.

247
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
Why did you bring me here?

248
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,560
I haven't taken good care of you.

249
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
Look.

250
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,560
This is the memory of the time when I shared it with you.

251
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,560
Look here.

252
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,560
This is...

253
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,560
This was taken by my parents when I was a kid.

254
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,560
I only found it when I was watching the photo at your house.

255
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
I gave it to you after you packed your bag.

256
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,560
My mom told me

257
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,560
that a little girl gave me a birthday gift.

258
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,560
So it was you.

259
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,560
Look.

260
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
It's so strange.

261
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
We've been through the same thing.

262
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
I've met your parents.

263
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Han Ting.

264
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
I will protect your happiness.

265
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
We won't let uncle and aunt worry about you.

266
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
I will protect you well.

267
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Go.

268
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,560
Let's go.

269
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Let's go to the hotel.

270
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
No.

271
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,560
I will take you to a place.

272
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Where are they?

273
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
I have told them.

274
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,560
I will pay the bill today.

275
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,560
They will have fun.

276
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
Okay.

277
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Let's go.

278
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Mr. Reich, Han Ting.

279
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,560
Happy birthday.

280
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Your stars are beautiful.

281
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,560
I would try to hasn't made it through for them.

282
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
It's good enough.

283
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
They'll feel sad if we don't make it here.

284
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,560
This is their village.

285
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,560
It has many things to do,

286
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,400
I've arranged it.

287
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,200
I'll have your help.

288
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,920
You're still talking?

289
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,280
It's all your fault.

290
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,240
I can't take it.

291
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,280
What's wrong?

292
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,800
The big master didn't come.

293
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,840
He asked us to have fun.

294
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,560
He even said he'd pay the bill.

295
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,560
No.

296
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,760
It's fine if Lily doesn't come.

297
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,840
Why is Xixing and Mr. Han not here?

298
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,680
They didn't come.

299
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,720
How can they live here?

300
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
They're not worth it.

301
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,640
She'll accompany you.

302
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:53,160
She is not

303
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,560
an old man now.

304
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,280
She documented her invece of an elder woman.

305
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,480
No, on the balcony.

306
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,360
Help me find it.

307
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:58,840
I'll get the medicine.

308
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,360
The balcony.

309
00:21:59,360 --> 00:21:59,840
Yes, yes.

310
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,640
Help me find it.

311
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,600
Wait a minute.

312
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,320
Don't wait for me.

313
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,960
Okay.

314
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,680
Wait for me.

315
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,240
You can't find it.

316
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,960
Let's find it in the kitchen.

317
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,560
Okay.

318
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,520
Fulin.

319
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,800
I didn't find it.

320
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Let's go to the hospital.

321
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,400
Let's go.

322
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,160
I'm fine.

323
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,320
Here.

324
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,880
What do you mean?

325
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:44,880
Xiaomeng.

326
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,040
Jin Ying grew up

327
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,360
in the bar.

328
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,840
It's the first time

329
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,280
she's done something serious.

330
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,280
I want to thank you.

331
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,880
You've been here to help me.

332
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,280
The name of this bar

333
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,440
is Sour Sweet.

334
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,960
I'm not a random person.

335
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,560
In my mind,

336
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,800
sour sweet

337
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,600
is the name of your dream.

338
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,800
Xiaomeng.

339
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,160
I...

340
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,640
Stop.

341
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,680
We're good friends.

342
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,600
If you think

343
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,480
we're not close enough,

344
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,600
I can be your sister.

345
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,160
No, no.

346
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,680
I'm your brother.

347
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,720
I'll be your brother.

348
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,200
Okay.

349
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,160
You understand me, right?

350
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,600
I'm leaving now.

351
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,760
Sour sweet.

352
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,560
Be my sister.

353
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,320
I'm done.

354
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,480
Sour sweet.

355
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,360
Don't think too much.

356
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,520
Why do I think of you?

357
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,120
Sour sweet.

358
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,320
Sour sweet.

359
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,200
Come.

360
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,960
Boss, Sour sweet.

361
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,640
Okay.

362
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,160
Sit.

363
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,720
This restaurant doesn't look very strange.

364
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,520
Don't look at this place.

365
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,600
Their wontons are delicious.

366
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,840
It's been so many years.

367
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,560
They've moved the shop.

368
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,120
Their restaurant is still open.

369
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,240
And

370
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,120
their chili is very fragrant.

371
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,680
Take your time.

372
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,480
It's so fragrant.

373
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,880
Because the boss

374
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,400
put in his own vinegar.

375
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,520
His own vinegar?

376
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,640
One by one,

377
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,880
the boss has high requirements for food.

378
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,960
He thinks the vinegar outside

379
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,040
can't give the taste he wants.

380
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,200
So he made it himself.

381
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,440
You're right.

382
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,160
Here, be careful.

383
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,080
Thank you.

384
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,840
Try it.

385
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,720
Thank you.

386
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,280
It's delicious.

387
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,840
But the taste is familiar.

388
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,600
It's delicious.

389
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,440
Did you bring Ye Xiao's restaurant?

390
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,040
I wanted to bring you something delicious.

391
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,640
You must be feeling better.

392
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,480
Boss Han is so stubborn.

393
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,280
I forgot to add chili.

394
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,040
Here.

395
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,440
Is it enough?

396
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,400
A little more.

397
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:50,800
Okay.

398
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,680
One more spoon.

399
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,200
More?

400
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,480
Although the wonton is delicious,

401
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,240
I never thought

402
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,320
the East Medical President

403
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,840
would like the wonton.

404
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,680
It's like my safe house.

405
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,120
Safe house?

406
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,560
I feel bad

407
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,920
when my parents died.

408
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,600
I don't want to go home.

409
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,680
Sometimes I went to school

410
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,240
and took my driver away.

411
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,040
I walked all by myself.

412
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,800
I got here.

413
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
I was hungry.

414
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,240
I didn't have money.

415
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,920
The boss gave me a bowl of wonton.

416
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,760
I thought

417
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,000
this was the most delicious food in the world.

418
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,880
After that,

419
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,440
I would come here every time I went back.

420
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,800
No matter how bad the weather is,

421
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,280
as long as you eat a bowl of wonton,

422
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,400
everything will be fine.

423
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,080
I was not sad or happy

424
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,720
when I was young.

425
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,440
I wanted to tell the whole world.

426
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,080
Later, I found that

427
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,160
when you share your emotions,

428
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,480
you will be happy when you are happy.

429
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,200
What's sad is not so sad.

430
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,560
So,

431
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,040
you don't have to come here alone

432
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,320
to laugh at the weather.

433
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,360
You can tell me.

434
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,360
I will tell you.

435
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,360
I will tell you.

436
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,360
I will tell you.

437
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,360
I will tell you.

438
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,360
I will tell you.

439
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,360
I will tell you.

440
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
I will tell you.

441
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,360
I will tell you.

442
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,360
I will tell you.

443
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,360
I will tell you.

444
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,360
I will tell you.

445
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,360
I will tell you.

446
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,360
I will tell you.

447
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,360
I will tell you.

448
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
I will tell you.

449
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,360
I will tell you.

450
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,360
I will tell you.

451
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,360
I will tell you.

452
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,360
I will tell you.

453
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,360
I will tell you.

454
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
I will tell you.

455
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
I will tell you.

456
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,360
I will tell you.

457
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,360
I will tell you.

458
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,360
I will tell you.

459
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
I will tell you.

460
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,360
I will tell you.

461
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
I will tell you.

462
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Do you remember the first time

463
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
you met Dr. Yun and Xiaobai?

464
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Of course.

465
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
Today, I met Yu Zhen.

466
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,360
My parents were in the car accident.

467
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,360
Because the medical resources were low,

468
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,360
they didn't have the emergency conditions.

469
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,360
They missed the best time to save.

470
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
I always thought

471
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,360
if the medical resources were better,

472
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
would they not leave?

473
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
So when you were in college,

474
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
you chose to be a medical student.

475
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,360
Later, I became a doctor at the time.

476
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
Actually, the reason is the same.

477
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,360
Although I had a regret in the past,

478
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,360
I couldn't make up my mind.

479
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,360
At least later,

480
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,360
no one would be like my parents,

481
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,360
who missed the time to save and lose their lives.

482
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,360
Uncle and Aunt will be proud of you.

483
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
OK.

484
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,360
How do I care about slashh betrothal?

485
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,360
Tray betrayals are bound to be filled with Wow.

486
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,360
The image of mutual safety and harmony

487
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,360
with the aesthetic of wars.

488
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
From now on,

489
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
I am with you

490
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,360
for every birthday.

491
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
OK.

492
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,360
I'll handle them.

493
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,520
You're so mean.

494
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,600
Be google slept.

495
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,280
I should go back.

496
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,920
Happy to see you.

497
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,760
Thank you.

498
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,360
I'm doing this for Bei Bei, not for you.

499
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
You don't have to thank me.

500
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,360
Li Li.

501
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,360
I know I did something bad to make you angry.

502
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,360
But you came to see me today.

503
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
I didn't hide anything.

504
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,360
I only have Bei Bei in my life.

505
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,360
I'm very grateful that you can be in my life.

506
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,360
Really.

507
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,360
Really.

508
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,360
I will work hard to open my life to you.

509
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,360
My phone password is 375261.

510
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,360
You are the one who is in contact with the police.

511
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,360
You are so good at making people laugh.

512
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,360
You are so good at making people laugh.

513
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,360
Because you are sincere, that's why you are useful.

514
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,360
Now I can't be angry anymore.

515
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,360
Look at your performance.

516
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,360
Come here.

517
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,360
Come here.

518
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,360
What is this?

519
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,360
This is your birthday gift.

520
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,360
A light card.

521
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,360
A sleeping pill card.

522
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
A cooking card.

523
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
A swimming card.

524
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
A cooking card.

525
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,360
A pizza card.

526
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,360
You can have a pizza with this card.

527
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,360
Pizza with what?

528
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,360
A heart-shaped decision.

529
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,360
You are giving me a gift.

530
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,360
I am wearing a private goods.

531
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
I am wearing a private goods.

532
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
Not only this.

533
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Besides,

534
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
you are giving me a gift.

535
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,360
Isn't it?

536
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,360
That's right.

537
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,360
Okay.

538
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
Thank you for your gift.

539
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
I like it.

540
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,360
You are welcome.

541
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,360
Where are you going?

542
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,360
Put it in my safe cabinet.

543
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
What is this safe cabinet for?

544
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
It is very important to me.

545
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,360
You can use this card now.

546
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,360
Are you sure you want to lock it?

547
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,360
Yes.

548
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,360
I should use this benefit.

549
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
What do you want to use now?

550
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,360
First,

551
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,360
I want to use

552
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,360
a special power for my boyfriend.

553
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,360
Use it again.

554
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,360
An Ting, you...

555
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
Did you catch me?

556
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,360
Yes.

557
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,360
An Ting.

558
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,360
Wait a minute.

559
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
Go to the bathroom.

560
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,360
This bar's name is

561
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,360
Sour Sweet.

562
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,360
I am not an ordinary person.

563
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,360
In my mind,

564
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,360
sour sweet is the lemon.

565
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,360
Xiaomeng.

566
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,360
Gaju.

567
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,360
We are good friends.

568
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,360
We are good friends.

569
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
We are good friends.

570
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,360
We are good friends.

571
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
I am sorry.

572
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,360
We are good friends.

573
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,360
If you think we are not close enough,

574
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,360
I can be your sister.

575
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,360
I am sorry.

576
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,360
Qiu Zifeng and Shao Yicheng's wedding is going to be held.

577
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
It should be.

578
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,360
Are you going?

579
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,360
If you want to be there, I won't go.

580
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,360
I am going.

581
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,360
It's nothing.

582
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,360
I will bless her.

583
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,360
Are you going with Han Ting?

584
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,360
Of course.

585
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
I am going to the secret wedding.

586
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
Are you going with me?

587
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
It's an honor.

588
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,360
What are you going to wear that day?

589
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
It's not fixed yet.

590
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,360
What's wrong?

591
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
What's wrong?

592
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,360
I will cooperate with you

593
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,360
if you want to wear it.

594
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
You are so beautiful.

595
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
Let's go.

596
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,360
Shang.

597
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
Is it true that you wrote it?

598
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,360
This is not the kind of person.

599
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,360
What kind of person is he?

600
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
Mr. Li.

601
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
Mr. Ji.

602
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,360
Why is there no water?

603
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
No water.

604
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,360
Uncle.

605
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
What's the matter?

606
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
Nothing.

607
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
It's just that Huang Weiwei

608
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,360
sent us a message

609
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,360
saying that his day is our tomorrow.

610
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,360
I know what he means.

611
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,360
He wants to make everyone happy.

612
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,360
I am sure he wants to remember it.

613
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360
But...

614
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,360
others are affected by it.

615
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,360
You are the original owner of the company.

616
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,360
You must know the person who sent it.

617
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,360
Some things are not easy to say.

618
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,360
You are better than us.

619
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
We are all on the same boat.

620
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,360
If Huang Weiwei

621
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,360
is a new boatman,

622
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,360
it's not a good thing for anyone.

623
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,360
Besides,

624
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,360
the day is a day to borrow people's hearts.

625
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,360
There is no perfect boss in the world.

626
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,360
Mr. Ji has done a good job.

627
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
I understand.

628
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,360
Go back to work.

629
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
Go back to work.

630
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,360
It's Huang Weiwei.

631
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,360
He sent us a message saying that

632
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
he wants to make everyone happy.

633
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,360
Don't go to your heart.

634
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,360
Everyone believes you and not him.

635
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,360
I didn't expect this to be so serious.

636
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,360
I must deal with this matter

637
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,360
seriously

638
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,360
or I will be in trouble.

639
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,360
Sister Xing.

640
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Sister Li.

641
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,360
Xiao Zhong saw the article.

642
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,360
I sent it to him.

643
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,360
You can have a look.

644
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
Look.

645
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,360
I was the most trusted partner

646
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,360
in the company.

647
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,360
I was deceived and cleaned the floor.

648
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,360
The article is too much.

649
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,360
The people in this article are so...

650
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,360
I will go to the public relations company

651
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,360
to make a statement.

652
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,360
No need.

653
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
I just want to have fun.

654
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,360
Who doesn't know how to write?

655
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
It's almost night.

656
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,360
Don't be too sad.

657
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,360
I'm standing by your side.

658
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,360
You can have a rest.

659
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,360
I will give you some information.

660
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,360
Xing Xing.

661
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
I'm done with my work.

662
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,360
If you don't finish it,

663
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,360
you can give me another part.

664
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,360
No need.

665
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,360
You can have a meal.

666
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
I'll handle it together.

667
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,360
Okay.

668
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,360
I'll stay with you for a while.

669
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,360
No need.

670
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,360
I'll handle the food and the oil.

671
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
Okay.

672
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,360
I'll stay with you for a while.

673
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,360
תinta

674
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,360
However many people don't based on your job,

675
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,360
I've already gone through the audacity.

676
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,360
Maybe it's better you are my assistant.

677
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,360
How?

678
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:53,920
Yes.

679
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,560
Will this affect the winter clothes?

680
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,600
No.

681
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,680
Don't worry.

682
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,880
You have to deal with this matter.

683
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,560
It will pass soon.

684
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,840
Don't be impulsive.

685
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,520
And don't make any memories.

686
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,200
The truth is not like that.

687
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,400
What do you want to do?

688
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,200
Don't worry.

689
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,000
I'll find a way to deal with it.

690
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,320
I believe you.

691
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,200
I'll hang up.

692
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,080
Tell them to have a meeting in three minutes.

693
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,360
Okay.

694
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:50,880
Mr. Ji,

695
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,160
why don't we find someone to explain the official report?

696
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:53,920
No.

697
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,880
We have something else to send.

698
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,960
Mr. Ji, what are we going to send?

699
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,840
We'll start the official report of Xing Chen Technology

700
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,360
and publish our product advertisement.

701
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,400
But will we be scolded when we make an advertisement?

702
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,480
Huang Weiwei used such a long uniform

703
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,760
to describe himself

704
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,720
and other outstanding staff

705
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,400
to work harder and work hard

706
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,960
to achieve great achievements.

707
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,680
Isn't this praising Xing Chen?

708
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,640
We can completely change this crisis

709
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,640
and become a chance to win.

710
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,680
We only care about the passion

711
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,080
and promote our products.

712
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,440
Soon,

713
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,080
we will have a judgment.

714
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,360
I agree.

715
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,480
What do you think?

716
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,600
I agree.

717
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,400
Then move it.

718
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,000
Change the crisis.

719
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,000
Sister Xing,

720
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:42,920
come to the official report.

721
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,760
We'll start it later.

722
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,280
Okay.

723
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,640
Then I'll start writing the report.

724
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,720
Find the professional friends

725
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,760
to help me to figure out the title.

726
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,640
The quality of the software

727
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,920
is much better than it.

728
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,120
I think we should discuss

729
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,280
the title of this article.

730
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,880
The title is the first step in the eyes of the professional.

731
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,560
Yes.

732
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,280
Many people have

733
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,560
a lot of titles to write.

734
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,200
That's right.

735
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,240
But there are also titles.

736
00:41:59,360 --> 00:41:59,760
The title is...

737
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,160
Yes.

738
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:00,800
The company of the company.

739
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,160
You know,

740
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,400
you can write all the titles.

741
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:02,920
The title is...

742
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,040
Think about the title.

743
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,320
The technology of Xingchen

744
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:32,880
and Zhen gitu

745
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,120
Akr� Hua

746
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,320
here on the server

747
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,840
そん係

748
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,320
Fruit

749
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:47,240
Zheng

750
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,640
Too many great works of knowledge

751
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,640
Our goal and intention

752
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,640
is to let everyone have their own way.

753
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,640
Let the medical treatment

754
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,640
be used in ordinary people.

755
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,640
Even if the starlight is weak,

756
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,640
it can be brightened.

757
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,640
I'm not sure if I can do it.

758
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,640
I'm not sure.

759
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,640
I'm not sure.

760
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,640
I'm not sure.

761
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,640
I'm not sure.

762
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,640
