This is just a little incident

OK. Just follow this.

OK, Xing.

33
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,990
Hi, Mr. Su.

34
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,710
Xing.

35
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,560
Huang Weiwei is here

36

for the resignation procedures.

37
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,520
She's fast.

38
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,800
Xing, I'm to blame.

39
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,710
I talked without thinking.

40
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,910
I didn't know she would misunderstand it

41
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,800
and use it against us.

42
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,960
It's OK.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,030
It's good that someone
of a different mind is gone.

what shall we do?

48
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,150
She offered to resign.

49
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,630
But we'll still give her

50
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,590
the ordinary compensation.

must be confirmed.

54
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,360
Got it.

55
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,270
Oh, Xing.

56
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,560
I think you're not what you used to be.

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,120
How?

58
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,120
The old you

59
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,430
would hesitate and fail to decide.

60
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,960
But now,

61
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,470
you're decisive and authoritative.

62
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,150
Come on. Don't flatter me.

63
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,470
I mean what I say.

64
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,030
There are human feelings out of regulations.

65
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,960
But the feelings must be used

66
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,360
for the right guys.

67
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,840
Or I'd be a softy.

68
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,430
It does no good

69
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,320
to the company's management.

70
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,870
I understand.

71
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,680
Why do I feel

72
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,630
you look as resolute

73
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,680
as Mr. Han?

74
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,840
No work to do, huh?

75
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,920
I'll go back to work.

76
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,470
Keep the door open.

77
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,960

His company has ceased production

84
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,870

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,840
I get it.

86
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,360
You knock off now.

87
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,590
OK.

Let's go.

92
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,360
Where are we going?

93
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,950
To have dinner together.

94
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,640
Come on.

Yes. I'm coming to you.

99
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,070
He's really ruthless.

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,750
You see how Zhu Houyu ends up, huh?

101
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,190
Don't fight against him.

102
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,560
Actually, Han Ting went his own way

103
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,750
and disobeyed us.

104
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,950
What? Fooling us?

105
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,120
It's a deal, then.

106
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,270
Let's dine out another day.

107
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,950
That's Tan Yuni?

108
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,270
Yes.

109
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,750
Oh, you even know a superstar.

110
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,750
What? Getting jealous?

111
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,390
She's the ambassador

112
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,240
of our social activities.

113
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,950
You don't need to explain anything.

114
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
I trust you.

115
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,560
Oh,

116
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,870
I just heard

117
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,000
some directors talk

118
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,720
about Zhu Houyu.

119
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,270
They said you were behind

120
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,040
the bankruptcy of his company.

121
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,150
Come on.

122
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,440
Sit.

123
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,560
What do you think?

124
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,160
He offered huge bribes

125
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,270
and deserved a severe sentence.

126
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,820
And last time, he made you drink

127
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,890
and caused your alcohol allergy.

128
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,830
I've kept all that in mind.

129
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,310
So revengeful?

130
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,630
Zhu Houyu got what he deserved.

131
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,630
But thousands of his employees

132
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,600
are innocent.

133
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,310
You think I'm merciless?

134
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,630
If one day,

135
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,680
I also hurt your interest,

136
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,120
will you also do this to me?

137
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,270
I won't.

138
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,870
You changed your lip color?

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,270
You noticed that.

140
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,320
How does it look?

141
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,390
Pretty.

142
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,120
You're always pretty.

143
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,320
Let's go home.

144
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,720
What? Why do you stare at me?

145
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,030
When a man drives carefully,

146
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,870
he looks so cool.

Xing, you're my most important friend.

150
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,960
I really don't want to lose you.

151
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,360
I sincerely hope

152
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,550
you can come to our wedding.

153
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,510
Shao Yichen is getting married?

154
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,990
Will you go?

155
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,440
I should go, I think.

156
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,750
I'll go with you.

157
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,270
What would you like to do tomorrow?

158
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,150
As long as I stay with you,

159
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,480
anything will do.

160
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
What are you looking at?

161
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,630
This is my last photo

162
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,720
with my parents.

163
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,320
That was my eighth birthday.

164
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,120
Since they passed away,

165
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,910
I've never celebrated my birthday.

166
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,910
I'm here for you.

167
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,120
Thanks, madam.

168
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,720
Look, Mom. The limited edition baby seals.

169
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,870
Happy, huh?

170
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,080
Let's go.

171
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,120
I'll have your father

172
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,750
- take a photo of you and the real seal.
- Hi.

173
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,240
I'd like a toy seal, please.

174
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,360
Sorry, madam. They're sold out.

175
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,200
Today is my son's birthday.

176
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,480
I had planned to buy one

177
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,670
as his birthday present.

178
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,670
Thanks anyway.

179
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,590
I'll look around.

180
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,080
Hi, madam.

181
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,200
I bought one extra toy.

182
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,120
This is for you.

183
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,360
It's so nice of you.

184
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,320
You keep it for yourself.

185
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,200
One is enough for me.

186
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,080
Thank you, sweetheart.

187
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,870
I'd like to thank you for my son.

188
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
It's so sweet of you. I'll give you the money.

189
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,390
No need. It's not expensive.

190
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,230
Keep it.

191
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,000
You're welcome, madam.

192
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,630
Take it as my present

193
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,720
for your son's birthday.

194
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,390
Wish him a happy birthday.

195
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,720
My sweetheart,

196
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,150
are you ready to go?

197
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,750
In a minute.

198
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,550
I should dress up today.

199
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,560
How do I look?

200
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,870
Gorgeous.

201
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,390
Are you ready for today's surprise?

202
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,440
So,

203
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,670
what is the surprise?

204
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,960
In no way can I tell you about it.

205
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,120
When you get in the car,

206
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,030
close your eyes.

207
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,960
I'll drive and you just follow me.

208
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,350
OK.

209
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,040
Let's go.

210
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,080
Li Li, Xiaomeng,

211
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,440
I'm going somewhere with Han Ting.

212
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,000
We'll be late. You have fun first.

213
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,480
See you at the bar.

214
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,160
What are you doing here?

215
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,200
Are you available?

216
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,270
I have a party to attend.

217
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,150
Have an appointment early next time.

218
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,390
Don't rush to reject me.

219
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,390
Beibei asked me to invite you.

220
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,000
Miss Li Li.

221
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,150
Miss Li Li, can you go with me

222
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,550
to watch the puppet show?

223
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,480
Other kids

224
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,480
will go with their parents.

225
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,750
I don't want to have my father alone.

226
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,910
Miss Li Li, can you come over?

227
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,990
Come on in.

228
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,700
(Xing, Lemon, and Li)

229
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,440
(Li Li)
Xiaomeng, I have an emergency.

230
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,510
I'm not going today.

231
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,750
Tell Xing about it.

232
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,790
You have a good time.

233
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,510
You aren't asleep, are you?

234
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,840
No.

235
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,200
Aren't you curious about where we're going?

236
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,870
I trust you.

237
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,600
You know what? When I was in college,

238
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,870
I played a game named Blind Walking.

239
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,870
I closed my eyes

240
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,480
and someone else led me to walk.

241
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,480
At that time, all my senses

242
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,120
seemed to be infinitely magnified.

243
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,150
I wasn't familiar with that path.

244
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,840
Halfway, I didn't dare to continue.

245
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,350
Later...

246
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,790
What happened later?

247
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,150
I suddenly think.

248
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,720
Since I started my company,

249
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,910
you've been leading me

250
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,270
as if my eyes are closed.

251
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,870
Walking on this strange path

252
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
makes no difference

253
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,300
from groping with closed eyes.

254
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,790
This time,

255
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,080
will you not dare

256
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,150
to continue halfway?

257
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,360
I don't think so.

258
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,720
The one who led me was really careless.

259
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,150
I missed a step several times.

260
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,270
But when I follow you,

261
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,670
I feel calm.

262
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,600
Lead me carefully, then.

263
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,720
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

264
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,080
I'll make you feel calm, too.

265
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,960
Take a few more steps.

266
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,590
OK. Open your eyes.

267
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,720

We're not going there.

327
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,440
I'll take you somewhere else.

328
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,350
What about the other guys?

329
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,350
I told them.

330
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,960
The whole treat is on me.

331
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,350
They'll have a great time.

332
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,430
OK.

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,430
Let's go.

334
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,030
Mr. Right Han Ting,

335
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,350
happy birthday.

336
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,830
Yours, Xing.

337
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,070
Awesome.

338
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,720
We're finally done decorating

339
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,390
before they arrive.

340
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,160
Glad you helped me.

341
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,880
Come on.

342
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,270
It's all your fault.

343
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,270
Unreliable man.

344
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,340
(Han Ting: We're not coming.
You guys have fun. The treat is on me.)

345
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,520
What's wrong?

346
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,790
They're not coming.

347
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,830
Han Ting asked us to have fun

348
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,510
and he would pay for everything.

349
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,750
Come on. It's OK that Li Li doesn't come.

350
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,960
Why will Xing and Mr. Han

351
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,880
not come, either?

352
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,680
In this case, how can we
celebrate his birthday?

353
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,790
The decoration is in vain.

354
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,380
(Mr. Right Han Ting,
happy birthday. Yours, Xing.)

355
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,310
Or it may not.

356
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,760
What?

357
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,960
Nothing.

358
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,310
Let's drink.

359
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,590
Come on.

360
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,190
What's wrong?

361
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,760
Oh, my back hurts.

362
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,160
- What's wrong?
- It hurts.

363
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,000
Sit down slowly.

364
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,000
Can you?

365
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,070
I guess

366
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,030
when I pull up the balloons,

367
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,070
I hurt my back.

368
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,550
Let's... Let's go to the hospital.

369
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,550
- Shall we?
- No, no, no.

370
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,350
I have some medicine at the bar.

371
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,270
Go get it for me.

372
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,200
- For sprain.
- Bar?

373
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,640
Yes. It's there. Get it for me.

374
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,510
Wait a minute here.

375
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,550
- Don't move.
- OK.

376
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,550
- OK.
- Wait for me.

377
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,920
If it's not at the bar, check the kitchen.

378
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,760
OK.

379
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,350
Lu Linjia.

380
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,640
I haven't found it. Let's go to the hospital.

381
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,480
Come on.

382
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,110
I'm fine.

383
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,960
What does this mean?

384
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,240
Xiaomeng,

385
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
running this bar

386
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,480
is the first thing

387
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,310
I've ever worked so seriously on.

388
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,510
I'd like to thank you

389
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,000
for accompanying and helping me.

390
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,480
The name of the bar

391
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,720
is Sour-Sweet.

392
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,240
I didn't name it casually.

393
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,880
In my mind, something sour-sweet

394
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,800
is the lemon.

395
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,750
- Xiaomeng.
- Stop.

396
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,720
We're good friends.

397
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,510
If you want us to be closer,

398
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,640
we can be sisters.

399
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,310
No, no, no.

400
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,910
Brother and sister.

401
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,840
We can be brother and sister.

402
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,310
You can get it, huh?

403
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,880
It's getting late. I should go.

404
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:17,830
Brother and sister.

405
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,480
It's a deal. We'll be brother and sister.

406
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,550
Brother and sister.

407
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,520
No more thinking.

408
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
Why did she think of that word?

409
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,340
(BRO)

410
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,200
Laosi Wonton Shop?

411
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,390
In you go.

412
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,880
Sir, two bowls of wonton.

413
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,000
- OK.
- Take your seat.

414
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,680
This wonton shop

415
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,720
looks unremarkable.

416
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,510
It's a small shop.

417
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,550
But wonton here tastes great.

418
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,960
Over all these years,

419
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,590
the neighboring shops have moved away.

420
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,110
Only this shop is still open.

421
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,390
And,

422
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,110
the chili here smells great.

423
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,950
Smell it.

424
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:32,630
Smells so good.

425
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,830
Because the owner

426
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,270
used some vinegar he made.

427
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,400
Vinegar he made?

428
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,750
Every kind of food has its flavor.

429
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,920
The owner has a high demand for food.

430
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,070
He thinks the vinegar that is sold

431
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,030
isn't the flavor he wants.

432
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,310
So, he makes the vinegar himself.

433
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,520
Fancy.

434
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
Come on. Be careful.

435
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,320
Thanks.

436
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,110
Taste it.

437
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,040
Thank you.

438
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,590
Really delicious.

439
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,960
The taste is so familiar.

440
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,070
You brought it to me last time, right?

441
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,720
I thought bringing you something delicious

442
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,440
would make you feel better.

443
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,160
It's thoughtful of you.

444
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,070
I forgot to add some chili.

445
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,150
Here.

446
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,350
Is it enough?

447
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,240
Some more.

448
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,800
OK.

449
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,350
One more scoop.

450
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,240
One more?

451
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,510
The wonton tastes good.

452
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,400
But I never knew

453
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,350
the CEO of Dongyang Medical

454
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,830
would love wonton.

455
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,680
This shop is like my safe house.

456
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,190
Safe house?

457
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,590
When my parents passed away,

458
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,000
I felt terrible.

459
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,680
I didn't want to go home.

460
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,790
One day after school,

461
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,240
I avoided my driver

462
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,200
and walked without a destination

463
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,830
until I came here.

464
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
I was hungry.

465
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,270
I didn't have any money.

466
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,030
The owner gave me
a free bowl of wonton noodles.

467
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,830
At that time, I thought

468
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,110
it was the most delicious food in the world.

469
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,960
Since then,

470
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,590
I've come here every time I'm back in China.

471
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,880
However bad I feel,

472
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,160
when I have some wonton,

473
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,480
I'll be all right.

474
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,830
When I was little, either I felt happy or sad,

475
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,510
I wanted to let the whole world know.

476
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,160
Later, I realized

477
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,110
when you shared your emotions,

478
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,480
your happiness would double

479
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,240
and your sadness would decline.

480
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,840
So,

481
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,070
you no longer need to come alone

482
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,440
to calm yourself down.

483
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,480
You can tell me about it.

484
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,070
Do you remember the first trip to a village

485
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,510
with Doctorcloud and Bay?

486
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,350
Of course. Qingtian Fishing Village.

487
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,200
That's where my parents had a car accident.

488
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,480
Due to the poor medical resources

489
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,320
in that village,

490
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,920
a first-aid wasn't available.

491
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,200
They missed the best operation time.

492
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,920
Later, I kept thinking.

493
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,720
If the medical resources

494
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,680
were much better,

495
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,160
would my parents not die?

496
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,200
So, in college,

497
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,680
you majored in medicine.

498
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,160
Later, I developed Doctorcloud

499
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,920
for the same reason.

500
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,160
The regrets about the past

501
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,350
can't be fixed,

502
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,200
but after that,

503
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,750
no one would be like my parents

504
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,680
who missed the rescue time

505
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,590
and lost their lives.

506
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,720
Your parents will be proud of you.

507
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,830
Wonton represents reunion and happiness.

508
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,160
You and I will celebrate

509
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,310
all your birthdays from now on.

510
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,310
I'll always be with you

511
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,590
for reunion.

512
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,670
OK.

513
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,560
Cheers.

514
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,590
Tastes so good.

515
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,680
Beibei is asleep.

516
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,350
I should go home.

517
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,880
Beibei was so happy to see you today.

518
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,150
Thank you.

519
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,790
I did that for Beibei,

520
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,510
not for you.

521
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,920
Don't say thank you.

522
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,000
Li Li.

523
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,830
I know

524
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,240
I was behaving so poorly

525
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,680
that I annoyed you.

526
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,680
But as you can see here,

527
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,960
I'm not keeping another woman.

528
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,000
Beibei is all that I have.

529
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,000
I appreciate it

530
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,200
when I have you in my life.

531
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,350
I'm serious.

532
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,480
I'll try harder

533
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,960
to open up my life to you.

534
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,680
The password of my phone

535
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,790
is 375261.

536
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,720
You're my emergency contact, too.

537
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,920
You have a lot of tricks to pamper a girl.

538
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,720
Quite experienced.

539
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,160
I'm saying this from my heart.

540
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,310
That's why it works.

541
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,920
No longer mad at me, huh?

542
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
It depends on what you do.

543
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,920
Come over.

544
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,910
What's this?

545
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,920
Your birthday present.

546
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,300
(Kiss Card, Forgiveness Card)

547
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,200
Kiss Card?

548
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,550
Sleep Late Card.

549
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,790
Cook Card.

550
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,070
Play Card.

551
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,070
Alarm Clock Card.

552
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,680
Pizza Cad.

553
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,510
When you use this card,

554
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,480
you can make Xing

555
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,830
buy you some pizza.

556
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,590
She decides

557
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,790
what pizza you'll eat.

558
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,480
You put in my present

559
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,880
what you want for yourself, huh?

560
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,110
I've put

561
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,510
more than that.

562
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,960
Anyway,

563
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,880
something good for me

564
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,270
is something good for you, isn't it?

565
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,590
It makes sense.

566
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:50,950
OK.

567
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,000
Thanks for your cards.

568
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,190
I love them.

569
00:31:59,070 --> 00:31:59,910
You're welcome.

570
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,350
Where are you going?

571
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,720
To put them in my safe.

572
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,550
What is this safe for?

573
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,590
Something very important.

574
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,070
You can use the cards now.

575
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,510
Are you sure you'll lock them up?

576
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,150
That's right.

577
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,030
I should make full use

578
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,960
of this great thing.

579
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,440
What card will you use first?

580
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,830
I'll use...

581
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,030
The boyfriend's privilege.

582
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,590
Let me use it again.

583
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,510
Han Ting, your beard...

584
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,030
Do you have a beard?

585
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,960
It pricks me.

586
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,830
Yes.

587
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,000
Oh, Han Ting.

588
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,310
Dahuang, go out and play.

589
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,400
The name of the bar

590
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,560
is Sour-Sweet.

591
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,030
I didn't name it casually.

592
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,480
In my mind, something sour-sweet

593
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,400
is the lemon.

594
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,760
Xiaomeng.

595
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,630
Stop.

596
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,030
We're good friends.

597
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,790
If you want us to be closer,

598
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,070
we can be sisters.

607
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,880
Will you go to the wedding
of Qiuzi and Shao Yichen?

608
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,800
Yes, I guess.

609
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,720
What about you?

610
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,400
If you feel embarrassed, I won't go.

611
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,480
I'll go.

612
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,880
It's nothing.

613
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,360
I'll give them my blessing.

Will you go with Han Ting?

615
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,430
Of course.

616
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,280
It's my best friend's wedding.

617
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,710
Will you go with me?

618
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,140
(Li Li)

619
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,320
With pleasure.

620
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,030
What are you going to wear that day?

(Li Li)
Haven't decided. Why?

623
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,510
Our outfits should match.

624
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,640
I'll dress like you do.

625
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,020
(Xiao Yixiao)

626
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,320
Control your expressions.

627
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,800
Let's get in.

628
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,400
Shang, it...

629
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,590
It can't be true, can it?

630
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,070
Miss Ji isn't that kind of person.

631
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,320
What kind of person is she, then?

632
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,070
Miss Li. Miss Ji.

633
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,480
Why is there no water?

634
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,200
Oops.

635
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,640
Tell me.

636
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,990
What happened?

637
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,590
Nothing, actually.

638
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,280
It's Huang Weiwei.

639
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,400
She texted every one of us,

640
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,960
saying we would

641
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,360
end up just like her.

642
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,320
I know why she did this.

643
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,670
She wanted to drive a wedge.

644
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,110
I trust Miss Ji.

645
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,320
But...

646
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,150
The rest of them

647
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,480
will be affected

648
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,480
more or less.

649
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,550
You're a founding member.

650
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,630
You know how good Miss Ji is.

651
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,760
It's not convenient for me to say something.

652
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,880
What you say will work best.

653
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,190
We're all in this together.

654
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,440
If an ungrateful guy like Huang Weiwei

655
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,510
ruins the whole company,

656
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,320
it'll be good for none of us.

657
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,320
And...

658
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,550
It takes time to see someone through.

659
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,960
There isn't a perfect boss in this world.

660
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,360
Miss Ji is doing really well.

661
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,030
Got it.

662
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,640
Get back to work.

663
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,400
It's Huang Weiwei.

664
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,510
She texted everyone

665
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,800
to stir things up.

666
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,110
Don't take it personally.

667
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,400
Everyone trusts you instead of her.

668
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,150
I didn't expect her case

669
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,320
to bring all that heat.

670
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,550
We have to handle this seriously.

671
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,920
Or our employees will hover.

672
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,510
Xing. Li.

673
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,230
Zhong read about a post.

674
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,260
I forwarded it to the group chat.

675
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,030
You check it.

676
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,960
We started a company together,

677
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,800
but my most trusted partner

678
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,590
deceived me and kicked me out?

679
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,960
This post is outrageous.

680
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,180
(She's too kind to say the name.)

681
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,260
(I know. Ji Xing of Xingchen.)

682
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,590
The comments are terrible.

683
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,710
I'll have a PR company
to release a statement.

684
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,870
No need.

685
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,190
It's just a long post.

686
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,480
I can write one, too.

687
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,280
She just won't stop, huh?

688
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,300
(Without doing a partner's job,
why could you get the partner's pay?)

689
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,340
(Xingchen offered Huang Weiwei
an above-market pay.)

690
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,860
(But she made a false countercharge.
Weakness is no excuse for that.)

691
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,980
(Perfidious and Ruthless, Comment)

692
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,710
Don't be too sad.

693
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,800
I'm on your side.

694
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,710
Bear with it now.

695
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,440
If something happens,

696
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,110
I'll let you know.

697
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,760
Xing, I'm done with my part.

698
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,840
If you're not done,

699
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,190
give me some of it.

700
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,320
No need. Email it to me.

701
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,320
I'll handle it together.

702
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,320
OK.

703
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,000
Shall I keep you company for a while?

704
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:36,910
Hello.

705
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,110
Are you OK?

706
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,190
You saw that?

707
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,510
Will it affect Dongyang Medical?

708
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,550
No. Don't worry.

709
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,710
Do nothing about this.

710
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,510
It'll be over soon.

711
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,800
Don't be impulsive

712
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,480
or respond to her.

713
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,110
But that isn't the truth.

714
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
What do you want to do?

715
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,120
Rest assured.

716
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,880
I'll handle it properly.

717
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
I trust you.

718
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,320
I'll hang up.

719
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,150
Tell everybody to have a meeting

720
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,070
in three minutes.

721
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,600
OK.

722
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,280
Miss Ji, shall we release a PR post

723
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,120
to explain this?

724
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,350
No.

725
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,000
We have something else to post.

726
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,070
Miss Ji, what will we post?

727
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,840
Open Xingchen's Official Account

728
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,480
and release our advertisements.

729
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,400
But if we advertise at this time,

730
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,550
will we be scolded?

731
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,550
Huang Weiwei used such a long post

732
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,880
to tell how hard

733
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,920
she and other founding members

734
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,550
have worked

735
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,000
and what great achievements they've made.

736
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,800
Isn't she just praising Xingchen?

737
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,510
We can totally turn

738
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,670
this crisis

739
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,710
into a marketing opportunity.

740
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,800
Let's take advantage of the popularity

741
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,150
to advertise our products.

742
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,590
As time goes by,

743
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,070
people will know the truth.

744
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,550
I agree.

745
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,550
What do you think, guys?

746
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,760
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

747
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,710
Let's move, then.

748
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,150
Turn the crisis into an opportunity.

749
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,000
Xing, shall we do the Official Account

750
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,480
- immediately?
- OK.

751
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,800
I'll draft the post now.

752
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,000
I'll consult professional friends
for the headline.

753
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,110
Then my post will be better than hers.

754
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,150
I think we should first discuss

755
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,440
the headline of this post.

756
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,070
A headline is what catches people's eye.

757
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,280
