1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,840
I can't say I'll ever be lost.

9
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:09,960
I want to fall into a dungeon,

10
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,660
to gain out my dream.

11
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,000
The seven realms of electricity mean to me.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,840
I become united,

13
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,760
losing the vow of love.

14
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,760
I will always believe in the miracle

15
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,760
Even if I don't know who I am

16
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Sorry, I have paid your money

17
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,760
What are you talking about?

18
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,760
I just told you not to be stressed

19
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
Your company is not in the business

20
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,760
I'm waiting for your salary to fly with me

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
Don't think so much

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,760
Are you hungry?

23
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,760
I will buy you something to eat

24
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,760
You can rest by yourself

25
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
I will buy you a drink

26
00:02:51,760 --> 00:03:11,760
Hello, Yichen

27
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760
Xing Xing

28
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,760
What happened at home?

29
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,760
My dad helped others to earn money

30
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,760
He also made a return to the government

31
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,760
He also made a return to the government

32
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,760
But it's okay

33
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,760
Did you help your friend?

34
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
It's solved

35
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
Sorry

36
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
I am fine

37
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
I understand

38
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,760
I will take care of the rest of the family

39
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
I will go now

40
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
Take a rest

41
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,760
I will go now

42
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,760
I am sorry

43
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Boss, Miss Ji is discharged

44
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Don't worry, Xing Xing is still sleeping

45
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,760
Right, Li, how is your work?

46
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,760
Li Li is discharged

47
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,760
Xing Xing, why are you up so early?

48
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,760
I will ask

49
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,760
Li Li, did Miss Wu contact you?

50
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,760
What are you talking about?

51
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,760
Miss Wu is my fault

52
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,760
I don't want to do it

53
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
What does it have to do with you?

54
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,760
Sorry

55
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,760
I didn't expect that thing to affect you so much

56
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Don't worry about yourself

57
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,760
Why do you always give yourself so much pressure?

58
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,760
Why are you up so early?

59
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
Go to bed and rest

60
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,760
I will hang up

61
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
Don't worry, Li

62
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,760
He has a lot of trouble to dig it

63
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,760
Go to the washroom

64
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,760
You just finished the bottle yesterday

65
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
The doctor said you have to rest

66
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
I can't rest

67
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,760
There are many things in the company

68
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
You have to rest and rest

69
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,760
You know, I finished the bottle

70
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
Hello, Mr. Liu

71
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,760
I am the reporter of Xing Chen Technology

72
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,760
We talked about it before

73
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,760
We talked about it before

74
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,760
As long as we can make a print, we will guarantee that the model product will be made

75
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,760
We have made the three models of the model product

76
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
We have made it

77
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,760
We can do anything

78
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,760
If you need anything, we can send it to you

79
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Even if the time is a little late

80
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,760
I will go to you to talk to you later

81
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
You can talk to your share

82
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
We have sincerity

83
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,760
Okay, I will wait for your time

84
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Sorry, I disturbed you, Mr. Zhou

85
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,760
You can go to the washroom

86
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,760
You can talk to your share

87
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
Mr. Jin, rest early

88
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,760
Thank you

89
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Xiaoshan

90
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,600
I'll help you.

91
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,680
Don't worry.

92
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,960
Mr. Ji,

93
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,760
I believe you and Su

94
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,080
will be in a difficult position

95
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,440
when you're in the business.

96
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
I understand.

97
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,720
Don't worry.

98
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,120
I don't have any pressure.

99
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,440
I have enough money.

100
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,000
You and Su

101
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,080
should take a rest.

102
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,680
After all,

103
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,160
you're the one who's got a life.

104
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,240
I can't help you

105
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,920
with the financing.

106
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,080
But I'll try to think of a way.

107
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,480
I believe we'll be in a difficult position

108
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,800
when we're in the business.

109
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,680
We will.

110
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,520
Thank you, Xiaoshan.

111
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,440
I'll go back first.

112
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,760
Take a rest.

113
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,320
Make him pay

114
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,280
It's possible for invest man to contact this girl.

115
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,480
Yang,

116
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,080
how about

117
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
we do the proposal

118
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,760
ofiosl any idea?

119
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
I don't have any product.

120
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,520
If we can talk about it,

121
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,720
it can also achieve our dream.

122
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,600
Actually, I think

123
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,400
although we don't have

124
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,520
a big talk with Mr. Han,

125
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,920
we don't have to

126
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
take such a big pressure at the same time.

127
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,400
Hello.

128
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,120
Hello.

129
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,880
Is it Ji Xing?

130
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,640
Yes. Who are you?

131
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,640
I'm Han Yuan from Duoyang Technology.

132
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,920
Can we meet tomorrow morning?

133
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,600
Yes.

134
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,960
Mr. Yuan, they're here.

135
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,840
Mr. Yuan.

136
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,600
Mr. Yuan.

137
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,400
Boss, Mr. Yuan is meeting Miss Ji.

138
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
If she's a smart person,

139
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,720
she won't accept Han Yuan's investment.

140
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,280
Boss,

141
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,880
I think Miss Ji

142
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,640
has entered the final stage.

143
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,640
If she doesn't accept the investment,

144
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,920
the company will be bankrupt.

145
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,120
I'm worried...

146
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,680
The investment and the back investment

147
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,960
are both options.

148
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,880
If we can make her lose her judgment

149
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
by this little pressure,

150
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
I won't use her investment.

151
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,080
She won't succeed in the future.

152
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,680
Why don't we give up earlier

153
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,880
and not be so miserable?

154
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,480
But once Yuan invests in her,

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,680
she'll stand in your team.

156
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,480
By then,

157
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,680
you'll have to kill Xing Chen.

158
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,280
Let's go to the gate.

159
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,280
I've read the information about Xing Chen.

160
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,680
The content is mature and thoughtful.

161
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
The investment department said

162
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
you've finished the model product

163
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,080
very quickly.

164
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,280
You're excellent.

165
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,080
Thank you for your firm's support.

166
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,280
I'm very optimistic about your company's future.

167
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,080
I want to cooperate with you.

168
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,480
We also want to cooperate with Mr. Yuan.

169
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,480
What's your idea about the investment?

170
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
One million dollars.

171
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
One million dollars?

172
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,480
Yes.

173
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
I'm very proud of you.

174
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
I'm very proud of you.

175
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,280
One million dollars is 15% of the stock.

176
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
We hope the investors

177
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,680
can trust Xing Chen completely

178
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
and don't interfere too much

179
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,680
with the content of Xing Chen.

180
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,680
You don't want to take it directly, do you?

181
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,480
Okay, I agree.

182
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,280
But I want to invest two million dollars,

183
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,480
33.4% of the stock.

184
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,280
After all, if the development is good,

185
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,880
there may be more investment.

186
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,880
15% of the stock is too little.

187
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,880
Don't worry.

188
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,280
The 33.4% of the stock

189
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,480
is not for me.

190
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,280
If I find

191
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,480
excellent developers or team members in the future,

192
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,880
I need the stock to attract them.

193
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,480
Do you have any concerns about Miss Ji?

194
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,680
Mr. Yuan, I just want to confirm

195
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,280
whether Xing Chen's creative team

196
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,480
will be replaced by the future.

197
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,080
Well,

198
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,480
we've talked too much.

199
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,080
Besides,

200
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,480
do you have any confidence in your team?

201
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,680
Of course I have.

202
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,480
But I need time to think about it.

203
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,480
I understand.

204
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,480
But I like speed battle and speed match.

205
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,280
I'm interested in this field recently.

206
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,280
Of course,

207
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
the company is not just your family.

208
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,880
If you're willing,

209
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,480
I'll give you a correct answer tomorrow morning.

210
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,480
I believe you're smart people

211
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,280
and will make the right choice.

212
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,480
Okay.

213
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,880
Are you trying to reject her?

214
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,080
Zhizhou,

215
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,680
33.4% of the stock

216
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,280
can be used to make a choice.

217
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,480
We'll be very passive in the future.

218
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,880
And I asked her

219
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,080
if she could guarantee

220
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,880
that the creative team will not be replaced.

221
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,680
She didn't answer me.

222
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
But we can't give up

223
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,480
because of the future crisis.

224
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,480
And we can save the life of the grass.

225
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,880
Even if there's danger,

226
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,880
we can try to avoid it.

227
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Look at this.

228
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,280
The company she invested in

229
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,080
has been empty by the creative team.

230
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,680
I don't think Xing Chen will be an exception.

231
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,680
But

232
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,480
it's really not the case after this.

233
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,280
We can't see the hope now.

234
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,680
What future do we have?

235
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,480
Xing.

236
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,680
Let's talk about it later.

237
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Or we can't continue.

238
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,080
I'll think about it again.

239
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,080
I'll think about it again.

240
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,680
No.

241
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,680
Xing,

242
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,680
you're not the one who knows.

243
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,680
You can't be so stubborn.

244
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,880
You should let her try.

245
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,280
It's better to have someone to create.

246
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,680
It's better to have someone to create.

247
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,280
What if she dies in the beach?

248
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,280
But we can't give up

249
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,080
because of the future crisis.

250
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,680
And we can save the life of the grass.

251
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
Xing.

252
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,680
Xing.

253
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
Xing.

254
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
Xing.

255
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
Xing.

256
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,680
Xing.

257
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
Xing.

258
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Xing.

259
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Xing.

260
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Xing.

261
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,680
But the dream is from a far place.

262
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,920
we must make the use of productivity.

263
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,160
You can't create employment.

264
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,560
It has been 12 years since we began.

265
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,520
You can do their best.

266
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,760
However time will pass,

267
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,960
just the day and place.

268
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,000
A mlaus naturale.

269
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,840
It'll be your last proper work.

270
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,840
No pressure.

271
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
First Press

272
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Second printing

273
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,600
Another

274
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,880
Second Press

275
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,640
Second Press

276
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,800
endre

277
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,480
Laura

278
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,240
heim

279
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:39,440
иля

280
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
I'm just trying to confirm

281
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,440
whether I can guarantee that the new founders' team

282
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,440
won't be replaced by T-1.

283
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
Well,

284
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,440
let's talk about this too early.

285
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
Besides,

286
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,440
don't you have any confidence in your team?

287
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
Once you invest in it,

288
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
it will stand in your team.

289
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Once you do that,

290
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
it will stand in your team.

291
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
By then,

292
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
will you really

293
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,440
destroy Xing Chen?

294
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
It's really not like that

295
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,440
after this.

296
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
I can't even see the hope

297
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
of what future I'll have.

298
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Xing.

299
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,440
Let's talk about this

300
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,440
before we go.

301
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
What kind of warrior is Xing Chen?

302
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,240
Go!

303
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:53,960
Yes!

304
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,160
Boss,

305
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,120
Miss Ji who bought a cabin.

306
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,360
I'm sorry.

307
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
I'm sorry.

308
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
I'm sorry.

309
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
I'm sorry.

310
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,360
I'm sorry.

311
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,360
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
I'm sorry.

313
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
I'm sorry.

314
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,360
I'm sorry.

315
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
I'm sorry.

316
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
I'm sorry.

317
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
I'm sorry.

318
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
I'm sorry.

319
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
I'm sorry.

320
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
I'm sorry.

321
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
I'm sorry.

322
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
I'm sorry.

323
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
I'm sorry.

324
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
I'm sorry.

326
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
I'm sorry.

328
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
I'm sorry.

330
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
I'm sorry.

331
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
I'm sorry.

333
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,360
I'm sorry.

334
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Boss.

336
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,280
Miss Ji has been to the hospital for a long time.

337
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Let's go to the city.

338
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,280
After we have the winter department,

339
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
I'm afraid that there will be no other choice.

340
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
Are you sure you will reject me?

341
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
Thank you for your kind consideration.

342
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
But I have some other thoughts.

343
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Other thoughts?

344
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
You mean that you are worried that

345
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
you will lose control of the company in the future?

346
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,280
It doesn't seem to be true.

347
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Actually, I think I will be a little more mature.

348
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,960
In the past years

349
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,840
the manufactures

350
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,020
langag encant

351
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,800
are pretty useless.

352
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,280
During the際

353
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,900
this won't happen more than a minute ago.

354
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,280
You know

355
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,880
the entrepreneurs have gece

356
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,440
its poor performance,

357
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:03,540
and they fought day and night during

358
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,500
their creation.

359
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,100
But I want a stage that can make my ideal.

360
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,100
I know that you may think this idea is very naive.

361
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,500
But these things have been supporting me.

362
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,900
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

363
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,700
I hope we have other opportunities in the future.

364
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
Liao Liao.

365
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
20 million.

366
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
33.4% share.

367
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
The company's business will report to me.

368
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
This is my bottom line.

369
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,500
No.

370
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,500
33.4% already has a decision.

371
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,100
I can't accept it.

372
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,100
15 million.

373
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
25% share.

374
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,700
The new company has a full-fledged capital.

375
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,500
I am a investor.

376
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,700
You have to understand.

377
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,700
A reliable investor

378
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,900
can give you money

379
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,700
and resources and connections.

380
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,500
But even so,

381
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,700
investors are not the investors who help you.

382
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,900
You are not an investor.

383
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,100
It doesn't mean there is no investor in the world.

384
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,100
You are an investor.

385
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,500
Someone has already made your conditions.

386
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,500
But in the same situation,

387
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,900
I should consider the future.

388
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,900
Of course, if you make more advantageous conditions,

389
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,500
such as the low stock price,

390
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,300
I might consider it.

391
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
Now,

392
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,300
I am not interested in taking fake news.

393
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,300
Ji Xing,

394
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,900
I don't think someone will agree to your conditions,

395
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,300
especially Han Yuan.

396
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,900
You have seen it.

397
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,300
You should have a judgment.

398
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,100
There is only one or two points in your plan.

399
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,100
You said you would combine private

400
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,100
and medical data.

401
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
But as far as I know,

402
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,700
all the data you have now

403
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,900
are still in the廣華 period.

404
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,900
What about in the future?

405
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,100
Can you get more new data?

406
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,300
The Dongyi has a smart doctor.

407
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,100
There is no need for the data in the sea.

408
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,300
It's just a little.

409
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,300
Other investors can't compare.

410
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,500
But other investors are very harmonious.

411
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,500
They are harmonious.

412
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,700
Can you solve the problem of Xing Chen?

413
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,900
You look very unfriendly.

414
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,100
I don't look like that.

415
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,900
I am really unfriendly.

416
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,900
But is it important to compare

417
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,900
the future with Xing Chen?

418
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,100
I believe you have the ability to make a judgment.

419
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,900
Otherwise, you won't reject Han Yuan.

420
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
You also said

421
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,700
you would combine the software and hardware.

422
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
You choose me and Dongyi.

423
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Xing Chen will have a better future.

424
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,500
I can agree to your conditions.

425
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,900
But I hope

426
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,700
Xing Chen won't join the external team.

427
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,100
I will be the one

428
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,300
to decide the internal world.

429
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,100
Okay.

430
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,300
Ding Qi asked me to report.

431
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,300
I need two years of monitoring.

432
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,900
Good cooperation.

433
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
Good cooperation.

434
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,100
Boss, where are we going next?

435
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,100
To see He Dong.

436
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
The investment meeting tomorrow needs his support.

437
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,100
Boss, the person you are talking to is here.

438
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,500
He Dong,

439
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,300
wait here.

440
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300
I called you earlier.

441
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:03,900
Sit down.

442
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,700
Please.

443
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,700
Did Mr. Han ask me out today?

444
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,700
Is there anything wrong?

445
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,300
I just want to thank

446
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,700
the board of directors

447
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,100
for helping me.

448
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,500
You're welcome.

449
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,700
I know your way of thinking.

450
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,900
You used to be a local in Germany.

451
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,900
You have a trust in capital.

452
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,100
Thank you for your cooperation.

453
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,100
Mr. Han asked me out today.

454
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,300
Not just to thank me, right?

455
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,900
I believe you have guessed my intentions.

456
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,500
You want me to vote for you

457
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,100
at the investment meeting tomorrow?

458
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,300
Yes.

459
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,300
I've read the information on Xing Chen's technology.

460
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,100
I'm not questioning your eyes.

461
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,100
The model of this company is good.

462
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,500
But there are too few technical personnel.

463
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,300
And the founder, Ji Xing,

464
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,100
didn't create successful profits before.

465
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
Will the investment company

466
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,300
be too risky?

467
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,700
It's risky to say a correct answer.

468
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,100
Ji Xing is from Guanghua.

469
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,700
She knows the system of East Medical.

470
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,700
The problem of the hospital wisdom doctor in Hong Kong

471
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,300
was solved by her first time.

472
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,100
Really?

473
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,700
Then this girl's technology is really good.

474
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,900
There's one thing you might not know.

475
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,100
My sister also wants to invest in Xing Chen.

476
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,300
But Ji Xing refused it later.

477
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,900
Your sisters all care about this company.

478
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,900
Ji Xing is really capable.

479
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,100
But since she chose East Medical

480
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,300
and refused to invest in East Medical,

481
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Mr. Yuan...

482
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,500
That's why I need your support.

483
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,700
I believe that

484
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,700
as long as there's a decision

485
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,500
on East Medical,

486
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
Mr. He will support it.

487
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
Don't worry.

488
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,100
I've already made the military order.

489
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,100
I won't do anything without confidence.

490
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,100
He Chen.

491
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,100
He Bu Xia.

492
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,100
Today's investment meeting

493
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,500
was made by the investment of East Medical

494
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,900
for Xing Chen technology.

495
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,300
Aren't you anxious?

496
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,300
What are you anxious about?

497
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,100
Didn't you invest in Xing Chen?

498
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,300
Although Xing Chen has good technology,

499
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,100
he's just a grasshopper.

500
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,100
He can't tell the truth.

501
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,700
Didn't you see it?

502
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,100
Didn't you see it?

503
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,900
Even Mr. He has led the interest of Han Ting.

504
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,100
If he goes down like this,

505
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,100
the board will be in trouble sooner or later.

506
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,300
Besides, there's also a chairman.

507
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,100
He's not in Hong Kong now.

508
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,700
When he comes back,

509
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,900
if he helps Han Ting to support him,

510
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,300
our days will be even better.

511
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,300
Don't worry.

512
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,500
Grandpa only looks at the results.

513
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,500
Then let's let Han Ting develop like this.

514
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,100
I always think that Xing Chen's future

515
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,500
will definitely become the breakthrough of our team.

516
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,700
What do you mean?

517
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,100
If the disease is caused by growing,

518
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,300
it can be developed.

519
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,500
Just wait.

520
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,100
Xing Xing, are you here?

521
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,300
Xing Chen,

522
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,500
Xing Chen.

523
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,900
Didn't I ask you not to pick me up?

524
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,300
I miss you.

525
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,500
Why did you bring the ring?

526
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,300
Listen, I've made the investment.

527
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,300
I'll sign the contract later.

528
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,900
Congratulations.

529
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,500
Let's go.

530
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,300
I'll take it.

531
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,300
No, no, no.

532
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,900
You still have to sign the contract today.

533
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Go ahead and get it.

534
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,100
I'll be fine when I go back alone.

535
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,100
It's okay.

536
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,500
I don't need this much time.

537
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,100
You really don't need it.

538
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,900
Are you angry with me?

539
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,700
No.

540
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,700
You are.

541
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,900
I really am.

542
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,700
Xing Xing, don't worry.

543
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
You just sign the contract today.

544
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,700
See you on the weekend.

545
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,700
Okay?

546
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,500
Okay.

547
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,900
I'll send you back first.

548
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,100
Then I'll go back to work.

549
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,100
Chief Tang.

550
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:58,900
Miss Ji.

551
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,100
Han Zong is already waiting for you inside.

552
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,700
Come.

553
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,100
Boss, Miss Ji is here.

554
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,100
Please have a seat.

555
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,100
Please.

556
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,700
Have a seat.

557
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,900
The investment agreement is two points.

558
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,100
The agreement has been signed.

559
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,300
Don't you look at it again?

560
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,300
Han Zong has decided to vote for us.

561
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,300
How could he make our company suffer?

562
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,900
I'm sorry.

563
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,900
I'm sorry.

564
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,900
I'm sorry.

565
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,900
I'm sorry.

566
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,900
I'm sorry.

567
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,900
I'm sorry.

568
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,900
I'm sorry.

569
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,900
I'm sorry.

570
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,900
I'm sorry.

571
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,900
I'm sorry.

572
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,900
I'm sorry.

573
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,900
I'm sorry.

574
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,900
I'm sorry.

575
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,900
I'm sorry.

576
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,900
I'm sorry.

577
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,900
I'm sorry.

578
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,900
I'm sorry.

579
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,900
I'm sorry.

580
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,900
I'm sorry.

581
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,900
I'm sorry.

582
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,900
I'm sorry.

583
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,900
I'm sorry.

584
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,900
I'm sorry.

585
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,900
I'm sorry.

586
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,900
I'm sorry.

587
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,900
I'm sorry.

588
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,900
I'm sorry.

589
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,900
I'm sorry.

590
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,900
I'm sorry.

591
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,900
I'm sorry.

592
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,300
I'm sorry.

593
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,400
The investment contract will be in you today tomorrow.

594
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,900
Okay.

595
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
There is still something.

596
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,100
President Han,

597
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,100
I just saw the invitation party for treatment in the class on the desk of Dalai posted.

598
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,100
Excuse me?

599
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,940
I'll give you a copy.

600
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,180
Let's see the situation.

601
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,180
Thank you, Mr. Han.

602
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,100
Have a good cooperation, Mr. Han.

603
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,020
Have a good cooperation, Mr. Ji.

604
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,740
I'll go first.

605
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:37,300
The

606
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,140
buyer of SPZ

607
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,420
I have some new ideas.

608
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,580
Take a look.

609
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,460
Before, Guang Hua always thought

610
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,380
that in the big hospital,

611
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,460
he would recommend Xiao Bai.

612
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:51,940
In fact,

613
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,980
in some hospitals,

614
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,540
the equivalent of lack of treatment,

615
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,780
he needs our products more.

616
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,780
It's better for everyone to have the same life.

617
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,460
This is my original intention.

618
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,780
Not bad.

619
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,260
Then let's promote this plan.

620
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,100
Okay.

621
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,500
I bought you several flavors.

622
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,340
I don't know if you like it.

623
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:26,900
Oh, right.

624
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,660
I heard that

625
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,980
you invested in your schoolmates.

626
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,700
You mean Ji Xing?

627
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,020
When you were in college,

628
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,180
you participated in the competition.

629
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,740
I won't invest in a company

630
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,260
that is useless

631
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,820
because of any personal relationship.

632
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,580
Have a good time.

633
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,740
Second Qi needs to advance to the next level.

634
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,060
I'm going slowly because I'm on the slope.

635
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,340
But don't worry.

636
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,740
I won't let you down.

637
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,180
Thank you for your concern.

638
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,980
I have something else to do.

639
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,660
Then don't be too late.

640
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,700
Take care.

641
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,500
Our first investment is here!

642
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,020
Look.

643
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,180
5, 10, 100,000, 10, 100,000,

644
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,820
6 million!

645
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,980
We can finally take the lead!

646
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,260
Xiao Cheng.

647
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,860
Let's take a look at the next product.

648
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,620
I've made the first step.

649
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,260
It's in my computer.

650
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,260
It's okay.

651
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,420
It's famous.

652
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,500
It's okay.

653
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,180
I've received the first investment of the precious.

654
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,340
Thank you, Mr. Han.

655
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,300
Mr. Han is filial.

656
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,820
Mr. Han gave us a treat

657
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,460
for the conference.

658
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,820
That's so good.

659
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,540
It's said that this conference

660
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,060
can be split into

661
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,220
the boss and curlarch

662
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,740
to make a living.

663
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,860
If I can get hold in this period,

664
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,060
I will be anywhere we can go.

665
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,820
Check the label while you wait.

666
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,580
It's a big thing!

667
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,660
Poop P್!!!

668
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,820
Pay your debt.

669
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,420
I heard Mr. Han

670
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,100
has been an intern

671
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,500
Okay.

672
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,660
Xin Xin, go back to work.

673
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,140
Yichen,

674
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,260
the first investment in Xing Chen is coming.

675
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,540
Let's go to the big restaurant for a celebration.

676
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:24,700
Okay.

677
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,460
Congratulations, Xin Xin.

678
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,820
I love you.

679
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:36,940
Okay.

680
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,220
Sit down.

681
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,460
Sister Li.

682
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,820
Why do you still want to see me?

683
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,020
Our first investment in the big restaurant is coming.

684
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,220
Our lawyer Yue

685
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,180
is going to talk about the new investment in Xing Chen.

686
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,700
Not bad.

687
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,020
You've worked so hard.

688
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,300
Finally, you've improved.

689
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,220
Sister Li, why are you here?

690
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,180
I just saw a hunter near me.

691
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,980
I came to send some information to Xing Xin.

692
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,820
I heard from Sister Xin that you left.

693
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,100
Sorry, I've made you a burden.

694
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,260
I was unhappy about that.

695
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,540
I fired the company.

696
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,140
But you have nothing to do with it.

697
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,420
Sister Li, you're so handsome.

698
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,260
Okay, where's Xing Xin?

699
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,540
Sister Xin went out for business.

700
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,580
She said she'd be back in a while.

701
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,500
Sister Li, I'm not in a hurry.

702
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,500
You're not here to see her.

703
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,340
We're going to talk to you.

704
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:33,900
Hurry up.

705
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,940
No, no.

706
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,620
Take it.

707
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,860
There are two documents here.

708
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,100
They're all the sales data

709
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,380
of the medical system in recent years.

710
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,060
And some basic information from the client.

711
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,300
It's for reference.

712
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,660
Thank you, Sister Li.

713
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,300
Thank you.

714
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,260
I'm leaving.

715
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,140
You can go back to work.

716
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,460
I'll send you off.

717
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,740
Sister Li, do you like to watch movies?

718
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,460
I heard that

719
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,140
the movies on Xing Xin are really good.

720
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,420
I'll go to watch them for you on Monday.

721
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,860
There are many people who want to see movies.

722
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,660
I'm not the one who gives opportunities.

723
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,220
My car is over there.

724
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:07,980
I'm leaving.

725
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,900
Goodbye, Sister Li.

726
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,140
Brother Su,

727
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,060
girls are hard to chase.

728
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,380
Are you still chasing?

729
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,940
Being single is the biggest hope.

730
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,100
How do you know that?

731
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,460
When you rejected me just now,

732
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,820
I didn't mention my boyfriend.

733
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:30,860
You're done talking.

734
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,820
What kind of girl are you?

735
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,460
Look at me separately.

736
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:54,900
Look at you.

737
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,060
I'm not afraid of you.

738
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,060
I'm afraid of you.

739
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,060
I'm afraid of you.

740
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,060
What a coincidence.

741
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,060
No, I'm here to see you.

742
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,060
How do you know I'm here?

743
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,460
The bar owner is my friend.

744
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,060
You're looking for me so desperately.

745
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,460
What's the matter?

746
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,460
I miss you.

747
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,460
Who is it?

748
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,060
Yichen,

749
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,060
isn't it Zhou Mocai?

750
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,660
Come and thank me.

751
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,060
Xiaoxiao, the food is ready.

752
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,460
Come out and eat.

753
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,660
Right away.

754
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,660
If you don't come out,

755
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,660
the food will be cold.

756
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,260
Coming.

757
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,260
Xiaoxiao,

758
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,260
I'm here to see you.

759
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,260
I'm here to see you.

760
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,260
I'm here to see you.

761
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,260
I'm here to see you.

762
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,260
I'm here to see you.

763
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,060
Go wash your hands first.

764
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,260
Okay.

765
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,260
Where's Xiaomeng?

766
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,060
Xiaomeng went to the field today

767
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,460
and participated in the live broadcast.

768
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,860
He'll be back tomorrow.

769
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,260
It smells so good.

770
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,460
It's so delicious.

771
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,260
Eat slowly.

772
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,660
No one will take it with you.

773
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,460
Are you tired recently?

774
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,660
Don't do this again.

775
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,060
No, I won't.

776
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,260
Today is because

777
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,860
there's a very important document.

778
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,660
By the way,

779
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,860
we have a night exchange meeting tomorrow.

780
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,460
It's like a business trip to Xingcheng.

781
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,860
No one is qualified to participate.

782
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,060
But I asked our investor

783
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,660
to give us a invitation.

784
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,460
That place is very old and gloomy.

785
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,860
If anyone can give me a little bit of a heart,

786
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,460
Xingcheng might be able to become a dragon.

787
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,260
No matter what,

788
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,860
I'm the first step

789
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,060
to go out and sell my heart to Xingcheng.

790
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,060
Xingcheng,

791
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,460
your future is about to begin.

792
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,860
It's our future.

793
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,060
You

794
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,260
forget to eat when you're busy.

795
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,060
Why do you have to be so fat?

796
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,060
Xingcheng,

797
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,660
promise me

798
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,860
that you'll eat every day

799
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,260
and every day.

800
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,260
Okay?

801
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,260
They're so mean.

802
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,260
Drink more.

803
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,660
I'll drink alone.

804
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,860
Xingxing, are you still busy?

805
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,660
Okay, okay.

806
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:56,860
Perfect.

807
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,060
You're working with your life.

808
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,060
No matter how important it is,

809
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,660
you need to work together.

810
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,660
Don't worry.

811
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,860
Look, I have the power to help.

812
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:07,660
Yichen,

813
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,460
do you want to watch a movie?

814
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,460
I haven't watched a movie for a long time.

815
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,460
Last time,

816
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,460
you said you liked watching the movie.

817
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,060
Sit down first.

818
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,860
Last time, I was scared

819
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,260
to watch that movie.

820
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,460
I'll wait for a while.

821
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,660
Last time, I didn't watch it

822
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,660
because I was too busy.

823
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,260
I can watch it this time.

824
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,460
Come on, put this on.

825
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,260
It's more comfortable.

826
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,660
Yichen,

827
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,860
after I finish working for a while,

828
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,660
let's go to see Uncle and Aunt.

829
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,460
Buy some tea for Uncle,

830
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,460
buy some skin care products for Aunt.

831
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,460
Let's watch the movie first.

832
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,060
I'm so tired.

833
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,260
