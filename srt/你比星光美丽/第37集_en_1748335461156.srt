1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to forget about the past and take the land.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not going to be afraid.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I still have my future.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm not afraid of the throne and the courage to do so.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Therefore, I'm going to forget about the past and take the land.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I won't give up.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,320
Executive Editor Kim

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,920
Now let's start over

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,720
not a straightforward man

18
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,080
but an flipshit

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,280
Han vier

20
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,960
Ji Xing

21
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,560
Ms. Kim

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not used to seeing you.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not used to seeing you.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm not used to seeing you.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is the latest full-fledged contract.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Aren't you signing it?

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I heard that Zhu Houyu

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
kidnapped Zixing to revenge Han Ting.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Han Ting was injured in the hospital.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I heard that too.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Is it you?

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Xiaodi.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Xiaodi.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's not a friendly business.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You're a colleague now.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I hope you can be a good friend with Dong Yi.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is it uncomfortable?

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's okay.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Why are you here?

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You said such a big thing.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Come and see.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You said such a big thing.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What?

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're not welcome?

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Come.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You guys talk first.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You guys talk first.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How is it?

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Is it serious?

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's okay.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Thank you.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But you're here

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
not only to learn how to be warm.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I didn't expect

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Zhu Houyu to do such a thing.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Chang He wants to take over Guanghua.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I accept it.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Good thing.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Congratulations.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm grateful to you.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If you hadn't abandoned Guanghua,

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Guanghua wouldn't have developed so well

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
that it would have won

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
the grand prize of the Gu family.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Do you regret

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
this situation?

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I bought Guanghua for Tong Ke.

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You said

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
you're not a friend,

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
but an enemy.

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Next time we meet,

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
we'll be enemies.

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Have a good rest.

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll be back soon.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Take care.

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're soft.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You'll forgive him

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
when he falls.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What do you want to say?

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I feel sorry for you as a woman.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You know how cruel Han Ting is.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You'll have the second time

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
if you have the first time

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
to cheat and use.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Zeng Di,

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
you've never known

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
real Han Ting.

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You don't understand

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
my relationship with Han Ting.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I went to Guanghua when I graduated.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I used to admire you.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I also hated you.

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But I found out later

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
you're pitiful.

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You're tall, ambitious, and capable,

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
but you've blinded

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Han Ting's eyes

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
because of you.

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You've lost your self-esteem.

113
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You've always been

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
a part of me,

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
which means you're self-sufficient.

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I see.

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm not.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll be back.

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll be back.

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I think you're confident

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
about Han Ting's relationship.

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll see

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
how long you can be together.

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll see you.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay.

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'll pay for the contract.

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Mr. Yuan.

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's rare.

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You haven't made an appointment

131
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
with me for a long time.

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You know

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
what happened

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
to Zhu Houyu's kidnapping.

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What?

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're upset about your own brotherhood?

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm so worried.

138
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're so irresponsible

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
that you'll be shocked by my father.

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If he finds out,

141
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
no one will be able to escape from me.

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't forget

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
that even Han Ting

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
can find out that we met.

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You're the only one

146
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
who can do it.

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Dongyang can

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
do the same as today.

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Your old man

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
won't be less capable

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
than me.

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He'll understand me.

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Besides,

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Han Ting

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
has no choice

156
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
even if she knows it.

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't care about you.

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You're so weak and unwell.

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I feel sorry for you.

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The door is over there.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's a good place.

162
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Are you kidding me?

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Where's Ji Xing?

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No, right?

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You saved him,

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and he's gone.

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That's too much.

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You almost died

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
just to save him.

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I implicated him

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and I was wrong.

172
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Why are you so mad at him?

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
If you miss this chance,

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Ji Xing will never forgive you.

175
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What should you do?

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What should I do?

177
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't just

178
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
keep your spirit.

179
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Listen to me.

180
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Go find him now.

181
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
President Xiao is here.

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I... I'm here to see Han Ting.

183
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I heard she's badly injured.

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Please take care of her

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and prepare some fruit for her.

186
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I bought it.

187
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You go first.

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'll go wash the fruit.

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Okay.

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
No.

191
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No.

192
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No.

193
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
No.

194
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
She didn't go.

195
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You're so funny.

196
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
She bought fruit for you.

197
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You should show her your skills.

198
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
She's so good at it.

199
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
She's very good at pretending.

200
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
She can trust you.

201
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Ji Xing.

202
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's right.

203
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Why did you do that?

204
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I was so upset.

205
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I was so mad.

206
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I was so mad.

207
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I was so upset.

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
President Ji.

209
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
May you live a happy life.

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm leaving now.

211
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh, right.

212
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
There's one more thing.

213
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I suddenly remembered

214
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
that some people

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
don't like their own body.

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
They want you to take care of it.

217
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What do you mean?

218
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You didn't know

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
that when you two broke up,

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,520
He drank all the wine I had.

221
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,040
The red board is red.

222
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,240
It's all over the body.

223
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,000
If not for me, you wouldn't have seen him.

224
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,680
Okay.

225
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,560
Chen Dong.

226
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,320
I...

227
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,120
You guys can talk.

228
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,680
I have to go.

229
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,160
Bye.

230
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,640
Han Dong.

231
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,440
Bye.

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I won't do it again.

233
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,120
I won't do it again.

234
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,560
Have,和 with BARC?

235
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,000
ACPtion to XINXIN?

236
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,840
Why doubt her?

237
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,840
That's the most important thing.

238
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,740
I hate to state her doing that.

239
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,160
She's always been Zhang Sayi.

240
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,360
No one here will take her hand.

241
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,960
I don't care if the shooting star

242
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,800
stashed when she was at home.

243
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,160
That's the reason.

244
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,160
I was wrong.

245
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,660
You better think twice.

246
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,920
Better think twice than go.

247
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,540
If you can make amends,

248
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,160
I won't deserve it.

249
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,860
It's too dangerous.

250
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,580
Wait!

251
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,840
Yun how'd you know about it?

252
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,340
馬的誂說,

253
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,940
Lu Lin Jia, you're sick.

254
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,540
Sorry, I'm at the door.

255
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,540
I... I was thinking that such a big thing happened.

256
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,540
You're not going to be scared at home.

257
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,540
I'll come and protect you.

258
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,540
No, no, no.

259
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,540
You're even more scared.

260
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,940
At least you're at least ten years old.

261
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,540
I'm sorry, mom.

262
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,140
I was thinking that I should tell you.

263
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,540
You definitely won't agree.

264
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,740
And I'm afraid that you won't be able to sleep at home.

265
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,540
I'll come and protect you.

266
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,540
You should be able to be more at ease.

267
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,240
Little?

268
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,640
Just a little.

269
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,340
Get up.

270
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,040
They are in the nên city.

271
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,740
Yes.

272
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,100
Sistership is inihter.

273
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,360
Are you ready?

274
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,920
Right away.

What happened to you?

279
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,260
What's happening?

280
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,380
Brother.

281
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,500
Come here.

282
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,360
But I wish

283
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,200
this world

284
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,280

285
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,260
Shall we?

286
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,020
Right.

287
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,080

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,840
Seize him for us along the way

292
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,660
and place him in our corny room

293
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,060
I always bothered him

294
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,960
He knows we all come here

295
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,600
Always

296
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,960
Don't get records

297
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,520
Be careful

298
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,020
Okay

299
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,420
We're quite glad.

300
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:36,100
Looking back, there's been so much conflict between your family and me.

301
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,340
I can't help telling От heavy weather how sour I am.

302
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,340
You don't need to 나도 any conc partly because I'm here initially.

Come on, come on, come on.

00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,400
Well?

307
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,000
No need.

00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:48,680
No need to be surprised

313
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,480
Back to the main attendants

314
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,560
Leave me alone

315
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,500
Think it through

316
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,800

A piece of paradise

320
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,400
A piece of vanity

321
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,200
Can't let you be there

322
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,040
Assault me

323
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Don't make someone cry

324
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,160
Return my dad back to me and I'll let him study in this field.

325
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,000
No more money.

326
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,900
I can get mykie.

327
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,560
Do you really know who he is?

328
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,200
Do you have any reasons lately?

329
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,920
I'm looking for Mr. Han to report to the studio.

330
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,640
Look at my style.

331
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,040
Isn't it too polite?

332
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,080
It's good.

333
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,280
It's formal.

334
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:07,960
It's okay.

335
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,840
It's okay.

336
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,120
What are you doing?

337
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,040
You're not coming in?

338
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,600
I'm waiting for you to come in.

339
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,360
Let's go.

340
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:13,920
Let's go.

341
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,480
What?

342
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:15,920
Sister.

343
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Sister.

344
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,040
Come in.

345
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,520
Please.

346
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,320
Mr. Han.

347
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,200
Big sister.

348
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,040
How is it?

349
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,760
Mr. Han.

350
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,960
How is the light?

351
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,720
We're worried about you.

352
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,960
You must rest well.

353
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,040
Much better.

354
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,840
Thank you.

355
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,240
Mr. Han.

356
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,520
Xixing is not here?

357
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,520
She went to see the doctor.

358
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,720
Mr. Han.

359
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,520
Han Xing left these days for us.

360
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,400
You and Xun can rest well.

361
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,120
I've been listening to you for a while.

362
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,440
I'm happy that you're strong.

363
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,760
Mr. Luo is over the top.

364
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,640
I did what I should do.

365
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,840
Mr. Su has been doing well.

366
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,160
Everyone is brave.

367
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,920
Okay.

368
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,640
It's more fun to talk about work in the hospital.

369
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:02,880
Come.

370
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,520
Let me introduce you to everyone.

371
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,800
My girlfriend.

372
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,200
Tu Xiaomeng.

373
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,160
You should introduce her to me.

374
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,560
She's my boyfriend.

375
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,840
She's still in the test period.

376
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,800
Stop talking nonsense.

377
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,040
You're all here.

378
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,760
Xixing.

379
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,400
Xixing.

380
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,360
How are you?

381
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,160
What did the doctor say?

382
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,720
The doctor said that you can be discharged today.

383
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,920
That's great.

384
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,120
Congratulations, big sister.

385
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,160
But you still look after your body after you're discharged.

386
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Who knows if your brain is damaged.

387
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,880
Thank you for reminding me that I'm very good.

388
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,840
Who can be sure?

389
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,840
Then, the report of the Bind 98.

390
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,720
Show me.

391
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,640
Smart.

392
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,040
The first smart person.

393
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:46,920
Okay.

394
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,520
Don't disturb Mr. Han's rest.

395
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,920
Mr. Han, we're leaving.

396
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,760
Have a good rest.

397
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,400
Yes.

398
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,640
Xun, take care of Mr. Han.

399
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,400
We're leaving.

400
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:53,840
Let's go.

401
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,360
Take care.

402
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:54,840
Okay.

403
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,560
Goodbye, Mr. Han.

404
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:56,840
Goodbye.

405
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,320
After you're discharged,

406
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,120
stay at my house for a few days, okay?

407
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,360
The doctor said that I can be discharged.

408
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,400
But I still feel uncomfortable.

409
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,320
Okay.

410
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,760
You said that.

411
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,840
Kiss me.

412
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,320
It's okay, keep it.

413
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,440
Don't you know,

414
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,720
I almost rolled my bottom neck.

415
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,200
How can you say that?

416
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:38,560
Hey!

417
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,040
If you have a mysterious girl number,

418
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,760
put her number on!

419
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,120
You are well-arranged.

420
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,000
What are you talking about?

421
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,340
I can hear it.

422
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,000
I've heard

423
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,340
We'll go there

424
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,820
Stop it

425
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,580
You guys are really fast

426
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,280
Congratulations

427
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,340
That's it

428
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,280
You will have the power over my back

429
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,460
It's our first time

430
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,320
So nice

431
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,220
I just found out that

432
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,340
the queen always turns a certain wolf into a medium dog.

433
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,260
I'm not happy with that.

434
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,020
You can't change your pen name.

435
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,140
What's wrong? How much do you have a crush on a image?

436
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,260
Su Zhizhou has changed a lot.

437
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,740
In the past, he seemed like a silly little puppy.

438
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,740
Now,

439
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,740
he's already become a wolf dog.

440
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,540
He's looking at you.

441
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,620
They must be discussing with you.

442
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,540
Li Jie is in your heart.

443
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,460
How do you know?

444
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,820
You believe me? That's right. Look at me.

445
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,420
I'm already in love with him.

446
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,740
Your progress is still here.

447
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:06,460
But I just heard that some people are still using their energy.

448
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,100
What's going on? They haven't turned their back yet.

449
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,020
What do you know?

450
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,740
This little girl is like a dancing angel.

451
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,180
You go in. I'll retreat.

452
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,540
What's important is the process of enjoying.

453
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,740
The process of enjoying?

454
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,740
What are you thinking about, Li Jie?

455
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,460
I don't know.

456
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,580
In theory, Su Zhizhou isn't my type.

457
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,220
Then, if you say that, can I understand him?

458
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,580
He might have changed your previous self-cultivation standards.

459
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:50,020
If you look at him like that, you think he's different.

460
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,020
Okay, you're now an expert in love.

461
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,620
Of course.

462
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,420
Just be yourself.

463
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,780
Li Jie is looking at you again.

464
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,420
Love is like a trick to you. You have to take the initiative to go out.

465
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,900
Xiao Meng!

466
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,220
I'm dying of thirst. Aren't you going to eat hotpot?

467
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,620
I have to go now. Bye, Li Jie.

468
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,220
Xiao Meng!

469
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,020
Remember to love everyone.

470
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,220
I'll be free later.

471
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,220
I'm going.

472
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,220
Don't go to a better place with me.

473
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,820
Did you come to talk to my mom?

474
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,820
I talked to her quite well.

475
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,420
You know what?

476
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,220
Every time she sends me a message,

477
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,220
as long as she talks to you, she can't finish it.

478
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,020
She said that when you were young,

479
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,820
she divorced and was alone with you.

480
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,020
She was busy with work and didn't have time to take good care of you.

481
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,020
She also didn't have time to take you out to have fun.

482
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:20,020
Now that you've grown up, she still thinks that you're busy with work.

483
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:24,420
So, don't miss the communication between the two of you.

484
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,420
I've never talked to my mom that deeply.

485
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,220
Don't forget that I'm with your mom. I'm your boyfriend.

486
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,220
Actually,

487
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:45,020
there are good words that can't be spoken to the person who's closest to you.

488
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,020
My mom is quite open to me.

489
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,220
It's just that she doesn't listen to me that well.

490
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:01,020
Actually, I feel that her mom is quite confused.

491
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,220
You know, she's urging you to get married.

492
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,420
She actually wants to find someone to take care of you for her.

493
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:11,220
But she's also afraid that you'll meet a wrong person like her.

494
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,420
So she always chooses a sister for your life.

495
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,820
I know.

496
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,020
You actually care about her a lot.

497
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,620
She also cares about you a lot.

498
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,420
And she's definitely not that much of a care for you.

499
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,020
You two just...

500
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,420
don't know how to express yourself to the other person.

501
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,220
I didn't expect that I'd be a saleswoman for so many years.

502
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,820
I'd still have a day when I'd be told that I won't be able to speak.

503
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,620
But you're right.

504
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,220
I'll also communicate with my mom.

505
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,220
Aunt Accept Guan Whitjia la oxide?

506
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,820
Auntie told me one more thing.

507
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,220
I'm particularly in a simple mind.

508
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,220
She said that even if

509
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,620
The one who deserves to be entrusted.

510
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,020
There's a restaurant in front of us. It's delicious.

511
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,420
I've been hiding it for a long time.

512
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,420
I'll take you there.

513
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,020
Okay.

514
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,820
Mr. Luo,

515
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,820
I'll think about going to Germany.

516
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,620
Boss, slow down.

517
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,820
Don't be so nervous.

518
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,220
The doctor said we can be discharged.

519
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,820
Tang Song is right.

520
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,220
You have to slow down.

521
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,820
Where's the pain in the bone?

522
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,020
I know. I know.

523
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,420
Slow down.

524
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,820
I saw it last time.

525
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,420
The fish is so beautiful.

526
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,420
It's like a butterfly.

527
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,420
Its name is called butterfly.

528
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,820
It's also called good luck.

529
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,620
So I believed it once.

530
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,620
I believe they can take you back to me.

531
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,820
I'm so confident that I can come back.

532
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,220
No.

533
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,820
But I'll wait.

534
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,220
I'll wait.

535
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,420
I'll wait.

536
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,820
This hand.

537
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,820
Why is the yellow one bigger than me?

538
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,420
Maybe in my heart, you're as cute as him.

539
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,820
I didn't expect you to do all the things

540
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,820
you want to do.

541
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,420
But what does the lottery mean

542
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,620
except for our birthday?

543
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,620
It's a day we meet again.

544
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,420
You remember all this?

545
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,620
It's hard for people to remember your way of doing things.

546
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,420
I'm so sorry.

547
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,220
I'm sorry.

548
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,020
I'm sorry.

549
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:45,820
I'm sorry.

550
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,620
I'm sorry.

551
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,420
I'm sorry.

552
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,420
I think you've been hesitating.

553
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,420
Yes.

554
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,420
The day of college.

555
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,420
College?

556
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,420
We only met for a few months.

557
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,620
When did we start?

558
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,020
Maybe

559
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,020
when you were on the stage of the speech.

560
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,020
Maybe

561
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,420
when we met the king.

562
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,420
Maybe

563
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,420
it was the first time we met in the lab.

564
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,020
I'll confess to you on the day of the gathering.

565
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,620
If I didn't go to Germany,

566
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,620
your phone would be lost.

567
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,620
Otherwise, your first love would be me.

568
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,620
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

569
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,820
I wish you were not as good as me.

570
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,420
You wouldn't have seen me earlier.

571
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,820
Why are you still so shy?

572
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,620
Thank you.

573
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,620
Xingbir.

574
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:49,480
You're going to the home to do everything in just one day.

575
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,740
Preparing for landing.

576
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,220
I will.

577
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,020
Didn't you say you can only use it once?

578
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,820
This time, I don't think so.

579
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,220
Thank you.

580
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,620
I'm sorry.

581
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,420
Mr. Han, you're so good.

582
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,420
You've never seen me before.

583
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,020
Not enough.

584
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,220
Not enough?

585
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,420
What are you doing?

586
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,020
What's wrong?

587
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,220
Nothing.

588
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,020
I must have been too stubborn.

589
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,420
You're making fun of me.

590
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,220
I'm just kidding.

591
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,820
I'll cook.

592
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,820
I'll change my clothes and come back.

593
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,420
Okay.

594
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:51,020
The face of the same person

595
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,620
I've been waiting for you

596
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,020
Do you need help?

597
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,020
Are you sure?

598
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,820
What are you doing?

599
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,820
This is sara sauce.

600
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,020
I'm going to make you a vegetable sara.

601
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,820
Sara sauce?

602
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,020
You call me?

603
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,420
Okay.

604
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,420
Come.

605
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,820
This is the net.

606
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,420
Yes.

607
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,620
The net.

608
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,620
I'm done.

609
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,820
Enough.

610
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,020
Enough.

611
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:31,820
Come.

612
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,420
This is...

613
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,020
Stir.

614
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,620
It's not that much.

615
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,220
Look.

616
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,620
This is how it's done.

617
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,220
Come.

618
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,820
Take it with your hand.

619
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,620
No.

620
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,540
時間隨便幫我湊忙

621
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,580
Right,

622
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,500
You're finished with the Aquaaran scene.

623
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,420
The core scene is completed.

624
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,220
I'll take care of it.

625
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,940
Let's go. Bye.

626
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:24,820
Okay.

627
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,460
How about you change your mind?

628
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,340
These are the favorite methods.

629
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,780
How about what opinions do you have?

630
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,540
Director Liu.

631
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:58,700
Director Liu,

632
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,340
there's no problem with this method.

633
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,260
But AI ανculMC have a huge influence.

634
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,580
It's very popular in Southeast Asia.

635
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,740
And it's hard to say

636
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,860
when there are no profits.

637
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,040
Before Chief Han decides

638
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,860
it,

639
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:18,260
AI talent is a very important part of the future planning of East Medical and Han Xin.

640
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,460
Other countries have already had AI talent resources.

641
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,660
Some countries have even established very well.

642
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,860
We don't lack talent in our country, but we lack such platform.

643
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,660
For AI fields, technology is a doorstep.

644
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,660
Human talent is desirable and cannot be cultivated.

645
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,060
If we all have our own AI talent,

646
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,860
I believe that there will be improvements in technology.

647
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,860
President Liu, we are very short of

648
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,860
the application talent in the market.

649
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,860
AI talent is a source of thought that can provide us with a lot of practical solutions.

650
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,860
It is also very helpful to cultivate application talents.

651
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,860
I understand these principles,

652
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,860
but it is the first time that we have tried.

653
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:05,260
I am worried that in the current stage, if we invest a lot of human resources and do nothing,

654
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,260
if the project is heavily criticized,

655
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,260
for East Medical and Han Xin, it will be a waste.

656
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,460
Technology and AI resources are a source of thought

657
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,060
that is the key to understanding AI.

658
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:25,060
So I hope that everyone can leave all their concerns and try their best.

659
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,660
President Ju, AI is the name of East Medical.

660
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,860
The capital will be exported from East Medical.

661
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,260
The board members are the most loyal to investing.

662
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,860
Even if we are ready to prepare the proposal,

663
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,460
I am afraid it will be difficult to pass the board meeting.

664
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,860
The problem of the meeting will be solved by President Han.

665
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,860
Do you have any other questions?

666
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:59,860
If not, let's discuss how to fix this board's proposal.

667
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,860
Okay.

668
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,860
How is the meeting going?

669
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,860
I finished it.

670
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,460
Everyone is still a little worried.

671
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:35,060
It's normal to be worried. How is the proposal?

672
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,260
We have already said that you only have to deal with the board meeting.

673
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,860
Don't worry about the proposal. Leave it to me.

674
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:45,460
You just have to rest.

675
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,060
I know.

676
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,060
How is the waistline? Is it comfortable?

677
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,660
It's very, very comfortable.

678
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:55,460
You can't sit down for long no matter how comfortable it is. Come, get up and do some activities.

679
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,260
I just learned a movement that relieves the lower back pain.

680
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,460
You can practice with me. Come.

681
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,460
Come.

682
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,460
Okay, stand like this and then...

683
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,460
breathe in.

684
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,460
Don't laugh.

685
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,460
Okay, again. Breathe in.

686
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,460
Okay, turn left.

687
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,460
Breathe in.

688
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:24,460
One, two, three, four, five.

689
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,460
Okay, back to the front.

690
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,460
Breathe in.

691
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:41,460
Turn right. One, two, three, four, five.

692
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,460
How do you feel?

693
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,460
I feel much better.

694
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,460
Okay, let's do another movement.

695
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,460
Open your hand like this.

696
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,460
Okay.

697
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,460
Okay.

698
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,460
Why are you here?

699
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,460
It's so beautiful to see the night view here.

700
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,020
I've never seen Ye Jing here.

701
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,260
Xin Xin.

702
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,620
We were too full of time.

703
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,820
We didn't have time to be with each other.

704
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:34,860
I think

705
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,660
we should save more time for each other.

706
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,380
Okay.

707
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,700
What are you doing?

708
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,860
This is like a family of three.

709
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,020
Dad and mom are a naughty child.

710
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,500
In terms of age,

711
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,700
he's older than us.

712
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,340
You can't hear this kind of words.

713
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,380
I'm sorry.

714
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,380
I'm sorry.

715
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,180
I'm sorry.

716
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,020
I'm sorry.

717
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,020
I'm sorry.

718
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,020
I'm sorry.

719
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,020
I'm sorry.

720
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,020
I'm sorry.

721
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,020
I'm sorry.

722
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,020
I'm sorry.

723
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,020
I'm sorry.

724
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,020
I'm sorry.

725
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,020
I'm sorry.

726
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,020
I'm sorry.

727
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,020
I'm sorry.

728
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,020
I'm sorry.

729
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,020
I'm sorry.

730
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,020
I'm sorry.

731
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,020
I'm sorry.

732
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,020
I'm sorry.

733
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,020
I'm sorry.

734
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,020
I'm sorry.

735
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,020
I'm sorry.

736
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,020
I'm sorry.

737
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,020
I'm sorry.

738
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,020
I'm sorry.

739
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,020
I'm sorry.

740
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,020
I'm sorry.

741
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,020
I'm sorry.

742
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,020
I'm sorry.

743
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,020
I'm sorry.

744
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,020
I'm sorry.

745
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,020
I'm sorry.

746
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,020
I'm sorry.

747
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,020
I'm sorry.

748
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,020
I'm sorry.

749
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,020
I'm sorry.

750
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,020
I'm sorry.

751
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,020
I'm sorry.

752
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,020
