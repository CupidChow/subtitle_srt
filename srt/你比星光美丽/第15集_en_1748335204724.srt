1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to forget the place where I belong.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll never hesitate.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'll be my future.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll be fearless.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to forget the place where I belong.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't give up.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll be more confident.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Even if I'm not alone.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Starry Sky

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 1

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Cheers!

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Congratulations on your success.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Thank you.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Cheers!

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The best match with fried chicken and beer.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm happy because I can enjoy it

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
when I'm drunk.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm not jealous of your beauty boss.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm happy when I'm sober.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Ever since I started my career.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I realized we haven't been together for a long time.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We've been eating together.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Right.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You know,

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
we've worked hard, but we don't have a clear budget.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now we have a half-time job.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We should thank the woman behind us

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and the woman who has been with us.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's because you made me believe

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Starry Sky would be a great stage.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
When the product comes out,

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I won't let you regret it.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
She's a great saleswoman.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I've always been happy.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Now we have a new starting point.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The future will be more smooth.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Cheers!

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Cheers!

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So cold.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hello, I'm Xu Youyou.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm Zhang Jie.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm Feng Yu.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm Chen Zuo.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm Jiang Jingxuan.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I graduated from Jiangyang Business School.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm a business management professional.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm a graduate of this school.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I graduated from Xinjiang Business Technology University.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm a graduate of the Department of Business and Business.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm a new graduate of Xinjiang Business Technology University.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm a professional in product engineering.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm a professional in the department of

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Xinjiang Business Technology.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We're friends.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
How much is your salary?

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I just graduated.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I hope you can pay me back every month.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I hope so, too.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Next one.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why did you leave the company?

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I fired the boss.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The company is too small.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The environment is too bad.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's cold and hot in winter.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's not a place for people to stay.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You're not bad.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Next one.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What's your ideal?

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Ideal?

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't think I have any ideal.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I hope to enter a company with a world of 500 boxes.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I designed the product to get professional.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I just want to do what I like.

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Like writing a program and making a list.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I can do it all day.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Sister Li.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I found you're so good at today's interview.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You really don't lose those professional A-chips.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You've worked hard.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Drink some water.

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Next one.

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Next one.

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hello, I'm Huang Weiwei.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Are you the former colleague of the CEO?

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You came to the interview.

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The CEO didn't say hi to us.

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Although we're acquaintances,

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
we want to share the company.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I want to ask you a few questions.

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You don't mind, right?

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I think so.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't want to be a relationship partner.

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Just ask.

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're very experienced.

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You've worked in this field for many years.

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We're looking for you.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But...

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Xing Chen and Guang Hua can't be compared to such a big company.

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Our tolerance is not high.

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
In my previous work in Guang Hua,

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
there were indeed some differences.

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But after the promotion,

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I've been in the company for many times.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But I've grown a lot.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll do my best

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
to take out more serious attitude and face it.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If you join Xing Chen,

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
can you ensure that the problem doesn't happen again?

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes.

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I can enter the test period

120
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
like the others.

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You can see my performance

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and decide whether to continue using me.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Xing Chen's three months of test period

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
is looking forward to your advantageous performance.

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Thank you.

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I really want to join Xing Chen.

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If we work together,

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Xing Chen won't disappoint you.

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We're also a common business.

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We're both good at serving and serving.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay.

132
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Next one.

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're with Guang Hua and Jian Chenghuo.

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hello?

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What's wrong, Huang Wei?

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's not time to work yet.

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Good.

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
No.

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You...

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Are you having a hard time at work?

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Or do you have any misunderstandings with your colleague?

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No, don't rush to pack up.

143
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's go to my office.

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We're coming.

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's not easy to talk, Mr. Cheng.

146
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I think it's clear.

147
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I can't give Guang Hua.

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I can't give Guang Hua.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Tell me the reason.

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The resignation letter is clear.

151
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Since the start of the journey,

152
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I've become the backer of the project team.

153
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You and Lin Zhen Lun are going to be careful.

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No, I'm...

155
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What do I mean by staying here?

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Why don't we work together?

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Huang Wei Wei,

158
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
you have to think it over.

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's a first-class company.

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
No one knows what will happen in the future.

161
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It doesn't matter.

162
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Xing Cheng and Guang Hua are all the same.

163
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm the head of the company now.

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But,

165
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
you were too cautious at the beginning.

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You don't have this chance.

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What are you looking at?

168
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Good job.

169
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You're a hardworking employee like this.

170
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
How can you not be a long-time employee?

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Everyone,

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
after half a year,

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Dong Yi has made a new career.

174
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Director of AI department, Dr. Jiang Huai.

175
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You all know him.

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He has led the smart medical team

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and not only has he quickly completed the product generation upgrade,

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
but also has worked with many hospitals.

179
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This is the new director of the new product department, Luo Ping.

180
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The original product director has been taken by the foreign companies

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
to the Eastern Yangtze.

182
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
From now on,

183
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Dong Yi's medical equipment production line

184
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
will be in charge of Director Luo.

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Everyone,

186
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
congratulations.

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The software hardware combination

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
is the strategic strategy of Dong Yi's firm development.

189
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I hope Dr. Jiang and Director Luo

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
can work together

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
to achieve the full success of the business.

192
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
In addition,

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I want to announce one more thing.

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Director of the new product department, Zhang Xinhua,

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
is the reason for his resignation.

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The current director of the new product department,

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Director of the new product department,

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Wang Chong.

199
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You are all experienced professionals.

200
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I hope you can all gather

201
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and support the needs of the business.

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I only look at the results.

203
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why are you here?

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What's the matter?

205
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Is the reporter too much?

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He just moved in and he's been digging for me.

207
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I even gave him a flower basket recently.

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Dong Yi's internal encouragement is free and active.

209
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Isn't the staff's dancing and dancing technique normal?

210
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Now is the critical time for the new product department.

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He dug people away.

212
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm very anxious.

213
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
He just left the engineering department.

214
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He dug the core internal support.

215
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He's been in a slow state.

216
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He's been affected by Dong Yi in the end.

217
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But if Dr. Jiang Huai

218
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
can come here early to ask,

219
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
it shouldn't have a big impact.

220
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Don't worry.

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I remember what you promised.

222
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Dr. Jiang Huai's team

223
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
will be in the flower basket in two days.

224
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Really?

225
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's great.

226
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I...

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Sister Yuan is here.

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You two talk.

229
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm leaving.

230
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Sister.

231
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What's the matter?

232
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Sit.

233
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Don't pretend to be silly.

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Do you know what I'm here for?

235
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Dong Yi is such a big company.

236
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's normal for people to change.

237
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you come to me for those wrongdoers,

238
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
is there something wrong with you?

239
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Han Ting.

240
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
As the vice president of the Group, or Han's family,

241
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I have to remind you.

242
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If you want to change, don't be too serious.

243
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Just keep it a secret.

244
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're not responsible for the budget.

245
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You're so anxious to change

246
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
the people in charge of the core department

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
into yours.

248
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What can the people in the future see?

249
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What I want to do is to run away from time.

250
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
After all, I've been in front of the board of directors.

251
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Time is so tight.

252
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I can't come slowly.

253
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Am I right?

254
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yes.

255
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You're right.

256
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But don't forget.

257
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The staff you fired

258
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
were all fighting with Dong Yi for years.

259
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
They left.

260
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You have to start from scratch.

261
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Thank you for your reminder.

262
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I only knew that Dong Yi's development

263
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
was not a good luck for the company.

264
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But these staff.

265
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
These people

266
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
can't be left behind.

267
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You're so stubborn.

268
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Will Grandpa agree?

269
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Grandpa only sees the result.

270
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll use the nightfall to prove it.

271
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I have something else to do.

272
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Take care.

273
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Okay.

274
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'll wait and see.

275
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Okay.

276
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I won't let you down.

277
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Mr. Han.

278
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's four o'clock in the afternoon.

279
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Xing Chen is going to have a new year's meeting.

280
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Do you have time to attend?

281
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Look at the situation.

282
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Sister Li, let's go.

283
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Thank you.

284
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hello, Mr. Su.

285
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Mr. Ji.

286
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Mr. Ji.

287
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Mr. Ji, it's time to go.

288
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Okay, let's start.

289
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This is our...

290
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
This is...

291
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm so handsome.

292
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm so handsome.

293
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
This is our first official meeting

294
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
of Xing Chen's first official meeting

295
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
of the East Asia Grand Sino.

296
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We're going to discuss

297
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
the future strategy of Xing Chen.

298
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And the specific work arrangement.

299
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Do you have any ideas?

300
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Mr. Ji.

301
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We've spent a lot of time

302
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
on the model product.

303
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So I'm wondering

304
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
if we should make a new direction.

305
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I have some ideas.

306
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I want to go to the land of the old land.

307
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The sky is not cloudy.

308
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I don't doubt the courage of the future.

309
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So I want to go to the land of the old land.

310
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But I won't give up.

311
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I will always believe in the miracle.

312
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Even if there is no end to the journey.

313
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Tutor's there will be one output

314
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
in the future.

315
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So stop so eager and by scratch.

316
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So for the final judge,

317
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,080
What do you devise to develop

318
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,000
for theheld products of Brand Like His P мнеN?

319
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,600
If it's more suitable,

320
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,560
I believe

321
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,600
it will become a big advantage in the future.

322
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,800
Everyone has a good idea.

323
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,760
I hope that in the future,

324
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,840
everyone will keep this sensitivity

325
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,600
and communicate with each other more.

326
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,840
Ying Ying,

327
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,680
please send me the meeting record as soon as possible.

328
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,400
Okay, Mr. Ji.

329
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,080
No problem.

330
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,360
Mr. Su,

331
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,400
the printing machine will arrive in a few days.

332
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,120
Please make a test report as soon as possible.

333
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,760
Okay.

334
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,320
Lie,

335
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,800
please take the list of the employees

336
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,920
who have the original material.

337
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,040
The price will be paid in a minute.

338
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,120
Prepare the purchase.

339
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,800
Okay.

340
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,440
I hope that in the future,

341
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,760
everyone can become

342
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,600
a friend who pays for their work.

343
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,720
In life,

344
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,920
you can communicate with your friends

345
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,200
like friends.

346
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,240
Let's cheer for our new tomorrow.

347
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,640
Okay,

348
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,000
that's all for today.

349
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,640
The meeting is over.

350
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,520
Ms. He.

351
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
Who is this?

352
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,960
Our investor,

353
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,240
the president of the Eastern Medical Center,

354
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,200
Han Ting Han Song.

355
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,160
No way.

356
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,600
He is the boss.

357
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,720
Let's have a look at our meeting.

358
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,920
Such a big company.

359
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,040
Mr. Ji,

360
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,080
why don't you invite me to your office?

361
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,840
Please.

362
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,040
Mr. Han, please.

363
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:29,880
Mr. Han,

364
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,720
you haven't participated in

365
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,960
the meeting of such a first-class company, right?

366
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,240
Xiao Fan,

367
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,400
I've seen too many.

368
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,960
What's your point

369
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,360
of the meeting?

370
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,200
The dream of selling food and selling clothes

371
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,560
is the dream of building a company.

372
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,720
With Qin Huai and Meng Xiao's paintings,

373
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,120
they attract employees to sell profits.

374
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,120
Most of the first-class companies

375
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,200
do that.

376
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,640
I don't have paintings.

377
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,120
We are different from those

378
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,920
who sell food and sell dreams

379
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,640
and Qin Huai's paintings.

380
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,520
What's the difference?

381
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,280
We really have dreams.

382
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,680
And for employees,

383
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,520
I really want to

384
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,840
treat them as my friends.

385
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,560
My new city will provide them

386
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,200
a free and open working environment

387
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
and platform.

388
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,120
Let them develop and grow together.

389
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,400
Even if one day

390
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,760
someone leaves here,

391
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,520
I also hope that

392
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,680
Xing Chen can become their capital city.

393
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,080
Don't look at me like that.

394
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,120
We are different from others.

395
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,520
We will have good results in the future.

396
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Your confidence

397
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,840
is like money.

398
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,600
Who mentioned that

399
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,640
I want to remember

400
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,680
the dream of becoming a new one?

401
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,040
Yes.

402
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,840
It's a good thing to have dreams.

403
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,640
But to achieve them

404
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,320
is another thing.

405
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,360
The creative and management needs to be realized.

406
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,840
It's not just about Qin Huai's paintings.

407
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,680
People who can join the first-class companies

408
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,040
don't have dreams.

409
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,360
As a boss,

410
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,160
you have to pull them back to the ground.

411
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,440
It's more useful

412
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,320
to make the road more solid.

413
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,440
The product experiment plan is out.

414
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,760
Report to me.

415
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,880
Thank you for your support.

416
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,960
Otherwise,

417
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,960
Han Hai will not be here today.

418
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,960
I'm very excited

419
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,640
for this favor.

420
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,440
I just made a investment.

421
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,960
Han Hai can achieve today.

422
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,200
Mr. Chen is too hard.

423
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,040
But, Mr. Han,

424
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,040
Luo Ping is reliable.

425
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,320
After all, he just joined the East Medical Company.

426
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,000
If he knows that Han Hai is a young man,

427
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,520
will he...

428
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,720
Don't worry about that.

429
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,880
Before we hire Luo Ping,

430
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,760
I have a thorough investigation on him.

431
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,880
I'm relieved then.

432
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,160
Mr. Han.

433
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,440
Let me introduce you.

434
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,760
Han Hai Technology CEO Chen Yin Yang, Mr. Chen.

435
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,680
The director of East Medical Company, Luo Ping.

436
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,080
Mr. Chen, thank you.

437
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,960
Mr. Luo, you're a great person.

438
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,680
Sit.

439
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,120
I'll open the door.

440
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,280
I'll open the door and say it.

441
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,880
Next, East Medical Company

442
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,080
needs to strengthen its main product line.

443
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,520
It needs to use Han Hai Technology's support.

444
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,840
You two can talk more.

445
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:43,840
But,

446
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,240
you have to do a good job.

447
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,840
I understand.

448
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,040
To be honest,

449
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,120
I've always heard from Mr. Han

450
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
that East Medical Company is going to be a software combination

451
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,960
and join the 3D medical printing technology.

452
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,760
I've always thought that

453
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,920
we should cooperate with Xing Chen Technology.

454
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,680
I'm worried that we'll be waiting for a long time.

455
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,720
I didn't expect that we can

456
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,560
work together with Han Hai Technology.

457
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,840
I'm confident now.

458
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,480
Mr. Luo, you're welcome.

459
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,640
Han Hai Technology is just a few years

460
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,080
from Xing Chen Technology.

461
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Mr. Han can choose to invest in Xing Chen Technology.

462
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,360
Xing Chen Technology must have its own advantages.

463
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,080
I believe that the support of East Medical Company

464
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,240
can develop very quickly.

465
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,360
By then,

466
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,280
we can work together with Han Hai Technology.

467
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,760
Yes.

468
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,120
I believe in Mr. Han's vision

469
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,560
and Mr. Ji's ability.

470
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,080
Please.

471
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,520
What's wrong?

472
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,440
Are you in a bad mood?

473
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,160
No.

474
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,520
You think I'm in a bad mood?

475
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,800
What do you want to drink?

476
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,720
Go to the baby's room.

477
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,440
Okay.

478
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,920
What's the matter? What's the matter?

479
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,400
I can't give you anything if I'm fine.

480
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,800
He has xing pretty hair.

481
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,400
Why are you giving me a gift instead?

482
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,360
I heard that

483
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,920
your parents went to overseas to vacation

484
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,880
with Zeng Yuan Jiang.

485
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,400
I would know that

486
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,000
you were now in New York

487
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,600
until I entered an foreign territory.

488
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,480
And I left you with new letters in my heart.

489
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,520
It's a new age gift from you.

490
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm not sure.

491
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,280
It's good.

492
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,480
It suits you.

493
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,480
Tell me.

494
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,480
What's the matter?

495
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,040
I heard that Han Ting

496
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,480
has bought a new company.

497
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,480
She hasn't done anything yet.

498
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,680
She moved to Dorgon's Dasha.

499
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,920
What's that girl's name?

500
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,080
Ji Qing.

501
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,280
I'm not sure.

502
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,480
I'm not sure.

503
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,720
You're really

504
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
paying attention to Han Ting's move.

505
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,680
I'm not paying attention to Han Ting.

506
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,680
I'm paying attention to you.

507
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,680
Xing Chen moved to Guanghua.

508
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,680
It's obvious that he's on the stage.

509
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,680
Guanghua and Xing Chen

510
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,680
didn't have any competition in the business.

511
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,680
Where did you get the competition?

512
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,480
The competition is not only about business.

513
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,280
There's also emotional conflict.

514
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,680
It's also about your employee.

515
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,480
Now Han Ting is investing in her.

516
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,080
The door to the door

517
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,680
is open every day.

518
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,480
Everyone is in a bad mood.

519
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,480
It's just a former employee.

520
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,280
It's not appropriate.

521
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,280
Don't worry about me.

522
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,680
I think Han Ting

523
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,880
is changing her clothes

524
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,080
in the Da Dao Kuo mansion.

525
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,480
It's not a good thing for the same class.

526
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,280
So I need you and Guanghua.

527
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,680
If you don't give us a chance to promote,

528
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,480
we'll go to limitations.

529
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,880
Of course I will take the bad things.

530
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,280
Just do what you do.

531
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,520
I'll definitely give you.

532
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,160
I just hope you won't be wrong.

533
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,680
Mr. Chang,

534
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,880
you didn't get influenced by the company.

535
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,960
You're more important than me.

536
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,480
We'll talk about you tomorrow.

537
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,000
Hope we can keep the news online.

538
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,600
Sorry, director commendthing.

539
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:10,240
The main

540
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,720
has finally arrived.

541
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,120
I will go to the sky

542
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,920
I forgot the original myself

543
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,720
I will go to the sky

544
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,520
I want to know

545
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,120
The sky is not cloudy

546
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,520
There is a future for me

547
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,920
I do not doubt the courage of the guards

548
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,320
So I will go to the sky

549
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,120
I want to know

550
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,720
But I will never give up

551
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,120
I will always believe

552
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,720
Even if there is no miracle

553
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,120
I will continue to search

554
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,520
I will go to the sky

555
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,920
I want to know

556
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,120
But I will never give up

557
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,320
I will always believe

558
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,720
I will always believe

559
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,120
I want to know

560
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,720
Time is so exciting

561
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,520
Open your arms and breathe

562
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,520
When the wind blows, the sun rises

563
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,920
I can't see the crowd

564
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,720
The courage is like a night sky

565
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,720
I want to know

566
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,320
But I will never give up

567
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,720
I will go to the sky

568
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,520
I want to know

569
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,120
The destination of the unknown

570
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,520
When the road becomes clear

571
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,320
I will prove you

572
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:35,120
The meaning of your destiny

573
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,920
The equipment of the North Pole has arrived

574
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,320
The test is very successful

575
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,720
The next step is the process design plan

576
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,120
This part of the professionalism is more powerful

577
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,120
Do you need me to tell you?

578
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,520
Do you think I don't understand?

579
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,520
No, no, no, no

580
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,320
How is it possible?

581
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,320
I really have a place where I didn't see Connor

582
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,020
Please explain it to me

583
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:25,720
Where?

584
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
What's written about it?

585
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,320
T cliché

586
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
потрified and pure

587
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,920
Connor write himself a love spy

588
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,920
What is that?

589
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,080
to give you a discount.

590
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,440
Luckily, Mr. Ji

591
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,120
didn't write the initials.

592
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,000
Otherwise, it's hard to find the capital.

593
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,240
How is the company?

594
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,840
Everything is normal.

595
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,640
The source material is imported.

596
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,400
The supervision department is approved.

597
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,360
Xu Kezheng

598
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,240
is providing the information of the hospital's clinical report.

599
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,080
It's being resolved one by one.

600
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,000
Mr. Han, don't worry.

601
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,760
Before we invest,

602
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,400
we don't need much.

603
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,440
The registration application of the application

604
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,360
is already submitted.

605
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
It's waiting for the approval.

606
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,560
We're planning to

607
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,520
work with Kebo.

608
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,760
Their price is high,

609
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
quality is stable,

610
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,640
and the taste is good.

611
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,560
But the fixed product is also very much.

612
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,840
So the new product is also

613
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,000
on the line and selling goods.

614
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,720
The source material is not delivered,

615
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,280
and the empty oil is printed.

616
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,360
It's not like it's in a beautiful pot.

617
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,360
How do you recommend the product experiment?

618
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,880
I'll think of another way.

619
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,840
Do you need my help?

620
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,160
Can I?

621
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,040
Then

622
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,880
I still need it.

623
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,000
Five percent of the shares.

624
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,840
It seems that it's not so necessary.

625
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,840
Well,

626
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,760
you can do it.

627
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,720
I'll go and find the source material.

628
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,000
Am I so hard-working?

629
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:40,960
Ji Qing.

630
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,320
Hello.

631
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,440
Come to see my uncle?

632
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,720
We're talking about work.

633
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm also here.

634
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,560
I came to see him to get the investment today.

635
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,520
It's a business with the capital.

636
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,160
I wish you all the best.

637
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,320
I'll go first.

638
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
Why is it not going well?

639
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,280
The server is full, right?

640
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,520
Uncle.

641
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:13,960
Yes.

642
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,840
No, not yet.

643
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,760
However,

644
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
I haven't made a copy.

645
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:27,920
I just bought some because I heard it was so nice to�

646
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,360
buy again or sell again.

647
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,440
But good stuff.

648
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,080
Some things appear like a hetero爽

649
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:34,460
or a true

650
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,320
magazine girl.

651
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:37,880
Si.

652
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,040
Si.

653
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,120
There's an文件 you need to sign it.

654
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,960
I'll see you later.

655
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,680
Sister Li Li,

656
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,040
your hat is so beautiful.

657
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,840
Mr. Li,

658
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,920
I heard from my friend

659
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,520
that your bag is broken.

660
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,240
I haven't bought it in Xinjiang recently.

661
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,360
The bag is so strong.

662
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,680
Of course.

663
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,280
They don't have internet stores.

664
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,040
They are all fake goods.

665
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,840
All fake goods?

666
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,080
Is it true?

667
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:22,920
Sister Li Li,

668
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,280
how can you

669
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,600
identify these bags?

670
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,080
Is it good or bad?

671
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,320
What do you know about girls?

672
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,440
Sister Li Li,

673
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,520
this is your boyfriend's gift.

674
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,480
Your boyfriend must love you

675
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,080
and spend so much money on you.

676
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,720
You must be so happy.

677
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,760
Okay, we're done.

678
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,880
You guys should get to work.

679
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:44,880
Let's go.

680
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,840
Let's go.

681
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,160
Listen,

682
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,480
my plan is perfect.

683
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,600
I'll definitely

684
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,960
find the right amount of money.

685
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,200
If you don't want to be in trouble,

686
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
you can take it with you.

687
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,040
What do you know?

688
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,840
Young people are really old-fashioned.

689
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,280
They are fashionists.

690
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,520
Oh, right.

691
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,640
I've found the place

692
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,400
where I'll be going.

693
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,240
I've made

694
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,840
300 bottles of wine and dishes.

695
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,240
And every year,

696
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,560
there will be a special activity.

697
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,160
I go to this place often.

698
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,160
Everyone, please.

699
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,320
Tell me,

700
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,520
what do you want to tell your grandma?

701
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,160
This is the name of the bar.

702
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,880
This is...

703
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,040
The handsome guy from the bar.

704
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,640
Let me tell you.

705
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,200
This bar will definitely be alive.

706
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,440
It's good for the land and the bar.

707
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,000
Didn't I take you there?

708
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,440
You should have drunk that one.

709
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,000
The location is not clear enough.

710
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,640
The model is too large.

711
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,600
There is no difference with the class.

712
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,040
The street is 200 meters long.

713
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,720
There are only 9, 8, 9, 5, 6 houses.

714
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,920
Why do people come here to spend money?

715
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Your plan is not good.

716
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,880
You can't find the place

717
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,280
where you want to be in the middle of the promotion.

718
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,640
We are looking for a plan.

719
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,040
I'll change it.

720
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
I'll go back and change it.

721
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,920
The agent said that

722
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,120
you are a capitalist.

723
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,560
You don't need to work for us.

724
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,480
Come on, Mr. Ma.

725
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,600
Try it.

726
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,000
Okay.

727
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,040
It's especially good for people

728
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,520
from Hangzhou to be famous.

729
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,560
Okay.

730
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,680
Thank you for this time.

731
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,760
It's okay.

732
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,520
But I'm worried about this.

733
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,320
Will I offend Mr. Han?

734
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,080
After all, the schedule

735
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,360
is his.

736
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,120
We are not giving him the raw materials.

737
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,840
It's just taking a while.

738
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,400
Besides,

739
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,320
there are so many fixed-end companies.

740
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,200
There is always a new path.

741
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,520
By the way, Mr. Ma.

742
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,160
My grandpa said

743
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,040
he would invite you to eat at home in two days.

744
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,480
Mr. Sun.

745
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,880
What's the matter?

746
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,160
I'll call you back.

747
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,760
Okay. No problem.

748
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,080
I'll make an appointment for you.

749
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,480
Okay.

750
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,000
Sorry.

751
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,400
The number you dialed

752
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,800
is temporarily unavailable.

753
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,240
Please call later.

754
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,760
Mr. Ma still doesn't answer the phone.

755
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,520
Han Ting is right.

756
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,600
It's useless to eat with them for ten thousand times.

757
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,280
Enough. Don't think so much.

758
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,840
I'll think of a way.

759
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,840
I'll contact Mr. Ma.

760
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,760
If it's not enough,

761
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,840
I'll go to the company to find him.

762
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,440
I'll go now.

763
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,400
Thanks for watching.

764
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,680
after no more reports from State University

765
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,600
excavations

766
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,040
will begin.

767
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,200
I am sorry.

768
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,800
Bon McK Advisor.

769
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,760
δ

770
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,400
Wait a minute.

771
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,680
Your beef is ready. Take care.

772
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,200
I think he's a student.

773
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,240
He's quite simple.

774
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,880
He's a student.

775
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,200
Oh, right.

776
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,920
He seems to like drinking.

777
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,040
He's looking for our Dean to drink with us

778
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,120
as soon as he has time.

779
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,640
But you know,

780
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,520
he's a big card like him.

781
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,120
We can't say anything about him.

782
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,600
If he wants to, I don't want to talk to him.

783
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,080
But the key is that

784
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,320
we need a lot of materials

785
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,320
that are not too big.

786
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,520
But we need a lot of materials.

787
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,400
We need the most materials.

788
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,480
It's hard to find a way to save them.

789
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,760
It's okay.

790
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,280
I'll help you figure it out.

791
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,480
Xing Xing...

792
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,600
doesn't care about this?

793
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,800
The company is in a hurry.

794
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,920
He's out of control.

795
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,480
I'll solve this.

796
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,000
How is he now?

797
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,640
He broke up with Yichen for so long.

798
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,920
Is he still single?

799
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,840
He's not in a good time to date.

800
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,440
But someone is chasing him.

801
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,080
Who's chasing him?

802
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,680
Okay.

803
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,280
Let's not talk about it today.

804
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,640
That's not important.

805
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,800
The most important thing for a woman is to get a job.

806
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,160
You just said that

807
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,520
Mato likes to drink.

808
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,200
He likes to drink.

809
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,680
He likes to drink.

810
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,440
Mato.

811
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,360
Mr. Li.

812
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,280
That Mato is really insincere.

813
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,080
He wasted my time.

814
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,120
Where's the Mato now?

815
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,680
He's on the toilet.

816
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,560
I'll think of another way.

817
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,040
Bye.

818
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,560
What's wrong?

819
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
You're so anxious.

820
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,440
About the materials.

821
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,800
It's been too long since the rehearsal.

822
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,320
The company hasn't been waiting for long.

823
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,400
I just met Mr. Ma of the customer material.

824
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,200
But he won't help.

825
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,440
Okay.

826
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,840
I can't finish my work.

827
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,840
Don't be in your mood

828
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,160
because of my work.

829
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,320
Where are you working now?

830
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,040
Xing Chen.

831
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,680
Xing Chen Technology.

832
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,360
No wonder you always

833
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,720
drive under the sun in the East.

834
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,640
You went to Xing Chen.

835
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,920
You've heard of our company?

836
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,360
It's a little bit.

837
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,960
Then...

838
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,960
You haven't eaten well, have you?

839
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,080
What do you want to eat?

840
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,640
Pick a dish.

841
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
I'll pick a place.

842
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,440
It's spicy.

843
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,400
The spicier the better.

844
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,360
Let's go.

845
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,080
You can come with us here tomorrow.

846
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,320
Don't give me that face.

847
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,160
I'll come with you.

848
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,440
Oh, yeah.

849
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,800
Don't get worked up.

850
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,320
How about this?

851
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:44,920
Go ahead.

852
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,740
There's no good English in the company.

853
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,720
Tell me.

854
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,440
Okay.

855
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,500
I'll eat with you.

856
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,120
It's so hot in those days.

857
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,160
because you were excited.

858
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,960
But you...

859
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,480
Why are you hitting so many times?

860
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,480
Time to eat.

861
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,560
Hello, everyone.

862
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,200
I'm Nianmeng's chef, Cong Minguo.

863
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,240
I'm here to take you to the restaurant.

864
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,800
This restaurant is the treasure shop

865
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,320
that I and my best friend, Chang'an, have been looking for.

866
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,680
Let's go to the restaurant.

867
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,880
I smelled a strong coffee aroma when I came in.

868
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,040
And there's a lot of green juice.

869
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,640
It really makes me feel so excited.

870
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,480
Here, here.

871
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,800
Here is the place

872
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,440
that I and my best friend have been looking for.

873
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,000
Okay, let's take a look at the camera.

874
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,280
I can't wait to order a cup of coffee.

875
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,000
This...

876
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,640
This chair is very comfortable.

877
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,840
It's very big and soft.

878
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,800
If you need to work for a long time,

879
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,680
this place is definitely your second choice.

880
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,000
I've already put the address

881
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,640
in the link below the video.

882
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Thank you.

883
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,640
Thank you for the gift Mr. Lu gave us.

884
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,640
Thank you.

885
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,640
Thank you for your attention.

886
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,120
Look.

887
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,440
Mr. Lu asked,

888
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,720
now young people like to go to the bar.

889
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,120
There's no one to come to the coffee shop.

890
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,120
But we're going to have a coffee shop today.

891
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,640
That's right.

892
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,720
So today we're going to take the theme here.

893
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,320
But I've thought about it.

894
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,320
I think Mr. Lu's theme is still good.

895
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,120
If you have any ideas for bar,

896
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,920
you can post it on the public screen.

897
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,640
We can also do a homework in advance, right?

898
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,640
We like to go to places where there are many young people.

899
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,880
Handsome, beautiful, right, right, right.

900
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,480
It seems that your ideas for bar are very good.

901
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,640
Okay, next time we'll plan a trip to bar.

902
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,640
Mr. Lu asked,

903
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,600
what kind of bar Guo Guo likes?

904
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,560
I personally think that

905
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,760
the kind of live house is quite good.

906
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,560
The singer is singing on the stage.

907
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,000
And the guest can drink and chat under it.

908
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,280
It's not too noisy.

909
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,000
And because I'm a host,

910
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,360
I think if there's a big screen in bar,

911
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,640
it can make the guest feel more comfortable.

912
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,040
So I think that

913
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,640
there's a big screen

914
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,120
that can make the guest feel the mood and feelings at the time.

915
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,320
And return it to everyone through the way of the bar.

916
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,440
This idea might be interesting.

917
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,640
Thank you.

918
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,600
Thank you for Mr. Lu's big gift.

919
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,120
Thank you.

920
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,880
Okay, everyone.

921
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,320
Please subscribe and add a comment.

922
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,880
Don't miss it.

923
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,920
Today is the trip to bar, right?

924
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,520
I've already ordered coffee.

925
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,560
It's so easy.

926
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,240
Let's see the process of making coffee.

927
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,240
Mr. Lu,

928
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,680
I've already sent the new batch of goods to you.

929
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,240
You must have the goods within a month.

930
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,840
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

931
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,640
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

932
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,920
It's time for you to come.

933
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,560
The problem is solved.

934
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,400
It's good that it's solved.

935
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,720
You helped me.

936
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,480
You helped me.

937
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,560
There's a friend who knows Mr. Ma.

938
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,720
Please give him a hand.

939
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,640
Didn't I say that

940
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,960
I don't need you to help me solve the problem on work?

941
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,880
I'm sorry.

942
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,120

00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,880
I'm sorry.

949
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,880

I'm sorry.

967
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,240
If I can get closer to you

968
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,240
can I recharge my memory?

969
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,240
Time goes by so fast

970
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,240
that I can at least be safe.

971
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,200
Don't let the past

972
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,200
become a adventure.

973
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,200
I'm sorry.

974
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
