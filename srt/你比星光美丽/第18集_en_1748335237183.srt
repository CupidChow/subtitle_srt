1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to the far-away land.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I won't hesitate to be the future me.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm afraid I'll have no courage.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'm going to the far-away land.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't give up.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll be lost in the dark.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
episodes 15

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Spicy and spicy?

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Spicy and spicy?

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll only eat spicy.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Introduce yourself.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What are you doing here?

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I have to go.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I just ate.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,840
I just had lunch.

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,960
Did you go out for fun?

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,560
No.

27
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,960
I was just doing homework in the room.

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,760
Don't think I'm a fool.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,160
What homework did you do?

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,640
Business secret.

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,920
Business secret.

32
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,280
Mr. Han.

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,280
Mr. Tong.

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,600
Long time no see.

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,560
It seems that this restaurant is very famous.

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,240
Even Mr. Han can shine.

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,960
Your technology medical data is very good.

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,800
I even want to find you a job.

39
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,800
What a coincidence.

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,880
I'm also paying attention to your Dong Yi's smart doctor.

41
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,120
I'm thinking of taking the chance to talk with you

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,600
and work with you.

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,840
Let me introduce you.

44
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,000
This is Ji Qing.

45
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,600
The boss of the new technology.

46
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
The company just started.

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,480
He specialized in 3D medical treatment.

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,920
You should be interested.

49
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,160
I heard that

50
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,040
it's the company that Mr. Han invested in.

51
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,360
I didn't expect that Mr. Ji is so young.

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
Mr. Peng, hello.

53
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,600
I used to be an AI medical robot.

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,360
I'm more interested in data.

55
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,400
I saw the AI data

56
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,520
that you published before.

57
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,000
It's very useful for the development of the AI data.

58
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,520
It's very big for me.

59
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,840
I came here to study.

60
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm looking forward to your speech.

61
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,720
That's all, Mr. Ji.

62
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,680
After this discussion,

63
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,280
I'll ask Mr. Peng to work in the new technology.

64
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,800
I'm not afraid of it.

65
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,800
Mr. Peng, this is my name card.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,960
Nice to meet you.

67
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,520
I'm glad to meet you.

68
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,160
Thank you.

69
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,160
Mr. Han, Mr. Ji,

70
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,640
let's meet in the forum.

71
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,960
I have friends there.

72
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,520
Take care.

73
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,200
It's not a big deal.

74
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,520
Goodbye.

75
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,080
Goodbye.

76
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,600
So, you're learning these things.

77
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,400
You should know the background of the guests.

78
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,640
You should focus more on the forum

79
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,520
when you go to the forum.

80
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,920
It seems that the Ministry of Public Affairs of Xincheng

81
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,000
is not in need of people.

82
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,080
I think you're praising me.

83
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,840
Here's your water.

84
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:49,880
Thank you.

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,720
Wait a minute.

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,400
Please wipe the floor for me.

87
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,640
Okay. Please wait a minute.

88
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,000
Mr. Lu, what are you doing?

89
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,360
You're here.

90
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,880
We've made a deal.

91
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,640
These are the equipment

92
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,640
I sent across free of charge.

93
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,120
I'm waiting for you.

94
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,120
What is it?

95
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,720
I feel lazy.

96
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,400
The most part of the wall following the..?

97
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,840
I'm a good girl.

98
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,740
Happy time with a dream.

99
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,180
The youth is laughing at me!

100
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,020
One.

101
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,860
Before you came,

102
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,700
you only told me

103
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,700
that you wanted me to show you

104
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,340
the condition of the bar.

105
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:23,900
But you didn't tell me

106
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,340
to watch the show.

107
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,540
Uncle.

108
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,580
Uncle.

109
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,180
I'm not good at singing.

110
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,580
You're a professional.

111
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,380
You sing.

112
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,420
Come on, you sing.

113
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,820
I...

114
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,420
Okay, I'll help you.

115
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,020
Come on.

116
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,820
Thank you.

117
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,980
Give it to me.

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,580
Sing.

119
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,880
As sound as I can?

120
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,200
Yes.

121
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,920
Day 8

122
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,580
Where are you?

123
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,620
That's good,

124
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,940
but I need your bike with me.

125
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,020
I wanted your bike.

126
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,380
I'm going too far.

127
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,940
I'll go this way.

128
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,420
We'll take the boat and ride there.

129
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,100
The US presents

130
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,100
will make you crowded

131
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,620
for 100,000 doses.

132
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,620
Who will going with it?

133
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,700
particularly

134
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,980
Can we get it?

135
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,820
We don't have to.

136
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,340
How about it?

137
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,780
Perfect.

138
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,140
Bye!

139
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:08,940
Come again!

140
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,700
Everyone!

141
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,540
See you.

142
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,780
Come again!

143
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,620
That's not good.

144
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,340
You're a professional athlete.

145
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,580
I'll give you a comparison.

146
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,540
You're a self-sacrificing member.

147
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,860
No, no.

148
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,420
You can't sing.

149
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,660
But you're good at singing.

150
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,140
You can consider going to Ripe.

151
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,220
Thank you.

152
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,780
How about this?

153
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,580
Come to my bar and sing.

154
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,180
I'll consider it.

155
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,460
You're weird.

156
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,900
Why did I hate him?

157
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,460
Which one is weird?

158
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,780
Here it comes.

159
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,500
Nice.

160
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,340
You're good at singing.

161
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,140
At least you're better than me.

162
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:30,820
Try it.

163
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,740
It's pretty.

164
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,500
It's good.

165
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,380
By the way,

166
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,860
I just wanted to say

167
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,380
that you're too straightforward.

168
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,340
It's hard to eat.

169
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,020
But you're good at romance and poetry.

170
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,260
Really?

171
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,700
What's your idea?

172
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,300
Business is good.

173
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,820
Food is not just wine.

174
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,660
It's also fantasy.

175
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,260
Look at this.

176
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,740
Dragon snake, blue sunrise.

177
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,260
If you change it

178
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,660
to a bar,

179
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,900
do you want to try it

180
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,980
when you're at work?

181
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Well,

182
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,340
I can change it

183
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,700
to drink it.

184
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,460
Then, I can change it to

185
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,900
drink it.

186
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,940
What?

187
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,220
No.

188
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,580
It's to make a difference.

189
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,100
I'm not asking you to do magic.

190
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,100
What are you doing?

191
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,820
I think

192
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,700
we should have

193
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,980
a wine that's white.

194
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,540
This kind of wine

195
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,860
is not too high in temperature.

196
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,020
The color should be cute.

197
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,500
It's made with

198
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,180
the wine.

199
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,580
What's the name of this wine?

200
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,260
It's called

201
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,860
1 plus 1 equals 2.

202
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,020
Why not 2?

203
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,220
Because

204
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,740
it's a positive change.

205
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,580
This is cute.

206
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,100
Right?

207
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,540
Thank you.

208
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,460
I heard from Mr. Gu

209
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,020
that you and I had lunch together.

210
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,740
I'm near the restaurant.

211
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,740
Do you want to have lunch together?

212
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,740
Ji Xin,

213
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,820
what a coincidence.

214
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,540
What a coincidence.

215
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,740
Mr. Zeng.

216
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,780
I knew you were here.

217
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,380
I came here after taking the plane.

218
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,100
I want to talk to Mr. Ji.

219
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,420
Yes.

220
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:37,980
Mr. Ji,

221
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,180
since you started,

222
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:54,620
you've just

223
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,180
found Lemony.

224
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,140
Ambassador Huai totally

225
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,940
stole it.

226
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,060
Yes.

227
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,060
It's not far from here.

228
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,140
Come and have a look if you have time.

229
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,180
After all, it's Guanghua's old employee.

230
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,540
He also contributed a lot for the company.

231
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,900
When he suddenly resigned,

232
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,660
I and Mr. Chen felt sorry for him.

233
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,820
Thank you for your invitation, Mr. Chen.

234
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,340
I'm sorry for what I said.

235
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,900
It wasn't a happy time

236
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,940
to leave Guanghua.

237
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,060
Everyone blamed me

238
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,220
for the opening of the pig's eyes.

239
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,860
I didn't understand it at that time.

240
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,660
But I understand now.

241
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,220
If something happens,

242
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,500
someone will be sad.

243
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,100
So,

244
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,020
I really owe you an apology.

245
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,220
I just thought

246
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,020
that I could get angry for you

247
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,140
except for the pig's eyes.

248
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,380
I didn't expect

249
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,100
that you would be

250
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,500
getting more and more misunderstood.

251
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,140
The restaurant has not changed at all.

252
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,340
It's the first time

253
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,060
I recommended this restaurant

254
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,380
when I attended the Shenzhen Feng Hui.

255
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,260
At that time,

256
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,660
Guanghua was still a starting point.

257
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,740
Thanks to you,

258
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,500
I introduced a lot of personnel resources.

259
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,860
That's why Guanghua sold the first step.

260
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,220
That's why it established

261
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,540
a long-term cooperation with so many good companies.

262
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,540
Just like Ji Xin contacted the North.

263
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,740
We all came here like that.

264
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,100
I have work to do.

265
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,020
I'm leaving first.

266
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,220
I won't be busy for a while.

267
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,260
I'll have a good meal.

268
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,900
Work is important.

269
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,100
Go back to work.

270
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,660
Do you want to know?

271
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:59,860
It's a good way to do Hasta Dali Hand

272
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,580
Sir, your duty have ended

273
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,100
Ε never thought

274
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,660
you like to eat garlic

275
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,140
Just like how we did

276
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,180
扶 Imperial Garden

277
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,500
Hello, Mr.

278
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,660
I'll pack this.

279
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,260
Okay, sir. Please wait.

280
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,340
Ji Xin is now the boss of Xing Chen.

281
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,020
She's not a broad-minded employee.

282
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,980
Don't bother with the old old man anymore.

283
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,860
I just want to save her.

284
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,500
Who knows if she'll get over it.

285
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,740
Why does she do this?

286
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,180
Don't you feel bad?

287
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,140
Sir, your bag is ready.

288
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,940
Thank you.

289
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,180
I'll get this lady.

290
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,300
Okay, please wait.

291
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,500
You come first.

292
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,860
I'll leave after dinner.

293
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,900
Ni Xiao is still affected

294
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,620
by his rugged celebrity himself.

295
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,860
Please consider that his position remains a misunderstanding.

296
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,300
Since we are roads,

297
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,780
I could just call Mi Chen a rascal.

298
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,100
I hope planting big trees

299
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,700
helps Mr. Ling funktioniert.

300
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,580
Please keep an eye on him.

301
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,260
If that's more serious,

302
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,340
just call the officer mentioned.

303
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,380
It's important for him

304
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,700
to be the voice of an ordinary person.

305
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,420
Don't try to make trouble for what happens.

306
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,540
Qingqing, what's wrong with you?

307
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,540
I just met Zeng Di in the restaurant.

308
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,180
I saw him and he was annoyed.

309
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,980
Everything is because of him.

310
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,620
But there's no possibility

311
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,180
that he and Han Ting's relationship

312
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,140
is not clear.

313
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,940
So it's just a coincidence.

314
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,140
What's the relationship between him and Han Ting?

315
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,900
What's the relationship between me and Han Ting?

316
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,700
What's the problem?

317
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,580
Did I make the right choice?

318
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,420
You might be hungry too.

319
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,380
I'll get going.

320
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,540
You can go ahead.

321
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,580
I'll wait for you.

322
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,820
Bye.

323
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,220
Another drink?

324
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,820
When did you come, Mr. Chang?

325
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,700
It's been awhile by myself.

326
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,260
You have a hard time with this necktie.

327
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,540
I forgot my books.

328
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,140
I'll go and have a drink with you.

329
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,900
Are your feelings害 awake?

330
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,620
cozy?

331
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,020
Come.

332
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,540
I remember you didn't like

333
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,380
to participate in this forum.

334
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,460
You should know

335
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,980
who I am for.

336
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,540
Mr. Chang,

337
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,860
I can't stand

338
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,060
your words.

339
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,820
What can't you stand?

340
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,100
I'm happy to be with you.

341
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,740
I'm happy to be with you.

342
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,540
This is...

343
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,060
The one you took at the auction two days ago.

344
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,140
Mr. Chang,

345
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,780
you're sending me necklace and watch.

346
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,100
You're so popular every day.

347
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,820
I...

348
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,620
I don't know how to repay you.

349
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,460
Sometimes,

350
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,460
I'm happy to be with you

351
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,780
when I'm in the same team.

352
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,460
Don't be stressed.

353
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,860
Besides, I'm happy to be with you

354
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,540
because I know you're in love.

355
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,060
Those who don't want to be with you

356
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,420
are willing to pay you a visit.

357
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,980
The business cooperation is the same.

358
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,260
At the end of the day,

359
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,100
you're still drinking with someone.

360
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,860
You can choose.

361
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,900
How about

362
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,220
giving you Han Tian back?

363
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,220
I'll give you

364
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,620
the same one

365
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,780
that Dong Yi can't give you.

366
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,100
Dong Yi can give you

367
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,620
the same one for double.

368
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,580
Thank you for your love.

369
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,620
But Han Tian has voted for me.

370
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,180
I can't be Dong Yi.

371
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,780
I believe Mr. Chang doesn't like

372
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,460
people who don't read old books.

373
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,860
I remember your kindness.

374
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,780
But this gift is too precious.

375
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,060
I can't accept it.

376
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,100
Thank you for your kind words.

377
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,460
Don't worry.

378
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,700
Take your time.

379
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,300
You're energetic.

380
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,260
You ran so far without eating.

381
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,740
I'm so angry.

382
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,100
I'm tired.

383
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,620
Do you still eat this?

384
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,340
Zendi is a boss of a company.

385
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,540
Why are you arguing with him?

386
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,620
What's wrong with him?

387
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,820
Why did I leave Guanghua?

388
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,900
He didn't lose.

389
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,540
I'm glad he won.

390
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,460
I don't see you

391
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,700
anything if you think you suklen.

392
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,820
That's the only way to save the personal enriched.

393
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,060
To take away people's Coblishness

394
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,060
like he did to all of you.

395
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,740
He wouldn't mention me

396
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,900
if I held him higher.

397
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,660
Won't cause a quarrel?

398
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,980
You share his feelings

399
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,380
with your friends and children

400
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,300
like you're glamored for on5-6 days.

401
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,780
Do you think

402
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:57,980
personal capitalize on wealth

403
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,580
will rarely improve results?

404
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,800
Mr. right.

405
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,420
Mr. X...

406
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,580
At ease.

407
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,180
What internal pressure?

408
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,960
I watched your good work.

409
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,040
The magic of love.

410
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,700
Pulling the billboard was a good idea.

411
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,980
How is it behind the table?

412
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,800
You know your punch routine.

413
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,360
Look. I left Guanghua And I'm lucky.

414
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,920
Eat it.

415
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,920
It's cold.

416
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,040
Where are you going?

417
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,360
To work.

418
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:11,400
The

419
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:26,980
is

420
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,540
Mr. Zeng.

421
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,540
Ji Xing.

422
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,940
Where's your seat?

423
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,940
Here.

424
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,420
Sit down.

425
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,420
We'll talk later.

426
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:47,940
Hi.

427
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,740
Why are you here?

428
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,740
Long time no see.

429
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,740
Welcome to Shenzhen AI Medical High-end forum.

430
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,340
I'm the representative of the team

431
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,780
of the guests.

432
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,500
Welcome.

433
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,220
Since the start of the industrial revolution,

434
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,620
every century has experienced

435
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,340
two major technological changes.

436
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,220
Now, the era of artificial intelligence

437
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,020
has come.

438
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,740
Medical is in the peak.

439
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,900
This time, AI Medical High-end forum

440
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,700
has also gathered

441
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,300
the elite personnel in the domestic medical industry.

442
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,740
I hope you can get what you want

443
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,500
in the speech and speech.

444
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,460
Now, I'll announce

445
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,620
the official start of this high-end forum.

446
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,740
First, let's welcome the guest of the opening

447
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,140
of the Eastern Medical High-end Forum,

448
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,460
Mr. Fan Ting,

449
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,460
to bring us a wonderful speech.

450
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,460
Please.

451
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,580
There will be various meetings and forum

452
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,460
in the next three or five days.

453
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,460
Each circle is like this.

454
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,780
There are not many things to do

455
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,300
and there are not many speeches.

456
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,300
I do have a lot to do.

457
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,900
Of course, there are not many paintings.

458
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,940
The industry is always

459
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,060
the most important problem

460
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,940
for the entrepreneurs.

461
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,820
Although I can't predict the future,

462
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,100
I want to talk with you

463
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,740
about the future development of the medical industry.

464
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,940
The whole medical history of the Songguan

465
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,940
has been developed.

466
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,180
People have always been

467
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,660
the traditional medical school

468
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,740
that has been developed from the beginning.

469
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,420
It has developed into a system

470
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,460
that is related to technology and the secret of the secret.

471
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,060
It is no better than the era

472
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,340
of the system medical and intellectual medical.

473
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,740
The trend of the era has been changing constantly.

474
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,740
And the needs of people and the market

475
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,340
are also changing at any time.

476
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,580
What kind of soil

477
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,500
will be the flower?

478
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,020
The flower of the red crown

479
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,060
is the foundation of industrial development

480
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,140
and the soil of the industrial growth.

481
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,940
It includes a series of

482
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,420
foreign key that can affect industrial development.

483
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,740
We can be from politics, society, economy...

484
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,780
It's a gold.

485
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,380
It will always shine.

486
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,220
You may be a gold.

487
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,820
But don't forget that

488
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,220
in this city,

489
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,140
the land is all gold.

490
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,820
I believe that

491
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,500
the future medical industry

492
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,180
will lead to the development of the economy.

493
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,780
The wave of the future is coming.

494
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,100
What our companies are going to do

495
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,860
is not to lead the trend,

496
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,980
but to lead the trend.

497
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,740
I hope that everyone who is doing this

498
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,260
can learn to be together

499
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,780
and contribute to the development of the country

500
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,460
and the industrial development

501
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,820
and the strength of the companies.

502
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,860
Thank you.

503
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,420
Thank you for your wonderful speech.

504
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,780
I believe that everyone

505
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,060
listened to Mr. Han's speech.

506
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,660
There must be a lot of questions

507
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,100
to ask Mr. Han.

508
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,420
Now, we have 10 minutes to ask questions.

509
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,900
Please come again

510
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,740
and raise your hand.

511
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,700
Mr. Han, let's step together

512
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,260
to our stage.

513
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,660
It seems that there are a lot of people

514
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,780
who want to ask Mr. Han.

515
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,220
Mr. Han, you can choose.

516
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,860
The lady in blue.

517
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,860
Mr. Han, hello.

518
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,700
I want to ask

519
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,100
what specific layout and planning

520
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,660
Dong Yi is doing in the wisdom treatment?

521
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,660
Mr. Han, hello.

522
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,780
Mr. Han, hello.

523
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,340
Mr. Han, hello.

524
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,620
Mr. Han, hello.

525
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,220
Mr. Han, hello.

526
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,820
Mr. Han, hello.

527
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,020
Mr. Han, hello.

528
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,780
Mr. Han, hello.

529
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,420
Mr. Han, hello.

530
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,460
Mr. Han, hello.

531
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,220
Okay, everyone.

532
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,140
Because of the time,

533
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,660
we still have one last question left.

534
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,100
Please come again.

535
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,540
The last lady with short hair.

536
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,860
Thank you.

537
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,500
Mr. Han, you said that

538
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,300
the company is not to lead the market

539
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,900
but to lead the market in a smooth way.

540
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,900
But it seems that

541
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,340
the company's main function

542
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,900
is to deny the company's identity.

543
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,020
Isn't it that the company

544
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,500
leading the market

545
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,300
is more competitive?

546
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,300
Yes.

547
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,100
The book of wisdom is indeed written like this.

548
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,260
But compared to the failure,

549
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,500
the personal power is too small.

550
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,500
The power is too small.

551
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Instead of leading,

552
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,140
it's better to make it faster

553
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,580
than others

554
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,220
and find the opportunity to change the era.

555
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,820
It's a change in the era.

556
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,660
If you overestimate the money,

557
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,420
you have to make sure

558
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,860
you can hold on to the path of your own era.

559
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,020
The right time and the right thing to do

560
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,100
will be a step closer to success.

561
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,660
What Dongyang did

562
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,660
was to find the needs of the real-world analysis data.

563
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,140
In the same mistake,

564
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,820
he used the time to make a move.

565
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,100
But for the small-scale enterprises,

566
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,420
they want to conquer the world as soon as they get there.

567
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,580
They want to learn how to use the wind and the Yangtze River to open the line.

568
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,980
From a young age,

569
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,300
they want to be the brick and the gold.

570
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,420
This is the first step.

571
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,420
I don't know

572
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,660
if this answer can solve the problem you mentioned.

573
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,900
Thank you, Mr. Han. I understand.

574
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,620
Wait a minute.

575
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,180
Let me introduce you to everyone.

576
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,060
This woman

577
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,660
is the chief manager of Xing Chen Technology.

578
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,860
Xing Chen Technology is a company

579
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,100
that invests in the three-day medical treatment

580
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,820
to seal the company's initial creation.

581
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,180
The three-day medical treatment is very high.

582
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,500
It's much harder than the first and second layer.

583
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,420
I hope

584
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,100
Mr. Ji can lead Xing Chen Technology

585
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,380
to fill the era of control and keep it up.

586
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,700
Manager Feng,

587
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,900
what are you doing at Put you change obviously?

588
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:22,980
Quiet!

589
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,940
overflowing來到

590
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,540
Come out here!

591
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,420
enhaca

592
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,460
Sing Chen will not abandon Mr. Han's hope.

593
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,940
Ourそれでは procedure

594
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,500
It's not dieing.

595
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:58,860
Mr. meals.

596
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,220
Your brother

597
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,940
can go anywhere and have a toast.

598
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,340
Dong Yi and Tong Ke are competitors in the competition.

599
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,740
But I have to admit,

600
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,500
Han Ting is really attractive.

601
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,940
I don't know how much he can take

602
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,980
when he's talking about it.

603
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,500
Being his competitor

604
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,780
is not easy.

605
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,220
When the meeting is over,

606
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,780
let's have a cup of tea together.

607
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,460
Mr. Chang,

608
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,860
with Dong Yang and Tong Ke's relationship,

609
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,460
do you think I can agree?

610
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,340
There's only one benefit between the killer.

611
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,220
And the benefit of the family

612
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,780
is that you can make me live.

613
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,820
I have a good idea.

614
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,060
I believe you will be very interested.

615
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,940
When you have time,

616
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,820
why don't you sit down and listen to it?

617
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:08,780
Get down.

618
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:11,860
Go.

619
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,700
Get down.

620
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,300
Qin Dong.

621
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,820
What are you looking at, Su Ge?

622
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,260
Mr. Han's speech.

623
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,340
Please don't say that.

624
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,900
Our speech is Ин vaccine- tugging.

625
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,100
I've learnt a lot after watching it.

626
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,380
Su Ge.

627
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,660
Why don't you open the door?

628
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,300
How many love-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate.

629
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,060
You and President Li have a great opportunity to get on a business trip.

630
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,460
You still don't know the strategy for him to get on a business trip.

631
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,820
You want to ask President Li to go out with him.

632
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,700
Show him your face, and go to your sister.

633
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,100
Don't say nonsense.

634
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,260
Don't be silly.

635
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,660
President Li has a boyfriend.

636
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,620
But I've been watching President Li for a long time.

637
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,180
I think he doesn't look like he has a boyfriend.

638
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,180
Maybe he just refused your excuse.

639
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,780
This time, it's really a great opportunity to show off your charm.

640
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,380
You must...

641
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,780
Show off what charm?

642
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,380
Show off...

643
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,780
Tell... Tell President Han's eyes.

644
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,980
President Han's charm.

645
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,180
Right?

646
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,180
You two... I still have work to do.

647
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,580
President Han is handsome.

648
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,380
President Han is Mr. Wang.

649
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,780
Mr. Wang.

650
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,180
Please come for lunch.

651
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,380
We'll eat together later.

652
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,180
A' paintings areение is inflammatory by the sun.

653
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,780
Brother Han, we'll have fun together.

654
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,080
Thank you, Brother Han.

655
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,480
I've said rubbish.

656
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,040
No, no, no.

657
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,120
Give it a facilities discount.

658
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,040
Hello, Mr. Han.

659
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,040
How is the meeting?

660
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,480
It's almost ready.

661
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,400
Lili and Su Zhi Zhou will be here soon.

662
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,680
Are you still listening?

663
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Well, I want to tell you...

664
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,800
Thank you.

665
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,200
I've got a lot of goods this time.

666
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,160
I'll go get them.

667
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,840
Okay.

668
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,400
Good bye.

669
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,040
Good bye.

670
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,560
Come on.

671
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,040
Good bye.

672
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,800
Mt. Hua,

673
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,080
the discovery for You Nen it has been a long time since you went to visit.

674
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,520
Over there is so教ed and awkward.

675
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,000
What's going on?

676
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:48,520
I feel�� imp glam

677
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,520
The result of the treatment is 99% higher than the rate of the test.

678
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
You can talk about it.

679
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,520
Xin Xin, please talk about it.

680
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,520
Okay, I'll talk about it.

681
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Please talk about it.

682
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,520
Xin Xin, please talk about it.

683
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,520
Hello, Xin Xin, please talk about it.

684
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,520
You know, the difference between Han and Hai,

685
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,520
is our store too small?

686
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,520
We should make it bigger

687
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,520
to be able to sell the company.

688
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,520
What's the point?

689
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,520
We lost the place in the underground.

690
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,520
The place where people stand is the largest place in the human population.

691
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,520
We are in the corner of the underground.

692
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,520
Why do you give yourself a break?

693
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
We can take the initiative to go out.

694
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,520
How about this?

695
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
This week, Lily, you stay here

696
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
to give a short summary of the people who come to the exhibition.

697
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,520
We will go to the promotion and screening of the exhibition

698
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
in the small town.

699
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,520
Take some customers back if you want to.

700
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,520
Okay.

701
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,520
Sit down.

702
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,520
Guanghua Technology.

703
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,520
Guanghua.

704
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,520
Please understand the machine.

705
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
You can go to our exhibition to understand it.

706
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,520
Okay, I'll go and have a look.

707
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,520
Hello, Miss.

708
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,520
We are from Xing Chen Technology. Please understand.

709
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Isn't this Ji Xing?

710
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,520
You are the boss.

711
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
You are still so energetic.

712
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,520
President Chen.

713
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
He is standing behind you.

714
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
We should be more careful.

715
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,520
After all, President Zhu is the key to the car.

716
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,520
No, it's really...

717
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
No, you...

718
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
Hello.

719
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,520
Are you the director of the new center Xu Zhi?

720
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
You are...

721
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,520
I am Ji Xing from Xing Chen Technology.

722
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,520
Hello.

723
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,520
Our company's development and research team

724
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,520
is looking for a cooperation mechanism for clinical testing.

725
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,520
Do you have any interest in knowing about it?

726
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,520
It's good.

727
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,520
Where is your position?

728
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,520
Let's go and have a look.

729
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,520
This way, please.

730
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,520
What are you looking at?

731
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,520
Send the car to the new center.

732
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,520
Guanghua Technology.

733
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,520
Xiao Bai understands you.

734
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,520
Xing Chen's product is very good.

735
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,520
We will do the research in the new center.

736
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,520
Great. Thank you, Director Xu.

737
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
Xing Chen will not let you down.

738
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
Thank you.

739
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,520
See you later.

740
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,520
Xing, you were so good just now.

741
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,520
You are the best.

742
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,520
It seems that this cooperation

743
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,520
with the new center

744
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
is a hope.

745
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,520
We have to look at the results of the results of the research in the new center.

746
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
But it's a little bit of a deal.

747
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,520
Let's continue to try to find more cooperation mechanisms.

748
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
Okay.

749
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
Hello.

750
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,520
You should know about it.

751
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,520
Okay.

752
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,520
This way.

753
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
We are mainly doing this because of the money.

754
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
Xing Chen is putting in a lot of effort.

755
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,520
And then we will continue to do the research.

756
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,520
Right now, Xing Chen is going to do the research.

757
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,520
And then we will look at the results of the research.

758
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,520
Okay.

759
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,520
Then we will look at the results of the research.

760
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
Right?

761
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,520
I don't know.

762
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,520
We will continue to look at the results of the research.

763
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
Right?

764
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
Then we will look into the results of the research.

765
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
Right.

766
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
Okay, everyone.

767
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,240
This is a product from Jingzhu Ronghe.

768
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,520
This product is our EBM

769
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,760
TIE-HERGIN material.

770
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,440
It has a very good sound and fragrance.

771
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,200
It can change our traditional products

772
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,760
to a very big change

773
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,680
and increase the effect.

774
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,600
Let's take a look.

775
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,160
Mr. Cheng, you know me?

776
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,520
In the forum yesterday,

777
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,160
the last one who asked Mr. Han

778
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,280
was you, right?

779
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,720
It's not a very mature question.

780
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,920
I'm sorry to make you laugh.

781
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
No, I won't.

782
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,560
This is indeed a common

783
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,760
but easy to be neglected question.

784
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,360
When I first started my business,

785
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,400
I was thinking about the management of the company.

786
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,560
After a lot of fighting,

787
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,360
I learned the time of the victory.

788
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,240
Han is the standard in our industry.

789
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,440
I didn't expect you to have experienced this.

790
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,120
Who came here from the time of Weibo?

791
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,160
Our industry is all about the money of investors.

792
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,440
The production cycle is long and the efficiency is slow.

793
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,400
The initial development is more difficult than many industries.

794
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,200
Yes.

795
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,480
Mr. Cheng, I want to ask you a question.

796
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,320
How long do you need to use your fusion equipment

797
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,360
from the image to the market?

798
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,960
Two years and three months.

799
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,720
That's quick.

800
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,920
But the investors may not be able to wait.

801
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,760
After all, the time we spend

802
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,320
is equal to the real gold and silver they invest in.

803
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,160
Mr. J, I've talked to the people.

804
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,360
I'll go first.

805
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,280
Take care.

806
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,000
Okay.

807
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,120
Bye.

808
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,840
Bye.

809
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,360
Mr. Ji.

810
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,040
Mr. Han.

811
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,360
What's the matter?

812
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,160
I just saw Han's products.

813
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,960
They have three or four

814
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
plant-based equipment this year.

815
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,200
They can be used.

816
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,800
There are too many leaders.

817
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,000
If we fight in the future,

818
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,320
with the current model of the new god,

819
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,800
the competition between Dan You and Han Hai is still going on.

820
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,520
This circle is actually very big.

821
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,080
The enemy today

822
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,480
may become his friend tomorrow.

823
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,080
He doesn't have to be so early

824
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,120
to give himself a chance to win.

825
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,760
Instead of being a good person,

826
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,560
it's better to hold on to yourself

827
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,240
and walk step by step.

828
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,680
Mr. Han.

829
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,560
Do you believe that one day

830
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,240
the new god will be like Han Hai?

831
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,200
Even surpass Han Hai?

832
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,400
Do you think I'm the new god

833
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,880
who is doing this?

834
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,120
Boss.

835
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,520
Mr. Han's phone number.

836
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,400
Sorry, I'll answer the phone.

837
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,960
Mr. Tang.

838
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,880
Is Mr. Han having fun tonight?

839
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,280
Mr. Han has a very important video meeting

840
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,880
at 7 p.m. tonight.

841
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,680
I guess it'll take time after 8 p.m.

842
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,040
Is there anything wrong with Mr. Ji?

843
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,800
I want to thank him.

844
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,200
Please ask him to

845
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,800
wait for me at the Sita Ice Cream Shop

846
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,200
on Longshan Road at 8.30 p.m. tonight.

847
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,400
I'll wait for him there.

848
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,240
Okay.

849
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,120
Thank you.

850
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,080
Have a drink.

851
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
Mr. Li.

852
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,680
Do you have time tonight?

853
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,240
I want to have a meal with you

854
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,320
after the meeting.

855
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,920
We can talk about the meeting later.

856
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,080
Okay.

857
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,640
We've been together for a long time.

858
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,840
We'll have a toast tonight.

859
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,840
Of course.

860
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,400
Okay. See you tonight.

861
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,080
See you tonight.

862
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,840
See you.

863
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,720
You can learn

864
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,560
about the meeting

865
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,640
and then we'll wait for you to come.

866
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,680
Okay.

867
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,680
Let's go.

868
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,080
Have a drink.

869
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,080
Have a drink.

870
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,000
Thank you.

871
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,400
Li.

872
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,400
I'll go with you

873
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,080
to the dinner party tonight.

874
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,080
Mr. Su.

875
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,080
Can you help me

876
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,080
with the wine

877
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,080
or the bill?

878
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,080
You have to control

879
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,080
the quality of the product.

880
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,080
It's not a big deal.

881
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,080
It's just a matter of time.

882
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
I'll go with you.

883
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
Okay.

884
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
I'll go with you.

885
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,080
Okay.

886
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,080
It's my job

887
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,080
to talk business with the client.

888
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,080
I don't know how to talk about orders.

889
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,080
But I know technology.

890
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,080
And as a company manager,

891
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,080
I have to learn more.

892
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,080
I'm a short-term employee.

893
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,080
Okay.

894
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,080
You have to listen to me.

895
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,080
Okay.

896
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,080
You're my assistant.

897
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,080
What assistant?

898
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,080
Li Jie has a dinner party tonight.

899
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,080
I'll go with her.

900
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,080
I'll learn.

901
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,080
Okay.

902
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,080
Take care of Li Li.

903
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,080
Don't let her drink too much.

904
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,080
Okay.

905
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,080
I won't let her

906
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,080
take care of anyone.

907
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,080
I'm sorry.

908
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,080
I'm sorry.

909
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,080
I'm sorry.

910
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,080
I'm sorry.

911
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,080
I'm sorry.
