1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to forget the past,

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and never hesitate.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll remember the future,

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and never doubt the courage I have.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'm going to forget the past,

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and never give up.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll always remember the miracle,

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
even if I don't know who I am.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The environment here is quite different.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Xing Yue has so many good dishes,

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
it's not as good as your bowl of wontons.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Just this one.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So the wonton you always talk about in Germany

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
is this one.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Have a bowl. It tastes good.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Forget it. I'm full.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Boss, come and have a cup of water.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's troublesome to have Director Li.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He's so close to your sister.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Today, you're here to have a meeting with the board.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Come and have a talk.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Thank you. You're welcome.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
One more time.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We met privately.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why are you so close to the meeting?

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you for the stars you sent.

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's the lantern. Don't you think it's very unique?

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They know that Xing Yue is your boss.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And I think it's a project to invest.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's all for you.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Isn't it exciting?

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Thank you.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But it's not enough.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
There's no waste.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't worry.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The board will be open tomorrow.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Tomorrow,

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
the National Medical Administration of the International Medicine Administration

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
will be approved.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The first batch of the Hanhai fusion equipment

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
is called the market use.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We've been raising the Hanhai for five years.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Finally, it's time to collect the goods.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I can't wait to see those people

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
know that the real boss of Hanhai is your face.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The girl with the flute tonight is Ji Xing.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Did you two know each other before?

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
A stranger

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
can't let Mr. Han take the initiative to let go of the book.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Besides,

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
you just want to get rid of Mr. Zhao.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You can't.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't want to.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Da Xue.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
My story.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
At least I fought with him

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
during college.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I won the national prize.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What's the point of pretending not to know me?

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And you dare to leave?

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I've been a leader in high school

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
since I came back from Germany.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's amazing.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Do you know me?

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He drove you out.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Come here.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Are you sure he knows you?

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm not.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm a big change.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It doesn't matter.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's embarrassing to leave.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
No.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's your fault.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You've been working in Guanghua for so long.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Why didn't you think about

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
who the investor is?

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He's a big worker.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's normal for him to be the investor.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Did you two have a good relationship?

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm Ji Xin.

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm here to report.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Mr. Zhao.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
There's a student named

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Han Ting Le

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
from the medical school

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
who's a student of the Medical School.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The first one is Ye Dong.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He's a student.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Mr. Yue.

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hello, I'm Han Ting.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm a student of the Medical School.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm Han Ting.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I think he's a big salesman.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
A big salesman?

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What do you say?

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He's a professional.

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The only thing I'm dealing with

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
is that we're going to report to

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
the National University

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
of Human Resources and Technology

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
to create a competition.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He won the first place.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Do you have time to eat at night?

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Sure.

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll book a restaurant later.

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Han Ting.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's eat together at night.

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll send you the address of the restaurant later.

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We planned to have dinner together

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
but we came back home.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I didn't expect there would be some changes.

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I haven't had time to talk to you.

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
OK.

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Ok.

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Ok.

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Can I be his girlfriend?

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's harder than doing it.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,720
sent over.

130
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
The report will be released in three days.

131
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,680
You should pack up.

132
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,200
They'll be sent to the police tonight.

133
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,040
Grandpa.

134
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,760
How many days will it take?

135
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,040
Nothing.

136
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,800
It's more important than your study.

137
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,280
Get to work.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,320
How did he reply?

139
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,680
He didn't reply.

140
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,440
He didn't answer the phone.

141
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,800
He didn't go to the dinner when he was in a good mood.

142
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,400
He just drove me out this time.

143
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,320
He didn't even ask me out.

144
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,600
You just pretended not to know him.

145
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,840
Is it because the situation tonight is too complicated?

146
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,120
You're afraid you'll be implicated?

147
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,640
You just don't like Xiao Zhao.

148
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,840
You're just a little bit of a fool.

149
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,240
You're just a little bit of a fool.

150
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,680
You're just a little bit of a fool.

151
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,960
You're just a little bit of a fool.

152
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,360
You're just a little bit of a fool.

153
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,960
You just don't like

154
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,600
Mr. Zhao's action.

155
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,080
That's why he called her out.

156
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,680
Right?

157
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,280
Xinxiao.

158
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,000
Aren't you curious

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
why he didn't tell anyone?

160
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,960
I'm curious.

161
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
But it doesn't matter.

162
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,640
We didn't have any allergic reactions.

163
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,800
You don't mean anything

164
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
to each other?

165
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,960
Which one?

166
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,400
That one.

167
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,840
What are you talking about?

168
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,160
You're just a little bit of a fool.

169
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,040
Why do you mind

170
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
taking him out?

171
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,960
You're not upset

172
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,680
when he calls you out.

173
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,840
The point is

174
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,080
Mr. Zeng has agreed

175
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,920
that if we can

176
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,280
work with Mr. Zhao this time,

177
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,120
we'll be like a group of idiots.

178
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,800
Idiots.

179
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,720
There's nothing left.

180
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,760
My house

181
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,840
is full of a toilet.

182
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,000
At least one toilet.

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,600
Enough. Stop thinking.

184
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,800
The money will be here.

185
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,680
Right.

186
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,480
It's worth the money

187
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,440
for him.

188
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,640
It's just that

189
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,080
he's not a good guy.

190
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,440
He just wants you to stay there.

191
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,080
You can't

192
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,960
get Mr. Zhao out, right?

193
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
What if...

194
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,480
No.

195
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,280
What's wrong with you?

196
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,120
Why did you tell him?

197
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,840
Okay.

198
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,240
Okay.

199
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,920
Come on.

200
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,760
Let's go.

201
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,520
For...

202
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,960
Today's toilet.

203
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,560
You bought it.

204
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,080
For the toilet.

205
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,520
Right.

206
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,520
It's here.

207
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,720
And Che Ping's wife.

208
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,160
Did you like her?

209
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,280
Go to your room slowly,

210
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,080
and don't talk to me running around anymore, okay?

211
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Hurry up.

212
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
Did you like her?

213
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,680
It's happening.

214
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,260
You must have gotten along well.

215
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,460
Are you sure you won't regret knowing HJ?

216
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,020
Where did you keep it?

217
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,860
I'm thinking of you,

218
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
or you.

219
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,300
I think

220
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,940
you used your strengths and tricks to manage Family Dragon.

221
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,780
Are you struggling to get?

222
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,180
I don't know about it.

223
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,960
You have made a good deal.

224
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,500
Can you let me sleep inside?

225
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,820
assigning deadline

226
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,820
...

227
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
H!

228
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:22,900
Master Murong.

229
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,420
Master Murong?

230
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,100
Everyone!

231
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,820
What happened?

232
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,180
Sorry, master.

233
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,260
I never Там

234
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,740
have the chance to play some você-masree with you.

235
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,340
Don't get mad much.

236
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,020
Fr boy

237
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,220
How much money do you need to compensate me?

238
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,100
I haven't checked the address yet.

239
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,980
Don't worry.

240
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,260
The boss is a good person.

241
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
He won't be a criminal.

242
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,100
Good thing.

243
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,340
Thank you.

244
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,860
Your boss is so kind.

245
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,700
He will have money for the rest of his life.

246
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,260
Your brother is not going to work?

247
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,140
He left the house.

248
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,140
Go.

249
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,780
Where is your future?

250
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,020
I'm here.

251
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,380
You...

252
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,780
I ruined the day.

253
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,820
What is the reason?

254
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,220
I'm a pretty good woman.

255
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,540
Is marriage a bad idea?

256
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,380
I won't get in that area.

257
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,260
Are you sure you like my father a lot?

258
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,100
You don't know what Do 번 Stop is?

259
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,620
No, I don't.

260
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,660
If you don't play the piano...

261
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,180
not when they hit me...

262
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,620
I don't think I can meet him often.

263
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,620
I'm excited to think about him.

264
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,620
Do you have this feeling?

265
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,260
I'm fine.

266
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,260
He's so handsome.

267
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,380
He's handsome and long-tailed.

268
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,340
Right?

269
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,660
He's so handsome.

270
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,780
The colleagues at the Ministry of Development

271
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,540
all heard that

272
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,740
there's a good news for everyone.

273
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,740
Mr. Zeng has made a collaboration

274
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,260
with the People's Hospital.

275
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,260
This weekend,

276
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,660
the company will hold a celebration.

277
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,820
After the celebration,

278
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,540
our department

279
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,740
will cooperate with the Director Zhu

280
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,660
of the girlね皮丹 team

281
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,340
for some work.

282
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,740
I'll make special contributions

283
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,500
for you all in the future.

284
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,300
Great!

285
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,700
Take your seat.

286
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,580
Have you seen the content of Hanhai?

287
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,820
到 Music High在 두抓的

288
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,140
head of the municipal certified marching band

289
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,780
He Dong,

290
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,540
We can't do anything outside.

291
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
We just follow our own way.

292
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,540
Our winter clothes

293
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,540
have been developing for decades.

294
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,540
They are getting bigger and bigger.

295
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,540
What are we relying on?

296
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,540
We are relying on the patent.

297
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,540
The Hanhai technology has been established for five years.

298
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,540
It just launched its first product.

299
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,540
I think everyone

300
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,540
knows about this investment product.

301
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,540
Sorry, it's late.

302
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,540
The last board meeting was cancelled.

303
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,540
It's a pity that I didn't see you all for the first time.

304
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,540
It's okay.

305
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,540
You all understand.

306
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,540
After all, you've been in Germany for ten years.

307
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,540
You just went back to China to receive the medical treatment in the East.

308
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,540
You still need to get familiar with the domestic environment.

309
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,540
I'm taking this board meeting today

310
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,540
to let you all take part in it.

311
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,540
I'm going to take this board meeting today

312
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,540
to let you all take part in it.

313
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,540
The Spring Festival is coming.

314
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,540
The Spring Festival is coming.

315
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,540
The Spring Festival is coming.

316
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,540
The Spring Festival is coming.

317
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,540
The Spring Festival is coming.

318
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,540
The Spring Festival is coming.

319
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,540
Mr. Han

320
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,540
has been abroad for a long time.

321
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,540
Before the experience,

322
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,540
the medical market in China

323
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,540
may not be very well-known.

324
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,540
You need to listen to your sister more.

325
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,540
If Mr. Han

326
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,540
wants to do everything on his own,

327
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,540
he can take the winter clothes

328
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,540
and put them in the hook.

329
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,540
I want to do it again.

330
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,540
I can't agree.

331
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,540
For me,

332
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,540
as long as I can make money,

333
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,540
make big money,

334
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,540
it's not easy to say.

335
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,540
If I can't make money,

336
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,540
I can't help it.

337
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,540
I think

338
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,540
everyone should think about it.

339
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,540
You're right.

340
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,540
East Asia still needs to see the silver harvest.

341
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,540
Sister,

342
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,540
you all know that

343
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,540
I've brought you a meeting today.

344
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,540
It's on the electronic screen in front of you.

345
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,540
When I was in Germany,

346
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,540
I was hit by a hit and hit.

347
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,540
I voted for Guanghua and made Xiao Bai.

348
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,540
Since I'm back as a CEO of East Asia,

349
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,540
I decided to make Guanghua into East Asia.

350
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,540
What you see now

351
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,540
is the cooperation of Xinjiang Hospital and Xiao Bai.

352
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,540
In addition to Xinjiang Hospital,

353
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,540
there are some medical institutions.

354
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,540
They also show that they are very interested in

355
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,540
using Xiao Bai to the current medical system.

356
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,540
And the investment circle

357
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,540
is also showing the passion of the restaurant.

358
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,540
This time, the purchase

359
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,540
should be close to the stock of East Asia

360
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,540
and has a small share of respect.

361
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,540
Xixiang, your flowers.

362
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,540
Mine?

363
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,540
Thank you.

364
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,540
Thank you for sending them to my boyfriend.

365
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,540
Let me see.

366
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,540
Come on.

367
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,540
Xixiang, you left me a deep impression last night.

368
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,540
I look forward to seeing you next time.

369
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,540
Zhao Xingbo.

370
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,540
Is your boyfriend called Zhao Xingbo?

371
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,540
Zhao Xingbo?

372
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,540
President Liu.

373
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,540
Zhao Xingbo is the president of the Human Hospital.

374
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,540
I thought this cooperation

375
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,540
was done by the general public.

376
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,540
I didn't expect it to be based on you.

377
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,540
Little girl, you have skills.

378
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,540
You are indeed beautiful and useful.

379
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,540
No, I mean, I misunderstood.

380
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,540
President Zhao was the one who met us

381
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,540
at President Zeng's restaurant yesterday.

382
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,540
He and I are totally

383
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,540
good friends because of Xiao Bai.

384
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,540
You and President Zeng went to eat together?

385
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,540
Chen, you are so good.

386
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,540
You are really good at thinking.

387
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,540
Stop kidding me.

388
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,540
Okay, you still have the restaurant.

389
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,540
Hurry up. I won't send you there.

390
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,540
President Zhou.

391
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,540
Xiaoxiao, I...

392
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,540
I brought this to balls.

393
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,540
You and I had such a strong friendship.

394
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,540
You are such a good friend.

395
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,540
You can go to entertainment with me,

396
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,540
not only you but we also did something together.

397
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,540
I didn't ask you to come to his restaurant.

398
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,540
Is that true?

399
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,540
You know me well.

400
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,540
I had couldn't meet Paul's plan

401
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,540
yet.

402
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,540
So those are the two reasons.

403
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,860
Then

404
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,420
I will factor in Dong Yi,

405
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,020
a famous professional ini thermometer doctor

406
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,740
with a packed database about padding and managing tillill system.

407
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,940
watering up the system.

408
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,500
Be the personal growth rate and準備.

409
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,220
Alsoenoside-wrenching

410
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,700
and promising new technology in the development of 3D 51ing.

411
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,620
I don't understand your idea.

412
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,660
But I know

413
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,500
the peak of previous efforts right away.

414
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,340
With the current financial conditions,

415
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,940
I'm afraid you can't support the development of the standard equipment production line.

416
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,340
You can also support your development to understand the medical treatment.

417
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,540
That's right.

418
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,940
That's why I plan to close a part of the standard equipment production line.

419
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,340
Close the production line.

420
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,540
That's right.

421
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,140
He's also very good.

422
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,740
Han Ting, I've been managing Dong Yi for many years.

423
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,140
I naturally know that Grandpa has always been very proud of Dong Yi.

424
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,540
But don't be too stressed out and sell the cloth too much.

425
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:18,740
The standard equipment production line has always been our Dong Yi's signature.

426
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,540
You can't just destroy our signature because you want to be a smart medical doctor.

427
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,340
Dong Yi is a listed company after all. He's a weak sea beast.

428
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,740
He wants to return to the original line of the industry after a week of investigation.

429
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,140
But it's very difficult.

430
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,140
What do you think, President Wang?

431
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,540
I think...

432
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,340
President Han's idea is quite good.

433
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,540
Our Dong Yi business is indeed growing.

434
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,140
It needs to be closer to the market.

435
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:53,140
Wang, let's put all our efforts into the medical treatment.

436
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,740
Only Han Hai can be the one who's going to be the model.

437
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,340
But Han Hai doesn't need to be the one to invest in the outside world.

438
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,140
So President Han, what do you plan to do?

439
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,140
Can we start from scratch?

440
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:13,740
Han Hai has the model now. He's been spending five or six years.

441
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,540
I don't know if you can wait that long for me to do it again.

442
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,740
Uncle Yang, it's been five or six years. I can't wait.

443
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,740
How about two years?

444
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,340
Two years?

445
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,940
Within two years, I will definitely make Dong Yi's stock price go up.

446
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,740
This is a military order.

447
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,540
I'm going to remind you that having faith is a good thing.

448
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,140
But you have to do it with your own strength.

449
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,740
Don't worry.

450
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,940
I can't do it. I'll do it with my own strength.

451
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,740
Okay.

452
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,940
You have such a strong faith. I'll do it with my strength.

453
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,140
President Chen.

454
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,140
Qi Xing. Come.

455
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,940
Sit down.

456
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,940
What's up?

457
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,140
Yesterday, President Zeng took me to the office.

458
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,940
Actually, it's because...

459
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,340
Qi Xing, in your eyes,

460
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,340
I'm a person who can borrow a hand.

461
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,340
I'm a person who can borrow a hand.

462
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,940
I can't borrow a hand.

463
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,140
I can't borrow a hand.

464
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,940
I can't borrow a hand.

465
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,740
In your eyes,

466
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,540
I'm a person who can borrow a hand

467
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,540
and go out with the boss.

468
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,540
No, no. I didn't mean that.

469
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,540
I just think I should tell you.

470
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,940
Come. Sit. Sit.

471
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,540
Qi Xing, you are the most outstanding engineer in the Xiaobai project team.

472
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,540
President Zeng took you out to introduce the product.

473
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,940
It's the most suitable.

474
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,740
You see, I have so many projects in my hands.

475
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,740
President Zeng also knows that I'm busy.

476
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,140
You and President Zeng are very normal.

477
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,740
Don't mind him.

478
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,140
Oh, right.

479
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,340
It's the end of the year.

480
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,140
I...

481
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,140
I just want to talk to you about the annual assessment.

482
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,140
You have done a lot for our project.

483
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,140
You always work overtime.

484
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,540
Every time I get the report back,

485
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,540
I look at the format, the ending and the label.

486
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,140
I know it's written by you.

487
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,540
In the past three years, your ability to work together is also very good.

488
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,740
It's also good.

489
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,340
I'll go find Director Ren Li to give you the update.

490
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,740
Thank you, President Chen.

491
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,740
I'm finishing the plan for the Xiaobai 27 project.

492
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,340
I'm finishing the plan for the 27 project.

493
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,340
I'll look at it for you.

494
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,540
Work is crazy.

495
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,340
Look at the Huang Weiwei and them.

496
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,940
They asked me about the vacation.

497
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,740
You're still thinking about work.

498
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,740
Tell me.

499
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,940
Who else would I be the leader of?

500
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,540
Xiaobai, I've been with this project for a long time.

501
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,740
I have a deep relationship.

502
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,740
But apart from the relationship factor, there are also some realistic factors.

503
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,740
I hope I can have the right to take the responsibility.

504
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,340
Don't worry.

505
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,740
Our project award ceremony is coming up soon.

506
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,940
This time, you helped Director Zeng

507
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,940
to make a cooperation with Ren'ai Hospital.

508
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,540
The contribution to Xiaobai is also the most outstanding.

509
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,940
The highest project award ceremony will definitely be yours.

510
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,940
Thank you, President Chen.

511
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,340
Okay, go back to work.

512
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,140
When you're at the celebration party, relax.

513
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:37,740
Okay.

514
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,940
By the way, what we're talking about today,

515
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,940
you must keep it secret.

516
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,140
I understand.

517
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,140
Go.

518
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,940
What's going on?

519
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,540
Why did you talk to Han Ting?

520
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,240
He thinks Han Ting wants to send you away.

521
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,340
Do you think Han Ting is responsible for what

522
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,940
he did to exhibited?

523
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,340
Maybe it has picked up Han Ting.

524
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,940
Did my grandfather really think so?

525
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,140
I suppose he has some kind of secret isn't in Han Ting's hands.

526
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,300
and see what he wants to do.

527
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,620
We've worked so hard for so many years.

528
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,620
We can't just keep it for nothing.

529
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,500
You worked hard.

530
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,380
Your hair is so good.

531
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,460
I'm so happy.

532
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,460
You can't just keep it for nothing.

533
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,100
Such a pretty kitty

534
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,820
almost became a stray cat.

535
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,340
What do you mean by that?

536
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,420
She was originally just a stray cat.

537
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,300
Who said that?

538
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,740
She's the owner now.

539
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:27,860
Who?

540
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:29,900
Me.

541
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,940
Then call her.

542
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,300
She won't be able to take it.

543
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,940
Kitty.

544
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,580
Kitty.

545
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,220
Come on, sis.

546
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,500
Look at me.

547
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,620
Come on.

548
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,380
Why are you still in the temporary position?

549
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,940
She ate it. Give it to me.

550
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,260
Come on.

551
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,380
It's so cute.

552
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,980
So cute.

553
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,580
Let's give her a name.

554
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,540
What do you think she will be?

555
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,180
Today is Tuesday.

556
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,500
Why don't we call it Tuesday?

557
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,700
Tuesday?

558
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,020
No.

559
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,500
You don't want to make her

560
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,380
think she's a weekday woman.

561
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,100
Yes.

562
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,740
It's called the yellow version.

563
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,660
It's good for your skin.

564
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,860
But it's not good.

565
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,140
The yellow version.

566
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,340
The yellow version.

567
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,340
The yellow version.

568
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,620
The yellow version.

569
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,500
The yellow version.

570
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,540
The yellow version.

571
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,500
From now on, you'll call it the yellow version.

572
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,140
The yellow version.

573
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:42,700
The yellow version.

574
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,420
Come out. Come out.

575
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,540
Look.

576
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,820
I know my name is the yellow version.

577
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,260
The yellow version.

578
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,620
You're so calm.

579
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,940
You just finished the military command.

580
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,780
And you're still in the temporary position.

581
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,580
Thati

582
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,100
That eye is very

583
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,580
accurate.

584
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,560
I think the horse officer is

585
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,220
extremely discernible.

586
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,580
She's not overlyowanie,

587
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:28,200
but rather

588
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,160
reliable.

589
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
until now

590
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,600
almost everyone

591
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,120
in the company

592
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,140
is Boxingyu.

593
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,240
She thinks

594
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,320
she could

595
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,420
help me feel better

596
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,820
just by giving me aırd express Vine page.

597
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,780
That would bring

598
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,880
us back the future

599
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,400
guiding troubles in the East vamos wanton.

600
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,160
I'm already looking forward to your new official business.

601
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,160
How are you going to burn it?

602
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
Don't worry.

603
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,160
I'll be back slowly.

604
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,160
I've always seen you in Germany.

605
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
You're still used to it when you come back.

606
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Do you often play in the college?

607
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,160
I often feed the cat together in college.

608
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,160
But I've always had regrets when I separated from my parents.

609
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,160
I don't know if she has any food left.

610
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,160
I just hope that all the stray cats will be happy.

611
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
That cat...

612
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,160
You feed it with Ji Xing, right?

613
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,160
You're right.

614
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,160
I don't know what's going on between you two.

615
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
Tell me.

616
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
Ji Xing, you're going to have lunch now, right?

617
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
I knew you'd have lunch.

618
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
You're so busy.

619
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
I want to see you.

620
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,160
When will you be able to go back to Hong Kong?

621
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
Look,

622
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,160
I have a lot of meetings and doctors this time.

623
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,160
I guess I'll have to leave in a while.

624
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
By the way, Xia Lan,

625
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,160
let's take the money and settle that house.

626
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,160
My mom asked me to give her a call.

627
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,160
I guess it's Cui Hong's phone number again.

628
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
Okay, Xia Lan.

629
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,160
You go talk to Auntie first.

630
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
Okay, bye.

631
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
This is my real dress.

632
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
You must look good in it.

633
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
I'll wear this in the celebration party.

634
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
It looks great.

635
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,160
But is it too cold?

636
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
I'll wear it myself.

637
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
No way.

638
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
That's not good.

639
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
But it's a celebration party.

640
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
You did it.

641
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
You have your credit card and the contract.

642
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
You're the main character today.

643
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
You have to wear this.

644
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
You're so bright.

645
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
Baby,

646
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,160
your capital is the same as yours.

647
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,160
You have to be generous to let them know

648
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,160
I'm beautiful and capable.

649
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
You're right.

650
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
Okay, they won't die.

651
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
Okay, don't be too much.

652
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,160
Let's go.

653
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
Let's go.

654
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
We have to go.

655
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Let's go.

656
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Let's go to the restaurant.

657
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,160
I'm so hungry.

658
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,160
I'm so hungry.

659
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,160
I'm so hungry.

660
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,160
I'm so hungry.

661
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,160
I'm so hungry.

662
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,160
I'm so hungry.

663
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,160
I'm so hungry.

664
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
I'm so hungry.

665
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,160
I'm so hungry.

666
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,160
I'm so hungry.

667
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,160
I'm so hungry.

668
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
I'm so hungry.

669
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
I'm so hungry.

670
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,160
I'm so hungry.

671
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Let's go.

672
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
It's okay.

673
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,160
Qi Tyson?

674
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,160
Director Chen.

675
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
Go now.

676
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,160
Qiłum?

677
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,160
Does this suit to buy business?

678
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,160
This is our project seller's shop.

679
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,160
We're making a restaurant arrangement.

680
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,760
No need to make trouble.

681
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,160
Don't be so dumb.

682
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,160
Han Song is here.

683
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,680
I'm so happy to see you.

684
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,400
Thank you.

685
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,680
As a person who invests in Guanghua,

686
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,840
I'm happy to see Xiao Bai succeed.

687
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,520
Six years ago,

688
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,280
when I proposed to Xiao Bai,

689
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,280
I heard a lot of questions.

690
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,040
It's Mr. Zeng's belief

691
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,160
that there's still a long way to go

692
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,880
before I have Xiao Bai.

693
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,640
So tonight's main character is not me.

694
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,760
It's Mr. Zeng.

695
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,840
And the full-body staff of Guanghua.

696
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
You've worked hard.

697
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,360
Give us a red packet, Mr. Han.

698
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,680
No problem.

699
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,480
I'm sure you'll be able to tell us

700
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,640
that the more you work,

701
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,800
the more you'll achieve your future.

702
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,600
Xiao Bai will also become

703
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,160
an important part of the transformation of wisdom.

704
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,080
Thank you.

705
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,000
Mr. Han's words just made me feel

706
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,000
that he's a great person.

707
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,040
Ten years ago,

708
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,200
when I went to Germany with him,

709
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,360
he told me

710
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,720
that he wanted to develop a machine.

711
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,120
So they knew each other so early.

712
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,640
Without his company,

713
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,040
I wouldn't have the courage

714
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,760
to go to the creative industry.

715
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,000
Xiao Bai went to the market all the way to this day.

716
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,160
I'm very lucky.

717
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,880
I didn't let Mr. Han down.

718
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,200
Han Ting,

719
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,160
you're not the one who's not here today.

720
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,440
I want to say something to you here.

721
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,920
Thank you.

722
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,920
Of course,

723
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,360
I want to thank you for

724
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,400
working so hard with Mr. Zeng.

725
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,560
And the hard-working people.

726
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,200
I believe that under your hard work,

727
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,920
Xiao Bai will be able to be a part of the transformation of wisdom.

728
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,120
You two are quite good.

729
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,800
Please continue to support Mr. Yan's team in the future.

730
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,960
I'm talking about work.

731
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,520
With Mr. Zeng as the vice-chairman,

732
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,160
you can be the leader.

733
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,600
It's not easy to get along.

734
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,560
Yes.

735
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,080
Then, please eat and drink well,

736
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,400
enjoy tonight.

737
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,720
After an hour,

738
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,320
we will have a total of over a million won prize.

739
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,840
Work hard.

740
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,640
Good luck.

741
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,320
filming

742
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,660
Qiqing,

743
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,540
I've changed my mind.

744
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,400
Good evening, Manager Zhao.

745
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,920
I got the flowers you sent.

746
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,080
Almost made the stairs.

747
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,960
Thank you.

748
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,640
But...

749
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,880
Don't mention it.

750
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,920
Xiao Bai was introduced to me by you.

751
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,120
I'll be tea class with you

752
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,240
in the next cooperation with this skismator.

753
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,600
Well,

754
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,760
Mr. Zhao doesn't mind at all.

755
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,920
Don't be young in the office.

756
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,320
If Mr. Zeng

757
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,840
I want him to deal with business.

758
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,560
I think Guang Hua is almost done.

759
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,800
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

760
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,520
Don't make us worry.

761
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
I've arranged

762
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,280
the sales director Zhu Lei

763
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,440
to deal with the rest of the business.

764
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,000
Then listen to Mr. Zeng.

765
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,640
But what will happen to Xiaobai

766
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,760
in the future?

767
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,480
I still have to find him.

768
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,640
Okay.

769
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,520
Mr. Zhao, slow down.

770
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,720
Let's talk to the boss first.

771
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,760
Let's go.

772
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,440
Slow down.

773
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,800
Mr. Zhao,

774
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,120
I'll toast you.

775
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,120
I hope our future cooperation

776
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,160
can be successful all the way.

777
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,920
I'll toast you, Mr. Zeng.

778
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,680
Cooperation is a bit of strength.

779
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
I'll send you the information

780
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,760
of my dad's life in the hospital

781
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,120
to Jiang Boshu.

782
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,520
He likes it very much.

783
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,640
At 10 p.m.,

784
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,600
he will be in the Hong Kong transfer room.

785
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,320
He can only stay for two hours.

786
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,120
I'll go to the airport now.

787
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,400
I'll inform you when he gets off.

788
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,160
See you at the airport later.

789
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,000
Okay.

790
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,360
The model is pretty good.

791
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,520
Ayun.

792
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,320
What are you doing here?

793
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,280
You don't like the atmosphere?

794
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,160
I'm just a technical person.

795
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,480
I don't need to

796
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,760
communicate with them.

797
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,640
Mr. Han is here.

798
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,840
I don't like the atmosphere inside.

799
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,840
Actually...

800
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
Han Ting.

801
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,440
Ji Xing.

802
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,200
Mr. Zeng.

803
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,680
You look so good today.

804
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,960
Thank you, Mr. Zeng.

805
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,080
Let's go in.

806
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
Let's go in.

807
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,000
We're all waiting for you.

808
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,560
Chen.

809
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,800
Chen.

810
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,440
How's my Uncle Lin Zhen.

811
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,920
Don't worry.

812
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,120
I haven't said

813
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,680
who made this project.

814
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,520
But

815
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,000
you have to work hard for him.

816
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,360
That way you can't

817
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,440
make copies near Ji Xing's report.

818
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,520
Am I right?

819
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,200
You are strange,

820
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,200
I can handle his case.

821
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:50,080
I'll give you the lowest price for your treatment.

822
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,080
You can't ask Ji Xin.

823
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,080
She will give you the title of the chief of the hand-poll.

824
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,080
Do you want her to come to the company?

825
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,080
You are too young.

826
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,080
I know you can't bear to do it.

827
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,080
But I have to give you a few stars.

828
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,080
Ji Xin is not good either.

829
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,080
She can be more than you and Zeng Tong to the office.

830
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,080
Maybe tomorrow she will kick you out.

831
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,080
I've thought about it.

832
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
So two days ago,

833
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,080
when Director Ren Li talked to me about the member of the team,

834
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,080
I even asked her to come to the company.

835
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,080
Chen, you can do it.

836
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,080
Young man.

837
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
You are a little bit angry.

838
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
She died in her own way.

839
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,080
I lied to her to give her a promotion.

840
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,080
Look at her.

841
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,080
She is so stubborn and stubborn.

842
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,080
She is so stubborn.

843
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,080
You are the master of the painting.

844
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,080
You are just a painter.

845
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,080
You don't need to be responsible for the law.

846
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,080
Go to the company.

847
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,080
I'll arrange it tomorrow.

848
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,080
You can talk to me tonight.

849
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,080
Okay.

850
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,080
I'll treat you to a better meal.

851
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,080
Okay.

852
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,080
Okay, go ahead.

853
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,080
Okay, I'm leaving.

854
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,080
Ji Xin.

855
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,080
You look so good today.

856
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
There are too many people tonight.

857
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,080
I can't come to talk to you.

858
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,080
Let's talk.

859
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,080
Director Zhu,

860
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,080
I have to go to the lottery.

861
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,080
I have to go back first.

862
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,080
Come on, let's talk.

863
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
Look at you.

864
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,080
You are beautiful and capable.

865
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,080
Why are you so hardworking in the technical department?

866
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,080
Come to our sales department.

867
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,080
I'll take your money.

868
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,080
With your help,

869
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,080
you can make President Zhao

870
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
a great success.

871
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
You are so good.

872
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,080
Let's go.

873
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,080
Don't drink and talk.

874
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,080
I'm waiting for the big prize.

875
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,080
I'm going to draw the prize first.

876
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,080
I'll draw the big prize for you.

877
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,080
What are you doing?

878
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
What am I doing?

879
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
What are you doing?

880
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,080
You touched my butt.

881
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,080
I touched your butt?

882
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,080
Don't talk nonsense, okay?

883
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,080
You just kissed me,

884
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,080
and I didn't want to hurt your waist.

885
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,080
I admit it.

886
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,080
You are so rude.

887
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,080
Enough. Don't talk nonsense.

888
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
You are crazy.

889
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,080
You are crazy.

890
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,080
You are crazy.

891
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,080
What are you doing?

892
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,080
What are you doing?

893
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,080
Wait.

894
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,080
I want to hug you.

895
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,080
Hug?

896
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,080
Hug?

897
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,080
Everyone.

898
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,080
Everyone.

899
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,080
Everyone saw it.

900
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,080
This woman is so exposed.

901
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,080
She is the one who seduced me.

902
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
What did you say?

903
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,080
She framed me.

904
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,080
I'm sorry.

905
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,080
I'm sorry.

906
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,080
I'm sorry.

907
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,080
I'm sorry.
