1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Forget the wandering self.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to forget the past that I want to know.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I definitely don't want to meet you.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If I have to forget our past, I'm afraid I'll be displeased.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'm going to forget the past that I want to know.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't give up on the past.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,800
My feet will regard the winner constant

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,480
Even if I had no reflex.

16
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,200
Yes, aunt

17
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,320
The person

18
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,820
is called Mr. Lu

19
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,460
Oh, Mr. Lu.

20
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,940
Lu Xiaoxiao.

21
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,980
Okay.

22
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,900
Your mom promised you

23
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,340
that she would never betray you.

24
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,100
Yes.

25
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

26
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,700
You, you, you, mom, mom,

27
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,100
you, you, you, mom, mom.

28
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,660
I just found you when I left.

29
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,500
You, you, mom, mom.

30
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,420
Is it still alive?

31
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,300
Who said that

32
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,260
I would never add my WeChat in my life?

33
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,820
My face hurts.

34
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,660
By the way,

35
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,420
my live broadcast room's progress

36
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,540
has been solved.

37
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,500
Why?

38
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,660
Why do you ask?

39
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,140
You should know

40
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,660
that my daughter Han

41
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,580
is the boss who pays you.

42
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,060
This year,

43
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,260
do you think it's appropriate?

44
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,500
Give you three minutes?

45
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,620
You!

46
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,300
You didn't let me watch the circle of friends?

47
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,740
I'm going to emphasize the probability.

48
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,220
From now on,

49
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,300
you'll be late for one minute.

50
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,380
You'll deduct five dollars.

51
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,220
Ten dollars!

52
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,940
Four.

53
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,860
You're crazy!

54
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,380
It's here again.

55
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,540
Any ideas?

56
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,460
No.

57
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,500
The dishes are delicious.

58
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,140
Let's go.

59
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,820
How's the business, Mr. Ma?

60
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,820
It's a mess.

61
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,060
Mr. Han is here.

62
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,340
Mr. Han.

63
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,820
Sorry to bother you.

64
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,380
We're just here.

65
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,500
Sit down.

66
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,380
Sit down.

67
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,060
It's time for the meal.

68
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,300
Let's have a toast.

69
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,180
Sorry.

70
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,620
I don't drink today.

71
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,220
I've already had tea and wine.

72
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,620
Here.

73
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,220
This is for you.

74
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,140
I heard that eastern medicine

75
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,860
has been

76
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,620
improved recently.

77
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,180
Mr. Han, please relax.

78
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,860

80
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,180
Dr GUY is involved in the development of the medical system.

81
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,940
I hope you can attracted more attention.

82
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,740
That's right.

83
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,420
Let's have a warm-up.

84
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,740
Wow.

85
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,620
the patient's treatment for COVID-19.

86
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,020
By the way, Director Han,

87
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,380
I have been wondering

88
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,620
what kind of targets

89
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,960

90
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,620
data building

91
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:16,780
細 carpin doctors

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,220

93
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:18,920

94
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,760
I'll have a toast.

95
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,520
So crowded?

96
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,800
Is this your first time coming to my house?

97
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,400
Xue Song.

98
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,680
You know this smell.

99
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,920
Every time I meet you,

100
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,680
your hair smells like this.

101
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,960
Have a meal.

102
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,600
It's so fancy and heart-warming.

103
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,120
But...

104
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,280
they're all wrapped.

105
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,720
That's annoying.

106
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,520
I can't cook.

107
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,840
I'll cook for you in the future.

108
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:58,960
Okay.

109
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,320
Eat up.

110
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,520
Have your first piece.

111
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,280
Cheers.

112
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,680
Mr. Han.

113
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,160
Dr. Zhi Huiyun is doing very well

114
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,440
in the Hong Kong Hospital.

115
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,680
Our dean means that

116
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,880
he hopes to cooperate with the hospital

117
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,680
more in the future.

118
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,280
Thank you, Director Li.

119
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,160
It's a good cooperation.

120
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,680
Let's have a drink.

121
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,280
By the way, let me introduce you to the hospital.

122
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,520
This is Ji Qing.

123
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,640
You've been in the hospital for a year.

124
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,960
I said

125
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,480
how can he be so familiar?

126
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,200
He's a responsible person in the new city technology.

127
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,920
He's now a third-ranked doctor.

128
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,280
He's a new major in computer science.

129
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,520
He's a new major in computer science.

130
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,680
He's very good at that.

131
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,880
He's talented.

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,560
He can't be so hard-working

133
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,120
and doesn't want to work for me.

134
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,720
He has to create his own business.

135
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,320
He wants to help people.

136
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,600
He's so talented.

137
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,880
Young people nowadays,

138
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,400
especially girls,

139
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,880
are getting better and better.

140
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,880
They have ideas and courage.

141
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,200
Yes.

142
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,760
Mr. Han is so talented.

143
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,920
He must be very good at that.

144
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,680
Mr. Ji,

145
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,280
I'm still your graduate from a school next door.

146
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,880
I often go to your school to play football in school.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,640
Really?

148
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,800
Yes.

149
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,680
We're half-sisters.

150
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,520
Xing Chen just started.

151
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,440
He's going to start his own research.

152
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,040
I hope you can take good care of him.

153
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,680
No matter what,

154
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,840
we'll communicate and communicate with each other.

155
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
If you have any problems,

156
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,280
just contact me.

157
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,120
Thank you, Director Li.

158
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,160
Give me a WeChat.

159
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,360
I'll contact you.

160
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,360
Mr. Ji,

161
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,560
let's do a WeChat.

162
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,320
Mr. Han is so considerate.

163
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,200
You have a promising future.

164
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,240
You'll have a chance to work with us

165
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,760
after you've thought about our customer material.

166
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,000
Come on, let's do a WeChat.

167
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,120
Let's do a WeChat, okay?

168
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,520
I'll clean up.

169
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,760
Let them clean you.

170
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,680
It's too troublesome for you to clean up.

171
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,440
Right.

172
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,440
Okay.

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,680
Thank you.

174
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,040
You can learn more from your seniors.

175
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,800
Here, let me toast to you.

176
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,360
Okay.

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,400
Here.

178
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,200
Thank you for helping me

179
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,840
solve Mr. Wu's problem.

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,680
Mr. Xiao.

181
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,600
You know?

182
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,560
Yes.

183
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,880
What are you doing?

184
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,120
Why are you so capable?

185
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,400
You can think I'm

186
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,840
a super hero.

187
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,800
Actually, I don't care about that.

188
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,400
You don't have to do that.

189
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,960
You don't care about that

190
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,360
because you're strong.

191
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,440
But I can't

192
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,280
just ignore you

193
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
when others are against me.

194
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,080
I still want to do

195
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,280
what I should do.

196
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,440
I've understood Mr. Xiao's experience.

197
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,160
No wonder so many girls

198
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,880
don't forget you.

199
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,040
Which one is not easy to read?

200
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,920
Whatever.

201
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,400
I'm just kidding.

202
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,720
So serious?

203
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,200
Of course, you're serious.

204
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,920
I won't do such boring things.

205
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,400
The rival of love

206
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,480
is never the third person.

207
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,920
It's late.

208
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,040
I'm leaving.

209
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,240
Have a good rest.

210
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,440
You're leaving?

211
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,720
It's still a long time.

212
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Let's take our time.

213
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,560
I'll see you out.

214
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,400
See you.

215
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,080
See you.

216
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,640
Bye.

217
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,560
Mr. Han,

218
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,480
I'll take my leave.

219
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
We'll have a meeting

220
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
and hope that

221
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,080
we can learn more from Mr. Han.

222
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,000
Dong Yi is changing his mind.

223
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,680
He needs to be like you

224
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,560
to understand the product

225
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,880
and the market.

226
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
Dong Yi's door

227
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,520
will open for you.

228
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,120
Thank you for your time.

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,080
I'll think about it.

230
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,280
Okay.

231
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,120
See you.

232
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,760
Take care.

233
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,000
What are you thinking about?

234
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,560
Nothing.

235
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,720
I just feel that time passes so quickly.

236
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,840
When I came here last time,

237
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,640
I was still in Guanghua.

238
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,160
And I didn't eat at that time.

239
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,440
So I was kicked out by you.

240
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,680
Do you know why Zendi

241
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,960
took you to that restaurant?

242
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,600
He asked me to introduce Mr. Zhao to Xiaobai.

243
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,640
You're good at technology,

244
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,080
but you're so different from the people in the mall.

245
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,200
If you just introduce Xiaobai,

246
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,920
why didn't Zendi take Chen Song to that restaurant?

247
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,080
Why can't you find a pretty young girl

248
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,480
in the bar?

249
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,800
Have you thought about it?

250
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,240
If that's the case,

251
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,720
it's too much.

252
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,520
Yes.

253
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,920
Unfortunately,

254
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,440
some people don't like it.

255
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,400
I've known that you're a good person.

256
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,200
I'm thinking about it.

257
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,080
After all,

258
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,320
there's a friendship

259
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,480
between us in the university.

260
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,800
You won't be so determined.

261
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,800
Don't look for me.

262
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,560
Get in the car.

263
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,200
Is the dish for you today?

264
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,360
Yes.

265
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,680
It's especially for the test.

266
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,400
Thank you for today.

267
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,000
What do you thank me for?

268
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,600
I know these people.

269
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
How do you know them?

270
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,480
If you don't have real strength,

271
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,560
you'll feel that

272
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,160
some people will stay on the table today,

273
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,280
and some people will really care about you.

274
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,560
Only those who have strength

275
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,160
have the right to say they're sold.

276
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,520
There's no value in them.

277
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,240
No matter how many times you change,

278
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,240
no one will really care about you.

279
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,760
Then why did you bring me here today?

280
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,360
You've been waiting for a long time

281
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,800
to get your legs tied up.

282
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,560
You just want to know Li Quan'an.

283
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,160
I'll bring you here to have a look.

284
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,760
Don't run away from here.

285
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,960
You're not right.

286
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,320
It's useless to run away from here.

287
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,040
I have no choice.

288
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,160
I'm not you.

289
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,960
No one will come to me now.

290
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,120
I'm not your wife.

291
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,640
No one will come to me.

292
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,160
Is it useful to find someone else?

293
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,080
People's time and experience are limited.

294
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,200
They're all used to

295
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,760
more important and important things.

296
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,560
Like running a business,

297
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,640
you can just find a boss.

298
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,400
You can do it yourself.

299
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,080
It looks like you're full of sincerity,

300
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,320
but where's the value of being a leader?

301
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,480
Right.

302
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,920
I got it.

303
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,920
To be a leader,

304
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,440
I think you should think more

305
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,040
about company strategy,

306
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,800
strategy and core technology.

307
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,680
Not really.

308
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,280
Protecting me from alcohol

309
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,840
Jo ai

310
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,200
Jo set the pace

311
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,480
It's here, thank you, director Heng

312
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,640
No problem

313
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,560
Although it's taught you

314
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,520
As if you were a primary teacher

315
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,080
Thank you, Teacher Heng

316
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,440
Teacher你好

317
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,520
should I pay for it

318
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,880
Take the home

319
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,920
5% of shares.

320
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,640
I know.

321
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,480
It's late, Mr. Han.

322
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,000
Go home early and rest.

323
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,720
Good night.

324
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,800
Are you ready for the wedding?

325
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,680
Yes.

326
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
I promise.

327
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,400
Mr. Han.

328
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,440
Mr. Han.

329
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,320
Mr. Han.

330
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,200
Ms. Han.

331
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,560
Your son is sleeping.

332
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,320
Do you think it's appropriate to have a child with you?

333
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,640
My son played a game last night.

334
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,920
Do you think it's appropriate?

335
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,640
You know you're still looking for me?

336
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,680
Mr. Meng said

337
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,960
it's the time for me to have a child with him.

338
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,080
You two are trying to fool me.

339
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,360
I'm going to sleep.

340
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,600
You're sleeping.

341
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,320
Okay. Okay. Okay.

342
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,640
Aunt.

343
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,800
I think you look very happy today.

344
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,960
I'm very happy.

345
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,920
You're so touched.

346
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,240
I'm very happy.

347
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,720
Meng.

348
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,040
You're so cute.

349
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,160
You're so cute.

350
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,800
Unlike my son.

351
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,600
He's still sleeping.

352
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,120
I'm going to get him to come down.

353
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,200
Aunt.

354
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,000
I have to go.

355
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,680
Don't go.

356
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,640
I've cooked the soup.

357
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,000
The soup is good for our sister-in-law.

358
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,560
Have some more.

359
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,320
I...

360
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,840
I didn't have a live broadcast last night.

361
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,840
I was going to make a scene today.

362
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,560
No.

363
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,160
How about this?

364
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,840
You should be at my house this time.

365
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,960
You should have a live broadcast.

366
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,600
I'll cook the soup for you.

367
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,200
I'll make a few more soups for you later.

368
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Each soup has a different effect.

369
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,120
You should introduce these soups to me this time.

370
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,000
Okay?

371
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,160
Okay.

372
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,600
Okay.

373
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,200
What are you doing?

374
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Go away.

375
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,760
I'll make you some more beautiful clothes.

376
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,720
It's too troublesome.

377
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,200
It's not troublesome at all.

378
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,800
Really?

379
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,520
Yes.

380
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,200
Hello, dear viewers.

381
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,920
I'm your smart girl.

382
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,360
You're smart girl in the entertainment world.

383
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
You and I are in the live broadcast room.

384
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,880
Today, I'll make a live broadcast for you.

385
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,200
It's called the soup.

386
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
The soup...

387
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,280
You're so salty today.

388
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,600
Why did you finish the live broadcast?

389
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,960
How should I make the live broadcast?

390
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:31,960
Liveceptions should be Northeast

391
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,080
Bless you.

392
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,300
Drink some soup.

393
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,520
I will hurry.

394
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,420
A customary醒

395
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,860
Give good 기여

396
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,560
In the new year,

397
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,520
Thank you, Brother Su.

398
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,800
Thank you, President Su.

399
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,680
You're welcome.

400
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,160
Xiaochun, look.

401
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,800
Sister Xin is not here.

402
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,520
She's here.

403
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,560
Brother Su, this box is so pink.

404
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,600
Is it for girls?

405
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,640
Did you get it wrong?

406
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,480
It's the same.

407
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,080
Sister Li.

408
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,960
Happy New Year.

409
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,240
Sister Xin, happy New Year.

410
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,000
Brother Su,

411
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,160
is this pink for me?

412
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,960
Do you want it? Don't give it back.

413
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,240
What's my bag?

414
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,120
Sister, I don't know if you like it.

415
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,200
I like it.

416
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,040
It's good that you like it.

417
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,320
Brother Su,

418
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,560
you're so different.

419
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,280
Sister Li's gift must be for you.

420
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,680
I bought this bag.

421
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,520
Did you give it to Zhengding?

422
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,480
Don't be too jealous.

423
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,520
He sent it to Xin.

424
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,880
It's better than sending it to me.

425
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,200
It's the same.

426
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,720
I have to help her.

427
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,080
It's the same.

428
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,960
I can't see it.

429
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,640
It's the same.

430
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,240
It's the same.

431
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,640
It's a demon.

432
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,360
I feel much better.

433
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,520
Thank you.

434
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,360
So,

435
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,320
in your heart,

436
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,760
what's the most important thing for you?

437
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,280
I thought of you

438
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,520
when I thought of you.

439
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,000
When I thought of you,

440
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,160
I thought of you when I thought of you.

441
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,280
You two are...

442
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,400
You two are so stubborn.

443
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,720
Can you shut up?

444
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,880
I'm not stupid.

445
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,840
I've been waiting for you.

446
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,600
I'm...

447
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,840
I've been waiting for you.

448
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,640
I'm...

449
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,160
Are you back to your hometown?

450
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,800
I'm back.

451
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,720
No.

452
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,840
I'm still in Hong Kong.

453
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,120
What's your order?

454
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,160
Where are you?

455
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm outside.

456
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,680
I'm going back to work.

457
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,720
What's wrong?

458
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,840
I'm going to find you.

459
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,000
Xu Qing Imagine what it will is like.

460
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,800
Come on.

461
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,320
I've been in a hurry.

462
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,340
It's been so many times.

463
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,080
I got my style from my live streams.

464
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,880
I've been on live for an hour and 70 minutes.

465
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,880
I can broadcast for a day.

466
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,880
I can broadcast for an hour and 70 minutes a week.

467
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,880
Damn you!

468
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
You deserve to die, Lu Ling Jia.

469
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,880
You're the one who caused my future loss.

470
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,880
I can do it.

471
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,760
It's not working.

472
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,880
It's like I'm making money from here.

473
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,260
Sorry, everyone.

474
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,220
Let me, good night.

475
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,680
Don't sleep.

476
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,480
頭 Catail

477
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,680

481
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,940
slow down

482
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,580
in front, it's the new year

483
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,020
I'm sorry.

484
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,700
Wish you a new year.

485
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,660
Pay the bill.

486
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,100
Let's pay the bill together.

487
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,140
Tomorrow is the day off.

488
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,020
Let's go home and celebrate.

489
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,300
If we go back,

490
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,820
it's not good to leave you alone here.

491
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,900
Shang, you go back with Zhou Xian.

492
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,100
I'll stay here with him.

493
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,900
Sister Li, you go back with Shang.

494
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,740
I'll go with Xing Jing.

495
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,020
No need.

496
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,700
I want to go back, too.

497
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,220
But my family is far away.

498
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,740
Your family is close.

499
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,540
If you don't go back, you can't go back.

500
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,180
But I can't go back

501
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,460
because I'm angry with you.

502
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,900
You can say that.

503
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,700
There are not many jobs left.

504
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,300
You can affect my work.

505
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,940
If you need me,

506
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,180
I'll call you.

507
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,820
Okay?

508
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,060
Okay.

509
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,860
I'll go back.

510
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,980
I'll go back first.

511
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,620
You're welcome.

512
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,140
Go back.

513
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,020
Happy new year.

514
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,740
Happy new year.

515
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,420
Bye.

516
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,660
Xing Jing, I'll go back and eat a new year's meal.

517
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,220
I'll come back to take care of you.

518
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:42,860
Don't.

519
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,620
I didn't ask you to come back.

520
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,300
Stay with your family.

521
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,420
Okay.

522
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,460
Yes.

00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,860
I'll go to pay my clients a visit

524
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,540
and then go home.

525
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,060
Okay.

00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,660
Go back early.

527
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,940
You won't go back to your hometown,

528
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,300
but you'll be out tomorrow.

529
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,340
Pay your own price.

530
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,500
Okay.

531
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,500

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,360
Xin Xin, you're so busy this year.

572
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,400
Jia Fan suddenly asked me to pay in advance.

573
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
I have to work.

574
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Xin Xin.

575
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,080
Jia Fan doesn't need you.

576
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,440
Your parents need you more, right?

577
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,800
When I make money,

578
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,000
you can be my parents.

579
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,800
I bought you a new year's gift.

580
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,000
You'll be here tomorrow.

581
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,400
Where are you working?

582
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,760
You're not working.

583
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,080
You're going home.

584
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,920
Come back.

585
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,520
No.

586
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,760
The notes are not moving.

587
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,440
I have to use the Internet and the TV.

588
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,920
I'll be back after I'm done.

589
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,040
Take care of yourself.

590
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,160
Don't worry about me.

591
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,640
I wish you a healthy and prosperous new year.

592
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,160
Take care of yourself.

593
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,440
Thank you for your kind words.

594
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,600
Don't worry about me.

595
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,040
Eat well.

596
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,640
Take some time to rest.

597
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,840
Don't be lazy.

598
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,200
Okay, I got it.

599
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,880
Okay, go back to work.

600
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,480
See you.

601
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,440
Bye.

602
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
Is anyone here?

603
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,440
Is anyone here?

604
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,440
Coming.

605
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,160
Mr. Han.

606
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,600
I came here last time.

607
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,640
I feel like I need some art.

608
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,040
I just got a painting.

609
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,440
I brought it here.

610
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,320
Thank you, Mr. Han.

611
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,200
Is this painting

612
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,960
Starry or Ocean?

613
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,200
How do you understand?

614
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,880
Look at the lines on it.

615
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,400
Do you think it's like

616
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,160
the unknowing thought?

617
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,560
Thank you, Mr. Han.

618
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,640
I'll hang up when I'm back.

619
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,160
I'll remind myself to be more unknowing.

620
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,960
When are you going to go back to your hometown?

621
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,200
I have some work to do.

622
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,160
I think I'll be back tomorrow.

623
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,760
Is there anything else, Mr. Han?

624
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
It's okay.

625
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,160
I'm leaving.

626
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,440
Mr. Han, take care.

627
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,080
Thank you.

628
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,840
Be careful.

629
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,200
There's a need in the painting.

630
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,200
Do you understand?

631
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,800
Your apartment is here.

632
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,840
Thank you, Mr. Han.

633
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,520
Yes.

634
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,100
Here,

635
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,480
hold it tight.

636
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:55,620
See if your

637
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,880
Let me pull help ladies out.

638
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,480
Mom.

639
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,000
What are you doing.

640
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,760
I've evenFather is dead.

641
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,720
He's a child.

642
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,400
Father.

643
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,400
You won't blame me, right?

644
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
You kid.

645
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,120
You can't learn from your kid.

646
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,520
Every time you make a big face,

647
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,800
you'll be so rude.

648
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,400
Grandpa, you don't understand.

649
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,280
I wanted to learn from him when I was young.

650
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,160
Now,

651
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,320
I'm going to get you in the village.

652
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,280
You're so stubborn.

653
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,880
So stubborn.

654
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:27,840
No.

655
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,640
It's a pity.

656
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,040
I don't want it.

657
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,280
Let's write one more.

658
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,200
Well,

659
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,400
while the people are here,

660
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,840
take the tea from the hospital

661
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,200
and give it to the lady.

662
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,280
I'll go.

663
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,840
No need to go.

664
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,120
You don't know where you are.

665
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,640
You don't come back often.

666
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,720
Come and chat with grandpa.

667
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,680
That's right.

668
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,880
You're family.

669
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,960
Don't be polite.

670
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,040
Come, Xiaoting.

671
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,200
Give me a kiss.

672
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,360
Come.

673
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,040
Hello,

674
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,320
Miss Deng is here.

675
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,040
Hello.

676
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,920
Grandpa Han.

677
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,680
I've been here for half a year.

678
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,160
Hello, aunt Zhou.

679
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,000
I wish you a long life.

680
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,960
And a happy life.

681
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,320
Thank you.

682
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,040
Aunt Zhou,

683
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,400
I brought you some smoke.

684
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,680
I wish you a long and safe life.

685
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,520
Thank you.

686
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,960
I like Xiaodi.

687
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,360
She's smart, beautiful,

688
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,320
and talkative.

689
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:14,800
Thank you.

690
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Grandpa, you're writing a letter.

691
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,480
It's great.

692
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,120
You're so strong.

693
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,440
You don't know

694
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,040
that you've been bored

695
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,680
with grandpa for a while.

696
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,880
You're always saying

697
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,360
no one is with him.

698
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,320
I miss my brother too.

699
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,640
I heard that your parents

700
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,360
will take him abroad for a while.

701
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,360
Yes.

702
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm the only one left.

703
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
I'm here to serve you.

704
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,360
Welcome.

705
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,840
Xiaodi is here.

706
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,600
Sister Deng.

707
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,080
You're here

708
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,280
because of Han Ting, right?

709
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,640
What?

710
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,040
I'm here because of you.

711
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,760
Look.

712
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,680
It's so hot this year.

713
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,600
It's almost the end of the world.

714
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,480
Your grandma

715
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,280
and Lu Linjia are here.

716
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,360
Let's sit down and talk.

717
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,000
Let's go.

718
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,640
Let's go.

719
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,680
Okay.

720
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,440
Don't smoke.

721
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,120
Come.

722
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,600
Mom.

723
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,640
Why are you still here?

724
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,880
You're so close to home.

725
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,040
You don't know

726
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,640
that you're back.

727
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,360
I'm on the way.

728
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,760
Let me tell you.

729
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,240
Remember to wear a conservative dress

730
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,960
when you're back.

731
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,480
You came here just now.

732
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,240
I saw your friends

733
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,680
taking pictures of those flowers.

734
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,160
She won't tell me.

735
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,680
I really don't know

736
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,480
that you're not paid for it.

737
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,280
Mom.

738
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,080
I'm not paid for it.

739
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,600
I'm just afraid that you'll think about it.

740
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,400
You're right.

741
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,680
I can think about it.

742
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,760
You're so ugly.

743
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,640
You're a good girl.

744
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,360
You're so nice.

745
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,160
These men

746
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,600
are so nice to you.

747
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,960
You shouldn't run away.

748
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,800
Mom.

749
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,320
What are you talking about?

750
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,320
There are so many men in the world.

751
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,160
Why can't I find a good man?

752
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,040
You.

753
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,760
Don't look at those men

754
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,400
spending a little money on you.

755
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,760
You're so considerate of them.

756
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,880
Those men

757
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,080
spend their money on flowers.

758
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,440
They're not good.

759
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,600
Don't listen to them.

760
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,360
Especially those who spend money on you.

761
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,880
Once you're in,

762
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,480
you'll cry all the time.

763
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,840
I'm doing this for you.

764
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
Okay, mom?

765
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,240
If you think I'm not good,

766
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,240
I won't go back to the heaven for you.

767
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,560
Who are you scaring?

768
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,880
You're still thinking of me?

769
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,600
I'm teaching you

770
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,720
not to go to your mom's old ways.

771
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,640
When your dad chased me,

772
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,360
he was so upset.

773
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,480
He was so upset

774
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,400
that he was so upset

775
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,320
that he gave you his life.

776
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,280
Then?

777
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,480
He was so upset

778
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,840
that I gave his life to him.

779
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,800
Mom,

780
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,920
can you stop saying that every time?

781
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,040
I can memorize all these words

782
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,640
when you hear them.

783
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,880
What's the use of saying that?

784
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,120
Can't you just forget about the money?

785
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,360
I'm happy to go back to the house.

786
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,720
You have to make everyone

787
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,440
unhappy.

788
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,800
You're happy, right?

789
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,000
You're a child.

790
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,520
You don't understand

791
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,200
how hard it is.

792
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,560
I'm telling you the good things.

793
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,520
Don't be angry.

794
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,760
Don't go back.

795
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,040
Don't listen to your mom.

796
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,120
You'll be punished in the future.

797
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,440
Hello.

798
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,080
Hello.

799
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,240
Happy New Year.

800
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,120
Happy New Year.

801
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,320
Hello, everyone.

802
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,440
I'm bored.

803
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,360
I feel like I'm getting older.

804
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,080
Honey,

805
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,040
why are you still in the car?

806
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,880
I'm a little bit noisy.

807
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,960
I'll be back next year.

808
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,920
Honey, why are you still working?

809
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,080
It's not the end of the year.

810
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,560
I'm not.

811
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,560
I'm not.

812
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,560
I'm not.

813
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
I'm not.

814
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,560
I'm not.

815
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
I'm not.

816
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,560
It's the same everywhere.

817
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
I'm almost done.

818
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
I'll go eat later.

819
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
Qiu Zi, where are you going to eat?

820
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,560
Yes.

821
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
I'm bored at home alone.

822
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,560
So I have a colleague.

823
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
My colleague is here.

824
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
I'll tell you.

825
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,560
Bye.

826
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
Happy New Year.

827
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,560
I'm going to live stream.

828
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,560
I'm going to bed.

829
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Bye.

830
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
Happy New Year.

831
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
Bye, Lily.

832
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
Eat more food.

833
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,560
Happy New Year.

834
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,560
Don't be hungry.

835
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,560
Okay, I got it.

836
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,560
Bye.

837
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
I love you.

838
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
Bye.

839
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
Qiu Zi, have you been waiting for a long time?

840
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,560
No, I just arrived.

841
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,560
That's good.

842
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,560
By the way,

843
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,560
this is a gift from my parents.

844
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Last time,

845
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,560
if you didn't take the money to give me,

846
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,560
I would have been so happy.

847
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
I'm sorry.

848
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
I'm sorry.

849
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,560
I'm sorry.

850
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
I'm sorry.

851
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,560
I'm sorry.

852
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
I'm sorry.

853
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,560
I'm sorry.

854
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,560
I'm sorry.

855
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
I'm afraid it's hard for our family to pass this difficult level.

856
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,560
What are you doing with me?

857
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
Are you all busy?

858
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,560
Thank me for the gift of Uncle Bo.

859
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,560
We should thank you for that.

860
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,560
Haven't you ordered yet?

861
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Service staff,

862
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
menu.

863
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,560
I'll pay for this meal.

864
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
I'll have more.

865
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
Hello,

866
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,560
here's your menu.

867
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,560
Thank you.

868
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,560
Do you have anything you want to eat?

869
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
I love all of your orders.

870
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,560
Okay.

871
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Sorry.

872
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,560
We only accept the package at the beginning of the night.

873
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,560
The food is not sold out.

874
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,560
Have a seat.

875
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,560
Mr. Xiao.

876
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,560
You can't make Mr. Ji hungry in the New Year.

877
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,560
Okay, boss.

878
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,560
Last time I saw you,

879
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,560
Mr. Ji is a famous engineer.

880
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,560
I didn't expect that you are now a new technology boss.

881
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,560
I heard that Mr. Han invested in you.

882
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,560
Yes.

883
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,560
Why didn't you go home in the New Year?

884
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,560
I have a project to do a social work.

885
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,560
I admire you.

886
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,560
I'll order food from Mr. Ji later.

887
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,560
And the signature dishes from the New Year.

888
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,560
I'll have the chef bring them to you.

889
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,560
It's all free.

890
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,560
No, no, no.

891
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,560
I can't finish it alone.

892
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,560
It's New Year.

893
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,560
Mr. Han has been taking care of our business.

894
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
I don't dare to say you are rich

895
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,560
when I see him.

896
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,560
I'll come to the factory.

897
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,560
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

898
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
Thank you, Mr. Han.

899
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,560
You have to tell him yourself.

900
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
Okay.

901
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,560
Okay.

902
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,560
Let's eat.

903
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,560
I should go back to eat New Year's food.

904
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,560
Okay, okay.

905
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,560
Happy New Year, Mr. Han.

906
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,560
Happy New Year.

907
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,560
See you.

908
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,560
See you.

909
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,560
Please take a look at our dishes.

910
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Your boss is a bit too much.

911
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,560
He bought New Year's food alone.

912
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,560
Since you are so heartless,

913
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,560
I decided to put the money on your head.

914
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,560
I knew you were here.

915
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,560
You are still the same as when you were a kid.

916
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,560
You don't like to be here.

917
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,560
New Year's food.

918
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,560
Do you have anything to say to me?

919
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,560
Han, do you know where our Xin Xin is?

920
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,560
Our little girl is still young.

921
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,560
But she is not at home or in the company.

922
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,560
She can't reach her phone.

923
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,560
Don't worry, aunt.

924
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,560
I know where she is.

925
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,560
Wait at the door.

926
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,560
I'll go find her.

927
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,560
Okay, thank you.

928
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,560
Are you going out?

929
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,560
You are still running away from New Year's food.

930
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,560
Do you think grandpa can agree?

931
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,560
You should leave first.

932
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,560
I'll go up and talk to grandpa.

933
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,560
I can help you to make it up.

934
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,560
Thank you.

935
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,560
Han Ting.

936
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,560
Happy New Year.

937
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,560
Happy New Year.

938
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,560
Happy New Year.

939
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,560
Happy New Year.

940
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,560
Happy New Year.

941
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,560
Happy New Year.

942
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,560
I don't want to be with you.
