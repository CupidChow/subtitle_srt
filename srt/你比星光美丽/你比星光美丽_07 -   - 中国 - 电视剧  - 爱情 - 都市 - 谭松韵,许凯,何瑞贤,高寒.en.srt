23
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,460
How about

24
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,370
we rent a printer?

25
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,210
Rent?

26
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,210
Isn't that risky?

27
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,370
We can ask about it

28
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,740
on the market.

29
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,980
Let's see which companies

30
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,340
have spare printers.

31
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,540
We can rent one

32
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,370
to test the product first.

33
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,980
If we manage

34
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,370
to make a physical cage,

35
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,930
the financing will be easier.

36
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,900
OK.

37
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,340
I'll talk to those companies

38
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,930
that I contacted.

39
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,930
OK. I'll consult my familiar companies, too.

40
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,970
No problem. Keep each other informed.

41
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:10,810
Sure.

42
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,370
OK, OK.

43
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,250
I get it.

44
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,500
If your company

45
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,940
has an idle printer,

46
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,780
please contact me.

47
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,220
Thank you so much.

48
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,610
So that's it. Bye-bye.

49
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:33,850
Zhizhou.

50
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,170
I made contact with Hengwei Technology.

51
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,380
They have an idle printer

52
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,290
that may be rented.

53
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,450
That's great.

54
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,570
In an hour, I'll visit them

55
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,170
and talk about details.

56
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,220
Has our contract been modified?

57
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,540
Yes. Have a look.

58
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,290
Xing, I ordered some takeout for you.

59
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,220
Eat some.

60
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,180
Thanks.

61
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,020
(Li Li)

62
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,290
Hello, Li Li.

63
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,340
Hi, Xing.

64
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,660
A client of mine does investments.

65
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,730
I told him about your company.

66
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,060
He's interested.

67
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,170
I invited him to lunch.

68
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,100
Come quickly.

69
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,380
Now?

70
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,100
But I have a very important meeting.

71
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,820
Can you ask your client

72
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,060
to take a rain check?

73
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,010
What are you thinking?

74
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,380
I can't, of course.

75
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,380
He's on a business trip tomorrow
and won't be available.

76
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,340
If you really can't spare the time,

77
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,820
send your partner.

78
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,010
OK. I'll send Zhizhou.

79
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,410
If you need anything, call me.

80
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,890
OK. I'll send you the address.

81
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,890
OK. Bye-bye.

82
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,170
- Zhizhou...
- I heard you. I'll go.

83
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,610
All right. Let's split up.

84
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,820
OK.

85
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,730
I should go.

86
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,610
Oh, Xing. Your food.

87
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,690
Fine. I'll eat it on my way.

88
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,220
I'll hold it tighter next time.

89
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,540
OK. Be careful.

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,850
Li Li,

91
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,220
thanks for introducing an investor.

92
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,220
It's not a problem.

93
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,380
You're welcome.

94
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,980
Glad to have you here.

95
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,060
It's the first investor I see

96
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,570
on behalf of our company.

97
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,490
Without you, I'd be nervous.

98
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,810
Don't be nervous.

99
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,370
Mr. Wu isn't the devil.

100
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,410
Just relax.

101
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,170
Sorry.

102
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,900
A client held me up.

103
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,170
Mr. Wu, this is Su Zhizhou.

104
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,370
My junior in college.

105
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,700
Hope you'll help him.

106
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,980
Mr. Wu, nice to meet you.

107
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,380
I will.

108
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,100
Li Li, your business is mine.

109
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,580
Li Li, go buy me a bottle of sparkling water.

110
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,580
My favorite one.

111
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,420
OK.

112
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,980
Hey, Mr. Wu.

113
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,610
Please take the seat of honor.

114
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,850
Let's eat and talk.

115
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:57,930
I don't know what food you like.

116
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,660
Don't bother. Let's just talk.

117
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,500
Come and sit.

118
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,580
Su, huh?

119
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,610
Let me be honest.

120
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,730
Without Li Li's introduction,

121
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,410
I usually wouldn't see someone

122
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,610
from a company like yours

123
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,490
without fame, funds, or products.

124
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,220
Mr. Wu, let me explain.

125
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,220
Our analog product

126
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,610
has been worked out.

127
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,170
When the printer is ready,

128
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,370
we'll make the physical product soon.

129
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,810
This is our business proposal.

130
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,650
Please review...

131
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,580
Sorry, Mr. Wu. I...

132
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,380
This is it. Please review it.

133
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,220
(Business Proposal)

134
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,620
Su.

135
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,290
It's a good thing

136
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,100
for young people to be passionate.

137
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,340
But to start a company,
you should work hard

138
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,900
instead of pulling a few strings only.

139
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,810
I used to develop very hard.

140
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,730
I know exactly what situation you're in.

141
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,290
But you know

142
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,290
I have such a big company.

143
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,370
Before investing,

144
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,140
I need to think seriously.

145
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,540
Thanks for your advice, Mr. Wu.

146
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,700
Mr. Wu, the investment...

147
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,010
Seven million

148
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,900
for 20% of the stock.

149
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:16,980
Think about it.

150
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,610
20%...

151
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,610
Mr. Wu, I don't think 20% is...

152
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,540
Not until you think it over.

153
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,140
The conversation is over already?

154
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,340
Won't you have lunch?

155
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,170
He's worried about the price.

156
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,140
I'll let him think about it.

157
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,930
Sorry, Li Li.

158
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,900
Mr. Wu, sorry for taking your time.

159
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,490
Anyway, your offer

160
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,730
is really far

161
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,610
from what we expected.

162
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,140
We're a startup company.

163
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,020
We must be more careful

164
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,930
with every step we take.

165
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,980
Hope you can understand.

166
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,540
Have your boss talk to me.

167
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,570
Li Li,

168
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,780
let me take you somewhere great.

169
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,250
You can eat and drink there.

170
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,340
You can sing karaoke

171
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,020
and even take a bath.

172
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,540
Have some water.

173
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,780
Mr. Wu, how about you rethink about it?

174
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,930
Their company has a lot of potential.

175
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,810
OK. Whatever you say.

176
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,980
Wu Lanxiang!

177
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,730
What are you doing here?

178
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,610
So, you've been flirting around

179
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,100
with this vixen, huh?

180
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,580
It's daytime. Aren't you ashamed?

181
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,700
Honey, it's not what you think it is.

182
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,730
- We just...
- Mrs. Wu.

183
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,930
Your husband is only my client.

184
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,340
We're in no other relationship.

185
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,810
He put his arm around you.

186
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,340
You think I'm blind?

187
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,450
Honey.

188
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,580
It's her. She seduced me just to fill orders!

189
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,580
- I...
- Cheeky!

190
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,660
How dare you slap me?

191
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,660
Believe it or not, I'll complain

192
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,170
about you and get you fired!

193
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,170
Shut up!

194
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,810
Your affair with some woman

195
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,700
has nothing to do with me.

196
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,610
I won't take the blame!

197
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,250
Just now, you put your arm around me

198
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,290
and I let it go.

199
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,930
Now, you even want to slander me?

200
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,140
You're just trash!

201
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,700
- You...
- And you.

202
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,730
If you like

203
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,730
such a trash husband,

204
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,370
keep him to yourself.

205
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,180
I...

206
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,060
Trash!

207
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,460
Li Li, are you OK?

208
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,610
Do I look like I'm not OK?

209
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,460
I know you feel badly treated.

210
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,180
How about you cry out?

211
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,180
I'm here for you.

212
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,180
I promise I won't tell anyone.

213
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,650
Why would I cry?

214
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,130
His marriage is trash

215
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,890
and he does poor investments.

216
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,370
Don't you think

217
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,980
he should cry?

218
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,660
It makes sense.

219
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,850
All right. I'm going to relax.

220
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,010
Shall I go with you?

221
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,780
No need.

222
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,340
Zhizhou, you go back alone.

223
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,730
Stay safe.

224
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,180
Stay safe?

225
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,180
She cares about me.

226
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,580
(Ji Xing)

227
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,580
Hello, Xing.

228
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,890
Zhizhou, Hengwei offered a harsh price.

229
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,530
The deposit is 800,000.

230
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,490
The monthly rent is 70,000.

231
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,460
We also have to pay

232
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,770
for daily maintenance.

233
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,770
Xing, my conversation with Mr. Wu

234
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,610
didn't go smoothly, either.

235
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,180
Never mind. Let's find another way.

236
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,900
OK.

237
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,980
Li Li, drive safe.

238
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,220
You stay safe, too.

239
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,610
Indeed, we should stay safe.

240
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,980
She's gorgeous.

241
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,420
Pretty, are you alone? Join me, huh?

242
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,820
I'm in a bad mood. Sorry.

243
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,490
People come here

244
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,700
for a better mood, don't they?

245
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,060
Let me give you some fun.

246
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,980
Hot girl.

247
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,610
Today is my treat, OK?

248
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,700
Let's be friends.

249
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,940
It hurts.

250
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,700
People are here for fun.

251
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,730
Don't ask for trouble.

252
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,850
Just you wait.

253
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,490
Thanks.

254
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,220
Won't you buy me a drink?

255
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,450
No problem.

256
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,100
Oh, Mr. Xiao.

257
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,370
Why do you not come to me?

258
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,300
Take my table, will you?

259
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,940
No.

260
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,530
I have an appointment now.

261
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,300
With your friend?

262
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,370
Maybe next time.

263
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,300
Shall we drink?

264
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,650
I don't want a drink now.

265
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,780
I'll leave you alone.

266
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,580
Dance with me.

267
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,620
(Director Zhang)

268
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,940
Director Zhang, what's up?

269
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,220
Here's the thing.

270
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,700
I'm asked to tell you to have some days off.

271
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,020
These days,

272
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,420
you don't need to come to work.

273
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,340
Are you giving me a vacation

274
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,010
or are you trying to fire me?

275
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,420
No, no, no.

276
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,610
Sales guys like you

277
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,940
have been working overtime.

278
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,700
There's little business before the New Year.

279
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,980
So, I want you to have some days off.

280
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,660
Director Zhang,

281
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,700
it's not my first day at work.

282
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,460
Everybody knows this is the busy season.

283
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,010
There's no point

284
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,940
beating about the bush.

285
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,890
Because Mr. Wu complained about me, huh?

286
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,180
I'll quit.

287
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,340
But figure out

288
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,220
the commission you owe me

289
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,060
and transfer it in time.

290
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,370
Otherwise, I'll apply for labor arbitration.

291
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,820
So cool, huh?

292
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,890
You know

293
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,420
if I'm really cool.

294
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,770
I paid for the room.

295
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,820
Give me your contact.

296
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,530
We'll meet if we're destined to.

297
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:03,850
Coming.

298
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,780
Xing,

299
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,370
happy fourth anniversary.

300
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,660
Thanks.

301
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,460
Happy fourth anniversary.

302
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,180
(Back, Eager)

303
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,980
(Don't Be Afraid of the Wind)

304
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,250
Ms. Jin performs once a year.

305
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,610
If we didn't come,

306
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,610
she would complain about us to Grandpa.

307
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,340
Nice. Xing, move left.

308
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,340
- A full-body photo.
- Left?

309
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,610
- Left?
- Yes.

310
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:39,970
This will do.

311
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:43,970
Ji Xing.

312
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,490
Miss Zeng. Mr. Han.

313
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,660
What a coincidence!

314
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,370
Who is this?

315
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,980
This is my boyfriend Shao Yichen.

316
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,940
Yichen, this is Miss Zeng from Guanghua.

317
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,300
Mr. Han from Dongyang Medical.

318
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,210
Nice to meet you.

319
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,010
During your years of work,

320
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,530
I have never seen him before.

321
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,770
Did you just start a relationship?

322
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,890
We've been together for four years.

323
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,610
So sweet.

324
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,770
The play is about to start.

325
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,180
Let's get in.

326
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,420
We should get in, too.

327
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,300
We can go this way.

328
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,460
Now, young people start a company
as if they play a game.

329
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,820
Xingchen Technology.

330
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,220
Ji Xing and Shao Yichen.

331
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,890
If they break up someday,

332
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,100
how will the company end up?

333
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,580
Since when did you care

334
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,850
so much for a former employee?

335
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,180
Ji Xing worked for me for years.

336
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,700
It's normal that I care for her.

337
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,060
Sorry.

338
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,330
Let's go.

339
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,300
Over there.

340
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,010
We haven't watched a drama for long.

341
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,140
Here.

342
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,020
Yes. Be seated.

343
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,370
Give me your scarf.

344
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,610
The other end.

345
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,340
You do better now.

346
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,650
You managed to remain calm.

347
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,530
Look. When you met your former boss,

348
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,300
you were tolerant, right?

349
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,730
I have basic manners.

350
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,980
But I'm upset, anyway.

351
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,220
Because she deducted my project bonus.

352
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,770
Xing, your former boss

353
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,180
is here with Mr. Han.

354
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,220
Is he the man

355
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,700
who gave you the offer
to Dongyang Medical?

356
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,340
I felt he gave me

357
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,420
a hostile look.

358
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,770
That's his look at everyone.

359
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,180
Or it wouldn't be him.

360
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,940
He gave you an offer, after all.

361
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,100
Don't say that.

362
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,163
(Su Zhizhou)

363
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,660
Hello, Zhizhou.

364
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,780
Oh, Xing.

365
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,610
Are you in the theater?

366
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
Yes. What's up?

367
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,370
Sorry.

368
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,220
I didn't mean to disturb you and Yichen.

369
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,730
But it's really an emergency.

370
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,050
A senior of mine

371
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,330
does equipment purchasing in Hanhai.

372
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,050
He said one of their printers

373
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:11,980
could be rented

374
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,980
due to business adjustments.

375
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,330
But if we want to rent it,

376
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,730
we have to first pay the deposit

377
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,010
as soon as possible.

378
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,530
Because a lot of people want that.

379
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,530
Do we have to decide now?

380
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,620
Yes. He's only available for the moment.

381
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,700
I'll go over to you, then.

382
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:27,980
I'll send you the location.

383
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,220
OK. Bye.

384
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,090
Sorry, Yichen.

385
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,900
You know my company

386
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,220
can't afford a printer.

387
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,090
Now, we finally get a chance

388
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,530
to rent one.

389
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,380
If we miss the chance, it'll be gone.

390
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,660
It's really unexpected.

391
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,940
But I... I have to...

392
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,570
Go ahead.

393
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,530
It's so sweet of you.

394
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,420
After you watch it,

395
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,530
tell me about the story.

396
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,420
- OK.
- I'll go to you when I'm done.

397
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,060
- Stay safe.
- I will.

398
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,340
(First-floor Stall, Odd Number)

399
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,940
(Wei Qiuzi)

400
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,180
Hello, Qiuzi.

401
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,620
Yichen.

402
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,810
What happened?

403
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,140
Huang, could you please

404
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,010
make it a little cheaper?

405
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,290
The deposit is 500,000,

406
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,940
not one penny less.

407
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,730
You know how expensive a printer is.

408
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,730
A deposit is really necessary.

409
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,900
But the monthly rent is low.

410
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,730
Unless you break the printer,

411
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,290
you can get the deposit back.

412
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,050
That's right. But can you make it...?

413
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,500
Su,

414
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,380
I've given you a discount on rent.

415
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,770
Do you know how many people try to rent it?

416
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,730
If you and I weren't so close,

417
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,460
I wouldn't be talking to you first.

418
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,090
That's right.

419
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,490
Look. Someone's calling again.

420
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,530
Hello, Mr. Xu.

421
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,730
Yes, yes. I know.

422
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,490
Don't worry. I'm still figuring things out.

423
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,140
Is he reliable?

424
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,980
In college, he and I were in the same club.

425
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,290
He helped me a lot.

426
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,940
I'm sure he works for Hanhai.

427
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,810
I read his post when he started to work.

428
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,570
The point is

429
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,730
500, 000 isn't...

430
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,420
It isn't a small amount.

431
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,660
And on our account,

432
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,860
there's only a hundred thousand.

433
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,220
- We...
- Xing,

434
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,090
how about we try

435
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,260
borrowing some money

436
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,570
to rent the printer?

437
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,890
Here's what I'm thinking.

438
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,620
When we rent a printer and make a product,

439
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,250
our financing will be easier.

440
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,330
It's the best we can do now.

441
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,180
Hello. It's 22,000 in total.

442
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,380
How will you pay?

443
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,220
Through WeChat.

444
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,130
OK.

445
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,420
Wait a minute.

446
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,740
(Ji Xing)

447
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,820
Hello, Xing.

448
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,810
Li Li.

449
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,810
We want to rent a 3D printer

450
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,530
but don't have enough money.

451
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,980
Can you lend me some?

452
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,220
OK. How much do you want?

453
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,460
How about 100,000?

454
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,810
OK. I'll give it to you now.

455
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,620
Love you.

456
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,730
I'll pay you back soon.

457
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,570
Come on. Don't disgust me.

458
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,940
Take it as my investment in you,

459
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,530
the future technical heavyweight.

460
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,330
Sorry. I won't take all these.

461
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,820
No problem.

462
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,010
We look forward to your next visit.

463
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,090
You're bound to be the store manager.

464
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,260
Thanks.

465
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:41,980
I'm way too busy.

466
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,140
Have you made up your mind?

467
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,980
If you still can't decide,

468
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,940
I'll rent it to someone else.

469
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,010
Huang, we thought about it

470
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,220
and we'll accept.

471
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,410
But

472
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,290
we'll sign the contract with Hanhai.

473
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,620
This isn't the normal channel.

474
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,290
To our company,

475
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,700
it's OK to have an idle printer.

476
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,290
It won't be rented.

477
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,330
Well, either you sign the contract with me

478
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,650
or you just give up.

479
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,980
When you're so indecisive,

480
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,980
you'd better not do business.

481
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,490
Huang, wait.

482
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,770
Come on. We'll sign it.

483
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,420
- Sit, Huang.
- Chill.

484
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,260
Here.

485
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,770
The contract in duplicate.

486
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,730
But now,

487
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,330
we can only give you half the money.

488
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,530
When the printer is delivered in three days,

489
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,490
we'll give you the other half.

490
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,370
Is that OK with you?

491
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,170
OK.

492
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,010
For Su's sake,

493
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,170
I'll accept this.

494
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,420
Thank you so much.

495
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:51,850
There you go.

496
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,860
(Ji Xing)

497
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,730
Why are you playing basketball so angrily?

498
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,330
She has a boyfriend.

499
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,570
Ji Xing?

500
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,140
What are you talking about?

501
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,530
She has a boyfriend?

502
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,700
It's OK that she has a boyfriend.

503
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,010
She isn't married, anyway.

504
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,620
You know what?

505
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,810
Ji Xing has worked out the analog product.

506
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,330
If you still don't take action

507
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,620
and she accepts another investor,

508
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,460
you'll really not have even a single chance.

509
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,090
But as long as you invest in her,

510
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,140
she'll be your employee.

511
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,530
What do you mean?

512
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,980
Stay close and take advantage.

513
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,330
Bad idea.

514
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,700
Xing, before Huang left, he said

515
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,770
the delivery of the printer

516
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:16,730
would take only two days.

517
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,980
That'd be great.

518
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,140
It's wise of you to think

519
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,140
of paying in two batches.

520
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,010
Otherwise, we wouldn't

521
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,140
have enough money.

522
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,140
Well, when the printer is delivered,

523
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,730
I'll talk to Huang

524
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,050
and try to avoid

525
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,290
the other half of the deposit.

526
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,620
Will it work?

527
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,500
I'll just try.

528
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,420
You keep track of the printer.

529
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,900
I'll take care of the money thing.

530
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,330
Don't worry.

531
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,250
Hope everything will go smoothly.

532
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,330
Hope so.

533
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,620
OK. It's done.

534
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,460
Thank you, sir. See you.

535
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,050
What? What have you lost?

536
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,420
It's OK. Just some bags.

537
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,770
And one laptop.

538
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,010
Glad you're all right.

539
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,330
The police came and recorded it.

540
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,500
The lock is changed, too.

541
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,090
If you're still worried,

542
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,620
you can stay in the hotel tonight.

543
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,730
Thank you, Yichen.

544
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,770
I was too scared just now.

545
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,010
My mind went blank

546
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,330
and then I called you.

547
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,420
Now, I think I shouldn't have done that.

548
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,220
I wonder

549
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,010
if I disturbed you and Xing.

550
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,660
No. She's too busy.

551
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,730
I don't have things to do today.

552
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,420
Xing just started her company.

553
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,700
She has to be very busy.

554
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:38,930
You...

555
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,090
Do you regret supporting her?

556
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,420
Anyway, she works really hard.

557
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,290
A girl like me can't stand

558
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,530
living a life of hers.

559
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,180
If I marry my beloved man

560
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,460
and live a simple life,

561
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,980
I will be satisfied.

562
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,620
Maybe she's made the right choice.

563
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,220
I just...

564
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,570
I'm confused now.

565
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,050
Yichen, have some tea.

566
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,330
Thanks.

567
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,220
You're going

568
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
to propose to Xing, right?

569
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,530
How do you know?

570
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,330
Me?

571
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,140
I'm going

572
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,660
to start up a business.

573
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,250
I guessed.

574
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,860
You and Xing

575
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,140
have been together for four years.

576
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,250
You're supposed to get married.

577
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,420
That's my plan, indeed.

578
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,140
Today is the fourth anniversary

579
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,460
of our relationship.

580
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,860
I had wanted to propose to her today.

581
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,740
But unexpected...

582
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,410
I...

583
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,220
I really don't know

584
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,660
if I can give her the life she wants.

585
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,420
Yichen,

586
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,530
when you think here all alone,

587
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,770
you'll only get more upset.

588
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,050
Why don't you go talk to her

589
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,250
with the ring?

590
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,180
You have been together for four years.

591
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,290
I believe she will

592
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,330
give you a satisfactory answer.

593
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,700
OK.

594
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,130
I'll try one more time.

595
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,570
I should go.

596
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,220
Yichen, let me walk you out.

597
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,140
No need. You take some rest.

598
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,570
Xing, you're done working?

599
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,530
I came as soon as I finished.

600
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,220
I bought something to eat on my way here.

601
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,330
Why haven't you had dinner yet?

602
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,380
I want to have it with you.

603
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,660
It's a big day.

604
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,940
We should celebrate.

605
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,700
I'll go wash my hands.

606
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,810
How about we put dinner on the tea table?

607
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,730
- We can watch TV.
- OK.

608
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,980
Whatever you say.

609
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,770
The dishes aren't cold, huh?

610
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,860
Your favorite restaurant
with Boiled Fish with Pickles

611
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,770
is closed.

612
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,220
I wonder how these dishes will taste.

613
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,460
Why do you not open them?

614
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,770
What? What are you laughing at?

615
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,940
What are you holding behind you?

616
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,780
Let me see.

617
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,140
Let me see.

618
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,410
Xing,

619
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,050
will you marry me?

620
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,330
Yichen,

621
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,090
I'd love to.

622
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,180
But...

623
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,620
I just started my company.

624
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,050
It's not stable.

625
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,220
Can you give me some more time?

626
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,180
If I accept your proposal now,

627
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,660
I'll be like getting a backup plan.

628
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,570
Neither you nor I will be respected.

629
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,180
How about this?

630
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,700
I'll keep the ring.

631
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,250
When I get financing,

632
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,900
I'll propose to you.

633
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,090
OK?

634
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,300
OK.

635
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:01,930
Pinky promise.

636
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,020
Wait for me.

637
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,460
There it goes.

638
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,820
Huang!

639
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,260
Huang!

640
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,140
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

641
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,980
Huang!

642
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,610
Zhizhou?

643
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,330
Senior?

644
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,330
Are you also here for Huang?

645
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,570
Yeah. The other day,

646
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,730
I rented a printer from him.

647
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:47,940
I gave him the money.

648
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,090
He said I could get it today.

649
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:49,930
But...

650
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,290
I'm unable to contact him.

651
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,980
He isn't back for days.

652
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,380
I paid his rent for this month.

653
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,860
If you find him,

654
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,900
ask him to call me back.

655
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,330
I can't pay his rent all the time.

656
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,810
You paid his rent?

657
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,770
- Yeah.
- What happened to him?

658
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,860
When he was talking on the phone, I heard

659
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,940
he had a financial problem.

660
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,380
Don't worry.

661
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,460
Will you come in?

662
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,860
Fine. See you later.

663
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,180
What?

664
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,050
Sorry, Xing.

665
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,730
It's all my fault.

666
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,530
Did you call the police?

667
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,570
I'll go ask about it.

668
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,420
- Which station?
- Dongli Police Station.

669
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,420
Do you think we can get the money back?

670
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,330
Let's not talk until Xing's back.

671
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,330
How could we be so unlucky?

672
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,250
At such a critical time,

673
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,620
we met a fraud.

674
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,660
Things will be better when we get financing.

675
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,570
All these problems will be gone.

676
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,980
Then when can we get financing?

677
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,740
I don't know.

678
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,500
What's up?

679
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,730
My landlord asked for the rent.

680
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:50,570
Nothing.

681
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,770
What's the rush?

682
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,770
You won't pack up and leave overnight.

683
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,730
You'll get your pay soon.

684
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,620
Ask him to wait.

685
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,730
Dad, please help me, will you?

686
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,330
Please help me. We...

687
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,050
We're so close to success.

688
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,620
When you just began,

689
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,730
you lost so much money.

690
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,780
Now you want more?

691
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:13,930
In your dreams!

692
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,860
Don't beg your mother.

693
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:15,980
No negotiation.

694
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,940
Don't start a company

695
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,660
until you have enough social experience.

696
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,460
Your friend can use the house for free.

697
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,180
Be a good son and come back home.

698
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,570
Or I'll take that house back.

699
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,860
But Dad, I...

700
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,460
I've never missed a credit card payment.

701
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,460
I don't even have an installment.

702
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,460
I'm sure I have a good credit.

703
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,380
Please check for me

704
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,380
the maximum loan I can apply for.

705
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,940
OK. I'll wait for it.

706
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,650
Miss Ji, you haven't had lunch, huh?

707
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,210
Thanks.

708
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,940
Where are they?

709
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,300
Mr. Su is out for business.

710
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,820
Shang is out for lunch.

711
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,010
Have you had lunch?

712
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,010
Yes.

713
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,660
Miss Ji,

714
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,530
any word from the police station?

715
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,050
They said the investigation
would take a few days.

716
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,650
Xia, what's up?

717
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,140
Miss Ji,

718
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,010
I've heard about something these days.

719
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,650
People say our company
can't get financing at all.

720
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,170
Investment companies say we ask for too much.

721
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,980
Our analog product has been made.

722
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,170
I believe we'll get financing soon.

723
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,010
Sorry, Miss Ji.

724
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,050
I really appreciate

725
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,370
(Letter of Resignation)
how you've helped.

726
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,010
I chose to work for Xingchen

727
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,530
just because I wanted to strike out

728
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,860
with my techniques.

729
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,570
Now, the analog product

730
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,530
has been made.

731
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,740
But we don't have a printer yet.

732
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,940
Every day in my seat,

733
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,650
I sit and do nothing.

734
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,210
If it goes on like this,

735
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,980
I'll go to waste.

736
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,420
I understand, Xia.

737
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,460
I know you've done a lot for our company.

738
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,130
Now, we're in some trouble.

739
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,820
But I'm trying my best to solve it.

740
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,170
Rest assured. You have my word.

741
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,940
When our company is on track,

742
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,170
I'll give you

743
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,940
all your wages and subsidies.

744
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,820
I've made up my mind.

745
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,170
I'm sorry.

746
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,100
OK.

747
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,420
In this case,

748
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,860
I won't force you to stay.

749
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,940
Hope everything will go well with you.

750
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,660
Thanks.

751
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,370
Miss Ji.

752
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,490
Miss Ji!

753
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,370

00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,130
This is our analog product.

756
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,570
We had planned

757
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,740
to print it out

758
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,980
before we get financing. But...

759
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:52,850
Mr. Han,

760
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,940
you gave us
the offer of Dongyang Medical, right?

761
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,860
I'd like to ask if this offer

762
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,860
is still valid.

763
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,650
Does Ji Xing know

764
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,860
you came to me?

765
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,940
Then you should persuade her
to come with you.

766
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,450
We...

767
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,650
Actually, we...

768
00:37:36,202 --> 00:37:36,819
(Xia)

769
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,980
Hello, Xia.

770
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,380
I'm in the middle of something.

771
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,210
Xing passed out?

772
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,180
(Emergency Observation Room)

773
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,300
How is she, doctor?

774
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,370
Don't worry.

775
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,220
She's fine.

776
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,010
She's too stressed at work for a long time

777
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,170
without enough rest.

778
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,690
With low blood sugar and a mild fever,

779
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,010
she passed out.

780
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,380
She's taking the infusion.

781
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,090
It has some soothing liquid.

782
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,980
Just let her sleep.

783
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,820
She has to take more rest from now on.

784
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,090
Let her not stay up late.

785
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,300
OK. Thanks, doctor.

786
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:21,490
Mr. Han.

787
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,420
Did you inform her friend?

788
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,050
She's on the way.

789
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,530
Mr. Han.

790
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,980
Let me tell you the truth.

791
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,340
We're literally desperate.

792
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,050
Some days ago,

793
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,210
we rented a 3D printer at a low price.

794
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,460
But the seller took the money and ran.

795
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:43,860
On our company account,

796
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,380
there's not even a penny.

797
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,260
For the sake

798
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,570
you and Xing took part

799
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,170
in the college competition together,

800
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,900
can you invest in us?

801
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,780
Friendship is friendship

802
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,570
while business is business.

803
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,610
If you can't even bear such little pressure,

804
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,260
my investment will be wasted.

805
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,170
If you really care for her,

806
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,900
persuade her to accept my offer.

807
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:38,260
(Xing)

808
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,780
(Mother)

809
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,650
Hello, Mom.

810
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,050
Yichen, did you explain to Ji Xing?

811
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,170
Your father was deceived.

812
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,490
If he doesn't pay the money,
it'll be enforced.

813
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,420
She usually doesn't care for you.

814
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,170
Now, she still doesn't help.

815
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,570
- How can you rely on her?
- Mom, don't worry.

816
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,420
I'll get the money.

817
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:06,930
This case

818
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,900
has nothing to do with Xing.

819
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:10,370
Be patient.

820
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:12,890
Bye-bye.

821
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:14,900
Yichen.

822
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,650
Qiuzi? What are you doing here?

823
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,300
Our institute

824
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,780
has cooperation with your hospital.

825
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,130
I'm here for a meeting.

826
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,490
Are you having a family problem?

827
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,050
Sorry.

828
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,690
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

829
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,100
Nothing.

830
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,300
Yichen, take it for your emergency.

831
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,260
I'll text you the password later.

832
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,610
No, thanks, Qiuzi.

833
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,260
I'll take care of it myself.

834
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,130
Don't stand on ceremony.

835
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,100
Take it.

836
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,490
Thank you, Qiuzi.

837
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,260
I'll pay you back with the interest.

838
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,260
Come on, Yichen.

839
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,530
Whatever trouble you are in,

840
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,780
I believe

841
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,260
you'll solve it perfectly.

842
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,330
Qiuzi,

843
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,260
I really don't know

844
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,010
how to thank you.

845
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,170
No need of that.

846
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,610
We were schoolmates.

847
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,300
Xing is my best friend, too.

848
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,220
And...

849
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,980
You proposed to her, right?

850
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,010
So, we're not strangers.

851
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,530
Thanks.

852
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,260
Excuse me.

853
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,570
Where is the infusion room?

854
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,450
Over there.

855
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,860
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

856
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,580
(Emergency Observation Room)

857
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,530
- Li.
- How is she?

858
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,610
Fine, according to the doctor.

859
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,450
She's too stressed

860
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,690
and she needs more rest.

861
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,780
OK.

862
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,570
I'll take care of her. You go home.

863
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:08,570
OK. I should go.

864
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,380
How do you feel, sweetheart?

865
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,130
According to the doctor,
you've been too stressed.

866
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,690
You didn't have enough rest, either.

867
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,490
So, you passed out.

868
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,900
Never let it happen again.

869
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,300
Sorry. I lost your money, too.

870
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,340
What are you talking about?

871
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,300
I just told you not to be stressed.

872
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,570
Your company isn't deregistered.

873
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,570
I'm waiting until you get financing

874
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,050
and carry me.

875
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:02,610
Don't think too much.

876
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,170
Are you hungry?

877
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:05,860
I'll go buy you something to eat.

878
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,380
You rest here.

879
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,220
I'll be right back.
