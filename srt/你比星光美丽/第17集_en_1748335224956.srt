1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to pass through the water and you will be lost

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Even if I meet the end, I will be lost in the mist

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the mist

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I can't see the crowd in the crowd

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to go to the end of my own life

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I want to forget the myself that I used to have

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to go to the end of the road

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sure I won't have any rain

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the future

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the mist

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I want to go to the end of the road

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But I won't give up

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I will always believe in the miracle

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Even if I don't know who I am

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Like spicy, spicy, and popular

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Wei Longbo is just one spicy

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's get into the video

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Episode 1

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Episode 2

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You go out first

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I heard that the machine has a problem with the machine

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You don't need to do it

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
No need, I trust her

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
How many people are there?

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
About 3%

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Why do you suddenly remember

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
the three stocks that I bought?

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Since I disbanded Han Yuan's family

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He has been very upset since he got the position of head of the human world

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The board of directors suddenly started questioning

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
my decision to invest in Xing Chen

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
There are no shareholders behind him

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The three stocks that I bought in advance

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
were replaced by Wu Huan

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think he can't make any money

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Isn't your old man absolutely right?

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't want to be shocked by his old man

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't be too hard on Xing Chen

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm willing to catch you

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Instead of hiding the secret

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why don't you

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
put it directly on the cotton?

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You care so much about Ji Xing

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm a little jealous

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What are you two doing now?

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Brother, you're not right

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You haven't done it yet

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Your sofa is so tight

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Take it out

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He just got out of the business

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's natural

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're so jealous

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hello

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Have you fixed the sound system?

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The North-East people just got our video

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We found a device with a technology system

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The device has fallen into the ground with the dormitory

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If it goes well, they will finish the work

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
They can come back tomorrow morning

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Where are you now?

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm at the company

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Tang Song, go to the teacher

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Xing, do you think this time will work?

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
President Xing

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
President Xing

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
President Xing

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Please slow down

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
How is it?

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The machine problem has been solved

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now the sample is already printed

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I knew you could do it

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
President Xie

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
President Han bought a night snack for everyone

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
President Han

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Come on, let's eat

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Thank you, President Han

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is for you

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Thank you

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Thank you

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
President Han, I'm so nervous

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Will I be fired?

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We've been with President Ji for so long

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He's the most sensitive person

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He's here, he won't be fired

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I've done such a big thing this time

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If I'm fired, I'll be recognized

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But Xing Chen is good at money

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And good at distribution

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I haven't written enough code

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I can't bear to leave

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't think too much

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What you can do now is to eat, drink, and invest in work

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Besides, when the sample is printed, it's okay

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Even if you want to pursue responsibility, you won't be punished

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Not enough?

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Here

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
One more

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
One more

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Thank you

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Thank you, President Han

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's delicious

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Didn't you borrow the printer?

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I was thinking of preparing it

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Lili is printing it

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If it's not enough, we won't waste time

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We'll wait for it

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Xing Chen's boss

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He's been working for half a night

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And he's been working for a long time

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's strange to hear

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't think so

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I think the more dangerous it is

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The boss will stay with the staff

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And I let Chen Zuo fix the printer

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't want him to be hit by his confidence because of this

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If he's fixed it, he can make up for it

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If he can't fix it, he'll do his best

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He can be a little better

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Can you guarantee that the same thing will happen next time?

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I can punish him and fire him

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's a rule to kill the chicken and the monkey

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But I came out of the廣華

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Xing Chen is the hope to build a different workplace

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm too good at it

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So I want to give them a slap in the face of the ability

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
When everyone makes mistakes

133
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And he's not the one who makes mistakes

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And he's not the one who makes mistakes

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I believe that after this thing

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Everyone will be nervous

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Eat it, it's cold

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Is it still not dead?

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What should we do?

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The North Pole can't get in touch with it

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This place must be sleeping

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Hello, how is it?

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Xing Xing, we're in a good mood

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's already hard to get a job

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Great

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Okay, we'll go tomorrow morning

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Thank you

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Thank you

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Xing Xing, I'm so sorry

150
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm sorry

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll go back tomorrow morning

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Thank you

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay, everything went well

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Take a rest

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
President Ji

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I want to try again

157
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I want to try too

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay

159
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay, let's continue

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Some tests should be done with a knife

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'll check it right away

162
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't see any ł

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll order it

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I Georgian

165
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,120
So I want show them

166
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
some preparation

167
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,560
I can love no one else but you.

168
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,920
I ask you.

169
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,600
That is a fake drug.

170
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,460
It's used by doctors.

171
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,540
You must give it to me.

172
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,660
Sometimes everyone wants to...

173
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,900
not just you,

174
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,120
but me too.

175
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,020
Understood.

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,960
Hello, Xin Xin.

177
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
We've agreed.

178
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
We're on our way to the airport.

179
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
Okay.

180
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
I'll be back.

181
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
See you.

182
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
Bye.

183
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Mr. Ji.

184
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
Mr. Ji.

185
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Why are you here so early?

186
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
I'm worried that you might not have dinner.

187
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
So I bought some early-face food.

188
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Then I met Xiaoyou at the door.

189
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Yes.

190
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Let's have breakfast.

191
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Give it to me.

192
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Have some.

193
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Mr. Ji, how is it?

194
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
We're still in the調 room.

195
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
Mr. Li is on his way back.

196
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
He can solve it.

197
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Don't worry.

198
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Go and get Xiaosuo out.

199
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
Have some food first.

200
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
After that, you can go.

201
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Okay.

202
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,120
Oh.

203
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,000
He likes to be calm.

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,960
This is 방.

205
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
OK.

206
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,020
Go.

207
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,200
I'll help you solve the problem.

208
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,640
Han Ning.

209
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,520
I gave you the winter clothes.

210
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,920
I didn't ask you to do it on your own.

211
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,040
Do you know

212
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
how many people are complaining about you?

213
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,960
The flowers in the garden

214
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,720
will be re-grown

215
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,920
and will be re-grown.

216
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,240
Only by cutting off

217
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,200
the unnecessary branches

218
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,720
can it grow rapidly.

219
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,000
The business of the spring and winter

220
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,640
is like a garden.

221
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,160
The management of the new city is so chaotic.

222
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,120
It's time to help him

223
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,160
to get into the business.

224
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,120
To get into the business

225
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,680
and the core team was empty,

226
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,720
I lost the meaning of investing in it.

227
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,320
Such a low-level mistake

228
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,640
is the same as investing in it.

229
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,360
Grandpa,

230
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,600
wait a minute.

231
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,160
The winter clothes will be out

232
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,040
in the afternoon.

233
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,120
After five o'clock,

234
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,000
you won't be late to make your decision.

235
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,960
You

236
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,600
are not strong enough to get back.

237
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,080
If you can't finish your task,

238
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,840
you can withdraw the money from the new city

239
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,800
and give the core team

240
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,480
to the manager.

241
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,760
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

242
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,160
I won't accept

243
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,960
the result of your help.

244
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,120
I've received the wrong decision.

245
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,760
Please pay attention to the departure of the new city.

246
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,400
We apologize for informing you.

247
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,840
The flight of the new city

248
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,640
is due to the air control system.

249
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,080
The time of departure is delayed.

250
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,000
The time is now.

251
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,720
Hello, Xixiang.

252
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,880
We've sent the plane to the hospital.

253
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The flight is due to the air control system.

254
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,800
The hospital hasn't arrived yet.

255
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,920
Okay, I got it.

256
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,640
Don't worry.

257
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,680
I'll figure it out.

258
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,240
Okay.

259
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,640
Mr. Ji, how is it?

260
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,320
They've sent the flight to the hospital.

261
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,320
I can't make it back.

262
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,360
What should we do?

263
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,640
We can only rely on our promise.

264
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,240
The directors gave you the decision yesterday.

265
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,920
I didn't say anything else.

266
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,960
After all, we are family.

267
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,040
We can't be too biased.

268
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,520
But in this case,

269
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,840
your management and investment of the new city

270
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,720
should be more careful.

271
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,840
Liu Zhiling.

272
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,280
Your special help.

273
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,960
Xing Chen needs a person in charge of management.

274
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,760
Liu Zhiling is a graduate from Changqing Tong University.

275
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,160
He knows management well.

276
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,760
He's as good as the leader of Dongyang Group.

277
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,360
I think he's the most suitable

278
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,200
for the professional manager of Xing Chen.

279
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,160
It's almost five o'clock.

280
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,840
I know Xing Chen has borrowed the audio machine from Jingxi.

281
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,040
We're not sure if the product

282
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,360
he's using is suitable for him.

283
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,080
As far as I know,

284
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,240
Jingxi seems to be in a bad mood.

285
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,480
Jingxi is in the business of Hong Kong.

286
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,520
Is the product not delivered to Xing Chen's company yet?

287
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,840
You're now in charge of the initiative.

288
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,000
It's more efficient than when

289
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,160
Grandpa forces you to sign the contract.

290
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,920
You can't afford it, can you?

291
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,600
It's not five o'clock yet.

292
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,680
Are you in a hurry?

293
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,560
Yes.

294
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,480
President Han, I...

295
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,680
President Yuan, I'm here to report my work.

296
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,200
Xing Chen's pursuit of Ronghe Qi

297
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,280
was just reported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

298
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,240
This is the report.

299
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,680
The sample can be checked by the examination room tomorrow.

300
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,640
Now we can only rely on our printer.

301
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,720
Our printer is like this.

302
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,840
It's not a good idea to make a mistake.

303
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,160
The scraper is fixed.

304
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,880
The printer should be fixed again.

305
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,840
Really?

306
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,720
Then this time it won't be a problem to make a mistake again, right?

307
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
It's definitely not a problem.

308
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
How did you do it?

309
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,480
Last night I asked Mr. Su

310
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,640
to follow my steps to repair the scraper.

311
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,360
I didn't expect that it was really fixed.

312
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,440
Great.

313
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,640
Mr. Su knows it.

314
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,520
Great.

315
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,960
But now it's fixed.

316
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
After we finish the printing,

317
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,640
we can't send the printer to the factory.

318
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,760
Not bad.

319
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,280
Sister.

320
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,080
What do you think?

321
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,920
It's such a good luck to send it.

322
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,640
You've found a solution in such a short time.

323
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,520
I'll go.

324
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,960
It's not a simple luck.

325
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,880
We did prepare it in two ways.

326
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,360
And we used this emergency situation

327
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,560
to upgrade the data reading in the software

328
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,080
and the calculation time.

329
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,880
It's a quick-much improvement.

330
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,400
Otherwise, it won't be a good time to send it.

331
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,720
It seems that the company management

332
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,880
is not affected by any trouble.

333
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,160
Mr. Yuan.

334
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,640
I'll finish the company's system as soon as possible.

335
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,240
Through this matter,

336
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,240
the team is getting better and better.

337
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,040
When we get the report of the paper and the paper,

338
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,000
we'll immediately proceed with the clinical trial.

339
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,200
The clinical cooperation institution

340
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,080
has also started to list the list.

341
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,440
Why are you so confident?

342
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,560
Something like this will not happen next time.

343
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,640
After all, luck can guarantee you a lifetime.

344
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,280
Tang Song.

345
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,320
Boss.

346
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,920
Bring the copy of the report.

347
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,840
Okay.

348
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,360
I only recovered half of the second copy last time.

349
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,680
It's still 4 million.

350
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,720
Okay.

351
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,800
This money is yours.

352
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,920
It's no longer yours.

353
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,640
That'll be yours.

354
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,560
Boss,

355
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,280
let me do the opposite.

356
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,880
Han Ting.

357
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,400
It's a small matter for now that the board is這麼 suspicious.

358
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
I suggest to see your own hands-in-law

359
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,240
before you sign the contract.

360
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,560
If I draw money today,

361
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,800
I must field it.

362
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,320
I need to deal with many things.

363
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,640
I won't send you off.

364
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,720
Da Zhun, are you there?

365
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,120
You're here.

366
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,040
You look pale.

367
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,520
I'm sorry to bully you.

368
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,280
I'm leaving.

369
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,720
It's so wooden house.

370
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,640
Don't come to the room.

371
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,920
It's a半 room.

372
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,480
Sand nuit boys,

373
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,000
why are you all wearing each other's uniforms?

374
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,280
The everyday fray is living in here.

375
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,200
Lu Sha.

376
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,360
Miss Ji is still in there.

377
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,000
Please wait outside a little.

378
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,800
Right?

379
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,560
Yes.

380
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,600
Families?

381
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm sorry to bother you so much.

382
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,320
Do they want to interference with Xing Chen's management?

383
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,280
After a few days, the Shenzhen A&I Medical Center will hold a good preparation.

384
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,280
I've been holding the exhibition for a long time.

385
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,280
This is the first time I've thought about it.

386
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
I hope it's good for me.

387
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
I'll leave first.

388
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,280
Thank you.

389
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Why thank me?

390
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
I didn't do anything.

391
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
Thank you for trusting me.

392
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Ji Xiang, how is it?

393
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,280
Are you in a good mood today?

394
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Trust yourself.

395
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Trust yourself.

396
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
A face-to-face iron star?

397
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,280
A person who trusts himself?

398
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
Da Chengzi.

399
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,280
I'm sorry.

400
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,280
Enough.

401
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
Don't be so stubborn.

402
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
I'll go back to change.

403
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
I've passed.

404
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,280
I'll change.

405
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
What did you say?

406
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
I've passed.

407
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Da Chengzi.

408
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Don't come back if you don't want to.

409
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,280
No, no, no.

410
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,280
You've been on the show all day.

411
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
You've passed.

412
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
Thank you, Da Shizang.

413
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,280
Bye.

414
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
Thank you for your hard work.

415
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,280
Sister.

416
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,280
I'm glad you've changed your sound system.

417
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
I've been thinking about it

418
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
since the beginning of the recording.

419
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,280
But I've never had the chance to try before.

420
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,280
Thanks to your new name,

421
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
I've prepared myself.

422
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
This isn't my own work.

423
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,280
This is the result of our hard work.

424
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Because of my lack of operation,

425
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,280
I've caused you trouble.

426
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
I'm sorry.

427
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,280
It's okay.

428
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,280
Just invite us to sing.

429
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
I'm here to work with you.

430
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
I've invited you to breakfast.

431
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
You can invite me to dinner.

432
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,280
President Xiao.

433
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,280
You must be responsible for this accident.

434
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,280
But apart from this,

435
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,280
there are more people

436
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,280
who are responsible for this.

437
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,280
The purchasing department.

438
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:14,000
Without the progress of the

439
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,280
contract,

440
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,280
the financial input of the contract is delayed.

441
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
The technical department.

442
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
The contract is not approved

443
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,280
by the two people at the same time.

444
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
The technical department is responsible for

445
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
Su Zhizhou.

446
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
It's against the rules

447
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,280
that the audit and signature can be made.

448
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
Besides them,

449
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
there is one person

450
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,280
who is responsible for this.

451
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,280
As the director of the company,

452
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,280
I don't have a strict

453
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,280
rules and regulations.

454
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,280
So I'm responsible for this.

455
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
I'll take this 50%

456
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,280
of the loss-free use.

457
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,280
The rest,

458
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,280
according to the responsibility,

459
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
will be deducted

460
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,280
from President Li,

461
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,280
President Su, and President Xiao.

462
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
President Ji.

463
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
President Xiao.

464
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
I've made a mistake.

465
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,280
I'm willing to bear all the costs.

466
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
What I just said

467
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,280
is the final result of the treatment.

468
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,280
This matter

469
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
is considered to be

470
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,280
a financial lesson for us.

471
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
Our company

472
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,280
used to be not good enough.

473
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
From now on,

474
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
we have to

475
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
take this rule.

476
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
I'll send a notice later.

477
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
If there is

478
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,280
another thing

479
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
that causes the loss of the company,

480
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,280
we will

481
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,280
strictly follow the

482
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
responsibility of the corresponding person.

483
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,280
In the future,

484
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,280
everything will be done

485
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,280
with the help of the company.

486
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,280
There will be a chance.

487
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
There will be a chance.

488
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
I see.

489
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
This is a big card

490
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,280
that we met in the new city.

491
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,280
But I saw

492
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,280
everyone's group.

493
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
I believe

494
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
after this,

495
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
we will be more

496
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
cautious.

497
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
Okay.

498
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
I want to tell you a good news.

499
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,280
This is what President Han gave me today.

500
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,280
Take a look.

501
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
What is this?

502
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,280
Invitation?

503
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,280
AI medical exhibition meeting.

504
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
Are we going to participate?

505
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,280
Yes.

506
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,280
We can take this exhibition meeting

507
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
to find some

508
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,280
clinical trial and cooperation

509
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
that is suitable for the meeting.

510
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
That's awesome.

511
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,280
President Si, let's take a look.

512
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,280
This...

513
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,280
If I listen to this,

514
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
many people will go.

515
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
Yes.

516
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,280
Xin,

517
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,280
you just said that

518
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
he has a level of level.

519
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
Indeed,

520
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,280
the MVP professor is awesome.

521
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
I would have known

522
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
that he is a real class.

523
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
Then you may not

524
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
find such a good teacher.

525
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
Okay.

526
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
That's all for today's meeting.

527
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,280
Everyone, get off work.

528
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
I'm sorry.

529
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
I have to go now.

530
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
I'm so sorry.

531
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
I'm sorry.

532
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
I'll go now.

533
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
I'm sorry.

534
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
Hello.

535
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,280
Hello.

536
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
Hello.

537
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,280
Hello.

538
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,280
Hello, Mr. Han.

539
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
Hello.

540
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
Hello.

541
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,280
Hello.

542
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Hello.

543
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,280
Hello.

544
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
Hello.

545
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,520
You gave me the opportunity to correct my mistakes.

546
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,440
When I broke the silver machine,

547
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,520
I felt that the sky was falling.

548
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,280
I thought about all the worst possibilities.

549
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,600
But nothing happened.

550
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,920
You didn't deny me.

551
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,960
You blamed me for opening the door.

552
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
And you brought me a fixed silver machine.

553
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,480
To me,

554
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,840
it's like I'm from hell to heaven.

555
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,640
President.

556
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,760
When everyone makes mistakes,

557
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,160
it's not your problem to break the silver machine.

558
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,080
You're a person who can be responsible

559
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,040
and can make up for your mistakes.

560
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,920
Now that we've fixed the silver machine,

561
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,680
you can make up for your mistakes.

562
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,880
President Qi.

563
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,440
Don't worry.

564
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,640
I'll work on the details.

565
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,800
I won't make mistakes again.

566
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:12,880
Okay.

567
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,880
I believe you.

568
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
It's late.

569
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,160
You took a break yesterday.

570
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,280
Go back and rest.

571
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,440
You've been working on it.

572
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,920
Go back and rest.

573
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,040
I'll go now.

574
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,600
When will you come back?

575
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,120
I'll be right back.

576
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,320
Wait for me at home.

577
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,040
What are you doing?

578
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,840
You're not coming out yet?

579
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,440
Coming.

580
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,680
You're in a good mood.

581
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,000
Can I make this understanding

582
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,000
to develop with me?

583
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,440
You don't want to?

584
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,280
Of course.

585
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,760
I want to be a good person.

586
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,160
Okay.

587
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,920
Mr. Xiao.

588
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,560
I'm a good person.

589
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,240
Especially for the taste.

590
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,960
If you're not good at it,

591
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,880
remember to clean it before entering the door.

592
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,880
Don't bring other people's taste back.

593
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,600
I'm also very picky.

594
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,800
I've found the taste

595
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,760
that makes me comfortable.

596
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,680
Why do I still need to go out to find it?

597
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,240
That's disgusting.

598
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,520
What makes Lili so happy

599
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,680
I don't think it's just me.

600
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,480
Something good happened in the company today.

601
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,520
We solved a crisis

602
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,880
that was extremely dangerous today.

603
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,400
I must thank her

604
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,200
no matter who it is.

605
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,640
I hope you feel better.

606
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,000
Here.

607
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,080
I was saying that

608
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,360
when I...

609
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,920
I thought this is how we talk in the kitchen.

610
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,120
Tell me the proof.

611
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,480
I'm telling you those words

612
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,620
Have you finished the cooking?

613
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,160
No, not yet.

614
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,020
otypes footage

615
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,440
They're all in the kitchen.

616
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,380
They're all boughterella

617
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,560
How can you talk?

618
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,760
I think

619
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,780
enough is enough.

620
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,780
It's hot, bit guys.

621
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,120
But tomorrow,

622
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,020
I'll get rid of you.

623
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:12,840
Of course.

624
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,120
See you in three days.

625
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,020
Prepare yourself.

626
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,680
I'd like to say thank you to you.

627
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,040
Mr. Han, do you know

628
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,360
you're not very polite

629
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,640
when you're in a tight relationship?

630
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,280
You're a bit cold-hearted.

631
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,200
I can answer you now.

632
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,960
I can answer you now.

633
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,760
I can answer you now.

634
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,280
Is Da Hong good today?

635
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
99% of the time is very good.

636
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
The rest is not good.

637
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
I choose to forgive him.

638
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
Give me a few of his photos.

639
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Da Hong.

640
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,480
Da Hong.

641
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,480
Mr. Han wants to see you.

642
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Come over and take a few photos for me.

643
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,480
Mr. Han.

644
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,480
You're fat.

645
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,480
All animals are cuter when they're fat.

646
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,480
You can also be fat.

647
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,480
Mr. Han.

648
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,480
Mr. Han.

649
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
Thank you.

650
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,480
I'm at the hotel.

651
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
I'll wait for you.

652
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Okay, Xin Xin.

653
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
Have a good rest.

654
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
I'll be there tomorrow night.

655
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
How is your relationship?

656
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
He's my boss.

657
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
And I'm his secretary.

658
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
You knew each other before?

659
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,480
He's my junior in college.

660
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,480
You're very curious now.

661
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
I want to know

662
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
about you.

663
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,480
You're a bit double-edged.

664
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
I don't know what you're doing.

665
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,480
I'm a investor.

666
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
You're so broad-minded.

667
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,480
You're not sincere.

668
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
I'm a investor.

669
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
You know it.

670
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
I can do anything.

671
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,480
Have you ever had a medical treatment?

672
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
Yes.

673
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
I've seen the project.

674
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
What project?

675
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
It's rare to have a meeting.

676
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,480
You want to have a job.

677
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,480
Try this.

678
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,480
It's good.

679
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,480
It's good.

680
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,480
Mr. Su.

681
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Yes.

682
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,480
The sample of the exhibition is checked.

683
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,480
Okay.

684
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
Okay.

685
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,480
I'll take you to dinner.

686
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
No.

687
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,480
You'll have a meal with me.

688
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,480
Okay.

689
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
I'm not going now.

690
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,480
The exhibition is important.

691
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,480
I have to check the materials.

692
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
I know you're not happy

693
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,480
after you've lost your love.

694
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,480
But you've been working overtime

695
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,480
all day and night.

696
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
You've been so bad to yourself.

697
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
Think about it.

698
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
It's okay.

699
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,480
I'm not happy.

700
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
It's okay.

701
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
Actually,

702
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,480
when I first knew

703
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Li Jie had a boyfriend,

704
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,480
I was quite upset.

705
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,480
I also wanted to

706
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,480
work hard to make up for myself.

707
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,480
But then I calmed down.

708
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,480
I also saw

709
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
the difference

710
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,480
between me and Li Jie's boyfriend.

711
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
You're so close.

712
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,480
Mr. Su, don't say that.

713
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
You're okay.

714
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,480
It's better to see yourself

715
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
working harder.

716
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,480
Support your boyfriend.

717
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
Okay.

718
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Don't bother me.

719
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
I'm going to have dinner.

720
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,480
I'm too busy.

721
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
Go. Go. Go.

722
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,480
I'll take you there.

723
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,480
Okay.

724
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,480
Take me there.

725
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,480
Okay.

726
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,480
What's up, Zhi Zhao?

727
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
Nothing.

728
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
I just wanted to ask

729
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,480
how's the place?

730
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,480
I've arrived at the hotel.

731
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
Everything is going well.

732
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,480
How's the sample and

733
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
the materials

734
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,480
we're going to have?

735
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,480
It's all ready.

736
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,480
Don't worry.

737
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
I promise to let our stars

738
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
come to the world.

739
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
A great person.

740
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,480
Okay.

741
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
You've been working hard recently.

742
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
It's not easy to get out of the gate.

743
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
Go and have a look.

744
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
I don't have time.

745
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,480
I have to go to the hotel.

746
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,480
I'm going to the hotel.

747
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,480
I'm going to the hotel.

748
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,480
I'm going to the hotel.

749
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
I have to

750
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
start the homework in advance.

751
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
I have to know

752
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
the materials of the guests first.

753
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
Then

754
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,480
I can

755
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
catch the key to the forum

756
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,480
as soon as possible.

757
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,480
Xing,

758
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
you have to learn to relax.

759
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,480
Do you know

760
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,480
who's the guest in our opening?

761
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
Who?

762
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Han Ting.

763
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Mr. Han is so good.

764
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,480
Xing, we're on the same team.

765
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Okay.

766
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
I'll leave it to you.

767
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,480
I'm going to start the homework.

768
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,480
Okay. Bye, Xing.

769
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Bye.

770
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,480
Xing.

771
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,480
Xing, what are you busy with?

772
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,480
I'm checking the materials.

773
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
My waist is aching.

774
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,480
My neck is aching.

775
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,480
I'm working in the muscles.

776
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,480
Have you eaten yet?

777
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
I'm eating instant noodles.

778
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,480
Tu Xiaomeng.

779
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,480
I'm telling you.

780
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,480
You have to sleep.

781
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,480
You should put the mouse in the room.

782
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
I missed their

783
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,480
time to put the food in.

784
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,480
I'll use the mouse to charge it.

785
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
It's hard to get a job.

786
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Don't put it in the room.

787
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
Try the local food.

788
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,480
Go downstairs to the hotel's restaurant.

789
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,480
You should eat the mouse in the room.

790
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
Exactly.

791
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
I just made a strategy.

792
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,480
There's a famous restaurant

793
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
next to the hotel.

794
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
It's so good.

795
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
Xing,

796
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,480
you have to be considerate in your business.

797
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
You have to take care of yourself.

798
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
Okay. I'll go there later.

799
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,480
Why is the building

800
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
getting worse and worse?

801
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,480
Do you have a blind date?

802
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,480
I don't have time to blind date.

803
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
I have a busy job.

804
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,480
Isn't your company

805
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,480
a nursing unit?

806
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
What's wrong?

807
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,480
Okay.

808
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
Xiaomeng, I'm telling you.

809
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
Go live.

810
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,480
Okay.

811
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,480
I forgot to talk.

812
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,480
Bye.

813
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,480
Bye.

814
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,480
Hello.

815
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
Pack this.

816
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Thank you.

817
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Okay. Wait a minute.

818
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
Yi Chen,

819
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,480
are you free tomorrow?

820
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,480
Yi Chen,

821
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,480
are you free tomorrow?

822
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,480
My friend gave me two flowers.

823
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
How about we go together?

824
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,480
Qiu,

825
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,480
I've been waiting for you

826
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,480
for two days.

827
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,480
I'm preparing

828
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,480
the interview of the New Hong Kong Hospital.

829
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,480
Sorry.

830
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
I can't go there.

831
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,480
Okay.

832
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
You can do it.

833
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
I'll definitely win.

834
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
Okay.

835
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
I'll do it for you.

836
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Hello, uncle.

837
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
Are you free tomorrow?

838
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
I know.

839
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,480
The decoration is so good.

840
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,480
The equipment and instruments are all set.

841
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,480
I'll send it to you.

842
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
I'll open the night market

843
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,480
when everything is ready.

844
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,480
Okay. Bye.

845
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,480
Thank you, baby.

846
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,480
I love you.

847
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,480
Thank you for your concern about the apartment.

848
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,480
Thank you for the gift

849
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,480
that your friend gave you.

850
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,480
I'll marry you.

851
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,480
My friend said that he wants to marry me.

852
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,480
But he's smart.

853
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,480
I'll marry you?

854
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,480
Thank you for your concern about the apartment.

855
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,480
Thank you for your concern about the apartment.

856
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,480
Thank you.

857
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,480
Thank you for the gift

858
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,480
that Mr. Lu gave me.

859
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,480
Thank you for your support.

860
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,480
Thank you.

861
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,480
Okay, guys.

862
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,480
You can click on the song first.

863
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
I'll come back later

864
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,480
and see what you want to hear.

865
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,480
Okay.

866
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,480
No need to thank me.

867
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,480
I didn't get a small gift.

868
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,480
But I finally passed

869
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,480
my proposal.

870
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,480
I have to thank you

871
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
for your friendship.

872
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,480
Okay.

873
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
Thank you for your gift.

874
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,480
I can give you a chance to click on the song.

875
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,480
Tell me.

876
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
What song do you want to hear?

877
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
I'll come and see

878
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,480
what song you want to hear.

879
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,480
It's so lively today.

880
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,480
Are you free tomorrow?

881
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,480
Help me see

882
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,480
what's going on

883
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,480
at the bar.

884
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
Yes, Mr. Lu.

885
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,480
Thank you, guys.

886
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,480
Thank you for your gift.

887
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
Thank you.

888
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
I'll share one noodle.

889
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,480
Okay, wait a minute.

890
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Mr. Lu.

891
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,480
What are you doing?

892
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,480
I just had a business deal.

893
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,480
I just had dinner.

894
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,480
Did you go out for fun?

895
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,480
No.

896
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,480
I was having a class in the room.

897
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
Don't think I'm

898
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,480
a student.

899
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,480
What class?

900
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,480
Business secret.

901
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,480
Business secret.

902
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,480
I'm sorry.

903
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,480
I'm sorry.

904
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,480
I'm sorry.
