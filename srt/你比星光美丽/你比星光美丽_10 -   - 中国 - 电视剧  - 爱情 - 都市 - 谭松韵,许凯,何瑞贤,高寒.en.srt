I sent Ji Xing back, after all.

Take care of her.

60
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,310
Thanks.

61
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,590
The three of you...

62
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,000
Why are you all here so early?

63
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,030
Do you know what you did last night?

64
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,760
What did I do?

65
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,830
I can't remember anything.

66
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,590
I blacked out.

67
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,350
I just remember I was drinking in a bar.

68
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,680
And then...

69
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,590
How did I come back?

70
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,030
Han Ting sent you back.

71
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,870
Han Ting?

72
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,230
He met you in the bar.

73
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,960
Who changed me?

74
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,400
I did.

75
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,880
OK, OK.

76
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,960
That's good.

77
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,750
What's so good?

78
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,990
Do you know how scary you were last night?

79
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,440
You gave us quite a lot of trouble.

80
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,680
You came last night?

81
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,590
Not the three of us here.

82
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,280
But Han Ting, a lesser man,

83
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,470
and me.

84
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,800
Mr. Lu we met

85
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,830
at Qiuzi's blind date.

86
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,320
Right. When I woke up this morning,

87
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
I saw a lot of missed calls

88
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,870
from Lu Linjia.

89
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,870
He said you were drunk

90
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,160
and asked me for your address.

91
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,800
I went to sleep too early last night

92
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,750
to answer the phone.

93
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,870
But later,

94
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,470
he asked Xiaomeng for your address.

95
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,630
Never mind. This guy isn't important.

96
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,040
Ji Xing,

97
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
do you know you kept singing

98
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,990
when you were drunk

99
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,350
and uttering dreary cries?

100
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,830
Nobody could stop you.

101
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,800
At last, Mr. Han got you
to your room on his shoulder.

102
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,120
Take care of her.

103
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,760

164
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,160
We broke up.

165
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,350
Broke...

166
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,280
What happened

167
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,750

You've been sweet all the time.

169
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,630
He said we had different plans for the future.

170
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,350
But you were together for four years.

171
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,870
How could you just

172
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,710
let it go?

173
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,510

00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,510

- Where's my phone?
- Don't call him.

182
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,110

184
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,200
She said they broke up,

185
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,710
so she and Shao Yichen

186
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,350

187
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,960

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,350
From this day on,

189
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,800
never bring up Shao Yichen in front of her

190
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,350
in case she feels sad.

191
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,460
(OK. Congratulations, Xing.)

192
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,140
(No need. The problem is solved.)

193
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,700
(Xing, I need money.
Can you lend me some?)

194
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,780
(Yichen, Only 3 days of Moments are visible.)

195
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,230
(This is love.)

196
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,750
(It can't be started)

197
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,800
(without a mutual decision.)

198
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,200
(But one alone)

199
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,280
(can decide to end it.)

200
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,320
(My boyfriend of four years)

201
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,590
(disappeared from my life)

202
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,630
(so unexpectedly like this.)

203
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,780
(Han Ting)

204
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,460
(Another new product will be released!)

205
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,380
(Hanhai continues to lead
the 3D medical printing industry.)

206
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,830
(Han Ting)
When can Xingchen

207
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,110
release its new product?

208
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,160
Any plan?

209
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,680
I'll speed up.

210
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,160
(Han Ting)
Hope you'll do your best.

211
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,920
(Ji Xing)
I will.

212
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:32,990
(Han Ting)
Before Chinese New Year,

213
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,920
I'll see the detailed annual plan of Xingchen.

214
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,230
(Ji Xing)
I will make it.

215
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,470
Remember to have breakfast.
Or you'll have nothing to vomit.

216
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,420

217
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,660

Look at your scarf.

235
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,710
Let me put it on you.

236
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,160
- You'll smother me.
- Sorry.

237
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,440
I'll do like this.

238
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,070
Feeling better, huh?

239
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,200
- Let's go.
- OK.

240
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,390
Xing.

241
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,310
Xing.

242
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,200
Xing, stop running.

243
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,510
You'll drop your scarf.

244
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,360
The play is about to begin.

245
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,600
You forgot to take your phone

246
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,510
and then the tickets.

247
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,030
Next time, you'll keep them, OK?

248
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,200
OK. Whatever you say.

249
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,710
- Let's go.
- Do you feel warmer?

250
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,990
- Yes.
- Let's go.

251
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,360
Shall we go watch a movie?

252
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,640
Let's not stay at home for the weekend.

253
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,120
No date for today?

254
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,120
The one I want to date
is never available at weekends.

255
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,750
Xing isn't home?

256
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,510
She's working overtime in her office.

257
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,550
She said her investor

258
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,920
rushed her for a new proposal.

259
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
She has worked non-stop for a long time.

260
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,790
If it goes on like this,

261
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,840
she'll be worn out.

262
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,960
To her,

263
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,120
the exhaustion from work

264
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,360
isn't as terrible as the pain from love.

265
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,710
She and Shao Yichen were in love for years.

266
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,360
They're kind of a family.

267
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,920
The breakup must be torturing her.

268
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,640
So, the busier, the better

269
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,120
in case she has foolish thoughts.

270
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,200
It makes sense.

271
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,440
Lately, Xing

272
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,440
has been completely committed to work.

273
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,400
She can't have the energy

274
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,510
to think of Shao Yichen.

275
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,400
Now, she's getting busy

276
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,160
and her company is on track.

277
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,710
In this case,

278
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,120
Mr. Han has helped her a lot.

279
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,710
(Ji Xing)
Mr. Han, I've done some research

280
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,400
these two weeks, and I found many problems

281
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,440
with our previous proposal.

282
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,440
I'll amend the problems

283
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,750
in the annual plan.

284
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,160
When it's done, I'll brief you.

285
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,520
(Han Ting)
OK.

286
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,400
Boss, Miss Ji hasn't briefed you for a while.

287
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,120
Shall I go rush her?

288
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,000
No need.

289
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,630
OK.

290
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,020
(Clinic)

291
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,760
You...

292
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Are you OK?

293
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,920
Are you here for a meeting?

294
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,120
You know what happened, huh?

295
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,750
I do.

296
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,400
Your relationship of four years is gone.

297
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,750
You must hate to leave her.

298
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,030
But I know very well

299
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,120
about Xing.

300
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,120
She's rather resolute.

301
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,230
Since you can't get back,

302
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,230
you should cheer up soon.

303
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,960
I understand.

304
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,790
She's strong.

305
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,270
If she's determined to do something,

306
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,230
she will make it.

307
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,030
I broke up with her.

308
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,030
But I believe she'll let it go.

309
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,070
Yichen, you...

310
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
I'm fine.

311
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,230
I just...

312
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,550
I just need some more time.

313
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,440
You're an excellent man.

314
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,990
You should think more

315
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,120
about work.

316
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,200
When you're frustrated in love,

317
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,840
you should try hard in your career.

318
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,400
Don't drink too much coffee, though.

319
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,880
Or you may be sleepless.

320
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,200
OK.

321
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,440
Are you available?

322
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,440
May I go to your office?

323
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,880
I have some confusion
about medical materials

324
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,960
to consult you.

325
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,600
OK. Let's go.

326
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,830
This way.

327
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,870
What's wrong?

328
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,990
Nothing. The water pipe is broken.

329
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,440
I... I'll have it fixed later.

330
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,980
(Targets for Phases)

331
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,270
Hanhai's new generation

332
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,550
of Trabecular Cage

333
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,750
gets a lot of attention
as soon as it's launched.

334
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,790
It's not surprising.

335
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,600
As for Xingchen...

336
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,160
What are you going to do?

337
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,030
Don't blame me for nagging.

338
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,030
Xingchen's business

339
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,600
is totally overlapped with Hanhai's.

340
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,160
The faster Hanhai develops,

341
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,600
the more pressure Xingchen will face.

342
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,790
Big fish eat smaller fish.

343
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,990
Xingchen has just got started.

344
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,030
I'm worried that your cousin

345
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,550
may give you a hard time

346
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,840
for Xingchen.

347
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,200
Without Xingchen,

348
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,750
would my cousin let me go?

349
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,790
You needn't have been as passive as now.

350
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,520
If I had known it,

351
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,400
I wouldn't advise you to invest in Xingchen.

352
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,510
Don't have unnecessary concerns.

353
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,230
Xingchen has its way to go.

354
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,110
Come on.

355
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,160
You'll just console yourself.

356
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,240
Some advice for you.

357
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,750
In love, you should put in more.

358
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,590
But in investment,

359
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,710
leave Xingchen to its fate.

360
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,440
I stand by what I said.

361
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,160
I never invest in a worthless company.

362
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,070
You just deny it.

363
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,920
Others may not know

364
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,200
how fast Hanhai develops.

365
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,230
But you're very clear.

366
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,990
When Hanhai has

367
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,030
massive production,

368
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,360
before your cousin or the directors complain,

369
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,990
the market will crush Xingchen.

370
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,470
I have confidence in Ji Xing.

371
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,590
Don't you eat?

372
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,550
Hanhai has launched its new product.

373
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,600
Han Yuan will not let go

374
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,400
of this chance to find fault with Xingchen.

375
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,090
Leaving already?

376
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,440
I have a meeting.

377
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,740
Boss,

378
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,990
you've been dedicated to Dongyang Medical.

379
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,550
When you were this busy,

380
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,840
Ms. Yuan still embarrassed you
at the executives' meeting.

381
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,510
And those executives.

382
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,750
They chime in with others

383
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,440
and have no judgments at all.

384
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,790
They only care about their own interests

385
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,600
and all they want is the result.

386
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,710
Nothing is wrong with that.

387
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,840
But Xingchen really has to speed up

388
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,160
and make a difference soon.

389
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,120
Or you have to bear all the stress.

390
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,120
You can't always be satirized like this.

391
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,640
Have you ever had a breakup?

392
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:31,870
Of course.

393
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,840
How long does it take to let it go?

394
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
One or two months.

395
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,680
But a breakup

396
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,160
would not affect my work.

397
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,230
One or two months?

398
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,630
Mr. Han,

399
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,990
the annual plan of Xingchen

400
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,830
has been done.

401
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,200
When are you available?

402
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,310
I'll go brief you.

403
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,160
At half past six today.

404
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,550
OK. I'll be there on time.

405
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,030
It won't take that long, I think.

406
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,840
Go and improve your anti-pressure ability.

407
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,840
I'm on it.

408
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,350
Oh, no.

409
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,070
I'm going to work now.

410
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,960
Come in.

411
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,960
Mr. Han.

412
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,230
You've come at last, Miss Ji.

413
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,510
I thought you would discard your company.

414
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,400
Sorry.

415
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,030
I was drunk that night.

416
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,600
And I had a drunken talk.

417
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,760
Drunken talk?

418
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,400
When wine is in, truth is out, huh?

419
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,640
This is Xingchen's annual plan for next year.

420
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,840
I emailed you the electronic copy.

421
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,710
This is the printed copy for your comments.

422
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,030
Entrepreneurs compete

423
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,230
in not only brain

424
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,680
but also physical power.

425
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,200
Hope you can adjust yourself

426
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,230
as soon as possible.

427
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,960
Keep your weight no less than 45 kilograms.

428
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,240
Otherwise,

429
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,510
I wonder if I'll give you the next payment.

430
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,360
Seriously?

431
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,920
I mean...

432
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,440
Does an investor have to restrain

433
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,030
the entrepreneur's life or weight?

434
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,440
Or would the entrepreneur

435
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,840
restrain her investor instead?

436
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,590
Look at you.

437
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,600
You have a point.

438
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,990
If you don't mind, I should go.

439
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,040
It's late.

440
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,200
Shall we have dinner?

441
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,270
No, thanks. I have things to do.

442
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,240
Fine.

443
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,310
Did she or did she not let it go?

444
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,760
You're back.

445
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,720
Mom.

446
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,680
Let me see.

447
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,590
I'm fine.

448
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,070
Come on, Xing.

449
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,680
If I hadn't called Yichen,

450
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,470
I wouldn't know you broke up.

451
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,920
Why did you not tell your parents

452
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,680
about such a big case?

453
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,990
There's no point telling you.

454
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,070
I didn't want you to worry about me.

455
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,070
When you said nothing,
we were more worried.

456
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,790
Look at you. You didn't tell us

457
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,940
you suffered at work and resigned.

458
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,230
When you started a company,

459
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,640
you even kept it more secret.

460
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,440
We didn't know how you were doing.

461
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,230
At home, we could do nothing but worry.

462
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,550
I was so worried

463
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,200
that I came to check on you.

464
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,990
Come on. I'm wrong.

465
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,510
Stop lecturing me.

466
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,350
All right.

467
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,280
Are you hungry?

468
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,920
I've brought you a lot of food.

469
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,270
It's being heated.
Wash your hands and have it.

470
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,510
- OK.
- Let's talk later.

471
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,710
Where's Tu Xiaomeng?

472
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,470
She had a date with a friend

473
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,400
and she went out.

474
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,960
Too bad for her.

Hello, Mr. Han.

478
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,600
The comments are done.

479
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,800
Let's meet tomorrow.

480
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,800
Great.

481
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,990
I'll go see you tomorrow.

482
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,990
No. I'll meet you in your place.

483
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,400
OK. Bye-bye.

484
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,960
The romantic weekend is off.

485
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
What are you doing here?

486
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,920
I know you must be awake.

487
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,220
I brought you a late night snack.

488
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,440
Come in.

489
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,380
What?

490
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,160
Do you like this decoration style?

(2023 Annual Plan,

492
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,710
When I knew you would come back to China,

493
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,360
I kept looking for a flat for you

494
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,400
and picking the furniture.

495
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,120
I visited many stores

496
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,990
before I finally bought

497
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,070
this couch for you.

498
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,960
You always have good taste.

499
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,710
You should pay attention to your health.

500
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,120
The couch is for you to sit on

501
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,750
for relaxation and rest.

502
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,550
It's for your overtime work.

503
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,510
Come over.

504
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,550
Taste it and see if you like it.

and shrimp dumplings from this canteen

510
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,880
taste very good.

511
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,750
Taste it.

512
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,990
All is your favorite.

513
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,960
I hear the directors

514

have been giving you a hard time.

515
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,840
Don't be too stressed.

516
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,440
I talked to Dr. Jiang.

517
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,030
He inspired me a lot

518
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,160
and recommended to me

519
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,550
some excellent talents.

520
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,230
I believe Bay Phase II will

521
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,440
make a significant breakthrough.

522
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,880
I'll show you the report.

See if it can relieve your stress.

You're doing a good job.

525
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,360
But you don't need

526
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,750
to force Bay Phase II to advance.

527
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,960
Just do it the right way.

528
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,440
Whatever you say.

529
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,750
Actually,

530
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,270
I want you to do me a favor.

531
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,760
Go ahead.

532
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,960
I want to hire Dr. Jiang Huai

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,030
as the consultant of our technical department.

534
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,360
I'll talk to Dr. Jiang.

535
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,310
You will?

536
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,550
Thank you.

537
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,400
Oh, look at me.

538
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,600
I told you to rest

539
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,880
and eat regularly.

540
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,510
But I talked about work again.

541
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,710
This fish tank looks good.

542
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,920
Who gave it to you?

00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,880
Grandaunt.

544
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,400
Seems a shame to keep it vacant.

545
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,840
How about I buy some pretty fish

546
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,680
and bring them to you?

547
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,600
No need. It's good.

548
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,800
That's right.

549
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,120

550
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,440

Let me taste it for Ji Xing.

554
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,550
The rest will be yours.

555
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,030
Come on. You just sound mean.

556
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,840
You actually care about her.

557
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,790
But you fake overtime work at the weekend.

558
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,840

559
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
she can't feel

00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,550
but complain of your sponging off her?

562
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,990
Clean the kitchen.

563
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,510
You never clean up the mess.

564
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:43,960
Where is it?

565
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,240
It's not under the flowerpot.

566
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,150
Who are you?

567
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,670
Oh, I found it.

568
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,150
OK. Come back early.

569
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,990
You must be Su, huh?

570
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,550
I'm Xing's mother.

571
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,320
Xing told me about you.

572
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,400
What is the problem

573
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,310
of your investor?

574
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,310
Come on.

575
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,880
He makes you work at the weekend.

576
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,960
Young guys like you

577
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,150
don't care about anything when you work.

578
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,470
You know what? Work can never be done.

579
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,310
Here. Hold them for me.

580
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,670
When your health is ruined,

581
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,720
you'll have nothing.

582
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,880
So, you must stay healthy,

583
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,110
by eating and drinking regularly.

584
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,190
Come on. Get in here, Su.

585
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,760
Is it the takeout food you ordered?

586
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,190
Young guys like you

587
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,240
love takeout food.

588
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,240
Listen.

589
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,670
You must not eat this anymore.

590
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,320
It's not good for your health at all.

591
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,510
If you keep eating it... Here.

592
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,550
Please wash the strawberries.

593
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,110
Here. Hurry.

594
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,280
What's going on?

595
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,580
Oh, God.

596
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,440
The water pipe is broken.

597
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,670
Come on. Wipe yourself.

598
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,960
Oh, you're all wet.

599
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,110
Get changed. Or you'll catch a cold.

600
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,470
It's OK. It'll dry soon, Mrs. Ji.

601
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,990
No spare clothes here, huh?

602
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,920
Hey, young man.

603
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,550
The weather changes.

604
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,800
You need spare clothes in the office.

605
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,030
Here. This is the cardigan

606
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,110
I brought Xing.

607
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,720
No, thanks, Mrs. Ji. No need.

608
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,840
Just do it. If you catch a cold,

609
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,800
your parents will worry.

610
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,760
Put it on.

611
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,670
I bought a big size. You can wear it.

612
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,960
Hey, young man.

613
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,400
Don't get cold.

614
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,320
You may not feel it now.

615
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,990
But when you're old, you'll suffer.

616
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,510
You'll have yourself to blame.

617
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,240
Mom.

618
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,560
Mom.

619
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,760
- You're back?
- I'm back.

620
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,070
Come have lunch. Hurry.

621
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,760
Mr. Han?

622
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,400
The tap was broken.

623
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,430
I fixed it.

624
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,360
Thank you.

625
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,470
Xing,

626
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,510
you just called him Mr. Han.

627
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,510
But isn't he Su?

628
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,990
What are you talking about?

629
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,590
He's my investor Han Ting.

630
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,430
Mr. Han.

631
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,400
When I called you Su,

632
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,960
why did you not deny it?

633
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,440
You didn't give him a chance to deny, I guess.

634
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:35,880
Sorry, Mr. Han.

635
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,920
When my mother talks,

636
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,760
no one else can cut in.

637
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,470
Don't say that to your boss.

638
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,280
Go wash your hands.

639
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,550
- Mr. Han, come have lunch.
- OK.

640
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,440
Come over.

641
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,280
Mr. Han isn't necessary.

642
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,470
Call me Han.

643
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,800
OK.

644
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,400
Actually, I'm here

645
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,190
to give Ji Xing the annual plan.

646
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,510
Thanks.

647
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,880
You guys eat. I should go.

648
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,280
Han, don't go.

649
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,280
You can eat with us.

650
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,550
I'm sure Xing has

651
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,550
troubled you a lot.

652
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,880
Take your seat.

653
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,720
Mr. Han, stay for lunch.

654
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,630
Look, so many dishes.
See how my mother cooks.

655
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,550
Yeah. Look. So many dishes.

656
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,110
The two of us can't finish them.

657
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,720
- OK.
- Come and sit.

658
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,550
- Han.
- Thanks, Mrs. Ji.

659
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,590
You should eat more.

660
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,110
You're so thin and need more nutrition.

661
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:18,950
OK.

662
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,110
Xingyue Club offers takeout food?

663
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,320
No. I packed some.

664
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,550
Tastes good.

665
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,440
Sadly, I didn't eat there last time.

666
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,590
Mom, taste some.

667
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:36,910
Takeout food

668
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,760
wouldn't taste better than my dishes.

669
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,630
Look, Han has been

670
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,880
eating my dishes.

671
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,840
Very nice dishes, Mrs. Ji.

672
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,510
I'll eat this alone, then.

673
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,600
So delicious.

674
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,440
Han, you're native, right?

675
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,800
A boss like you must be busy.

676
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,640
Do you have time

677
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,840
to dine with your parents?

678
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,960
Mom, Mr. Han must be very busy.

679
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,760
Stop asking and let him eat.

680
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,880
OK.

681
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,150
My parents passed away.

682
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,840
I'm sorry.

683
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,550
It's OK. It happened years ago.

684
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,840
When we're done eating,

685
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,320
let's add each other on WeChat.

686
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,920
- OK.
- When you have time

687
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,800
to visit Chuancheng,

688
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,030
come to my place for dinner.

689
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,670
I'll make whatever you want to eat.

690
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,190
Obviously, Han

691
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,070
is a young man
who keeps nobody worried.

692
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,240
Unlike you.

693
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,360
Since my daughter was little,

694
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,150
she's been naughty and stubborn.

695
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,840
When she was little,
she wrote in her composition,

696
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,070
"My mother is like

697
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,320
a hard-working pancake."

698
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,160
Say no more.

699
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,630
Xing,

700
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,550
why did you not describe me with better words?

701
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,920
The red-crowned crane

702
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,840
or the peacock. They are beautiful.

703
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,110
Guess what?

704
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,280
"My teacher said

705
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,320
I should make a sentence instead of a rumor."

706
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,590
At that time, she was having loose teeth.

707
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,510
She lost two of her teeth.

708
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,400
Say no more. Just eat.

709
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,720
So funny.

710
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,760
Oh, I remember.

711
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,670
I have her childhood photos.

712
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,550
Let me show you.

713
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,990
- Don't show him.
- You have no idea...

714
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,150
I have the photos. Don't...

715
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,510
- Look.
- Don't.

716
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,400
Look, she was chubby and round.

717
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,550
Don't be embarrassed.

718
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,440
Don't show him such photos.

719
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,800
Everybody used to be a kid.

720
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,720
Everybody.

721
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,510
She even sang songs out of tune.

722
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,630
I thought she actually

723
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,920
looked like a pancake.

724
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,920
So many things here.

725
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,110
Let me carry them up for you.

726
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,070
Don't bother.

727
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,110
We can do it ourselves.

728
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,440
- Mom.
- Han.

729
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,960
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

730
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:15,880
I'll go open the door.

731
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,960
See you later.

732
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,160
Mom...

733
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,720
Sorry.

734
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,190
My mother always

735
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,070
packs the unfinished food.

736
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,190
Sorry for the trouble.

737
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,030
It's good.

738
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,870
Come on.

739
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,320
I'll get them up. Go.

740
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,990
Mr. Han, thank you so much for today.

741
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,320
I didn't know you could fix a tap.

742
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,360
It's nothing.

743
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,150
After all, I was living abroad alone

744
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,630
for a dozen years.

745
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,760
Alone?

746
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,760
Was your grandpa not there for you?

747
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,670
When I arrived in Germany,

748
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,590
he was there for two days.

749
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,320
But because of busy business in China,

750
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,320
he never went there again.

751
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,720
You must have suffered a lot, huh?

752
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,470
An adult always suffers.

753
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,560
Here.

754
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,510
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

755
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,470
I'll clean the cardigan
and give it back to you soon.

756
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,240
It's OK. Take your time.

757
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,190
Sorry, Mr. Han.

758
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,280
I just have

759
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,550
never seen you like a homebody.

760
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,630
Don't blame me.

761
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,510
I won't.

762
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,440
You always display a sign of emotion.

763
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,240
What you said

764
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,150
doesn't sound good.

765
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,160
When I'm back home,

766
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,840
I'll read your comments carefully.

767
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,030
You go get some rest early.

768
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,350
OK.

769
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,510
I should go.

770
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,510
Bye-bye.
