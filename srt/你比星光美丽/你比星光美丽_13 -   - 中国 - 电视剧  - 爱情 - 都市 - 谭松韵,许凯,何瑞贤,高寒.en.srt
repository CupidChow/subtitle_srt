23
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,070
Oh, Ms. Han.

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,240
That man's name

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,840
is Mr. Lu.

26
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,590
Mr. Lu?

27
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,040
Be careful on your way!

28
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,910
I will.

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,790
Whatever I promise you,

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,400
have I ever failed?

31
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,790
No. Thank you, Your Majesty.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,640
Why can I do it right when she's away?

33
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,520
(Lu Linjia)
Will you delete me again?

34
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,800
Who said she would

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,310
never add me again?

36
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,000
Such a slap in her face.

37
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,920
Oh,

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,360
unban my silence

39
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,590
in your live room.

40
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,680
(Smart Lemon)
Why?

41
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,750
Don't ask why.

42
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,280
(Lu Linjia)
You should know exactly.

43
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,840
My mother

44
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,710
pays you.

45
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,310
Is it appropriate to silence her son?

46
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,590
You have three minutes.

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,590
Childish.

48
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,500
(Tu Xiaomeng)

49
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,260
(Smart Lemon)

50
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,150
She hides her posts from me.

51
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,840
(Lu Linjia)
Let me stress the discipline.

52
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,120
For future classes,

53
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,240
one minute you're late,

54
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,400
five will be deducted.

55
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,310
Ten!

56
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,870
He's insane.

57
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,470
Oh, this club again.

58
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,680
Anything wrong?

59
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,470
No.

60
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,560
The food here tastes good.

61
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,400
Here we go.

62
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,910
Mr. Ma, how's your business recently?

63
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,870
Just so-so.

64
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,150
There you are, Mr. Han.

65
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,470
Mr. Han.

66
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,750
Sorry.

67
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,750
Sorry to keep you waiting.

68
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,430
We just arrived, too.

69
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,240
- Sit, please.
- OK.

70
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,080
Since everybody is here,

71
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,360
let's make a toast to Mr. Han.

72
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,430
Sorry.

73
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,680
I won't drink wine today.

74
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,190
I'll have tea, instead.

75
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,800
Cheers.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,840
Cheers.

77
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,430
I hear Dongyang Medical has been

78
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,240
fully enhancing its product lines.

79
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,070
It's courageous of you, Mr. Han.

80
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,920
Nowadays, technology

81
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
is evolving rapidly.

82
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,480
We do innovations

83
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,120
just to develop ahead of the times.

84
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,160
When Doctorcloud

85
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,070
of Dongyang Medical upgrades,

86
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,680
please give us as many comments as you can.

87
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,750
- We will.
- No problem.

88
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,270
Let's eat and talk.

89
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,480
- Come on.
- Let's eat.

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,840
Oh, Mr. Han.

91
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,920
I've had some confusion.

92
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,430
After Doctorcloud upgrades,

93
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,630
what goal is it expected

94
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,600
to reach?

95
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,720
80% of the common diseases

96
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,560
can be diagnosed through AI.

97
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,560
The other 20% complicated diseases

98
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,480
can be diagnosed
through the assistance of doctors.

99
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,120
Doctors will offer a treatment plan faster.

100
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,080
Impressive.

101
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,480
Awesome, indeed.

102
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,920
Mr. Han, a toast to you.

103
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,830
So serious?

104
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,120
It's your first visit here, anyway.

105
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,790
Cedar?

106
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,920
You know this smell?

107
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,040
Every time I meet you,

108
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,870
I can smell it from your hair.

109
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,360
Let's eat.

110
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,150
Such a grand meal.

111
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,080
Thanks.

112
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,470
However,

113
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,360
you got it from a canteen, huh?

114
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,800
Come on.

115
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,600
You know I can't cook.

116
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,950
I'll cook for you.

117
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,150
OK.

118
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,560
Let's eat.

119
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,680
The first piece is for you.

120
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,670
Cheers.

121
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,000
Mr. Han,

122
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,630
Doctorcloud is working very well

123
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,480
in Xinggang Hospital.

124
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
Our dean expects

125
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,680
more cooperation with Dongyang Medical.

126
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,360
Thanks for your introduction, Director Li.

127
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,160
It's just my duty.

128
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,750
Wish us a pleasant cooperation.

129
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,270
Oh, let me introduce her.

130
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,630
This is Ji Xing.

131
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,720
This afternoon,
you met her in the hospital.

132
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,040
Oh, I wondered

133
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,430
why she looked so familiar.

134
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,270
She's in charge of Xingchen Technology.

135
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,950
Now, she does 3D medical printing.

136
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,240
Master's degree in Computer Science
of Xinggang University.

137
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,480
Computer Science of Xinggang University?

138
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,630
Pretty impressive.

139
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,600
- Talent.
- I didn't have a choice.

140
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,590
She was so capable

141
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,120
that she didn't want to work for me.

142
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,830
Instead, she started a company.

143
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,560
To retain talent,
I had to invest in her.

144
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,040
Young guys,

145
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,480
especially the young ladies,

146
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,040
are getting more impressive.

147
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,830
They have ideas and they're courageous.

148
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,160
- Yes.
- Yeah.

149
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,720
A girl Mr. Han invested in

150
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,920
must be competent enough.

151
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,240
Miss Ji, speaking of this,

152
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,430
I graduated from the university
next to yours.

153
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,310
When I was in college,

154
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,950
I often played basketball on your campus.

155
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,880
You did?

156
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,800
So, we're half of the schoolmates.

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,510
- Yes.
- Xingchen has just started.

158
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,360
They'll have the product experiment soon.

159
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,950
Everybody, hope you will

160
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
help her as far as you can.

161
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,630
Don't say that.

162
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,830
We'll just communicate more.

163
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,360
If you're in trouble,

164
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,270
feel free to contact me.

165
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,160
Thank you, Director Li.

166
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,200
Add him on WeChat

167
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,480
for convenient contact.

168
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,630
Miss Ji, let's add each other, too.

169
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,310
Mr. Han thinks highly of you.

170
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,240
You're a young promising lady.

171
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,480
When there's a chance,

172
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,950
you can consider cooperating with us,
Kebo Material.

173
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,240
Let's add each other.

174
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,190
How about we all add her?

175
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,120
Well,

176
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,510
I'll scan your codes, then.

177
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,870
Let them scan yours.

178
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,720
It's too much trouble for you.

179
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,430
That's right.

180
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,470
OK.

181
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,150
OK.

182
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,160
- OK.
- Here.

183
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,840
Thanks.

184
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,000
From now on,

185
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,120
learn as much as you can from them.

186
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,750
Here. A toast to everybody.

187
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,070
- OK.
- Cheers.

188
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,360
Take this meal

189
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,750
as my gratitude for your dealing with Mr. Wu,

190
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,710
Mr. Xiao.

191
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,790
You knew that?

192
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,870
What exactly are you?

193
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,960
How could you be so influential?

194
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,390
You can see me

195
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,000
as a superhero.

196
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,670
Actually, I don't care about that stuff.

197
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,240
You needn't have done that.

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,910
You don't care

199
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,200
because you're mentally strong.

200
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,390
But I can't watch people slander you

201
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,320
but do nothing.

202
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,030
I just did

203
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,240
what I should do.

204
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,200
Now, I've experienced

205
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,440
how thoughtful Mr. Xiao could be.

206
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,240
No wonder so many girls

207
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,840
can't forget you.

208
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,000
If any name upsets you,

209
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,040
delete it.

210
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,440
Just kidding.

211
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,750
So serious?

212
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,030
I'm always serious with you.

213
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,030
I won't do anything so boring.

214
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,360
A rival in love

215
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,270
is never the third guy.

216
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,040
It's late.

217
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,160
I should go.

218
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,360
Get some rest early.

219
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,390
Leaving already?

220
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,670
Life is long.

221
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,030
We'll take our time.

222
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,630
Let me walk you out.

223
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,080
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

224
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,920
Bye-bye.

225
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,870
Mr. Han,

226
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,440
I should go.

227
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,270
We, Huilin Medical,

228
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,720
wish to cooperate with you

229
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,150
when possible.

230
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,870
Dongyang Medical is reforming.

231
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,630
We really need someone like you

232
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,600
who knows products

233
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,750
as well as the marketing

234
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,870
to lead the team.

235
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,080
Dongyang Medical will always

236
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,480
welcome you.

237
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,240
Mr. Han, thank you for your appreciation.

238
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,120
I'll think about it.

239
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,490
OK.

240
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,870
- Bye.
- See you.

241
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,150
What are you thinking?

242
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,630
Nothing.

243
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,670
How time flies!

244
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,960
Last time when I was here,

245
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,790
I still worked for Guanghua.

246
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,120
At that time, before I had dinner,

247
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,270
you had kicked me out.

248
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,030
Do you know

249
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,030
why Zeng Di took you here for dinner?

250
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,550
To make me introduce Bay to Mr. Zhao.

251
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,720
You're good at techniques.

252
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,390
But you know nothing

253
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,120
about business rules.

254
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,030
If Zeng Di only wanted to introduce Bay,

255
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,840
why did she not take Chen Songlin?

256
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,030
Why are there always pretty girls

257
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,480
at dinner?

258
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,670
Never thought about this?

259
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,200
If it's true,

260
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,670
she was outrageous.

261
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,630
Yeah.

262
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,440
Sadly, someone misunderstood my kindness.

263
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,790
I always know you're a nice guy.

264
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,550
I was thinking,

265
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,960
back in college,

266
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,440
we took part in the competition together

267
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,080
and you wouldn't be that merciless.

268
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,270
Don't try to make up.

269
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,110
Get in the car.

270
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,480
Do you like today's dishes?

271
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,080
Yes. They're delicious.

272
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,150
Especially the roast duck.

273
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,030
Thanks for today.

274
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,270
For what?

275
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,150
For introducing me to these people.

276
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,750
How would that help?

277
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,910
If you didn't have real strength,

278
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,200
how many of them do you think

279
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,550
would stay for dinner?

280
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,720
And how many of them would really care?

281
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,720
Only a man of strength

282
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,320
can have real connections.

283
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,870
A worthless man,

284
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,750
however many dinners he goes to,

285
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,670
will be noticed by no one.

286
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,150
Then why did you still take me here?

287
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,960
Today, you wasted your time in the hospital

288
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,240
and even got numb legs

289
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,960
just to get to know Li Quan'an, right?

290
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,510
Then, I took you here.

291
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,000
Don't run around anymore.

292
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,320
On the wrong pathway,

293
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,720
even breaking your legs will not help.

294
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,480
I don't have a choice.

295
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,630
I'm not you.

296
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,600
No one comes to me on their initiative.

297
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,030
Then has your initiative helped?

298
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
Everyone has limited

299
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,960
time and energy.

300
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,030
It should be spent

301
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,460
on something more important and critical.

302
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,080
For the visiting thing,

303
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,630
any experienced salesperson can do.

304
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,000
When you do it yourself,

305
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,670
you look sincere.

306
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,150
But what is your value

307
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,150
of being a leader?

308
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,670
I get it.

309
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,120
A leader

310
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,360
should care more about
company administration,

311
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,670
strategy, and core technology.

312
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,440
Not too silly.

313
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,320
Here I am. Thanks, Mr. Han.

314
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,280
My pleasure.

315
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,320
Teaching you

316
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,960
feels like teaching a pupil, though.

317
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,750
Thank you, teacher.

318
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,150
Since I'm your teacher,

319
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,240
shouldn't you pay your tuition?

320
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,720
Name a price.

321
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,960
5% of the stock.

322
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,840
I knew it.

323
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,480
It's late, Mr. Han.

324
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,960
You go back for some rest early.

325
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,600
Good night.

326
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,840
Is everything ready?

327
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,840
Yes.

328
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,080
Miss Ji will love it.

329
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,920
Ms. Han!

330
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,480
Your son is sleeping.

331
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,240
Is it appropriate to practice singing?

332
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,550
My son played games all night long.

333
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,910
Does he find it appropriate?

334
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,550
Since you knew it,
why did you wake me up?

335
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,550
According to Miss Xiaomeng,

336
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,510
it's the best time to practice

337
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,790
in the morning.

338
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,030
You two are just being mean!

339
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,280
I'm going back to my room!

340
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,550
Off you go.

341
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,800
Ms. Han.

342
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,840
You're in a very good state today.

343
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,910
Super vigorous.

344
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,910
You've touched me.

345
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,480
Super vigorous.

346
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,710
Oh, Xiaomeng.

347
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,120
The more I look at you,
the more adorable you are.

348
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,270
You're hard-working and pretty.

349
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,870
Unlike my son.

350
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,720
He's still sleeping up there.

351
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,150
I'll get him down.

352
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,320
Ms. Han,

353
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,080
I should go.

354
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,510
Don't go.

355
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
I've made some soup.

356
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,000
It's good for our throats.

357
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,670
Have some before you leave.

358
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,960
I didn't do live streaming yesterday.

359
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,070
I promised to do it today.

360
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,110
How about this?

361
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,960
Do it in my house.

362
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,960
You can show...

363
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,750
Show the soup I made you.

364
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,310
Later, I'll make more kinds of soup.

365
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,550
They each have

366
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,440
a different efficacy.

367
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,070
You can introduce the soup today.

368
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,070
What do you think?

369
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,030
Good idea.

370
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,310
- OK.
- Really? Let's go.

371
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,270
Come on.

372
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,720
I'll also get you

373
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,830
some pretty clothes.

374
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,720
Don't bother, Ms. Han.

375
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,200
It's no bother. Not at all.

376
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,350
- Really?
- Really.

377
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,270
(Smart Lemon)
Hello, sweethearts here.

378
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,960
This is Smart Lemon.

379
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,350
(Live streaming is on.)
Right here,

380
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,270
you and I will stay.

381
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,890
Today, in my live streaming,

382
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,000
I'll taste some soup.

383
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,070
Actually, soup...

384
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,100
(Who's this man? What's going on here?)

385
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,110
(Is he Smart Lemon's boyfriend?)
Mom, the soup is salty.

386
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,480
Why are you doing live streaming?

387
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,110
Due to inappropriate content,

388
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,830
this live streamer is banned!

389
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,960
You wear my mother's sweater

390
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,270
and her hairstyle.

391
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,750
I'm not to blame, huh?

392
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,750
What do I do?

393
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,150
How about

394
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,030
you register a new account?

395
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,350
I'll give you a lot of gifts.

396
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,110
Have some soup and calm down.

397
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,590
I won't.

398
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,550
Come on.

399
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,440
New Year gift package for everyone.

400
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,400
Thank you, Su.

401
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,750
Thank you, Mr. Su.

402
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,800
You're welcome.

403
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,110
Shang, this is yours.

404
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,790
Xing is away.

405
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,270
I'll put it here.

406
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,550
Su, it's such a pink box.

407
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,510
It's for a girl, huh?

408
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,480
Did you give me the wrong one?

409
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,590
The same gifts.

410
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,190
Li.

411
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,960
Happy Chinese New Year!

412
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,070
Thanks. Happy Chinese New Year!

413
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,080
Su,

414
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,310
it's so pink.

415
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,070
Are you sure it's for me?

416
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,030
Do you want it? If you don't, give it back.

417
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,510
What is the pattern of my cushion?

418
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,350
I wonder if you'll like it.

419
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,270
I will.

420
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,270
Glad to hear that.

421
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,550
Su,

422
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,590
this is so unfair.

423
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,520
You must have carefully

424
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,310
picked the present for Li.

425
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,310
And this cushion is a giveaway

426
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,550
from her cosmetics, huh?

427
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,590
It's too early to be jealous.

428
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,030
He must have given Xing a better gift.

429
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,720
- The same.
- I'll check it for Miss Ji.

430
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,270
It's the same, Shang!

431
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,240
- I'll just take a look.
- Don't be impolite. The same gift.

432
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,640
So, it's a lumbar pillow.

433
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,640
I feel much better now.

434
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,510
Indeed,

435
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,270
in Mr. Su's heart,

436
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,880
Miss Li is the most important.

437
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,350
Every time I see Miss Li,

438
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,640
I think of Mr. Su.

439
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,960
And every time I see him,

440
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,270
I think of Miss Li.

441
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,310
- You...
- Shang Gaofeng,

442
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,310
just shut up,

443
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,680
will you?

444
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,960
I'll go buy you some water.

445
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,400
It's the festival, or I...

446
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,560
I...

447
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,220
Or I would...

448
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,160
(Han Ting)
Are you back in your hometown?

449
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,550
(Ji Xing)
No. I'm still in Xinggang.

450
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,030
Any orders, Mr. Han?

451
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,190
(Han Ting)
Where are you?

452
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:04,940
(Ji Xing)
Out there.

453
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,550
I'm going back to my office
for overtime work.

454
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,870
What's up?

455
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,760
I'll go see you.

456
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,740
(Han Ting: I'll go see you.)

457
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,030
After so many appeals,

458
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,240
my live-streaming room is finally unbanned.

459
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,240
Wait.

460
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,590
In live streaming,

461
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,240
I make 70 per hour on average.

462
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,960
Every day,

463
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,560
I work for eight hours.

464
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,750
Every week,

465
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,910
I work for seven days.

466
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,080
So much...

467
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,180
(Lu Linjia)

468
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,400
(Lu Linjia)
Lu Linjia, I hate you.

469
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,720
You made me lose so much money.

470
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,580
(Tu Xiaomeng)

471
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,190
No way.

472
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,680
Looks like

473
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,510
I'm asking him for compensation.

474
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,780
(Recall)

475
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,380
(Smart Lemon recalled a message.)

476
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,350
Recalled?

477
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,270
What did she recall?

478
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,880
I bought you some fruit.

479
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,480
Thank you for your hard work.

480
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,590
It's my fault.

481
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,550
I didn't know

482
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,960
the clinic would test the app

483
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,110
on the third day of the new year

484
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,270
and on the fifth day,

485
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,160
the online registration app
would be put into use.

486
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,440
Before the Chinese New Year,

487
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,310
you have to work overtime.

488
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,720
I'm sorry, guys.

489
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,640
Not at all.

490
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,830
I can make money. I love overtime work.

491
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,400
Comrades,

492
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,550
the more codes we type now,

493
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,750
the more bricks we'll lay

494
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,830
for the future of our company.

495
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,670
That's right.

496
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,160
♪Let's work harder♪

497
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,830
The Chinese New Year is coming.

498
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,790
A red packet for each of you.

499
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,720
Happy Chinese New Year!

500
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,430
- Thanks.
- Happy New Year!

501
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,290
Thank you, Xing.

502
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,030
- Thank you, Xing.
- You're welcome.

503
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,790
Xing, wish you a big fortune

504
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,720
in the new year.

505
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,070
Let's make a fortune together.

506
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,030
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

507
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,070
You get packed

508
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,920
and go home for it.

509
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,310
If we all leave,

510
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,640
you'll be working overtime alone

511
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,790
and isn't that inappropriate?

512
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,750
Shang, you and Zhizhou go back now.

513
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,240
I'll keep her company.

514
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,920
Li, you and Shang go back.

515
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,790
I'll stay with Xing.

516
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,920
None of you need to stay.

517
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,680
I also want to go home.

518
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,200
But my parents live too far away.

519
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,790
Your families live very close.

520
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,350
Not going home makes no sense.

521
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,030
But leaving you alone at this time

522
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,510
will be really unreasonable.

523
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,960
It's reasonable. It is.

524
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,750
There's not too much work left.

525
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,270
When you stay, you'll slow me down.

526
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,880
If I need anything,

527
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,830
I'll call you, OK?

528
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,030
- OK.
- OK.

529
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,920
I'll stop the pleasantries, then.

530
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,030
I'm going home.

531
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,240
No problem. Just go.

532
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,830
- Happy New Year!
- The same to you.

533
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,680
Bye-bye.

534
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,560
Bye-bye, Xing.

535
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,720
I'll only stay for the dinner.

536
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,270
I'll be back on the first day to wrap it up.

537
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,590
No. Don't come back unless I tell you to.

538
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,480
Spend more time with your family.

539
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,630
OK.

540
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,720
I will, boss.

541
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,880
After visiting some clients this afternoon,

542
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,350
I'll go home.

543
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,390
OK.

544
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,640
You go back home early today.

545
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,960
You won't go back to your hometown,

546
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,310
but tomorrow is the New Year's Eve.

547
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,400
Have a day off.

548
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,630
I will.

549
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,720
Hug me.

550
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,000
- Bye-bye, sweetheart.
- Off you go.

551
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,480
- Bye-bye.
- I should go.

552
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,400
Bring my regards to your mother.

553
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,270
You go back early.

554
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,110
I will.

555
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,700
(Xiao Yixiao)
Going back home?

556
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Mr. Xiao,

557
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,680
let me guess.

558
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,200
You can't be nearby, can you?

559
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,030
You really came.

560
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,110
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

561
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,680
I'll have dinner with my family.

562
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,680
We can't meet, then.

563
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,550
I should come and give you

564
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,390
the New Year's presents.

565
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,880
I'll put them in your trunk.

566
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,400
So many presents?

567
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,480
During the Chinese New Year,

568
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,200
you'll visit your relatives.

569
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,070
I've prepared the presents

570
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,270
in case you need them.

571
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,160
You can just hand out the presents.

572
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,430
These days,

573
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,880
take good care of yourself.

574
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,030
It's about time.

575
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,070
I should go back.

576
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,750
Let's meet after the festival.

577
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,680
I'll miss you.

578
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,680
Come on. Off you go.

579
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,150
I'm leaving.

580
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,750
Drive safe.

581
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,840
I will.

582
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,790
Sorry, Mom.

583
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,880
I'm not coming back
for the Chinese New Year.

584
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,030
Xing, on such a holiday,

585
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,510
do you have to be this busy?

586
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,240
Our client suddenly requested

587
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,590
an early submission.

588
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,590
I have to go around the clock.

589
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,390
Xing,

590
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,960
your client needs you.

591
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,560
Your parents need you more, right?

592
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,640
When I make money, I can

593
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,920
take good care of my parents.

594
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,960
I bought you New Year's presents.

595
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,200
They'll arrive tomorrow.

596
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,440
Speaking of your work,

597
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,830
you can do it everywhere.

598
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,790
Why don't you do it at home?

599
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,040
Come back.

600
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,920
No. A laptop isn't good enough for this job.

601
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,830
I need the network

602
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,400
and the desktop computer in my office.

603
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,920
When I'm done with this job,
I'm going home.

604
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,110
You stay healthy.

605
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,240
Don't worry about me.

606
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,400
For the new year, I wish you

607
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,640
good health and luck in everything.

608
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
You must take good care of yourself, then.

609
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,590
It's the Chinese New Year, after all.

610
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,550
Listen to me.

611
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,680
Don't make do with anything.

612
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,000
Have a big dinner

613
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,510
and take as much rest as you can.

614
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,310
Sleep more instead of staying up late.

615
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,310
OK. I get it.

616
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,880
Fine. We'll let you work.

617
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,350
Bye.

618
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,400
Bye-bye.

619
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,320
Anybody?

620
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,400
- Anybody?
- Coming.

621
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,030
Last time I came here,

622
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,960
I felt a shortage of artistic flavor.

623
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,510
Coincidentally, I have a painting.

624
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,070
So, I brought it to you.

625
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,790
Thank you, Mr. Han.

626
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,310
What is this, a starry sky or an ocean?

627
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,720
That depends.

628
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,240
Look at the complex lines.

629
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,790
They look like

630
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,310
your confused ideas, don't they?

631
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,110
Thank you, Mr. Han.

632
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,640
I'll put it up later

633
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,590
to always remind myself

634
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,920
to be quick-minded.

635
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,590
When are you leaving for your hometown?

636
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,240
I still have some work to do.

637
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,790
I can't finish it until tomorrow.

638
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,270
Anything else, Mr. Han?

639
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,590
Nothing.

640
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,480
I should go.

641
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,680
See you, Mr. Han.

642
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,270
Thanks for the painting.
Watch the steps.

643
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,350
Messy but orderly.

644
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,320
Understand?

645
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,440
(Blessing of New Year)
Great success

646
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,350
starts from scratch.

647
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,510
Good luck comes from all directions.

648
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,590
The horizontal scroll is...

649
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,070
Remain vibrant.

650
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,110
That's right.

651
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,110
Grandpa.

652
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,040
Cousin.

653
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,160
There you are, Ting.

654
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,350
Take your seat.

655
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,510
- Have some nuts.
- Ting.

656
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,400
Come over here.

657
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,240
Come on. Check

658
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,240
if Grandpa has made progress in calligraphy.

659
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,920
Dad, your calligraphy is awesome.

660
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,480
It looks great in every way.

661
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,480
What are you waiting for? Put it up.

662
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,960
- Wait.
- I'll put it up.

663
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,480
Mom,

664
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,790
look at you. Why did you rush?

665
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,680
I ruined Grandpa's calligraphy.

666
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,720
Naughty girl.

667
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,070
Grandpa.

668
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,350
You won't blame me, will you?

669
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,720
Come on.

670
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,100
When you were little, you never

671
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,260
practiced calligraphy carefully.

672
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,550
Every time, you stained your face.

673
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,590
So rash.

674
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,400
Grandpa, you know what?

675
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,200
If I had learned it in my childhood,

676
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,240
writing couplets wouldn't be your job now.

677
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,270
- She has a quick tongue.
- Stop joking.

678
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,110
Come on.

679
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,640
- Discard that.
- What a pity!

680
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,270
- Discard this?
- I'll do another one.

681
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,400
When everybody is here,

682
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,720
take out Yuan's tea

683
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,200
and make it.

684
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,430
I'll go.

685
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,870
No need.

686
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,960
You don't know where it is.

687
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,680
You seldom come back home.

688
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,720
Talk to Grandpa.

689
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,920
Yeah. We're a family.

690
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,760
Make yourself at home.

691
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,270
Come on, Ting. Grind the ink stick for me.

692
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,590
Come on.

693
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,350
Mr. Han, Miss Zeng is here.

694
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
Grandpa Han,

695
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,070
I'm paying you a New Year's visit.

696
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,200
Hi, Ms. Zhou.

697
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,000
Wish you blessing and longevity.

698
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Thank you.

699
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
Ms. Zhou, some bird's nest for you.

700
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,790
Wish you youth and good luck in everything.

701
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,880
I always like Di.

702
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,400
She's smart, pretty,

703
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,240
and honey-lipped.

704
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,590
Doing calligraphy, Grandpa?

705
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,070
Great. It's as vigorous as before.

706
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,480
You have no idea.

707
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,110
When you were in Hainan,

708
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,880
my grandpa was so bored at home.

709
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,920
He kept saying

710
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,240
no one would play chess with him.

711
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,400
I miss my old buddy, too.

712
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,640
I heard your parents

713
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,310
would take him abroad for a while.

714
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,030
Yeah. I'm left all alone.

715
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,240
That's why I came here for dinner.

716
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,550
Welcome.

717
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,960
There you are, Di.

718
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,800
Yuan.

719
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,440
You're here for Han Ting, huh?

720
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,590
That's not true.

721
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,110
I'm here for you.

722
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,750
Look. We'll have a big dinner

723
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,720
for this Chinese New Year.

724
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,750
Almost everybody is here.

725
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,400
Your grandaunt

726
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,350
will also come with Lu Linjia.

727
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,240
Let's sit and talk.

728
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,590
Yuan, go make some tea.

729
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,160
Here we go.

730
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,920
You can stop. Come on.

731
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,620
(Li Li)

732
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,910
Mom.

733
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,680
Why are you not back yet?

734
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,750
We live so near.

735
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,960
Throughout the year,

736
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,550
you haven't come back once.

737
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,070
I'm on my way.

738
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,560
You know what?

739
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,070
When you're back,

740
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,750
dress conservatively.

741
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,240
Ms. Zhang just paid us

742
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,200
a New Year's visit.

743
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,160
She said you posted

744
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,200
all those fancy photos

745
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,550
on Moments.

746
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,110
Without her,

747
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,590
I wouldn't know

748
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,110
you blocked me from your posts.

749
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,510
Mom, I did that

750
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,550
in case you would imagine or gossip.

751
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,480
In this way, I imagine more.

752
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,680
Look around.

753
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,590
What kind of good girl

754
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,270
will post such photos

755
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,160
unless they have to?

756
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,160
When those serious men

757
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,480
see your posts,

758
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,880
they'll be scared away.

759
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,640
Mom, it's the Chinese New Year.

760
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,400
Don't say stuff like this.

761
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,200
There are plenty of men in this world.

762
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,270
Why can I not get a nice guy?

763
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,040
Come on.

764
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,710
Don't fall head over heels in love

765
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,150
just when some men

766
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,550
spend a little money on you.

767
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,710
Those guys

768
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,840
are rather tricky.

769
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,360
None of them is good.

770
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,510
Don't trust their honeyed words.

771
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,000
Especially those rich guys.

772
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,480
When you're stuck in love,

773
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,150
you won't even have anyone to cry to.

774
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,760
I'm saying this for your own good.

775
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,630
Come on, Mom.

776
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,880
If you think I'm giddy,

777
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,960
I won't go home to upset you.

778
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,230
Who are you scaring?

779
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,630
You think I'm nagging?

780
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,630
I'm lecturing you.

781
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,360
Don't make the mistake I made.

782
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,360
When your father pursued me,

783
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,960
he was way too generous.

784
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,360
What did he say to me?

785
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,230
He kept calling me sweetheart

786
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,710
and even wanted to die for me!

787
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,240
What about later?

788
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,480
He didn't even want my life.

789
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,320
Mom, could you please

790
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,550
stop repeating all this?

791
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,030
You keep talking like this

792
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,440
and I can nearly recite it.

793
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,550
What's the point?

794
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,840
Can't you just let it go

795
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,840
and move on?

796
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,230
I'm going back home happily.

797
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,480
But will you not be satisfied

798
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,630
until you upset the both of us?

799
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,670
Hey, girl.

800
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,550
Why can you not tell

801
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,880
what's good for you?

802
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,360
I'm saying this for your own good!

803
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,480
If you don't like it,

804
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,550
don't come back home!

805
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,070
When you don't take my advice,

806
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,630
you'll have to suffer!

815
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,320
It's boring to stay at home.

816
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,880
There's less festive atmosphere now.

817
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,710
Li, why are you still in the car?

818
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,760
I quarreled with my mother.

819
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,840
I'm not going home, then.

820
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,800
Xing, why are you still working?

821
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,640
Won't you celebrate it?

822
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,320
It doesn't matter where I stay alone.

823
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,760
I'm almost done working

824
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,800
and I'll go for dinner.

826
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,880

827
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,320
Yes.

828
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,590
I'm bored of staying at home.

829
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,190
So, I asked a colleague out.

830
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,710
Here he comes.

831
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,280
I won't talk to you. Bye-bye.

832
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,880
Happy Chinese New Year!

833
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,550
I'll start my live streaming.

834
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,800
- I'll hang up.
- Bye-bye.

835
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,230
Bye-bye, Xing. Bye-bye, Li.

836
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,760
Have some fancy food.

837
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,510
Xing, have a big dinner.
Don't make do with it.

838
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,070
OK. I will.

839
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,550
Bye-bye.

840
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,960

00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,150
Qiuzi, have you waited too long?

842
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,320
No. I just arrived.

843
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,360
That's good. Oh, this.

844
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,030
It's the present

845
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,070
my parents asked me to give you.

846
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,550
If you hadn't

847
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,840
lent me money for the emergency,

848
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,840
I'm afraid my family

849
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,110
could hardly get through it.

850
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,760
Don't say that.

851
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,600
Just a little favor.

852
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,150
Please bring my gratitude

853
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,440
to your parents for the present.

854
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,840
We should thank you.

855
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,110
You haven't ordered, huh?

856
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,150
Waiter, the menu, please.

857
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,670
Just so you know, it's on me.

858
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,320
I'll eat a lot, then.

859
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,630
Hello. Here's the menu.

860
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,800
What would you like to eat?

861
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,880
Anything you order.

862
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,910
OK.

863
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,110
Sorry, but on the New Year's Eve,

864
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,280
we only take whole-table orders.

865
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,550
Single dishes aren't sold.

866
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,680
Take her order.

867
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,120
Mr. Xiao?

868
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,070
It's the Chinese New Year.

869
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,480
We can't let Miss Ji starve.

870
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,630
OK, boss.

871
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,070
Last time I saw you,

872
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,710
you were an engineer in Guanghua.

873
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,030
But now, you're the boss

874
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,440
of Xingchen Technology.

875
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,840
I heard Mr. Han invested in you, huh?

876
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,510
Yes.

877
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,550
Why are you not home for the festival?

878
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,760
I'm doing the finishing work

879
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,110
of a project.

880
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,030
Very impressive.

881
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,070
Ask our chefs to make

882
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,590
the dishes Miss Ji will order

883
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,110
and our signature dishes

884
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:17,950
and have them sent here.

885
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,710
- On the house.
- No, thanks.

886
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,550
No need.

887
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,280
I can't finish them alone.

888
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,510
It's the festival, anyway.

889
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,840
Besides, Mr. Han often comes

890
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,840
to consume in my club.

891
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,880
For his sake,

892
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,230
I don't dare to charge you.

893
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,510
Hope you'll come often.

894
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,960
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

895
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,440
I'd like to thank Mr. Han, too.

896
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,670
Say that to him personally.

897
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,510
OK.

898
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,710
You can order.
I'm going back home for dinner.

899
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,360
OK. Happy Chinese New Year, Mr. Xiao.

900
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,880
The same to you. See you.

901
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,760
- See you.
- Miss Ji,

902
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,000
check the menu, please.

903
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,000
(Smile)
You're being

904
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,360
such an exploitative boss.

905
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,840
Just now, Ji Xing came alone

906
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,230
to buy some food in Xingyue Club.

907
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,480
For the sake of your cruelness,

908
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,630
the bill is on you.

909
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,710
I knew you were here.

910
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,670
As you were in the childhood,

911
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,230
you still enjoy being alone.

912
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,800
It's the Chinese New Year.

913
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,190
Don't you have anything to say to me?

914
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,860
(Mrs. Ji)

915
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,510
Han,

916
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,710
do you know where Xing is?

917
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,550
We want to celebrate the festival with her.

918
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,440
But she's at home or in her office.

919
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,110
I can't get through to her, either.

920
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:03,950
Don't worry, Ms. Han.

921
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:04,920
I know where she is.

922
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,670
Wait at her door.

923
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,190
I'm going to get her now.

924
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,110
OK. Thank you.

925
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,760
Are you going out?

926
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,800
If you go out on a night like this,

927
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,590
do you think Grandpa Han will approve?

928
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,030
If you're in a hurry, just go.

929
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,760
I'll tell Grandpa Han on your behalf.

930
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,320
