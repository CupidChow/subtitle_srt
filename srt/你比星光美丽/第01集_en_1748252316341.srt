1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to forget the past and forget the past

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sure I won't be able to find the future

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm afraid I'll have no courage to be fearless

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'm going to forget the past and forget the past

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I won't give up

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll be more careful and remember even if I have no courage to be with you

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Calls

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,800
Okay.

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Ji Jia

18
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,700
How is the house?

19
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,300
I went to rob a dozen of it yesterday.

20
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,840
The old coating

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,080
which is more thanリ迪帖进.

22
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,160
How about this

23
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,200
school?

24
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,900
Or would our kids

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,600
evolve in the variants

26
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,900
when we are out there?

27
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,900
It's very convenient.

28
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,500
And the house is just right.

29
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,500
When I get the award

30
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,100
and Xiaobai's project prize,

31
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,900
I can come with Yichen to celebrate the birthday.

32
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,100
Okay, it's good that you two have a deal.

33
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,700
The house is all set.

34
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,700
You should mention the wedding date

35
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,100
about the wedding.

36
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,300
You should arrange two meeting places.

37
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,300
The wedding is fixed.

38
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,900
The hotel is not good now.

39
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,900
I heard that the hotel will be on two or three days.

40
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,900
Don't worry.

41
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,900
Yichen and I are still in a stable relationship.

42
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,300
You should buy a house.

43
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,900
It's not a good house for people.

44
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,300
What if the house is gone?

45
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,900
When we buy a house,

46
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
the wedding is just a matter of half a hand.

47
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
You're right.

48
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,700
You've cleaned up so much.

49
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,900
You're so noisy.

50
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,900
You're a manager.

51
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,900
Don't you want to be a manager?

52
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,500
Okay?

53
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,900
Okay, I know.

54
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,100
Don't worry.

55
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,300
I told you that I'm going to work.

56
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,700
Bye.

57
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,100
Da Huang,

58
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,700
I'll make you a cat food.

59
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,300
Be good.

60
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,500
Chen Meng, you're so young.

61
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,900
Look at my bag.

62
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,300
It's easy to get down.

63
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,900
Okay.

64
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,900
I didn't sleep at home.

65
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,900
I only finished the game and put on a plate.

66
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,900
I'll go home after eating.

67
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,900
I brought you some food.

68
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,500
I envy you so much.

69
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,700
I can do it anytime.

70
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,500
Don't be anxious.

71
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,300
Don't be afraid.

72
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,100
Don't be anxious.

73
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,100
It's good.

74
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,300
But I can't sleep early.

75
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,100
I'm playing the live stream with four kids.

76
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,100
I have to play with those Internet users.

77
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,500
Thank you.

78
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,500
I'll tell you later.

79
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,100
Bye.

80
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,100
Don't worry.

81
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Don't drink wind when you're on your way.

82
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
It's easy to get a fight.

83
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,700
Bye.

84
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,900
Bye.

85
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,900
Mr. Yuan, don't worry.

86
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,300
Although the old man told Han Ting to come back to the office,

87
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,100
everyone knows that

88
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,300
Dong Yi is your blood.

89
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,300
Don't be anxious.

90
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,100
He just came back from abroad.

91
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,100
He doesn't know the situation.

92
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,100
Besides, we're here.

93
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,700
He's not far from here.

94
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,300
Don't worry.

95
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
The board of directors

96
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,700
will give him a discount.

97
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,700
Mr. Yuan, don't worry.

98
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,300
We'll go to the board of directors.

99
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,300
Mr. Han.

100
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,700
Mr. Wang, long time no see.

101
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,100
Aren't you from

102
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,900
the airport in Germany?

103
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,500
I'm here to protect you.

104
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,100
I've transferred the plane

105
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,300
from Shenzhen to your company.

106
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,900
Mr. Han, you're joking.

107
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,700
I don't need protection.

108
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,500
This is a sample of the purchase.

109
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,700
The supplier of Dongyang's plane

110
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,300
is one of the best in the market price.

111
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,700
He sold his own house in Europe to you.

112
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,500
Mr. Han,

113
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
the supplier is in a hurry.

114
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,900
So he sold it to me.

115
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,100
Of course I trust you.

116
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,300
But the board of directors

117
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,700
don't know what he would think

118
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,300
if they saw this document.

119
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,300
You've fought for Dongyang for so many years.

120
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,300
It's normal to buy a good house.

121
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,900
I've returned to the country to invest in Dongyang's medical care.

122
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,100
I need your support.

123
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,300
In the future,

124
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,900
you can buy many good houses

125
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,500
with the share of shares.

126
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,300
Mr. Han,

127
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,700
tell me what I need to do.

128
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,100
Excuse me.

129
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,500
The local exam is over.

130
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,900
I brought you some supplies.

131
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,700
It's late.

132
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,700
Are you late?

133
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,500
We're also the company's colleagues.

134
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,700
We're colleagues.

135
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,500
We can't do anything about it.

136
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,300
We're not very clear about it.

137
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,700
Can we use a準?

138
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,900
It's not clear.

139
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,700
I can't say it.

140
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,700
I can't leave.

141
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,900
Yes, you can't.

142
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,900
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Where are you?

144
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,900
It's the first time you've attended the board of directors after you've returned to the country.

145
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,900
If you're late,

146
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,900
you'll be punished.

147
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,500
You can't help me.

148
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,500
It seems that you didn't receive any notice.

149
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,100
Mr. Yuan,

150
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,500
I've told him that he has something to do.

151
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,500
He can't come.

152
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,700
I won't say it.

153
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,500
You should have a bunch of calls later.

154
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,700
I'll call you later.

155
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,900
I'll call you later.

156
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,100
I'll call you later.

157
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,300
I'll call you later.

158
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
I'll call you later.

159
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,700
I'll call you later.

160
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,300
I'll call you later.

161
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,700
Mr. He,

162
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,300
Mr. Wang said that he won't come to the board of directors today.

163
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,700
Do you know what's going on?

164
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,100
Mr. Yuan,

165
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,500
I'm telling you.

166
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,900
I'm in a bad mood.

167
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,300
I can't go to the board of directors today.

168
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,900
Boss,

169
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,300
you've been away from Hong Kong for ten years.

170
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,500
My father has been ordering you to come back from Germany to take the winter clothes.

171
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,900
It's so important.

172
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,100
He said that

173
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,100
he would help you to get the job.

174
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
But I went to the South China Sea for a vacation.

175
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,900
It's so sad.

176
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,900
If you can't even get a few directors,

177
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
how can you make me a CEO?

178
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,300
Of course.

179
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,900
Mr. Yuan, I wanted to give you a summary.

180
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,100
I didn't expect that

181
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,300
you would be so angry with the board of directors.

182
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,700
He must be very angry now.

183
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,900
But I, the sister Tang,

184
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,300
gave up the winter clothes.

185
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,100
I'm not that angry.

186
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Did you inform the board of directors that I'm going to Guanghua?

187
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,300
Yes.

188
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,300
Mr. Sun said that they are all ready.

189
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,700
Hello, Xijing. Where are you?

190
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,900
I'm at the company with just one pass.

191
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,500
I saw that Lin Zhen is on the night of your report on the ship last night.

192
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,900
He is always like this. I'm used to it.

193
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,700
I made some small tricks in the report this time.

194
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,500
Even if he tells, he will be very surprised.

195
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,700
Mr. Chen must know that I did it.

196
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,500
It's okay.

197
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,100
What? It's okay?

198
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,500
Our investment in Guanghua,

199
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,100
Mr. Zeng and all the bosses of the departments are here.

200
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,100
Mr. Chen can't say that you made this report, right?

201
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
I'll be right there.

202
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,500
Thank you for your understanding of my investigation.

203
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:13,600
Do you want some 50000's?

204
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,100
This is just the money.

205
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,860
I'll go and deal with it.

206
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,060
Your car must be fast.

207
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,260
I really can't take it.

208
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,660
I've taken the picture.

209
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,660
The compensation for the car

210
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,660
needs to be waited until the car is damaged.

211
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,660
The car is damaged?

212
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,300
The car...

213
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,660
The car is damaged.

214
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,660
The car is damaged.

215
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,820
A man was riding a car and hit me.

216
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,660
This guy

217
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,020
hid me and accidentally hit your car.

218
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,860
I went after him and didn't catch him.

219
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,900
I have the responsibility for this.

220
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,820
If he didn't hide me,

221
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,060
I wouldn't be able to hit your car.

222
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,500
When you were damaged,

223
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,220
I'll compensate for the amount of money

224
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,580
I spent with him.

225
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,220
Of course,

226
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,780
I have to find that man.

227
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,540
And that man

228
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,780
hit me while riding the car.

229
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,140
He violated the rules.

230
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,180
He has to compensate for it.

231
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,180
It's him.

232
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,140
I still have something to do today.

233
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,540
I can't leave a call to you.

234
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,300
What's your problem?

235
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,540
You can call me anytime.

236
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,420
Tang Song,

237
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
leave a call.

238
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,220
Let them go.

239
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,780
Okay.

240
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,380
Then,

241
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,140
leave a message for me.

242
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,540
I'll contact you after the order.

243
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,340
Okay.

244
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,900
Okay.

245
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,620
Give her my card.

246
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,440
Boss, the owner arrive in a fewب

247
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,860
You just send her back to his shelter.

248
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,420
Come quickly.

249
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,300
This is report to your MD

250
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,900
for your 피 tobacco is serious.

251
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,820
As a result,

252
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:25,480
Yourкахeng

253
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,500
Rolly

254
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,100
This is the toothpasteGeese made by Theе고

255
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,700
And this is the check report I made in the hospital a few days ago.

256
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,820
We can see that the treatment results that the robot Xiao Bai and the hospital got

257
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,300
are exactly the same.

258
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,900
Director Han, please come over.

259
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,500
The robot Xiao Bai's condition is that the main function is to treat the treatment.

260
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,100
Today, the result is that the treatment of the patient with 1600 patients

261
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,500
and the treatment results of the hospital experts

262
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,500
is 99% higher.

263
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,900
Thank you.

264
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,500
Hurry. Hurry.

265
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,700
It's just that I feel like a big heart disease.

266
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,900
I still feel like a panther.

267
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,700
After being taken by Lin Zhen.

268
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,100
The whole plan.

269
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,700
What day is it? You're getting off work.

270
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,700
Who knows that Boss will suddenly come back?

271
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,700
Is he the first one to do it?

272
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,700
Yes. I heard that he is not only the head of our Guanghua

273
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,900
but also the president of the Hong Kong Medical Center in the East.

274
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,700
Today, he just returned to the country and is looking for the news of Xiao Bai.

275
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,100
It seems that he is very important to our project.

276
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,700
The first step in the plan of the robot Xiao Bai is to...

277
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,300
The first step is to expand the market plan.

278
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,700
We are all divided into...

279
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,900
Returning to last night.

280
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,500
This is the model of the core algorithm.

281
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,700
Let's expand it.

282
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,500
Boss is a big person.

283
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,100
We are not fully prepared for this model of the core algorithm.

284
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,100
Our team is also working hard to make this...

285
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,100
So, the report is not yours.

286
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,700
What's going on?

287
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,300
Han Zuo, Zeng Zuo.

288
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,900
The report is that the team has completed it together.

289
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,900
The second step in the development of the project

290
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,900
is to implement the core algorithm of the factory construction.

291
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,900
Ji Qing, come up here.

292
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,900
Hurry up.

293
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,300
Ji Qing, come up here.

294
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
Hurry up.

295
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,500
Is there a final decision in the house of the client?

296
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,300
Yes.

297
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,300
It's the body.

298
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,300
I'm so tired.

299
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
Hey, hey, hey, newbie!

300
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
The newbie!

301
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,500
This is the newbie of our Xiao Bai's product engineer, Ji Qing.

302
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Han Ting?

303
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,900
Give me the translation pen.

304
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,900
Okay.

305
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,300
The biggest feature of a medical machine

306
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,300
is that it is in its work process

307
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,900
that there are many communication between doctors and patients.

308
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,900
Therefore, in the algorithm, we need to pay attention to two parts.

309
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,700
The first part is the collection of data

310
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,500
and the learning of the system.

311
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,900
The main thing is to deal with the data related to the data

312
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,700
received by the sensor.

313
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,700
Then the second part...

314
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,100
The calculation result of the collection of data.

315
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,700
Yes.

316
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,700
After receiving the data, the system will automatically learn

317
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
the standard of the fast-speed.

318
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,700
The different symptoms, the corresponding indicators and the corresponding calculation result

319
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,900
will directly relate the patient's medical power

320
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,700
and do the data analysis and analysis of the collection.

321
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,300
Thank you to the committee of the competition

322
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,100
and to the medical machine of our design.

323
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,300
Thank you to my little partners too.

324
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,500
Because this is the product that we all design together.

325
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,100
Although it is just a model,

326
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
we will continue to improve

327
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,100
until we really invest in it

328
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,100
and help more people who need help.

329
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,900
In the second part of Xiao Bai's work, we will provide the medical treatment for the salary.

330
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,300
There will be more variation.

331
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
Therefore, in order to ensure the accuracy,

332
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,900
we suggest that Xiao Bai enter the data of each hospital.

333
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,300
To make more perfect preparation for the difference in image and accuracy.

334
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,300
Xiao Bai's second part of the detailed plan

335
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,900
will be the detailed report when we officially experience it.

336
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,900
Thank you.

337
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,100
Thank you.

338
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,700
Thank you everyone.

339
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,100
That's all for today's meeting.

340
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,300
Thank you, boss.

341
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,900
Your peach is back.

342
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
This year, we have the highest prize.

343
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
You are done.

344
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,900
You really look like you are not good at doing things.

345
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,500
You must be sad this time.

346
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,700
Fortunately, today's investment is very good.

347
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,300
Look out!

348
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,900
That's all for today's meeting.

349
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,100
Deng Chao had a chance to come to slipped this year.

350
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,500
Deng Chao's hard work supports me and screams,

351
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,900
but he is also a real approx��ant!

352
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,500
He is almost a pageant.

353
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,300
That's not a fake.

354
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,300
I know why he is not here to complain.

355
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,300
Hello, Zhizhou.

356
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,300
Hello, Xingjian.

357
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,300
I've come to your company's coffee shop.

358
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,300
I'll give you a black card.

359
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,300
Okay, you decide.

360
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Just send me the location.

361
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,300
Okay.

362
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,300
Bye.

363
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
See you later.

364
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,300
See you later.

365
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,300
Black card.

366
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
Your favorite beans.

367
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,300
How is it?

368
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,300
Xiao Bai and you were in Germany

369
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,300
talking about the location.

370
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
Are you getting closer?

371
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,300
It's more interesting than the preview.

372
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,300
Interesting?

373
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,300
I want to hold a celebration

374
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,300
at the weekend

375
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,300
for the success of this issue.

376
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Do you want to come over?

377
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,300
Sure.

378
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,300
Send the time and location to Tang Song.

379
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,300
Okay.

380
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,300
Do you want to eat dinner

381
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
at home at night?

382
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,300
Grandpa knows you're back.

383
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,300
He asked me to pick you up.

384
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,300
Go to see Zhen Yiye next time.

385
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,300
The general manager of the company

386
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,300
and the hospital director of the personnel hospital

387
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,300
are also here.

388
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,300
Go and talk to Xiao Bai.

389
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,300
I'll be there at 8 p.m. on the New Year's Eve.

390
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,300
Okay.

391
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,300
President Li?

392
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
He's been doing well with your sister recently.

393
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,300
It's just business.

394
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,300
You asked me to go with you

395
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,300
just for business?

396
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
Get ready.

397
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,300
If you can cooperate,

398
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,300
it will be very beneficial

399
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,300
for Xiao Bai's market development.

400
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,300
Okay, I got it.

401
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,300
Don't worry, Mr. Han.

402
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,300
I'll do as you say.

403
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,300
I'm leaving.

404
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,300
I'll see you out.

405
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,300
Here.

406
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,300
Coffee.

407
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
Thank you.

408
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300
Your creative plan

409
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,300
is done.

410
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,300
I'll change it for you.

411
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
Okay.

412
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,300
The industry is developing.

413
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,300
Even the digital delivery is done.

414
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,300
You just helped me

415
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,300
to make a copy.

416
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,300
It's really my sister.

417
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,300
Didn't you want to

418
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,300
make more customized medical equipment?

419
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,300
Fortunately,

420
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,300
I've been searching

421
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,300
for this part of the data recently.

422
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,300
I'm thinking about

423
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,300
whether I can combine the hardware

424
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,300
and software

425
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
to use it

426
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
in the future

427
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,300
for Xiao Bai's market development.

428
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,300
I'll write more.

429
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,300
It's nothing.

430
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,300
Senior,

431
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,300
why are you doing this with me?

432
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,300
No, no, no.

433
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,300
I'm quite stable now.

434
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
And I'm going to buy a house soon.

435
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,300
I still have to carry a bag.

436
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,300
I won't take this risk.

437
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,300
Life is

438
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,300
a risk.

439
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,300
When you were doing

440
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,300
this creative plan,

441
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,300
did you have

442
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,300
a little bit of

443
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,300
machine-based cooperation?

444
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,300
Senior,

445
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,300
really.

446
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,300
Think about it.

447
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,300
Do you think it's enough

448
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,300
for someone else?

449
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,300
And

450
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,300
you just need to have some skills.

451
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,300
My dad said

452
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,300
if I'm creative,

453
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,300
he would prepare

454
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,300
a big profit for me.

455
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,300
You know

456
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,300
our family is open to business.

457
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
I think

458
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
my dad will prepare

459
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,300
a small amount of money for me.

460
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,300
Think about it.

461
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,300
We have skills.

462
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
My dad has money.

463
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,300
Why do you have a lot of money?

464
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,300
I...

465
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,300
Mr. Zeng.

466
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,300
Hello, Ji Xin.

467
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,300
Are you busy?

468
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
No, no.

469
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,300
Please tell me.

470
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
Go to a hard-earned market with me tonight.

471
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,300
Send me a address.

472
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,300
It's 7.30.

473
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,300
I'll pick you up.

474
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,300
Okay.

475
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,300
Oh, right.

476
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,300
Please call me later.

477
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
It's quite important

478
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,300
to meet someone tonight.

479
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Okay, I'm done.

480
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,300
I'm going to do the dishes.

481
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,300
Listen to me.

482
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,300
You look so good in this way.

483
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
What did you do?

484
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,300
My skin is too heavy.

485
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
I can't see it clearly.

486
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
Look.

487
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
Don't move.

488
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,300
Look up.

489
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,300
Okay.

490
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,300
Here.

491
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,300
What?

492
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,300
Such a long eyelashes?

493
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,300
It's a big double eyelid.

494
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,300
You don't understand.

495
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,300
Okay, okay.

496
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,300
Don't bother me.

497
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
This...

498
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Jin Song.

499
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Xin Xin.

500
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,300
Your boss brought you to dinner.

501
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,300
Is it a new signal?

502
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
It's possible.

503
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,300
I did the project report today.

504
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,300
The performance is not bad.

505
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,300
Maybe our boss saw me.

506
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,300
Really?

507
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,300
Then you can't help but buy a house

508
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,300
and enter the market again.

509
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,300
Hurry up.

510
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
Coming.

511
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
Open the door.

512
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,300
Don't move.

513
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,300
Li Li.

514
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,300
Why are you here?

515
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,300
Come in, Li Li.

516
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,300
Don't change shoes.

517
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,300
Come in.

518
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,300
Hurry up.

519
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,300
You...

520
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,300
This is...

521
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,300
You drew it?

522
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,300
It looks good, right?

523
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,300
Today's situation is too important.

524
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
I have to find you here.

525
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,300
What do you mean?

526
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,300
You don't trust me?

527
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,300
You want to find a source?

528
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,300
We have a lot of gold, gold and silver sales.

529
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
We can give my dad a good look.

530
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,300
Give him a good look.

531
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,300
Hurry up.

532
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,300
We've been drawing for two hours.

533
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
What's the mood today?

534
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,300
Today...

535
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,300
I don't know.

536
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,300
Our boss didn't say it.

537
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,300
He said he would meet someone.

538
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,300
But he said he would ask me to dress up.

539
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,300
How old is your boss?

540
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,300
About 28 or 29 years old.

541
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,300
He's almost the same age as us.

542
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
I'm telling you.

543
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,300
He's a tall guy.

544
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,300
He's always like this.

545
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,300
He's beautiful and rich.

546
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,300
He has his own company.

547
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,300
He's so great.

548
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
I think I can guess his style.

549
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,300
Go and take off your makeup.

550
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,300
Boss.

551
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,300
The office has already set up

552
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
the habit of following you in Germany.

553
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,300
I've also helped you

554
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,300
with the gift.

555
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,300
I'll take the list for you later.

556
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,300
If you have any other opinions,

557
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,300
I'll follow the list.

558
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,300
And some inconvenient gifts.

559
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,300
I'll help you with them.

560
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,300
What's that?

561
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
It's a lamp.

562
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,300
President Xiao gave it to you.

563
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,300
He said it's a star.

564
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,300
It's one-to-one.

565
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,300
Don't worry.

566
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,300
Lingcheng,

567
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,300
do you have what I asked for?

568
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,300
Against things like you,

569
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,300
you're a blessing to me.

570
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,020
I'm sorry.

571
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,820
You've been waiting for a long time, haven't you?

572
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,300
No.

573
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,020
Ji Xin,

574
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,300
you've been here for three years.

575
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,140
Yes.

576
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,420
You must be tired, Xiaobai.

577
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,660
No, I'm not.

578
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,700
And I'm very happy

579
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,180
with my favorite project.

580
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,900
I'm very satisfied.

581
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,860
I can see your efforts.

582
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,100
If Xiaobai didn't have you,

583
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,540
she wouldn't have been so fast.

584
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,900
Are you sure?

585
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,340
Don't worry.

586
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,300
Guang Hua will never treat

587
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,260
the people who work hard for the company.

588
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,620
Thank you, Mr. Zeng.

589
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,020
We'll perform well

590
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,100
in the future.

591
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,460
We'll try to get Mr. Zhao.

592
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,980
Mr. Zhao is...

593
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,020
Mr. Zhao's son in the Ren'ai Hospital.

594
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,660
Ren'ai Hospital?

595
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,380
There are many departments in the country.

596
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,220
Yes.

597
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,060
So tonight,

598
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,100
if he agrees to work with us,

599
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,900
the future will be very good.

600
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,100
What do I need to do?

601
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,340
You know Xiaobai best.

602
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,020
Go and introduce him to him.

603
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,340
He's a good guy.

604
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,860
Okay.

605
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,420
If the project is successful,

606
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,340
I'll reward you.

607
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,820
Thank you, Mr. Zeng.

608
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,100
Three for two.

609
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,260
Pass.

610
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,980
Mr. Zhao is really good today.

611
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:49,740
He's been winning.

612
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,340
I'm really lucky.

613
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,260
Not only the big game,

614
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,580
I'm good at anything.

615
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,300
Right?

616
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,260
Yes.

617
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,700
The project of your recent national health

618
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,500
and fun is all working.

619
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,300
Two for two.

620
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,180
I just came back.

621
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,660
I'm here to take care of you.

622
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,700
I think I'll learn more from you.

623
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,740
Lian'er.

624
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,380
You're all on your own.

625
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,500
I told you to come today.

626
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,660
Don't think you're in Germany.

627
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,980
You'll be in the same country.

628
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,020
But the domestic situation

629
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,300
needs to be asked by you.

630
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,580
Here.

631
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,780
As for business,

632
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,060
who are you?

633
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,060
Only your brothers and sisters are in the same company.

634
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,100
Our cooperation

635
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,620
can be strong.

636
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,100
I'll make you a meal today.

637
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Xiaobai's business

638
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,500
is a little bit foreign.

639
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,780
If you need a favor,

640
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,660
come here.

641
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,060
Yes, Mr. Han.

642
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,620
We'll come to Qingyue often.

643
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,700
Thanks to Mr. Li,

644
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,860
I can work in the big back.

645
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,940
But the investment in medical equipment

646
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,660
needs to be more in my house.

647
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,060
Look at you.

648
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,100
You're just playing cards.

649
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,340
What's the use of playing cards?

650
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,500
You can talk to me again.

651
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,260
I won't bother you anymore.

652
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,180
Do you understand?

653
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,980
Hold me.

654
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,540
Yes.

655
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,660
Five gold coins.

656
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,660
Get in the car.

657
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,460
You're so thoughtful.

658
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,140
You're so thoughtful.

659
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:01,780
Han Ting.

660
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,460
You're so thoughtful.

661
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,580
Mr. Li.

662
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,060
Mr. Zhao.

663
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,820
You're the loudest.

664
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,620
You won't win a lot tonight, right?

665
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,860
Look at him.

666
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,660
Mr. Xiao and Mr. Li

667
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,460
won a lot tonight.

668
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,180
Really?

669
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,860
Han Dong is playing cards.

670
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,060
Do you think it's interesting?

671
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,460
It's related to Shuyin.

672
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,660
He's very serious.

673
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,740
Miss, your clothes need me to help you.

674
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,060
This is the name of the technology.

675
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:34,980
Mr. Zeng.

676
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,900
Mr. Zhao and Mr. Li know each other.

677
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,900
Mr. Li, Mr. Xiao.

678
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,860
Mr. Xiao, Jiuyang.

679
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,540
Now your music

680
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,740
is the gathering place of the elders.

681
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,820
I've heard of Mr. Zeng's name.

682
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,660
I didn't expect he's young and beautiful.

683
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,220
Of course.

684
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,860
Mr. Zeng is the famous beauty in our circle.

685
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,140
You're not like him.

686
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,060
You'll be the witness if you play around.

687
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,260
Let's go.

688
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:02,780
Come on.

689
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,420
Let me introduce you.

690
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,620
Our staff in Guanghua.

691
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,620
Ji Xin.

692
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,260
She looks young.

693
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,300
She just graduated.

694
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,660
She's been in the industry for three years.

695
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,060
What's the business?

696
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,340
She's a major in computer science.

697
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,580
She's a major in computer science.

698
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,620
She's a major in computer science.

699
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,980
I didn't expect she's so beautiful.

700
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,060
She's not bad in school.

701
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,180
Of course.

702
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,780
We only know the beautiful high school in Guanghua.

703
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,300
You're playing around with the key.

704
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,060
The key?

705
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,380
Do you know it?

706
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,140
A little.

707
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,060
That's great.

708
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:35,660
Come on.

709
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:35,980
Come on.

710
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,420
I'll sit here, Mr. Zhao.

711
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,100
Come on.

712
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,220
Help me look at her.

713
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,420
See if she's a good student.

714
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,500
No need to.

715
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,660
I'll give you some hot tea.

716
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,060
Okay.

717
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:43,740
I'll go.

718
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,420
It's okay.

719
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:44,980
Sit.

720
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,900
Mr. Zhao is a good student.

721
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,820
He's a beautiful girl.

722
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,380
It's boring to play around like this.

723
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,260
Mr. Han.

724
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,940
How about we change seats?

725
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,820
I'll be Mr. Zhao's wife.

726
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,060
It doesn't matter.

727
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,500
Whoever comes with me,

728
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,460
will win.

729
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:04,900
Come on.

730
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,020
I'll play the game.

731
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,820
Hurry up.

732
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:10,980
Come on.

733
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,220
This is up to you, Mr. Zhao.

734
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,220
Don't worry.

735
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,820
Don't worry about me.

736
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,340
Mr. Zhao is a little crazy today.

737
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,860
He's crazy.

738
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,620
I'm...

739
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,580
Mr. Zhao, how about I try it?

740
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,780
Then you try it.

741
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:40,980
OK.

742
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,620
Blue light.

743
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,460
Don't hold your戒指.

744
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,940
On dial 3.

745
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:03,940
On dial 6.

746
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,540
On dial 9.

747
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:06,980
On dial 8.

748
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:08,940
On dial 3.

749
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,740
It's very new,ヾゝ。

750
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,540
3and3slowly.

751
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,940
On two, such two brands.

752
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,340
Nie Yi engine oh

753
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,220
You can play the boundary Cross clock vielen

754
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,600
San dioxide only has 1

755
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,320
This Santander has played for several times

756
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,560
Probably not something left

757
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,460
You are no longer skilled

758
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,500
Any trouble Han Tia

759
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,180
So when you come to me,

So as long as you want

763
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,260
I'm happy among you

764
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,860
Alright

765
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,500
I'm going to killer you

766
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,780
And I want you tonight

767
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,180
Your confidence is like money.

768
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,900
Why didn't you press me?

769
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,060
So you're waiting here for the last shot.

770
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,740
Yes.

771
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,620
I've already counted your cards.

772
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,860
You've counted the cards and the probability of the number of people.

773
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,220
You're tired now.

774
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,260
Only you want to win me.

775
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,620
You still have to rely on me to let go.

776
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,220
You win.

777
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,900
What are you doing?

778
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:16,940
Unless I call you guys.

779
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:21,220
You do need to cheer up Corbin

780
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,620
to get in this match.

781
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,580
Really?

782
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,620
What aegis.

783
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,380
You're trying to be a playboy?

784
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,140
Yes.

785
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,220
I'm good at naaring the Textile Works.

786
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,940
I am also a good player.

787
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,420
I'm not talking about you.

788
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,740
Ji Qing didn't rely on luck.

789
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,340
I know what I'm doing.

790
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:43,340
Ji Qing is just relying on strength to support you.

791
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,620
What's wrong?

792
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,660
No, I just had a power outage.

793
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,220
President Zhao, come to my seat.

794
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:56,980
Help me play a game.

795
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,180
I'll call you back.

796
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,980
Come, President Zhao, sit here.

797
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,140
Have a good sleep here.

798
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Okay.

799
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,900
Ji Qing, don't let them play with you.

800
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,900
Okay.

801
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,740
Sit down.

802
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,980
Please.

803
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,980
Don't worry.

804
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,260
What's the matter?

805
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,340
You were just a teammate.

806
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,460
Now you're a rival.

807
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,860
What's wrong?

808
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,620
Let your staff play with you.

809
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,420
That's your way of playing.

810
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,100
Ji Qing is a product engineer.

811
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,620
She knows Xiaobai the best.

812
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,860
Isn't she here to introduce our products

813
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,020
to President Zhao?

814
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,980
You're the boss of Guanghua.

815
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,660
You know your own products.

816
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,420
I'm in charge of managing the products.

817
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,460
The details on the technology

818
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,860
must be more professional.

819
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,260
Do you have any common sense?

820
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,700
The staff is playing well.

821
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,900
Are you the PR director of Guanghua?

822
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,020
I'm the engineer of the production and development department.

823
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,260
Xiaobai is from the project team.

824
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,260
Xiaobai?

825
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,540
I heard that you're good at managing Xiaobai's products.

826
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,060
Why don't you tell us about it?

827
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,900
Okay.

828
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,820
Xiaobai is the clinic staff of our company.

829
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,500
She can not only do basic treatment for face-to-face,

830
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,780
but also do complex treatment services for future entrants.

831
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,900
It's a hot spot for future treatment.

832
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,300
We're mainly helping the big-scale hospital

833
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,340
to do basic patient's quick examination.

834
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,660
The main thing we're doing is mouth-to-mouth treatment.

835
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,700
We've successfully started the operation.

836
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,060
We'll develop a new way of working.

837
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,300
Have you seen the super-powerful team?

838
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:48,860
I've seen it.

839
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,340
I've seen it.

840
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,140
How does it have anything to do with Xiaobai?

841
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,580
Our Xiaobai looks like the big white inside.

842
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,020
It's just that he uses his eyes to scan the white

843
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,540
to detect the condition of his body.

844
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,860
But Xiaobai, let me show you.

845
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,300
Xiaobai is a person who only has one mouth.

846
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,860
His hand can go to the mouth to detect the condition.

847
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,340
In the future, he can also treat wounds

848
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,780
just like the big white.

849
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,620
Really?

850
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,740
Yes.

851
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,460
You're so insensitive

852
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,060
after doing it this evening.

853
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:24,740
It's much more interesting than my brothers' heads.

854
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,500
This is the direction we're going to work hard for.

855
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,100
We're very happy

856
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,100
to see Mr. Zhao in this evening.

857
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,100
Besides,

858
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,500
you're not with us anymore.

859
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,500
Let him go.

860
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,900
This is a private bureau.

861
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,900
I'm not used to having outsiders around.

862
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,500
Okay, I understand.

863
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,900
Although we're not that big in terms of quantity,

864
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,700
if we can find a big hospital

865
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,900
and have strategic cooperation,

866
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,300
then the machine will be able to

867
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,700
work in more complicated treatment.

868
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,300
The problem with the data of the sample,

869
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,100
how can I help you

870
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,300
solve it with Mr. Zhao's hospital?

871
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,100
Mr. Zhao,

872
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,700
don't make a fool of me.

873
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,300
Miss,

874
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,700
aren't you doing this for my company?

875
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,900
It's a small matter.

876
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,700
I'll tell my dad when I get back.

877
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,100
But you have to introduce it to me carefully later, okay?

878
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,300
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

879
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,500
Come, let's add a WeChat.

880
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,100
Come, sit down.

881
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,100
Ji Ji.

882
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,900
Come here.

883
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,500
Sorry.

884
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,500
Mr. Zhang,

885
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
you've worked hard tonight.

886
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,300
Then you can go back first.

887
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,700
Don't think too much.

888
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,700
Mr. Han is having private talks with them.

889
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,700
It's not convenient for outsiders to be here.

890
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,500
Go back by car.

891
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,700
Remember to take the car to the company to pay the bill.

892
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,900
Be careful.

893
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,700
Mr. Zhang, four of you.

894
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,700
Come up here.

895
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,700
Hold it.

896
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,300
Sit down.

897
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,700
Hurry up.

898
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,300
Miss, your clothes.

899
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,700
Thank you.

900
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,700
Let's go.

901
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,700
Okay, that's it.

902
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,900
Go back in time.

903
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,700
Come, let's go.

904
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,700
Okay, let's go.

905
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,900
I'm busy.

906
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,900
Okay, let's go.

907
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,500
Be careful.

908
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,500
Mr. Zhang, we'll work together.

909
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
Next time, we'll bring Ji Ji to the company.

910
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,100
Okay.

911
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,500
Goodbye, Mr. Zhao.

912
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,500
You two should rest early.

913
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,700
Come, let's go.

914
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,900
Han Ting.

915
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,900
Do you have time later?

916
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,500
I have something to tell you.

917
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,500
I'm just back from work.

918
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,700
Next time.

919
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,100
Drink up.

920
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,300
Rest early.

921
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,900
ida

922
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,300
Boss, I bought some abalone buns.

923
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,500
We haven't seen each other for long.

924
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,300
Are you home already?

925
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,500
Yes.

926
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,900
of young men to collect mash let's have a taste of it

927
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,420
This environment is quite private

928
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,980
If there are so many good foods

929
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,280
The 갱触 nicht auf dich

930
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:01,780
Drink it

931
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,860
So this is the 갱触

932

reside in this bowl

934
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:11,460
OK

935
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,580
Let's eat

936
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,660
Such a girl mittlerweile with her reward tonight

937
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,660
Do you know each other?

938
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:50,660
I'm not familiar with the world.

939
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:57,660
Those who seem distant, but hate each other.

940
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:03,660
I want to test who has crossed the border.

941
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:10,660
If I can get closer to you,

942
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:16,660
can I remember the beginning and end of the memory?

943
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:23,660
Time goes on, but the loneliness is at least safe.

944
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:31,660
Don't let the understanding become a risk.

945
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:37,660
We are a couple.

946
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:43,660
We don't want to be afraid of being separated.

947
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:51,660
We are always afraid that we will be heartbroken.

948
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:57,660
We are always afraid that we will be heartbroken.

949
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:02,660
We are never related.

950
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,660
We are half-hearted.

951
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:13,660
We are always afraid that we will be heartbroken.

952
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:19,660
We are always afraid that we will be heartbroken.
