1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to pass through the water.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Even if I encounter a miracle, I'll be lost in the fog.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the fog.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I can't see the courage in the crowd.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the fog.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to finish the book of lyrics.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I forgot to say goodbye to myself.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to go to the sky and see the earth.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The sky is not empty.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the fog.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the fog.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I want to go to the sky and see the earth.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I won't give up.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll be lost in the fog.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Even if I'm lost in the fog.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Love is True

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Episode 18

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Xing Chen Technology.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Mr. Ji.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Ji Xing.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't you drink?

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Come on.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Mr. Ji.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll drink first.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well,

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
please have a drink.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Come on.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Come on.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Mr. Ji.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You can't drink a single bottle.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's not good.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We don't care.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Mr. Chang is a big man.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Please give him a drink.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I mean,

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
why do you say

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
you can come here?

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Well,

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Mr. Ji.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll drink for you.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Mr. Ji.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Mr. Chang is a wine.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Come on.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Don't make him feel guilty.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Mr. Han is talking.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Mr. Ji is so sweet.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Mr. Chang.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You can't drink this wine.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Mr. Han is right.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
A girl

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
can't drink wine.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's drink.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Mr. Ji.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Mr. Han is so sweet.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Mr. Han is so drunk.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Mr. Han.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Mr. Chang

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
has given you a face.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He won't let you drink.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
At least give him a face.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Drink it.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Mr. Chang,

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll drink for you.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Well...

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's a hero's beauty.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
How can Mr. Han

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
let you die

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
with such a small girl?

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Sorry.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We have something to do.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Excuse us.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,060
I haven't spread my confidence in you

78
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,940
for so many years.

79
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,580
Whatever you say is true.

80
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,460
That is true for sure.

81
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,400
What should I do?

82
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,020
This reminds me of

83
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,740
the old times,

84
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,660
those shimosos

85
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,300
who were poisoned by projetive.

86
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,880
As to the situations

87
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,800
What's wrong?

88
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,680
Are you okay?

89
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,560
Do you want to go to the hospital?

90
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,440
I'm fine

91
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,320
and I'll be back later.

92
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,080
Tang Song

93
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes.

94
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,720
Find out a 재밌 collusion

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,120
of 정 veneration

96
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
Okay, I got it.

97
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Hello?

98
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,000
Ji Xing, Zhang Fengmei has a problem.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,680
She's in a critical condition.

100
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,000
She's in a critical condition.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Please come to the center of the bed.

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,440
How could this happen?

103
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,400
I'll come over now.

104
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,360
The patient has a problem.

105
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,960
I have to go.

106
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,800
Tang Cong, go to the bed.

107
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,680
No.

108
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,520
You two take a rest.

109
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,080
I can handle it myself.

110
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
I'll go with you.

111
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
What's going on?

112
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,000
The patient has been in a critical condition.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,040
He accidentally stepped on the sand on the floor.

114
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,560
He fell down from the stairs.

115
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,080
It caused an error in his bone.

116
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,440
He's in a critical condition.

117
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,040
In a critical condition?

118
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Yes.

119
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,000
But all the test cases

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
have never been like this before.

121
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,280
Even if he fell down,

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,440
it's not that serious.

123
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,320
I'm thinking

124
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,040
if it's a product.

125
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,800
You mean there's a problem with the product?

126
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,040
Take a look at Zhang Fengmei's medical records.

127
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Ji Xing.

128
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,760
The things are ready.

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Mr. Han.

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,520
Let's go and see Zhang Fengmei.

131
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,000
Why did you come with Han Ting?

132
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,680
I was in a restaurant.

133
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,960
I came with her.

134
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
Zhizhou.

135
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,520
Don't come.

136
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
I'm not coming.

137
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
I'm not coming.

138
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
I'm not coming.

139
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
I'm not coming.

140
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
I'm not coming.

141
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Don't come.

142
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,720
Go back to the company now.

143
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,480
Find the data of the fusion machine

144
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,840
and check the medical records of Zhang Fengmei again.

145
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Okay.

146
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,120
Which one?

147
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
That one.

148
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,320
I'm in trouble.

149
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,080
It's not your fault.

150
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,600
Don't be so worried.

151
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,720
Actually...

152
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Hello?

153
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,120
Are you okay?

154
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,720
If you have any difficulties,

155
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,320
feel free to tell us.

156
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,720
We'll help you find a way.

157
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Okay.

158
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,120
I just feel...

159
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,120
I'm so sorry.

160
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,120
You're so hard-working to help me.

161
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,320
It's okay.

162
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
After the treatment is done,

163
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,320
we'll treat you again.

164
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,720
But if you want to hear the doctor's words,

165
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
eat well and sleep well.

166
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
Okay.

167
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,720
Do you think Zhang Fengmei was a little strange?

168
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,120
Yes, he was.

169
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,720
He was in the hospital and was in a coma.

170
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,520
There must be some kind of cause behind him.

171
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,120
Let's talk about it first.

172
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,320
We'll talk later.

173
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
Okay.

174
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,120
What's going on?

175
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Our product is not in a problem.

176
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,120
Even if it doesn't have a proper doctor,

177
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,720
it won't be that serious.

178
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,320
Okay, don't be so serious.

179
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,720
Let me have a rest.

180
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,520
Mr. Han, you're not leaving yet?

181
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,920
Please send Ji Xin back.

182
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,520
I have to go.

183
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:21,920
I...

184
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Bye-bye.

185
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
Bye-bye.

186
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,320
I'll just call the car.

187
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
I'll send you back.

188
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Let's go.

189
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,520
Don't overthink it

190
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,720
before the result comes out.

191
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,320
I was just busy.

192
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,720
I should have been with you in the hospital

193
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,120
to see the doctor.

194
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
It's okay.

195
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
Don't worry.

196
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,320
Thank you for today.

197
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
I'll go back first.

198
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
I'll send you back.

199
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
I left a note...

200
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,520
Why did you hide from me?

201
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,160
Don't you like

202
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,080
guys like you?

203
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,800
He should give us some advice

204
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,040
Nothing junas

205
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,360
Then Why didn't you bring it

206
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,980
S remains

207
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,300
There will be different meaning

208
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,960
What does it have to do with me?

209
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,160
What do you think

210
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,480
we are?

211
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,200
What is it?

212
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,760
Why did you take me so far?

213
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,280
Xu Xin and Han.

214
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,400
Brothervocadrant Hu Ahge

215
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,440
Xinsu

216
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,440
Come here

217
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,240
Mr. Han

218
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,240
Why don't you come in too?

219
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,680
What else can I do for you?

220
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,920
Need this radio to carry it for you.

221
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,280
Thank you

222
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,260
Of course

223
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,160
Which step did you and Mr. Han go?

224
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,920
He helped me to bring the garbage down.

225
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,520
He's so naive.

226
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,060
This nap basket officers.

227
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,940
is not upstairs.

228
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,360
You can't go outside.

229
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:20,540
So the air

230
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,540
Victim of first release and a first release,

231
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,540
Episode 1

232
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,540
Baby, don't worry.

233
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,140
I'll go to the same house right away.

234
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,540
Mr. Yu.

235
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,540
Something happened in the county.

236
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,140
You always say that you have something to do at home.

237
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,740
And you don't want me to go to your house.

238
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,140
You're so careless.

239
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,140
How could that be?

240
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,540
You know it.

241
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,540
I only have you.

242
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,740
When will you let me go to your house?

243
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,340
I'll take some more time, okay?

244
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,940
How long?

245
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:24,940
Ten days?

246
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,340
Half a month?

247
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,340
Or a year?

248
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,140
I'm sorry.

249
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,540
I'm a lover.

250
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,540
Why didn't you tell me anything?

251
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,740
Sorry.

252
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,140
It's my problem.

253
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,340
Okay, you can go.

254
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,140
Then sleep here.

255
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,340
Okay.

256
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:11,940
Xiaodi.

257
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,140
I heard that Xiaobai 27

258
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,340
is doing well.

259
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,940
It's going well.

260
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,940
But you need to be in trouble

261
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,140
for the landfall.

262
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,140
Congratulations.

263
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,740
I don't think

264
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,740
I've ever seen Han Ping drinking.

265
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,340
He's allergic to alcohol.

266
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,340
He never drinks.

267
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,340
Today, on the court,

268
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,340
he's my real lover.

269
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,540
He drank?

270
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,340
To celebrate the anniversary of Xing Chen's technology,

271
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,140
he's a hero.

272
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,340
I think

273
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,540
if a man wants to be the woman he likes,

274
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,340
he can be a hero.

275
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,740
He's a smart investor.

276
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,540
It's normal to help him drink.

277
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,540
That's right.

278
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,540
The love of the people is the nature of men.

279
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,340
Xiaodi.

280
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,140
I'll help you

281
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,540
to get the girl in the wine bureau.

282
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,140
Okay.

283
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,340
I'm very capable.

284
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,140
I'm done.

285
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,340
Hurry up.

286
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,140
No, no.

287
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,140
Pour it.

288
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,340
You need to pour more.

289
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,140
Okay?

290
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,340
I have a lot of money.

291
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,140
I don't know if you're interested.

292
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,740
Say it.

293
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,940
What's wrong with you?

294
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,740
What's wrong?

295
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,540
What's wrong?

296
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,940
What should we do?

297
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,740
Hello, Yichen.

298
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,140
Ji Xiang.

299
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,540
Zhao Fangmei is gone.

300
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,140
We can't contact him now.

301
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,540
He's in a big accident in Dongyang.

302
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,940
What's going on?

303
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,940
Our operation is about to end.

304
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,140
Why did he leave the hospital at this time?

305
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,140
And you're just colleagues.

306
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,740
They're looking for you.

307
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,140
They must be targeting you.

308
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,540
So there must be a problem.

309
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,140
Ji Xiang.

310
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,940
If you can find a way to

311
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,140
bring Zhang Fangmei back to the hospital

312
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,140
and get the treatment,

313
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,140
you can come.

314
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,940
Okay, I got it.

315
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,740
Don't worry too much.

316
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,940
If you need anything,

317
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,340
I'll explain it to you.

318
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,340
No need for now.

319
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,740
I'll hang up.

320
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,140
Both of you.

321
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,540
Don't worry too much.

322
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:02,940
Ji Xiang.

323
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,140
What should we do?

324
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,340
Xin.

325
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,540
What should we do?

326
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,340
Let me go down first.

327
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,340
We can talk to them.

328
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,740
No, they don't know

329
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,340
what they're doing.

330
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,540
Xin Xin.

331
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,140
Shall we go to the lawyer now?

332
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,140
Zhizhou,

333
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,340
have we checked our data

334
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,340
and Zhang Fangmei's medical records?

335
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,140
We've checked it.

336
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,540
No problem.

337
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,700
You're deliberately threatening me.

338
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,100
Well, Zhizhou and Lily,

339
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,380
let's go down and have a look.

340
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,100
Let's see if we can persuade them

341
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,500
to bring Zhang Hongmei to the clinic.

342
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,980
The rest of us will continue to work.

343
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,140
Okay.

344
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,100
No matter what happens later,

345
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,100
don't be impulsive.

346
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:41,940
Let's go.

347
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,700
The most important thing is your health.

348
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,260
If you keep delaying,

349
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,580
you'll lose your quality.

350
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:04,860
I...

351
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,740
What are you doing?

352
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,300
You and your wife are not bad enough.

353
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,740
You want to lie to her?

354
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,980
We agreed to do a surgery yesterday.

355
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,260
Why did you change your mind suddenly?

356
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,580
She's the boss of Star Technology.

357
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,020
She's the one who ruined my wife!

358
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,380
Keep it down!

359
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,300
Keep it down!

360
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,580
Keep it down!

361
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,020
Keep it down!

362
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,220
Keep it down!

363
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,060
Okay.

364
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,860
Calm down.

365
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,740
Let's talk about it slowly.

366
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,780
We can't.

367
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,620
Let's compensate for it.

368
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,420
Or we'll be in trouble.

369
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,660
You're making a fuss.

370
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,340
Do you know that?

371
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,780
I'm making a fuss?

372
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,100
You're not responsible for it, understand?

373
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,300
Stop talking nonsense.

374
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,420
You want to solve the problem

375
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,620
or to make things worse?

376
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,020
You can't save your wife by making a fuss.

377
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,340
Why do you listen to a black-hearted boss?

378
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,940
You lied to my wife

379
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,020
that you can cure her illness by doing a surgery.

380
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,700
What happened?

381
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,700
You shouldn't call her Star Technology.

382
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,980
You should call her the human chain.

383
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,660
The hospital has prepared

384
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,780
a follow-up treatment plan for her.

385
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,620
When Mu Zhiqi cured her illness,

386
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,340
she'd be in a bad mood

387
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,500
and she'd be in a bad mood for the rest of her life.

388
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,260
Okay.

389
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,380
Yes.

390
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,780
You must cure her illness.

391
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,820
Let's compensate her first.

392
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,260
After that,

393
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,500
we'll go to the hospital.

394
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,020
We'll not find

395
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,180
a black-hearted boss

396
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,500
who doesn't care about her life.

397
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,580
Stop!

398
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,460
Stop!

399
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,460
Stop!

400
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,180
Stop!

401
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,780
Stop!

402
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,060
Stop!

403
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,060
Mr. Han.

404
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,580
Mr. Luo and I have a good conversation.

405
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,860
He's very professional.

406
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,140
He's also very straightforward.

407
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,180
Very good.

408
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,580
Mr. Luo.

409
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,660
Mr. Han.

410
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,220
Can I?

411
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,380
I don't know

412
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,140
what's your plan

413
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,980
for Starotte?

414
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,340
When your relationship

415
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:12,940
is published in the future,

416
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,060
a董事 dic Jedi

417
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,780
will ban

418
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,140
the competition

419
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,260
between the two republics?

420
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,500
Don't get the wrong idea.

421
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,460
It's just the development speed

422
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,940
is very fast.

423
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,940
Their pursuit of the fusion of the air is very fast.

424
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,940
And Lin Chong's performance is also very smooth.

425
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,940
But this mountain is not easy to be caught up in.

426
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,940
Mr. Han,

427
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,940
do you think of putting Xing Chen into Han Hai?

428
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,940
Xing Chen is very fast in development.

429
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,940
But in all aspects of Han Hai,

430
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,940
we can't discuss it in detail.

431
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,940
When the fusion is not over,

432
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,940
and

433
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,940
he won't agree.

434
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,940
Boss.

435
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,940
Xing Chen is in trouble.

436
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,940
Sorry, I'll leave it to you next time.

437
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,940
Mr. Han,

438
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,940
take care.

439
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,940
The seven days of fusion are back.

440
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:40,960
It's good to have a white-collar

441
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,940
and go back to drink some water.

442
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,940
Look, your mouth is getting tired.

443
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,940
We just sit here.

444
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,940
When will Xing Chen's technology give us money?

445
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,940
When will we leave?

446
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,940
I've said it.

447
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,940
I won't give a penny

448
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,940
before we find out the problem.

449
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,940
He doesn't want to compensate.

450
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,940
Hit me.

451
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,940
Hit me.

452
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,940
He's holding it.

453
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,940
He's holding it.

454
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,940
He's holding it.

455
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,940
Hit me.

456
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,940
Hit him.

457
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,940
Hit me.

458
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,940
Hit me.

459
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,940
Hit me.

460
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,940
I'm tired.

461
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,940
Follow him.

462
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,940
I'll beat you up.

463
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,940
Are you okay?

464
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,940
I'm fine.

465
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,940
Okay, come back.

466
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,940
Zhang Fengmei's application to the volunteer

467
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,940
signed a agreement.

468
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,940
There's a problem with the number of people

469
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,940
and Xing Chen's technology.

470
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,940
So what?

471
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,940
I signed the contract

472
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,940
not the life and death.

473
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,940
Besides, they've cured it.

474
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,940
Shouldn't we compensate?

475
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,940
The whole process has records.

476
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,940
Xing Chen's products

477
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,940
have been checked.

478
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,940
If you have any questions

479
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,940
or don't believe me,

480
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,940
if you want to find out the reason for the problem,

481
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,940
we can investigate it together.

482
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,940
Xu.

483
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,940
Xu, forget it.

484
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,940
Forget it.

485
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,940
Forget it.

486
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,940
Forget what?

487
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,940
Okay.

488
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,940
We can leave.

489
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,940
Take the money and sell it.

490
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,940
Tang Song.

491
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,940
Hello.

492
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,940
Let's talk here.

493
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,940
Tang Song.

494
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,940
What are you doing?

495
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,940
Are you going to pay him?

496
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,940
You're not going to pay him.

497
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,940
If you pay him,

498
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,940
he won't care about Zhang Fengmei.

499
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,940
Stop it.

500
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,940
Why are you taking pictures?

501
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,940
Let's go.

502
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,940
You don't have to interfere.

503
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,940
If you don't want me to interfere,

504
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,940
you have to be able to solve the problem.

505
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,940
I'm not going to solve it again.

506
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,940
How can you solve it?

507
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,940
You've been wrong since the beginning.

508
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,940
Besides,

509
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,940
innovation is responsible for it.

510
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,940
You have to take the initiative.

511
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,940
Can you not

512
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,940
always think about the problem

513
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,940
in your own way?

514
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,940
Xing Chen is not Dongyang.

515
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,940
He doesn't have the right

516
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,940
to make things worse.

517
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,940
The problem is serious.

518
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,940
The biggest loss is Xing Chen.

519
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,940
It's quite realistic.

520
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,940
So,

521
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,940
I solved the problem for you.

522
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,940
Shouldn't you thank me?

523
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,940
Isn't it just

524
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,940
to let Tang Song take the money to pay the debt?

525
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,940
That means Xing Chen is wrong.

526
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,940
What's wrong?

527
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,940
What's wrong?

528
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,940
You're standing there with Xing Chen

529
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,940
and making trouble with them.

530
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,940
You're already wrong.

531
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,940
You're fighting with the factory and the big deal.

532
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,940
And you didn't see many people

533
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,940
taking pictures,

534
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,940
recording videos, and live streaming?

535
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,940
What's the matter with the pictures?

536
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,940
Xing Chen didn't do it first.

537
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,940
And I've been talking about the facts

538
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,940
and the truth there.

539
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,940
Even if I put these things online,

540
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,940
the public won't stand by them.

541
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,940
And then?

542
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,940
I cured Zhang Fengmei.

543
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,940
Then I completed a good job

544
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,940
and made a commercial.

545
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,940
But you brought me

546
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,940
with money to solve the problem.

547
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,940
Is it just a matter of time?

548
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,940
Xing Chen is wrong.

549
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,940
And you also saw

550
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,940
that man is a scumbag.

551
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,940
He didn't care about Zhang Fengmei's life

552
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,940
when he took the money.

553
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,940
You know what kind of person he is.

554
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,940
You still hope to save Zhang Fengmei.

555
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,940
This kind of family and patient,

556
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,940
you dare to give him the second operation?

557
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,940
But I can't just

558
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,940
let him see Zhang Fengmei

559
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,940
with his eyes.

560
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,940
I'll keep talking to him.

561
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,940
Keep telling him to pay attention to the facts.

562
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,940
Do you think he's in this situation

563
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,940
because you didn't tell him clearly last time?

564
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,940
Just an accident.

565
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,940
It wasn't your fault.

566
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,340
I...

567
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,020
Uncle.

568
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,700
You got hurt.

569
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,380
You hit my chest

570
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,140
with your price tag.

571
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,460
Don't you tell低 in летnink.

572
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,180
Well.

573
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,440
Boyuan Chief?

574
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,440
Wait.

575
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,160
Be serious.

576
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,240
Are you trying to say something crazy?

577
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,600
Do it.

578
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,200
Don't move.

579
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,140
Or I will push it against your will.

580
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,800
I'm not your Ki Owner.

581
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,940
I'm hungry.

582
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,940
I haven't eaten anything for a day.

583
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,940
You said you were hungry.

584
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,940
I'm hungry.

585
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,940
I'm hungry.

586
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,940
I'm hungry.

587
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,940
I'm hungry.

588
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,940
I'm hungry.

589
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,940
I'm hungry.

590
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,940
I'm hungry.

591
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,940
I'm hungry.

592
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,940
I'll go cook later.

593
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,940
Zhicheng, how's the company?

594
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,940
The production team is gone.

595
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,940
Okay, we all think about

596
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,940
how to deal with this later.

597
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,940
We're trying to get the influence to the smallest.

598
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,940
The Big Brother

599
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,940
Episode 1

600
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,940
Don't worry.

601
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,940
We'll make sure we don't do anything else.

602
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,940
I hope you can be seated.

603
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,940
Of course.

604
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,940
Be careful.

605
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,940
Okay.

606
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,940
Have you finished?

607
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,940
Xu Shuang just wants money.

608
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,940
He wants to talk to us as soon as possible.

609
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,940
He doesn't have much time.

610
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,940
The condition has been approved?

611
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,940
Yes.

612
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,940
He has signed the contract.

613
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,940
Send the view on your phone.

614
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,940
I see.

615
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,940
Cheers.

616
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,920
Looks good now.

617
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,940
Take a toast first.

618
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,940
Cheers.

619
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,940
What are you looking at?

620
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,940
Let me see two-key tempo fundamental techniques.

621
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,740
I promise I will definitely

622
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,580
overcome every difficulties

623
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,700
without a big problem.

624
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,420
Xu Zhong has signed it?

625
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,260
In short, things have been resolved.

626
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,620
You can rest assured at this junction now.

627
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,380
Take a seat before I eat.

628
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,980
Gone.

629
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,580
You should take a shower first.

630
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,580
All right.

631
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,000
I want you to be swear 50 times.

632
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,180
This might hurt your finger.

633
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,920
In every game,

634
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,900
keep their touch down,

635
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,940
and they won't need you to ask them for your name.

636
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,500
Oh, I have chased the States.

637
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,600
On,

638
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,860
thank you,

639
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,780
bye.

640
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:11,900
Come on.

641
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,640
I love it.

642
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,820
Keep your mouth shut.

643
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,980
I'm a fish tanker.

644
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,740
Did you notice it last time?

645
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,500
Why didn't you have fish?

646
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,500
Grandma Gu said I was single.

647
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,860
She asked me to raise fish

648
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,460
and enrich my life.

649
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,660
I don't have time to raise fish.

650
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:38,900
Look,

651
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,460
Grandma Gu still thinks

652
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,980
you're too selfish.

653
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,020
You should learn to fish

654
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,340
and be cute.

655
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,380
Who would have thought that

656
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,740
you've raised a can of water?

657
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,900
It's more refreshing in the room.

658
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,140
Is it?

659
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,700
Are you okay?

660
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,580
You're still here?

661
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,560
You're still so moral.

662
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,260
Go back to the same room.

663
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,260
Wait for me, Grandma for a moment.

664
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,180
I'm not soashing spirit in this way.

665
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,320
Hurry.

666
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,660
For you.

667
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,660
What are you waiting for?

668
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,660
Let's eat.

669
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,660
Are you cooking or art?

670
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,660
It's suitable for me.

671
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,660
The pumpkin is like a real talent.

672
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,660
Some places like to call the pumpkin soup

673
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,660
as the soup of the farm.

674
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,660
Try it.

675
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,660
Try it.

676
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,660
It won't be too spicy.

677
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,660
What other dishes can you cook?

678
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,660
The country of pineapple is good.

679
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,660
In Minnan,

680
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,660
they like to call the pineapple

681
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,660
as Wanglai.

682
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,660
Because their pronunciation is

683
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,660
Onglai.

684
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,660
What is it?

685
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,660
Onglai.

686
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,660
Onglai.

687
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,660
Onglai.

688
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,660
Onglai.

689
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,660
Onglai.

690
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,660
Onglai.

691
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,660
Onglai.

692
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,660
I don't know.

693
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,660
You said it was called Onglai.

694
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,660
Shouldn't you have a name?

695
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,660
Onglai?

696
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,660
Onglai.

697
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,660
You're right.

698
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,660
But I'm curious.

699
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,660
Why do you have a purpose?

700
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,660
When the house was under the warm care,

701
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,660
people would take the situation

702
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,660
and the social situation as a value.

703
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,660
So,

704
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,660
these food

705
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,660
are meaningful.

706
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,660
How is it?

707
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,660
Why is it so delicious?

708
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,660
Thank you, Han Dachu,

709
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,660
for making this meal for me.

710
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,660
It's not enough to thank me.

711
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,660
What do you mean?

712
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,660
Do you want to try it?

713
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,660
Why do you ask me this time?

714
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,660
I can't refuse to eat.

715
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,660
What are you thinking about?

716
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,660
I didn't say what it is.

717
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,660
Be my girlfriend.

718
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,660
I'm afraid of pain.

719
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,660
But I said pain.

720
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,660
The moment I left, I was so tired.

721
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,660
Okay.

722
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,660
Actually,

723
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,660
I'm your boyfriend

724
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,660
from now on.

725
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,660
Onglai.

726
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,660
Onglai.

727
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,660
Please listen to me.

728
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,660
I'm afraid of pain.

729
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,660
Onglai.

730
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,660
Mr. Han,

731
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,660
we received the contract.

732
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,220
Yes.

733
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,460
But the details on the contract,

734
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,820
I think it's necessary to adjust it.

735
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,420
Mr. Zhu thinks

736
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,820
Dongyang's contract can be changed.

737
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,420
Mr. Han,

738
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,020
you understand me, too.

739
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,420
It's not easy for me.

740
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:26,820
How about this?

741
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,420
You can take some time.

742
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,620
I'll be in the middle of the price.

743
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,020
I just wanted to ask you.

744
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,780
Why do you have a female jade robe and slippers?

745
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,780
I've prepared it for you.

746
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,380
I finally sent it to the public today.

747
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,380
It looks good.

748
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,180
What about yours?

749
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,180
Mine is not bad.

750
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,580
What are you doing?

751
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:09,780
Come here.

752
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,380
What's your name?

753
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,380
It's easy.

754
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,380
Actually, the person's name

755
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,780
is his own face.

756
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,580
So, what's his signature?

757
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,980
You must practice it well.

758
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,380
I'll practice it.

759
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,780
I'll be in the middle of the price.

760
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,780
I'll be in the middle of the price.

761
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,780
I'll be in the middle of the price.

762
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,780
I'll be in the middle of the price.

763
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,780
