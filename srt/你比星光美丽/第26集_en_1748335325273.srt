1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,720
I will go to the heaven and earth

2
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,720
I will never hesitate to give up my future

3
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,200
I will never give up my future

4
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,480
I will go to the heaven and earth

5
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,040
I will never give up my future

6
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,320
I will always believe in miracles

7
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,520
Even with the great future

8
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,600
& Time limited

9
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,440
Episode 26

10
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,440
Are you not Clan Envoy Chen?

11
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,920
I prefer to tease myself to compensation

12
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,240
But I don't want to hear

13
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,740
what those heart-touching thoughts

14
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,940
are like cheering for East Asia

15
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,100
What do you want to see me do?

16
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,380
You don't need to do much겠� hue.

17
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,860
I'll let your aunt enjoy herself.

18
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,660
I love you.

19
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,320
Aren't you saying you're serving yourself?

20
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,380
Probably not.

21
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,620
You just want to chose one girl.

22
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,380
After you're done with her美國 Paid.

23
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,900
Xiaoyue is Visiting辛苦 conocerbewrik,

24
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,900
But what are you doing?

25
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,900
I'm here to meet you.

26
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,480
What is that for?

27
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,540
So mysterious.

28
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,320
Come here.

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,760
He took me here to take a short tour.

30
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,920
This is the best place in Hong Kong.

31
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,480
Take a look.

32
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,720
Did you see that すー

33
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,320
Wo's at the bottom?

34
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,080
Wo's is essentially,...

35
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,840
Wo's?

36
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,120
The one with the brightest, which one?

37
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,920
See that?

38
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,440
I have the image reduced.

39
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,320
I'll give you a bottle.

40
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
I'll give it to you.

41
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,600
I really like watching stars.

42
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,320
When I first came to this city,

43
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,960
I was under great pressure.

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,320
I was confused and lonely.

45
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,240
But as soon as I look at stars,

46
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,360
I feel relaxed.

47
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,520
And romantic.

48
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,120
I feel like he gave me the right to dream.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,840
But it's more romantic

50
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,400
than you are with me now.

51
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,800
I've heard about stars, too.

52
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,200
We are all stars.

53
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,760
Love is the dust.

54
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,480
Every element in our body

55
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,040
is composed of the universe's explosion,

56
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,320
the stars and the sunset.

57
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,640
Every star we see now,

58
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,360
including the heart,

59
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,240
are connected to us.

60
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,880
Now,

61
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,040
I want to ask you about my heart.

62
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,560
Everything you wanted me to be

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,560
to try to let you be my destiny.

64
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,400
To start shining through the day and night.

65
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,440
Hell is this.

66
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,920
All my hate across the land and sea.

67
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,920
Commonly from this sky to me.

68
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,200
We are the one that God keeps saying.

69
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,720
Hell is this.

70
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,760
You are everything.

71
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,760
I love you.

72
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,040
I'm afraid of pain, but I'll say it's painful.

73
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
I'm serious.

74
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,960
The wind and the waves are running.

75
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,680
The morning and morning are both on the street.

76
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,080
That moment of eyes are red.

77
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
It's because you are still with me.

78
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,400
Everything you wanted me to be

79
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,240
to try to let you be my destiny.

80
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,320
To start shining through the day and night.

81
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,600
Hell is this.

82
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,640
You are everything.

83
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,400
Congratulations.

84
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,360
The price of the winter clothes is falling.

85
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,200
But I'm also very happy with you.

86
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,360
I've been busy for so long.

87
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,760
I'm afraid that the price of the clothes is gone.

88
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,360
What do you want to say?

89
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,760
I'm afraid that I'll lose my mind.

90
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,960
I'm afraid that I'll lose my mind.

91
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,280
I'm afraid that I'll lose my mind.

92
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,640
I'm afraid that I'll lose my mind.

93
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,920
I'm afraid that I'll lose my mind.

94
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
I want to tell you something, Han Tian.

95
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
There's not much time left for you.

96
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,920
Tell me.

97
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
What should I do next?

98
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,920
Just do what I told you.

99
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
I know.

100
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
It's only a low price.

101
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
I've been buying the clothes on the market.

102
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
I've been buying the clothes on the market.

103
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
You're under so much pressure now.

104
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Do you want to re-create your KPI with Ji Xin?

105
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
As her personality,

106
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
I don't need to give her pressure.

107
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,920
The new product of winter clothes is stable now.

108
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
By then,

109
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,920
as long as the news of the Han Sea is released,

110
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
it will be a problem to complete the military order.

111
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
I'll do something else.

112
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
You just want to make your work

113
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
and your relationship a mess.

114
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
It's not pure.

115
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
You can take your time.

116
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
Let's go.

117
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Take care.

118
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Look at this.

119
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Hong Kong is promoting a great medical system

120
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
for the pre-trial test.

121
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
The test project selected by the pre-trial project

122
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
is not only available

123
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
to the international famous test center

124
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
to study together,

125
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
but also to get a total of

126
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
a total of 2 million scientific research fund.

127
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,920
This opportunity is too important to us.

128
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,920
It's hard to promote this pre-trial project.

129
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,920
I think it also needs the Ministry of Health,

130
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,920
and all the other departments to promote the pre-trial test.

131
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
The new hospital has the right to promote the promotion.

132
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Then we'll be in their hands.

133
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Zhizheng, go to the various departments to have a meeting.

134
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Prepare the materials for the promotion.

135
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
Okay, I'll go right away.

136
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Okay.

137
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Is it for Mr. Han?

138
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
It's also for ourselves.

139
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Grandpa, after the video was released,

140
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,920
we've quickly conducted a crisis control.

141
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
According to the latest medical test,

142
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
the result is very good.

143
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
The patient, Zhang Fengmei,

144
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
will undergo the second operation.

145
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
And Xing Chen will also be in charge of all the costs

146
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,920
and the subsequent recovery problems.

147
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
His husband also got the punishment for his shadow.

148
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
The child is also relieved of the disease.

149
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,920
Since I started in the East Asia,

150
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
it's still the first time

151
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
that people have been gambling and pulling their butts.

152
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
Do you think

153
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,920
you're done with this matter?

154
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,920
I believe that this is the best

155
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
solution for the best.

156
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
The PR team in the East Asia will continue to follow

157
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
and eliminate the negative effects.

158
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
A stick

159
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
is stuck in the wooden board.

160
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,920
It's the best craftsman to pull it out.

161
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,920
Do you think there will be traces on the wooden board?

162
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Grandpa,

163
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
I believe that

164
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
the next time you do something like this,

165
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,920
you will be punished.

166
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Little Di?

167
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
What does this have to do with Little Di?

168
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,920
It's the matter of Zhang Fengmei's husband who is the mastermind of the enemy.

169
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,920
I'm sorry.

170
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,920
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,920
I saw this little girl grow up.

176
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Don't drink.

177
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
You'll finish this bottle of wine by yourself.

178
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,920
Isn't this place for drinking wine?

179
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
When I first met you,

180
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,920
you came back to the bedside.

181
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
We met at the party again, right?

182
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
At that time, you were very good.

183
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
I saw you in the crowd.

184
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Ever since you came back from this Hanlin,

185
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
you have become more and more exhausted.

186
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,920
I just want to ask you,

187
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
when did you hit the wall?

188
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,920
You can't turn back.

189
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Since you hit the head and broke the blood,

190
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,920
you don't have to turn back, right?

191
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
I'll go to the bathroom.

192
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
Mr. Chang,

193
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,920
the new news of Dongwei's new report is not low.

194
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
You should add more on the price of the previous report.

195
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Let's meet tomorrow.

196
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
I'll see you tomorrow.

197
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Let's meet tomorrow.

198
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
Okay.

199
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
Li, have you watched Xiaomeng's new video?

200
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
What are you doing?

201
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,920
I'm just trying to prove it.

202
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
The result of the investigation has not been revealed yet.

203
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,920
How can you be so happy?

204
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
And the product of the new product has not been revealed yet.

205
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
There has been no problem.

206
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
If you don't understand the situation,

207
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,920
why do you say that the new product is...

208
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Why do you curse him?

209
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,920
It's probably because of Zhang Fengmei.

210
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,920
I'll be right there.

211
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,920
It's really delicious.

212
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,920
What are you doing?

213
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,920
Why are you only looking at me?

214
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,920
Xiaomeng,

215
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
don't go online to watch those comments these days.

216
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
They are cursing them.

217
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
They have no influence on me.

218
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Are they going to be beaten by those Internet black people?

219
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Xiaomeng, I'm sorry.

220
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
It's all because of you helping Xing Chen speak.

221
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,920
You...

222
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,920
Don't be so sad.

223
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,920
My sister was bullied.

224
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,920
I didn't stand out at this time.

225
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
I was still a Tu Xiaomeng.

226
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
Besides,

227
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
your things have gone too far.

228
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Those people are still here.

229
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
People are still in the crowd.

230
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,920
They are online.

231
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,920
They are really fake.

232
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,920
I think they are free to send me a warm-up.

233
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
When I get warm up,

234
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
I'll do another live broadcast.

235
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
I'm so angry with them.

236
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Okay.

237
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
Don't worry.

238
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Come on.

239
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Okay.

240
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
I'm so anxious.

241
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
Don't worry.

242
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
It's okay.

243
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
Xiaomeng is a beauty warrior, right?

244
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
You are so nice.

245
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
Big one.

246
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,920
No.

247
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Anyway,

248
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,920
no matter who you are,

249
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,920
we will be together forever.

250
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
We will have a secret life.

251
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
We will have a good life.

252
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Yichen,

253
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Xing Chen wants to promote the Xianfeng project.

254
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,920
Do you think it's a good idea?

255
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,920
Xing Chen's ancient project

256
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,920
is very popular in the clinical trials of the whole Xinjiang Hospital.

257
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,920
How about this?

258
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
I'll help you to meet

259
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
some colleagues who know about Xianfeng project.

260
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,920
We will have a meal together tomorrow noon.

261
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,920
That's great.

262
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,920
Thank you.

263
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,920
It's okay.

264
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
You are so busy today.

265
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
I'm in a good mood today.

266
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
Why?

267
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
I should tell you that

268
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
Xing Chen has finally passed the South gate.

269
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
Come on.

270
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
Let's celebrate it.

271
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,920
Cheers.

272
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
You are in a good mood today.

273
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
Of course.

274
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,920
After all, Xing Chen is my best friend.

275
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
I'm really happy for her.

276
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
But

277
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,920
I can't participate

278
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
in the celebration of the three of them.

279
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Maybe in the future,

280
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
I won't be too proud.

281
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,920
Qiu Zeyu.

282
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Do you think

283
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
you have regrets?

284
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
After being with me,

285
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,560
you will continue to be

286
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,920
with the secret door

287
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
and be brave.

288
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,920
Since I chose you,

289
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
I will never regret it.

290
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
Qiu Zeyu.

291
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,920
As long as we are happy,

292
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
Qiu Zeyu.

293
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Let's get married.

294
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,920
Let's get married.

295
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
Let's get married.

296
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
It's cold these days.

297
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,920
Take off your clothes when you leave the door.

298
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
Brother.

299
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
Try this.

300
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
I'll heat it myself.

301
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,920
Don't burn it.

302
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
What are you doing?

303
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,920
You try it yourself.

304
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Mingming is very good at drinking.

305
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,920
You are the one who accepted new things.

306
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,920
This tea is from my brother.

307
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Don't throw it away.

308
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
If you don't like it,

309
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,920
I'll leave it to Xiaoting and Xiao Yuan to drink.

310
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,920
I'll give it to them.

311
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
You came late.

312
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Xiaoting just came yesterday.

313
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Really?

314
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
It's a big deal.

315
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,920
Xiaoting is so good at drinking.

316
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,920
She's a good girl.

317
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
Xiaoting is so busy.

318
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,920
What's the big deal here?

319
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,920
She came here to get him.

320
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,920
Isn't it the thing about the person who is full of love?

321
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
That thing?

322
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,920
Isn't it all about the truth?

323
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
I've seen it myself.

324
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,920
I've sent a lot of videos.

325
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
I've said it.

326
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
That person is really pitiful.

327
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,920
What should they do in the future?

328
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
They married such a husband.

329
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,920
They are not as good as they are.

330
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
They are not good.

331
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,920
They are small.

332
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Brother,

333
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
how about we...

334
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
Come on.

335
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
It's time to go.

336
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Xing Chen's company is going to

337
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,920
do a new operation for him.

338
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,920
And he needs to be treated as a nurse.

339
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Don't worry about it.

340
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,920
I don't know what to ask.

341
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,920
If it's really like this,

342
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,920
that's great.

343
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
Brother,

344
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,920
Xing Chen's idea is the best.

345
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,920
I mean, she is a good girl.

346
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
She is a good girl.

347
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,920
You haven't even made it clear yet.

348
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Ji Xing.

349
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Ji Xing?

350
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
I'll tell you.

351
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Ji Xing is a good girl.

352
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
She is a good girl.

353
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
She is a good girl.

354
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
Right, Brother?

355
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Okay, Brother, I beg you.

356
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,920
You don't hate Ji Xing, do you?

357
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,920
This girl is a bit stubborn.

358
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,920
But how high she is,

359
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,920
how much she is,

360
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
there is still some observation.

361
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,920
Brother, I really admire you.

362
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,920
We are all in the same stomach.

363
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Brother,

364
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
you are in the same stomach.

365
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Can you not say less?

366
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,920
General, have some food and drink.

367
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
You are so reliable.

368
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
It's so hard to drink.

369
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,920
Brother, you are so much.

370
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
I don't know you

371
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
since we were together.

372
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,920
We look like close friends.

373
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
But we are all fake.

374
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
Think about it carefully.

375
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
We seem to be in the same glass.

376
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
I have never been in your heart

377
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
since I was a child.

378
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
I used to think

379
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
it's good to be happy

380
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
when we are together.

381
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,920
Since you want to know,

382
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
I am willing to protect you.

383
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
I wanted to tell you last time,

384
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
but that day,

385
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Xing Chen Keqi suddenly died.

386
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
I didn't mention it to you.

387
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Li Li,

388
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
I have a soul.

389
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,920
My wife, Wang Tian,

390
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
died in the south of the country five years ago.

391
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,920
But I left a daughter for me.

392
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Her name is Bei Bei.

393
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
My mother used to be the one

394
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
who brought me here.

395
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Now you know it all.

396
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
It's gone.

397
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
It's gone.

398
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
I respect all your decisions.

399
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
I am sorry.

400
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
I am sorry.

401
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,920
I am sorry.

402
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
I am sorry.

403
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
I am sorry.

404
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
I have ordered the meal.

405
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
Look,

406
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
I am sorry.

407
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,920
Don't eat.

408
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
What's the matter?

409
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
Thank you.

410
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
I have a few things

411
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
to thank you for.

412
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
Take care of yourself.

413
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
According to your plan,

414
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,920
to improve the stock price,

415
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
you have to take the jewelry

416
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,920
to make a move.

417
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Chang He is also in contact with Zhu Houyu.

418
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,920
If you can't make it,

419
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
you won't want to improve the stock price

420
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,920
by Xing Chen, right?

421
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
After all, according to Xing Chen Keqi's

422
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,920
current speed of development,

423
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,920
he can't do it.

424
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
Anything else?

425
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,920
You don't care about Tong Ke?

426
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,920
Tong Ke has any action.

427
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,920
You shouldn't give me news.

428
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,920
Han Ting,

429
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
I want to help you.

430
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
The exchange of the Chinese shares

431
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,920
has been transferred to you.

432
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,920
Give it to him as soon as possible.

433
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Are you sure

434
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
you want to push me out of this?

435
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,920
Leave Dongyang.

436
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,920
Guanghua will join Tong Ke right away.

437
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,920
That's what you want to see.

438
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Guanghua is yours.

439
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
This is your business.

440
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,920
I always thought you were a reasonable person.

441
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
I didn't expect you to use it so hard.

442
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,920
You are not worried

443
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
about your opponent.

444
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
If I were to use it hard,

445
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,920
I should have done something

446
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,920
when you and Chang He came to the dark.

447
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
I'm sorry.

448
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
I'm sorry.

449
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
Chang He is good to you.

450
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
He is more familiar with your family.

451
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,920
Don't do such a thing again.

452
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
It's not good for you.

453
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
Han Ting.

454
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
Have you ever seen

455
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,920
a face like this?

456
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
Mr. Xu, take care.

457
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
Mr. Xu, take care.

458
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
Thank you.

459
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Bye.

460
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
There are so many drinks.

461
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
I'll get you a price.

462
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
I'll take you home.

463
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
No.

464
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
No.

465
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
Be careful.

466
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
I'll take you home.

467
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
What a coincidence, Mr. Han.

468
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,920
We just had dinner

469
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
with our colleagues here.

470
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
Mr. Ji wants to know

471
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,920
about the blind date project.

472
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
I have something to do.

473
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
Please, Mr. Han.

474
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
Send Mr. Ji home.

475
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
I'll go first.

476
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
Take care.

477
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,920
Bye.

478
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
Bye.

479
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
Thank you, Yichen.

480
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,920
Don't worry.

481
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Bye.

482
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
You asked Shao Yichen

483
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
to help you

484
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
to get the blind date project.

485
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
He helped me a lot.

486
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
He helped you

487
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
to drink so much.

488
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,920
I want to drink it myself.

489
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
You want to drink it yourself?

490
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
Can you stop

491
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
asking questions

492
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
and keep asking questions?

493
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Did you ask

494
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
if I wanted to ask you

495
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
if you just ate with Zeng Di?

496
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,920
Okay.

497
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Get in the car.

498
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
I'll go home.

499
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,920
You'll get in the car

500
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,920
if you go home.

501
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Let's go.

502
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
I'll get in the car.

503
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
Let's go.

504
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
Boss.

505
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,920
How about you...

506
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,920
Mr. Ji.

507
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,920
I'll send you home.

508
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
Please.

509
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
Stop drinking.

510
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Let's go.

511
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
I'll go home.

512
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,920
I'm not leaving.

513
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
So late.

514
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
Bye.

515
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,920
You are almost down today.

516
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
Are you going to drink half of your mg?

517
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Do you know

518
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,120
I...

519
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:10,580
plan to keep doing Chapuch

520
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,180
becoming an electrical engineer.

521
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,200
Some software

522
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,860
needs to be adjusted to improve the record.

523
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,440
A lady?

524
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,780
Why?

525
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,580
I've been following the word wrongly for...

526
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,520
Because...

527
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,940
It's a pity he doesn't care about you.

528
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,180
There's no chance.

529
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,380
Although I'm your daughter,

530
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,700
I'm good for you.

531
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,780
For me?

532
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,940
You did it on purpose

533
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,020
to show me the news of Zhu Shi's death, right?

534
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,460
Zhang Fengwei,

535
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,340
he is also responsible for

536
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,340
this news.

537
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,580
He's good for me?

538
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,660
You're using me?

539
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,080
So Mine and Han Ting

540
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,080
I'm not going to go to the police station.

541
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,080
You and Han Ting went to the police station today.

542
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
You have nothing to do with other people.

543
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,080
Don't be so obsessed with me anymore.

544
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,080
Han Ting has only one intention.

545
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,080
Let's go.

546
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,080
You're much better.

547
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,080
I'll go back.

548
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,080
I'm not happy.

549
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,080
I can't live without this breath.

550
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,080
I can't live.

551
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,080
Okay.

552
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,080
I'll help you.

553
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,080
I'm sorry.

554
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,080
Meishan is the most famous doctor in Jinlong.

555
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
She has a very famous medical skill.

556
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,080
Especially, she has a long hair.

557
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,080
She has the most difficult face to appear.

558
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,080
But she has a short neck.

559
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,080
I want to see Bei Bei tomorrow.

560
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,080
Can you?

561
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,080
Okay.

562
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
Be careful, Bei Bei.

563
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,080
Be careful.

564
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
Dad, Aunt Lili.

565
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,080
You can't come in and play.

566
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,080
I want to buy you two a person.

567
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Thank you.

568
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,080
Thank you, Bei Bei.

569
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,080
Go play.

570
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,080
Good girl.

571
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
Be careful.

572
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,080
Actually, Bei Bei likes you a lot.

573
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,080
What about you?

574
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,080
How much do you like me?

575
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,080
I'm a very strong editor.

576
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,080
I never wanted to be in any relationship.

577
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,080
I knew my family was a secret.

578
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
But you're different.

579
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,080
I can make my private life like you.

580
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
Just like now.

581
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,080
I like Bei Bei too.

582
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,080
Just now,

583
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,080
I even felt that

584
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,080
the three days of family life

585
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
were not bad.

586
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,080
Any changes in relationship

587
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,080
will be a perfect match for me.

588
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080
I don't want Bei Bei to experience this all of a sudden.

589
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,080
I hope you can give me some more time.

590
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,080
Bei Bei.

591
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
Come on, Xiaomeng.

592
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,080
Yes.

593
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,080
Drink some soup.

594
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,080
You'll be fine.

595
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
Thank you, Aunt Lili.

596
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,080
I heard from Jia Jia

597
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,080
that you were bullied by someone.

598
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,080
Who?

599
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,080
Who is so sure

600
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
that you're bullying us?

601
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,080
It's okay, Aunt Lili.

602
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,080
It's just a small thing.

603
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,080
What else?

604
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,080
Look at your eyes.

605
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,080
They're all red.

606
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,080
They're like rabbits.

607
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,080
This is my self-made

608
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
self-made makeup for girls.

609
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Don't put it on when I'm here.

610
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
No matter how big it is,

611
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,080
you have to eat well.

612
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,080
It's important to have a good body.

613
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,080
Isn't there something you want to say?

614
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,080
Five words in the sky.

615
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,080
Aunt, I'm fine.

616
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,080
Okay, you're fine.

617
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,080
Drink more soup tonight.

618
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,080
Okay?

619
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
Okay. I can do this.

620
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,080
Ma, this soup is really good.

621
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,080
How long have you been stewing?

622
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,080
How long?

623
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,080
It's broken.

624
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,080
I'm late.

625
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
I have three regular dates.

626
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,080
I'll pay 3,000 per month.

627
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
Okay.

628
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,080
If you're late,

629
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,080
I won't eat with you.

630
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,080
Jia Jia,

631
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,080
eat with Xiaomeng.

632
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,080
After dinner,

633
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,080
eat with Xiaomeng.

634
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,080
Have a good time.

635
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,080
Okay.

636
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
I'm leaving.

637
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
Be careful, Aunt.

638
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,080
Eat.

639
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,080
Okay.

640
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,080
Bye.

641
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
Bye.

642
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
Bye.

643
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,080
Come on, you eat this.

644
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,080
Black fish sauce salad.

645
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
Have a try.

646
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,080
Black fish.

647
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,080
Black fish.

648
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,080
This is really perfect compared to the month.

649
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,080
Okay, okay.

650
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,080
I won't eat it.

651
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,080
I'll have another one.

652
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,080
Have a bowl of rice noodles.

653
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Come on.

654
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,080
This is good.

655
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,080
Rice noodles?

656
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,080
I hope I can have some.

657
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
I'll have some.

658
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,080
No, I won't eat it.

659
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
I'm still alive.

660
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,080
I really don't mean that.

661
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
Don't be like this.

662
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,080
Don't be so sensitive.

663
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
Okay?

664
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,080
I just want you to eat more.

665
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,080
I'm kidding.

666
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,080
Are you serious?

667
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,080
I just want to see you

668
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,080
being so cautious.

669
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,080
I want to tease you.

670
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
It's okay.

671
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,080
I'm really okay.

672
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
I can be strong.

673
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,080
Don't underestimate me.

674
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,080
Really.

675
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,080
I think

676
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
I can only be

677
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,080
so sad.

678
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,080
Really?

679
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,080
Fine.

680
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,080
I'm relieved that you can say that.

681
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,080
Zong Mingguo.

682
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,080
You can still be funny

683
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,080
in this state.

684
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,080
You're really a strange woman.

685
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,080
Life is just

686
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,680
a strange and

687
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,080
a little bit of a joke.

688
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,080
Life is easy.

689
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,080
Yes.

690
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
It's hard to be optimistic.

691
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,080
Zong Mingguo, come on.

692
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
I'll go and order some food for you.

693
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,080
Is there any plan for you next?

694
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
I haven't thought about it.

695
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,080
I'll continue singing.

696
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,080
Can I teach others to dance?

697
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,080
You can still dance?

698
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,080
Of course.

699
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,080
No.

700
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
I can.

701
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
It's just a piece of cake.

702
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,080
It's just a piece of cake.

703
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,080
I'm not so good.

704
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,080
Don't cry.

705
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,080
Of course, I won't.

706
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,080
It's professional, okay?

707
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,080
Come.

708
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,080
The weather is hot.

709
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

710
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

711
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

712
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

713
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

714
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

715
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

716
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

717
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

718
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

719
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

720
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

721
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

722
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

723
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

724
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

725
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

726
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

727
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

728
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

729
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

730
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

731
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

732
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

733
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

734
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

735
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,080
I'm going to go to the hotel.

736
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,080
Helping you to stay in Beijing.

737
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,480
Retire!

738
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,080
What a weird officer.

739
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,320
What is this?

740
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,080
Stay inside!

741
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,080
Don't let him escape!

742
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,080
Mister Jiang Hong.

743
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,080
What is this?

744
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,080
I can only look at a jeans.

745
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,080
You can't be that poor.

746
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,080
What is it?

747
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,880
Sono?

748
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,080
What?

749
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,160
Did you see the goods?

750
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,080
How many goods have you finished?

751
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,080
These messages.

752
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,080
It's coming.

753
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,080
It's coming.

754
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,080
Look,

755
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,080
she doesn't have a single message.

756
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,080
How could she do that?

757
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,080
She doesn't know I'm angry.

758
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,080
You can't do that to your girlfriend.

759
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,080
If you do that, your child will be sad.

760
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,080
She will be unhappy.

761
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,080
Do you understand?

762
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,080
Tong Xiaomeng,

763
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,080
are you stupid?

764
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,080
Do you have a key with you?
