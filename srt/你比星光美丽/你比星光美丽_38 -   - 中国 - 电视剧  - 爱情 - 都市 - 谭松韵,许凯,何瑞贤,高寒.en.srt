23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,150
You're more sensible, Mr. Han.

24
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,640
You prepared morning coffee

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,310
before driving me to work.

26
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,190
Sensible?

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,710
Thoughtful.

28
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,590
I love it.

29
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,510
Glad you love it.

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,120
I'll prepare something else next time.

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,350
I'll order something, then.

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,560
I want carrot and orange juice next time.

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,520
OK.

34
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,520
- Zhizhou.
- Hey, Xing.

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,190
(Hanhai Xingchen)
There's something urgent

36
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,150
I have to tell you.

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,640
What is it?

38
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,240
Zuoyang Company

39
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,150
unilaterally terminated

40
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,360
their cooperation agreement with us

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,520
and would not renew it.

42
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,120
Among all our partners,

43
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,710
Zuoyang is the only company

44
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,840
that supplies tantalum material.

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,360
A product I'm working on

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,840
needs tantalum material.

47
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,520
Or no progress can be made.

48
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,240
I didn't know before asking
the Purchasing Department.

49
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,560
So, I'm calling you immediately

50
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,400
to discuss with you

51
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,430
what we can do next.

52
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,630
Did they break the agreement

53
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,960
or did the agreement expire?

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,310
Normal termination
upon expiration, theoretically.

55
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,310
But I asked the Purchasing Department.

56
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,800
Everything went smoothly
during our cooperation.

57
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,030
So, we don't know

58
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,560
why they suddenly terminate it.

59
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,000
Termination upon expiration?

60
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
In this case,

61
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,000
without a renewed agreement,

62
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,800
we can't hold them responsible.

63
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,360
That's right.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,560
But now,

65
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,470
we need their materials

66
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,590
for the product experiment.

67
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,080
How about this?

68
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,240
I'll do something

69
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,360
to handle the supply of this month.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,080
But in terms of urgency,

71
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,560
we may have to spend more.

72
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,640
Got it.

73
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,680
But we can't scrape materials

74
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,150
for every month.

75
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,840
Xing, I think

76
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,870
after this incident,

77
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,360
we need to get

78
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,120
new and stable material suppliers.

79
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,000
Since I was back from Germany,

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I've had an idea.

81
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,360
I can give it a try now.

82
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,680
What is it?

83
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,120
Not until I realize it.

84
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,430
OK. That's it.

85
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,710
Bye-bye.

86
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,630
Mr. Han, change the destination, please.

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,840
OK.

88
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,630
Why do you not ask me

89
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,030
what idea I have?

90
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,280
Instead of a verbal description,

91
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,310
I prefer to check the result.

92
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,400
When Luo Ping is abroad for inspection,

93
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,000
you seem to be very busy, Miss Ji.

94
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,120
I have no choice.

95
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,750
I have to fill in his position.

96
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,680
But compared to you, Mr. Han,

97
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,560
it is nothing.

98
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,710
Just a drop in the bucket.

99
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,390
Yeah, Mr. Ma.

100
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,680
Your raw materials

101
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,920
have guaranteed quality.

102
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,120
Our company has been

103
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,430
cooperating with you, right?

104
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
We want...

105
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,750
Miss Li, aren't you

106
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,950
working in the Sales Department?

107
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,480
Why do you do the purchasing job?

108
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,360
Working in the same company,

109
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
I'll help as much as can.

110
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,870
Different departments

111
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,830
aren't a problem.

112
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,390
It's really helpful of you, Miss Li.

113
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,950
I won't beat around the bush, then.

114
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,190
Are you calling me

115
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,950
because Zuoyang no longer supplies

116
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,600
and we've just imported

117
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,510
some tantalum materials from abroad?

118
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,430
You're well-informed, Mr. Ma.

119
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,600
I'll be straightforward, too.

120
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,190
If you can help us,

121
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,510
we'll always keep it in mind.

122
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,310
If you need us someday,

123
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,510
just let us know.

124
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,920
It's nice of you, Miss Li.

125
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,360
Since you ask for help,

126
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,830
I'll certainly help as much as can.

127
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,950
You're generous, Mr. Ma.

128
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,270
How about

129
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,390
we draft the contract today?

130
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,270
Miss Li, you know.

131
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,560
The whole market is understocked.

132
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,870
Our stock materials

133
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,390
aren't even enough for old clients.

134
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,190
And you want a big supply.

135
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,750
We really can't offer that.

136
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,120
How about this? 50 kilos at most.

137
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,240
The price goes by 30%.

138
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,200
What do you say?

139
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,560
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

140
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,720
Mr. Ma, get off the phone.

141
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,390
- We'll drink with you.
- Fine, fine.

142
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,750
Miss Li, we'll talk later.

143
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,720
You think about it.

144
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,570
- Bye.
- Come on.

145
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,560
Li.

146
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,040
Stop frowning.

147
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,960
Have something to drink

148
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,200
to replenish your energy.

149
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,230
Thank you.

150
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,630
I should thank you.

151
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,160
You're still trying

152
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,630
to help us with the material thing.

153
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,630
Colleagues help each other.

154
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,160
And I haven't solved the problem.

155
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,360
This morning, I went to Meiyang Material.

156
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,510
Just now, I called Mr. Ma of Kebo Material.

157
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
But I got nothing.

158
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,040
It gives me a headache.

159
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,390
Xing texted, saying

160
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,070
the supply problem was solved.

161
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,150
Really?

162
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,150
Look.

163
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,560
This is great.

164
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,440
Tomorrow noon,

165
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,950
do you have time?

166
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,120
I want to take you somewhere.

167
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,400
OK.

168
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,230
See you tomorrow.

169
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,150
I should go.

170
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,480
Here. Have something to eat.

171
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,480
I feel so happy

172
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,160
to have some noodles made by Mr. Han

173
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,920
when I'm working.

174
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,230
Oh.

175
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,600
I've solved the raw material problem.

176
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,150
So soon?

177
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,120
How?

178
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,630
The CEO of Juhuang has been
in Xinggang for a business trip.

179
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
Qin Li has a good relationship with him.

180
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,310
He got me an appointment with the CEO

181
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,310
and Mr. Xu from Xu's Group.

182
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,000
We reached a strategic cooperation.

183
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,120
One has the high-tech
material technology in Germany

184
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,310
and the other is a local material company.

185
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,160
In this way, we can solve the problem
where local materials

186
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,600
have unstable quality

187
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,830
and help Juhuang, the German company,

188
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,160
to expand the Chinese market.

189
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,390
Hanhai Xingchen will also have

190
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,870
a stable supply of raw materials.

191
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,750
This is creative collaboration.

192
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,190
Impressive, Miss Ji.

193
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,040
You flatter me. I learned it from you.

194
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,510
But I believe

195
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,150
someone must be behind

196
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,720
the termination of Zuoyang Company.

197
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,840
It's cooperating with Tongke.

198
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,270
Compared to yours, Tongke's price

199
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,550
has gone up by 15%.

200
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,120
Too short.

201
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,320
What do you mean?

202
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,990
Too short-sighted.

203
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,910
Vicious competition

204
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,360
benefits no one.

205
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,550
They're too short-sighted.

206
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,030
Only a win-win is the bigger picture.

207
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,150
Not everyone can

208
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,270
think as big

209
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,360
as you do, Miss Ji.

210
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,320
Come on. Take a bath and go to bed early.

211
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,390
I'll review the proposal for a while.

212
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,000
It'll be examined by the directors soon.

213
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,960
You go wash up.

214
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
I'll be there in a second.

215
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,030
Oh, Miss Ji,

216
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,910
here's a document

217
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,030
you need to sign.

218
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,540
(Kiss Card)

219
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,750
Done.

220
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,000
That's all?

221
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,240
It can only be used once a day.

222
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,600
Once a day?

223
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,720
Then can't I even use

224
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,120
my boyfriend privilege?

225
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,720
Fine. I'll check

226
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,320
what other card I can use.

227
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,750
Company Card.

228
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,750
Play Card.

229
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,720
Where can we play so late?

230
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,120
Watching a midnight movie will be good, huh?

231
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,630
Blessing Card.

232
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,840
Pizza Card.

233
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,200
This one is good. Massage Card.

234
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,720
I just ache all over.

235
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,840
- Alarm Clock Card.
- Let's go.

236
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,350
Where are we going?

237
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,510
I'll massage you.

238
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,840
Where does it ache?

239
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,750
Everywhere.

240
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,560
Do you have needles?

241
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,680
I'll acupuncture you.

242
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,270
Acupuncture me? In bed?

243
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,390
Serious acupuncture.

244
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,750
You prepared this for me?

245
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,080
Thanks.

246
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,360
Don't say that.

247
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,390
I thought

248
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,120
cutting Xingchen's raw materials

249
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,200
can cause some trouble.

250
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,000
Unexpectedly, Ji Xing solved the problem again.

251
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,790
She has even got

252
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,320
new material suppliers.

253
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,670
Looks like this drastic trick

254
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,910
didn't work on her.

255
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,390
Ji Xing is capable, indeed.

256
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,120
But she has less experience.

257
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,030
As time goes by, she'll show weakness.

258
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,120
Don't you taste it?

259
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,590
Hello.

260
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,150
It's done.

261
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,600
OK. Stick to our plan.

262
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,990
What is it?

263
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,720
I had my man

264
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,320
contact a marketing company.

265
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,200
What's your plan?

266
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,270
It's not your concern, Mr. Chang.

267
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,440
Indeed, we can't offend a woman.

268
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,600
When a woman is heartless,

269
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,910
she shows no mercy.

270
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,030
When I showed mercy,

271
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,360
he didn't care at all.

272
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,030
Isn't that what you told me?

273
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,630
Business competition

274
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,150
is impersonal.

275
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,360
I should go.

276
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,750
Thanks for the coffee.

277
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,630
I'm done ordering.

278
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,240
See what else you want to eat.

279
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,160
Order more dishes.

280
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,150
These are my favorite dishes.

281
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,630
I want nothing else.

282
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,440
Actually, when dining out,

283
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,840
they don't let me order.

284
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,200
They either think I order bad dishes

285
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,840
or I order too many dishes.

286
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,200
Only when I dine with you...

287
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,320
I know very well

288
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,910
what you love to eat.

289
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,200
As your old colleague

290
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,150
and friend,

291
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,120
I'm quite flattered.

292
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,630
Li Li,

293
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,840
this bouquet

294
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,630
is for you.

295
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,910
Maybe you don't remember.

296
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,080
This bouquet

297
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,910
looks exactly the same as the one you brought

298
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,840
the first time you visited our rooftop office.

299
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,030
- The first time I saw you,
- Surprise!

300
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,480
I felt the whole house

301
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,720
was lit up by you.

302
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,040
I know.

303
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,790
I used to be immature.

304
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,120
To pursue you,

305
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,030
I did a lot of silly things.

306
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,150
But I'm no longer what I used to be.

307
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,120
After Xing left,

308
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,030
we defended Xingchen together

309
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,600
and grew together.

310
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,550
We've been through a lot of things.

311
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,440
And I...

312
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,910
I've been gradually more mature.

313
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,150
Maybe in the past,

314
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,870
you rejected me

315
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,000
because I was childish and impulsive.

316
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,240
But for you, I will

317
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,840
get better.

318
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,320
Will you give me a second chance?

319
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,590
Li Li.

320
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,390
I adore you.

321
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,200
Xia,

322
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,320
do you think

323
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,200
Mr. Su rejected it

324
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,120
because of Miss Li?

325
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,240
I believe he just doesn't want to leave her.

326
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,600
I didn't expect Mr. Su
to be a hopeless romantic.

327
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,040
Mr. Su must have

328
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,630
his own considerations.

329
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,200
But when he's back from Germany,

330
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,320
he'll be the CTO of our company.

331
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,960
He just missed this opportunity.

332
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,120
Too bad.

333
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,200
Maybe this time,

334
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,480
I still have to say,

335
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,120
I'm sorry.

336
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,280
It's OK.

337
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,240
Since I'm ready

338
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,840
to confess my love to you,

339
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,390
I'm also ready

340
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,720
to be rejected.

341
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,590
It's OK.

342
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,630
Look at you.

343
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,120
Just now, you said you were mature.

344
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,790
But now, you look depressed.

345
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,840
Do you really mean

346
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,960
to buy me lunch?

347
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,790
Yes, I mean it.

348
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,080
Actually,

349
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,750
I confessed to you

350
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,000
as if I was giving myself

351
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,200
one last chance.

352
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,480
I sincerely want you

353
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,750
to be always happy.

354
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,960
Come on.

355
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,390
Just kidding.

356
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,030
I've been witnessing

357
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,960
how you grew mature.

358
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,840
And...

359
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,910
You're wrong about one thing.

360
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,320
You didn't start to grow

361
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,600
after Xing left.

362
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,910
Do you remember

363
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,510
we flew to borrow a printer

364
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,240
because our printer broke down?

365
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,790
You guided Zuo to fix the scraper.

366
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,000
At that time, you were

367
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,310
the backbone of Xingchen.

368
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,840
Remember.

369
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,350
You won't grow better for me,

370
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,790
but for yourself.

371
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,510
You have your own merits.

372
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,390
You're honest,

373
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,040
serious,

374
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,000
and responsible.

375
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,110
You just flatter me.

376
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,510
You have a good memory, too.

377
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,640
I bought that bouquet casually.

378
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,270
I don't even remember what it looks like.

379
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,240
But you still remember.

380
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,150
This bouquet...

381
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,110
I'll accept it.

382
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,640
Let me tell you a secret.

383
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,240
I keep eating Western food

384
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,880
just to defend my honor

385
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,160
as a top salesgirl.

386
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,160
Actually, I love to eat...

387
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,510
Stinky tofu.

388
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,920
Stinky tofu?

389
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,400
You love that?

390
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,270
Nearby, there's a very...

391
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,880
A very authentic restaurant.

392
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,160
Hunan restaurant at the street corner.

393
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,350
Yes. That's it.

394
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,960
I'll go buy some for you.

395
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,830
Wait for me.

396
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,920
I'll be right back.

397
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,480
Just wait.

398
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,550
Here it is.

399
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,160
Your favorite cake.

400
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,190
Thanks.

401
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,720
What's wrong?

402
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,960
How could a bar owner like you

403
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,310
not even smile?

404
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,400
Even my nephew,

405
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,030
who is always unsmiling,

406
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,350
has got a girlfriend.

407
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,240
But his uncle,

408
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,590
the handsome me,

409
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,720
hasn't had one yet.

410
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,400
For the sake

411
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,310
I've been behaving very well,

412
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
make me your real boyfriend.

413
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,350
I'll think about it.

414
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,000
I knew it.

415
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,750
I needn't have asked.

416
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,960
Come on. Don't be despondent.

417
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,240
Let me show you my account.

418
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,240
I've made a little change.

419
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,160
What?

420
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,630
Click in and see.

421
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,000
Tu Xiaomeng,

422
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,550
when will you make me your real boyfriend?

423
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,640
It looks awful.

424
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,960
When did you make this video?

425
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,160
You keep asking me

426
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,550
when you will be my real boyfriend, huh?

427
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,790
Now.

428
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Will you,

429
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,240
Mr. Lu?

430
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,550
Yes.

431
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,240
Yes, I will!

432
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,960
I will!

433
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,000
I will be Smart Lemon's boyfriend!

434
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,920
- I will!
- Don't be silly.

435
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,760
I will.

436
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,680
This is my real girlfriend.

437
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,400
I'm your real boyfriend.

438
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,790
Don't be silly.

439
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,310
Come on. Put me down.

440
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,480
But...

441
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,960
What day is it today?

442
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,240
Why did you suddenly approve?

443
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,880
Probably because

444
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,400
of Xing and Mr. Han.

445
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,920
They make me feel nothing can wait

446
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,030
before death.

447
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,270
I had planned to prepare something

448
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,030
and make this day special.

449
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,000
But now,

450
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,160
I can't wait.

451
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,350
Nor can I.

452
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,000
Then...

453
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,720
I'll do my boyfriend privilege.

454
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,720
Wait.

455
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,880
I'll check how many pretty girls are there

456
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,070
on your following list.

457
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,960
Since I fell in love with you,

458
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,350
I've paid no attention to social media.

459
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,310
No pretty girls.

460
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,400
I will be a fan of nobody but you.

461
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,480
(Han Ting)
Come up here.

462
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,880
Xing.

463
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,560
Come on.

464
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,640
This is my girlfriend Ji Xing,

465
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,310
vice president of Hanhai Xingchen.

466
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,350
This is Miss Tan Yuni.

467
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,190
Hello, Miss Tan.

468
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,510
I watched your movies.

469
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,750
You're gorgeous.

470
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,800
Nice to meet you.

471
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,750
I wanted to invite Mr. Han to lunch.

472
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,750
Since your girlfriend is here,

473
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,830
I'll leave you alone.

474
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,260
(Ting, wish you good health. By Yuni.)

475
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,870
Ting?

476
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,590
Gorgeous lady, isn't she?

477
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,110
She came without telling me.

478
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,950
You're jealous?

479
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,400
So, I got you up here to help me out.

480
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,070
Just now, I told her

481
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,350
you were my girlfriend.

482
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,920
She won't come again.

483
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,030
Well done.

484
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,790
It's noon. What would you like for lunch?

485
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,920
How about we dine at Lang Canteen?

486
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,790
A lot of stars love to dine there.

487
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,150
OK.

488
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,870
But next time.

489
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,640
I've reserved another canteen.

490
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,840
- Let's go.
- OK.

491
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,110
(Main Building, Elevator Lobby)

492
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,240
What do you like to eat, Mr. Han?

493
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,080
It's up to you.

494
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,270
As agreed, the treat is on me.

495
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,030
That's rare, Miss Ji.

496
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,750
What are you talking about?

497
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,760
Watch out!

498
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,000
- Mr. Han and Miss Ji.
- How's your waist?

499
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:32,860
Mr. Han and Miss Ji.

500
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,400
I'll call the ambulance.

501
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,560
Don't.

502
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,800
Call Tang Song.

503
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,630
Ms. Yuan.

504
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,630
Come in.

505
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,550
Something happened to Mr. Han.

506
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,670
What happened?

507
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,720
I just heard that Tang Song ran

508
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,000
out of his office hurriedly.

509
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,310
In the underground parking garage, our men

510
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,510
saw Tang Song and Miss Ji

511
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,920
get Mr. Han into the car.

512
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,830
He hasn't come back yet.

513
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,880
I knew his injury

514
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,830
couldn't be that simple.

515
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,350
Shall we tell Mr. Zhou about it?

516
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,190
Not now.

517
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,560
Got it.

518
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,240
The result is out.

519
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,750
According to Director Wei,

520
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,590
you need surgery ASAP.

521
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,390
OK.

522
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,920
It hurts a lot, huh?

523
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,190
I'm fine.

524
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,800
Don't cry.

525
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,550
I'm not crying.

526
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,960
Get a good sleep.

527
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,960
I'll always be here for you.

528
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,920
The chairman is here.

529
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,240
Chairman.

530
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,960
Ji Xing, thanks for your hard work.

531
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,510
Not at all. It's what I should do.

532
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,790
I'll get in and check on him.

533
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,000
OK.

534
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,200
Grandpa, why are you back?

535
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,350
You're in hospital.

536
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,750
How can I still stay in Hainan?

537
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,960
I'm fine.

538
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,310
How could you say that?

539
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,110
You just never learn your lesson.

540
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,030
These days,

541
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,920
I've been thinking

542
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,880
of what you told me.

543
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,750
In the future,

544
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,550
I'll leave some room.

545
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,680
Even the crushed worm will turn.

546
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,110
Remember.

547
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,350
Never challenge someone else's humanity

548
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,350
with your own life.

549
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,150
I get it.

550
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,160
What happened this time

551
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,960
has nothing to do with Ji Xing.

552
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,830
I got her involved.

553
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,750
I didn't come all this way back from Hainan

554
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,720
to blame a young lady.

555
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,550
Your grandpa

556
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,030
isn't that muddle-headed.

557
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,480
Grandpa,

558
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,030
in my heart,

559
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,510
she's as important as Dongyang.

560
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,920
It's good to be flooded with love.

561
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,550
But loving someone

562
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,030
is like a dog, like a god.

563
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,720
You should protect yourself.

564
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,920
You should protect her, too.

565
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,550
I don't want these guys

566
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,880
to keep hurting the lady

567
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,270
my grandson loves.

568
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,800
Grandpa.

569
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,720
Get well soon.

570
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,790
Don't keep a lady

571
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,310
worried about you all the time.

572
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,800
I will.

573
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,750
Don't worry about the company thing.

574
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,590
I've declared

575
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,400
that you've gone abroad for an emergency.

576
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,080
OK.

577
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,080
I should go.

578
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,340
(Dongyang Group)

579
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,280
Xing.

580
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
Check this video.

581
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,590
It says, in our implantable product,

582
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,160
something radioactive is detected.

583
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,240
An implantable medical device

584
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,310
is supposed to save people.

585
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,790
But it's unqualified.

586
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,400
Something radioactive is detected.

587
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,880
How much does it harm the health?

588
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,240
(Dongyang Medical)
Will it cause cancer?

589
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,110
Only experts know that.

590
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,590
(So unscrupulous.)

591
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,830
(Investigate it.)
(Hanhai Xingchen?)

592
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,810
(How can it use this name?)

593
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,420
(Nasty medical circle.
If you get it, you get it.)

594
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,900
(Dongyang Medical makes dirty money.)

595
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,990
(Aren't they afraid of comeuppance?)

596
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,830
Every product of ours

597
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,860
passes the quality inspection.

598
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,830
Nothing radioactive

599
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,790
can be detected.

600
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,750
Obviously, someone is framing us.

601
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,080
How about

602
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,400
I negotiate with him

603
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,160
and see what he's up to?

604
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,310
Not now.

605
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,030
This guy managed

606
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,030
to get our product,

607
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,790
tested it with a so-called detector,

608
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,200
and posted it on social media.

609
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,160
It can't be that simple.

610
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,750
If we contact them now,

611
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,110
maybe they'll charge us

612
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,550
of being guilty.

613
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,200
It makes sense.

614
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,400
I'll issue a statement denying it.

615
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,550
Have you thought about it?

616
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,160
If someone is really

617
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,200
behind all this,

618
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,310
our denial

619
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,550
may be what they want.

620
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,350
Then they'll launch a second attack.

621
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,310
When we keep arguing,

622
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,920
people can't know the truth.

623
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,110
Then they'll suspect us.

624
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,440
Once they do,

625
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,310
we'll have to suffer.

626
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,590
In the medical device industry,

627
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,550
quality is the bottom line.

628
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,590
I understand.

629
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,590
But I fear,

630
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,440
if we don't issue a statement now,

631
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,160
things may get worse.

632
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,350
Shall we

633
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,790
remain silent for a few days?

634
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,310
Maybe it'll come down itself.

635
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,030
We can't. Or we'll be doomed.

636
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,440
Well, you go contact the media.

637
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,270
At two this afternoon on the ground floor,

638
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,310
we'll hold a press conference.

639
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,750
Have the hall decorated.

640
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,440
I'll go keep Mr. Chen informed.

641
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,510
- OK.
- OK. We're on it.

642
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,430
Ms. Yuan,

643
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,960
Hanhai Xingchen's problem

644
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,240
is a great chance to take down Han Ting.

645
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,830
Whether we take action

646
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,110
depends on how they handle this problem.

647
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,960
If we take action now,
they'll easily get something on us.

648
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,040
There's no point.

649
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,750
Are you being soft?

650
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,640
You can't shrink at this moment.

651
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,270
Han Ting does

652
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,000
much tougher tricks.

653
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,720
We'll see.

654
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,720
This crisis

655
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,030
will easily get Dongyang involved.

656
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,790
It may also affect us.

657
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,430
That's right.

658
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,310
But if they handle it improperly...

659
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,840
Ms. Yuan,

660
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,790
you can do something

661
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,110
to take back Dongyang Medical.

662
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,190
Don't be scared.

663
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,350
I'll be waiting for you.

664
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,620
(Ji Xing, Vice President)

665
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,440
- They're here.
- Look.

666
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,720
There they are.

667
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,300
(Hanhai Xingchen Press Conference)

668
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,200
She doesn't look very well.

669
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,550
Hi, everybody.

670
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:24,950
I'm Ji Xing, vice president

671
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,150
of Hanhai Xingchen, Dongyi Medical.

672
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,510
Today, there's a video

673
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,590
circulating on social media.

674
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,760
Here, I assure you.

675
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,840
Our raw materials

676
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,110
are absolutely safe.

677
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,010
China has very strict

678
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:39,960
quality inspection process

679
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,050
for implantable medical devices.

680
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,920
All our products

681
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,590
are approved
by the Food and Drug Administration

682
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,510
and have the registration certificate.

683
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,920
There is absolutely no radiation problem.

684
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,760
What makes you think your products

685
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,150
have no radiation problem?

686
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,590
With a radioactive device inside the body,

687
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,400
the patient will be greatly harmed.

688
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,840
Does Hanhai Xingchen totally ignore

689
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,030
the lives of the patients?

690
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,280
Did you use some special methods

691
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,320
to pass the quality inspection?

692
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,150
Your products are widely available in surgery.

693
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,440
If there's really a problem,

694
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,360
what will you do?

695
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,150
As for the video circulating on social media,

696
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,360
what are you going to explain?

697
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,320
These reporters are ridiculous.

698
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,550
You aren't objective or neutral at all.

699
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,400
Before the investigation result comes out,

700
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,000
they blame Xing for everything.

701
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,710
Come on. Take it easy.

702
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,440
Ji Xing will handle it properly.

703
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,070
Don't worry.

704
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,000
This radioactivity detector

705
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,550
I am holding

706
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,400
is exactly the same

707
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,320
as that in the video.

708
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,230
This is the intervertebral cage

709
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,550
we have produced.

710
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,150
Exactly. It's over normal levels.

711
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,280
Even this one?

712
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,510
Still over normal levels.

713
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,550
May I borrow your notebook?

714
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:15,950
The detector problem.

715
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,510
As you can see,

716
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,070
a detector like this

717
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,510
can be tampered with.

718
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,800
Its test results aren't convincing.

719
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,960
But to reassure our patients,

720
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,630
on behalf of Hanhai Xingchen,
I hereby announce.

721
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,760
We will collect

722
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,070
some detectors from the public

723
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,400
to retest our products

724
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,030
and reveal the test results.

725
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,030
They sound really confident.

726
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,150
We'll see. It's just what she said.

727
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,070
Yeah. Let's wait and see.

728
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,440
Since you say there isn't a problem,

729
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,320
why will you take the trouble to retest them?

730
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,510
Are you feeling guilty?

731
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,110
Dongyang Medical's goal

732
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,590
is to give top priority

733
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,710
to every patient's interests.

734
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,320
When it comes to health,

735
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,800
we can't be too cautious.

736
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,840
When all our products are taken back,

737
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,070
I'll have a third-party institution

738
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:58,960
to do the test

739
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,400
and live stream the entire process.

740
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,590
Is there a problem with our products?

741
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,840
By then, you will

742
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,960
have your own judgment.

743
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,400
Won't you watch till the end?

744
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,510
This young lady

745
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,710
has expressed our attitude

746
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,110
very clearly.

747
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,710
Based on the evidence we have,

748
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,070
the publisher of the video

749
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:32,400
once faked a video and blackmailed someone.

750
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,670
My journalist friends,

751
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,840
if you're interested,

752
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,360
you can dig for hidden layers.

753
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,800
It will be a very good social subject.

754
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,960
I really hope

755
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,630
you will not exacerbate the public opinion

756
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,840
for the rumor monger.

757
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,360
We've called the police.

758
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,800
After a further investigation,

759
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,710
the result will come out.

760
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,230
Taking this opportunity,

761
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,070
I'd like to invite you guys.

762
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,630
When you have time, come to Dongyang Medical

763
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,550
and Hanhai Xingchen

764
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,590
to visit our R&D center

765
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,550
and production site.

766
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,070
You can get to know our strict demands

767
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,510
for all kinds of products up close.

768
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,590
If you're interested,

769
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,110
after the press conference is over,

770
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,230
you can contact the crew members beside me.

771
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,070
Let's go have a look.

772
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:11,910
Let's go together.

773
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,000
So, they're whitewashed?

774
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,280
Not really.

775
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,150
We misunderstood them.

776
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,320
My journalist friends, thank you

777
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,760
for coming here.

778
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,760
Please stay tuned

779
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,000
for the follow-up result.

780
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,280
Thanks.

781
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,360
Xing, you were so cool!

782
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,760
Super cool, Miss Ji!

783
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,360
Yeah, Miss Ji. Awesome!

784
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,510
Truly impressive, Miss Ji.

785
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,760
Stop.

786
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,470
Miss Ji,

787
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,630
this press conference

788
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,710
turned to be a great response.

789
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,590
It not only shows

790
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,550
the honesty of the two companies

791
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,280
but also has some media

792
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,320
give us free advertisement.

793
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,110
You flatter me, Mr. Chen.

794
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,880
Next, the work will be handed over

795
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,710
to the Sales Department and the PR Department.

796
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,440
The Sales Department will get back

797
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,030
all the products of the same batch

798
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,840
and pacify those patients
who have used these products.

799
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,510
Give them our guarantee of the follow-up work.

800
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,510
The PR Department will investigate

801
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,190
the Internet celebrity who posted the video.

802
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,630
Keep all the evidence.

803
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,110
Get a third-party institution for the test

804
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,920
and reveal the test results in real time.

805
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,510
Pay attention to public opinion.

806
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,590
OK. Get back to work, guys.

807
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,280
Mr. Chen, I have something urgent to do.

808
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,230
I have to go.

809
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,760
Do what you have to do.

810
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,150
I'll keep an eye on everything else.

811
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,550
Thanks.

812
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,280
Miss Ji.

813
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,640
How is he?

814
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,510
The surgery is successful.

815
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,390
That's great.

816
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,070
You're awake?

817
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,320
Shall I wipe you?

818
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,710
What's the rush?

819
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,230
You had to come back.

820
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,960
Come with me and you'll know.

821
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,760
Xiaomeng, isn't it inappropriate?

822
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,840
What's inappropriate?

823
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,230
It's still the day and I'm shy.

824
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,880
If you want it,

825
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,030
let's do it tonight.

826
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,960
If we don't do it now,

827
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,150
it'll be too late at night.

828
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,280
Got it.

829
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,720
Xiaomeng,

830
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,400
I didn't know you could be so forthright.

831
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,120
What are you doing?

832
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,030
What about you?

833
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,880
Oh, Xiaomeng.

834
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,320
So, you'll do the live streaming.

835
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,440
But it's not time yet.

836
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,840
Of course, I'll do the live streaming.

837
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,840
I must make hay while the sun shines.

838
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,150
Xing's press conference

839
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,230
has just been over.

840
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,840
The public opinion is the most fierce.

841
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,150
I must preview my live streaming.

842
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,190
When the volunteer of Xingchen

843
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,630
had a problem,

844
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,190
the public opinion was exactly the same.

845
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,840
Later, Xingchen turned it all around.

846
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,440
But some people have been slandering me.

847
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,550
When I watched Xing's press conference,

848
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,190
a great idea struck out of nowhere.

849
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,110
I can interview some volunteers

850
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,960
