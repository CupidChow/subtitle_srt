1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll go to the sky, I want to go to the ground

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sure I won't be afraid

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There's a future, I'm not afraid

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm not afraid of courage

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'll go to the sky, I want to go to the ground

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But I won't give up

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll always believe

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There's a miracle, even if I don't know

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll go to the sky

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll go to the sky, I want to go to the sky

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why are you here?

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Not bad, you've turned the situation into success

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But there are still many people scolding me

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then don't look

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How is it? Are you tired?

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm fine

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Take you to the mountains

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Where?

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To see the most beautiful night view in Xinjiang

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's go

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I used to work in Guanghua

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I felt this city is unfamiliar

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Without my place of life

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I worked so hard and so excellent

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
How could I not get what I wanted?

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I was not strong enough

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Later, I had a new city

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I was also in the business

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I finally could have a place in this city

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But today

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I feel this city is back to the place

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
A strange feeling

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Not because I'm not strong enough

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But because I'm stronger

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I realized what I got

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What I lost

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Today, I won a double-fledged battle

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
To be honest

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't care about Huang Weiwei's suffering

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He betrayed me

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
In his eyes, maybe I hurt him too

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I can't bear it anymore

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The only thing I feel sad about

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I can't find anything

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I can't find anything anymore

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Look at this road in front of you

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The people walking on it

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The people who meet you

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The things you've experienced

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's all because of you

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's useless to comfort others

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You need to feel all this

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Then you can go through it

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You must have experienced this for hundreds of times

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What feelings?

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If you have a good relationship, you will have a good life

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Forget about having a good relationship

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's just a type of attitude

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Life is like this

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You have a good life

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's easy to say that you are waiting to exchange

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But it's actually a trade

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What do you want to get?

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Which part of the eye do you want to exchange?

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You can see through it

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You just like it

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What's wrong?

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Nothing

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I just want to touch you

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Are you happy now?

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm happy now

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Because of you

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The sun Holds on

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
done

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Buying it all

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You are leaning on the anchor

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I heard that

93
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
there is no technology company

94
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
that can use Huang Weiwei.

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Han Yuan didn't plan to

96
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
pay him back.

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He completely

98
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
put himself in there.

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He chose to do it himself.

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He did it himself.

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I didn't expect that Ji Xing

102
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
is so stubborn.

103
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He's a fast learner.

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What do I want?

105
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You guessed it right.

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Han Yuan and Chang He

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
have been together long ago.

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Chang He has been together for a long time.

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's been three times in a month.

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Maybe he's afraid that he'll attract people to pay attention.

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The address is very secretive.

112
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The price list of the jewelry

113
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
that Dong Yi bought

114
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
is also written by Han Yuan

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
to be leaked to Chang He.

116
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
After the last meeting,

117
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
he has been investigating

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Dong Yi's relationship

119
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
with the outside world.

120
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Did he

121
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
guess your relationship

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
with Han Hai?

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Then you can't hide

124
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
the thing about investing in Han Hai.

125
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
If Ji Xing knows

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that Han Hai is your one-hand man,

127
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll find a suitable opportunity to tell him.

128
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
From now on,

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
he knows well

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
from others.

131
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll go.

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll...

133
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What's wrong?

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Why is it so sour?

135
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Son,

136
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
are you unhappy?

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No. It has nothing to do with you.

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Then you...

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Ms. Han,

140
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I have a friend.

141
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
When he confessed,

142
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
he sent a brother and sister card to each other.

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What do you think

144
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
he should do now?

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You can't be angry with him.

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You can't be jealous

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
about the change.

148
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What about you?

149
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I mean,

150
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
you can't

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
quit Tangguo with your friend.

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Do you know

153
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
when I was chasing your father,

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
if I knew the enemy,

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
how could you be so stupid?

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But I was afraid

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
that if I continued chasing him,

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
he would run away.

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm so bold.

160
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Do you know

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I've always thought

162
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
that Xiaoting

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and Ji Xing

164
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
were dating

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
when they were in college.

166
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Look at Xiaoting,

167
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
she ran into the palace.

168
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But you're still in the garden.

169
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You haven't even

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
prepared your posture

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
before you came here.

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
No, you have to hurry.

173
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I was chasing

174
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
your father

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
for the first time.

176
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yes.

177
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No, Ms. Han.

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I said it was my friend.

179
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It wasn't me.

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I know.

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It wasn't you, Mr. Tan Lu.

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Ms. Han,

183
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
you know everything.

184
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Who am I?

185
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I used your phone

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
that year

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
to give Mr. Xiaomeng

188
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
a gift.

189
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I knew it.

190
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You're his partner.

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Mr. Tan Lu.

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You said you'd give him

193
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
a gift

194
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
every day

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
in other live broadcasts.

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You helped him

197
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
to beat Mr. Xiaomeng.

198
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You want

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Mr. Xiaomeng

200
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
to accept you so quickly.

201
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Do you think it's possible?

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I know.

203
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Come on.

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Mr. Tan Lu.

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Ms. Han,

206
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
stop calling me like that.

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay, okay.

208
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Mr. Tan Lu.

209
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Lin Jia.

210
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Come on.

211
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Come on.

212
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Let's have a drink.

213
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Okay, okay.

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Let's have a drink.

215
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Next,

216
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
let's welcome the bride and groom

217
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
to exchange their wedding ceremony.

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Qiu Zi.

219
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Thank you.

220
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
In my life,

221
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
the most difficult

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and most important moment

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
is when you're with me.

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
In the future,

225
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
please let me be with you.

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'll also be with you

227
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
to enjoy our family well.

228
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Qiu Zi.

229
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Every day of my life,

230
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I love you.

231
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yichen,

232
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
from the day we were together,

233
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I've never changed

234
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
the person I want to be with.

235
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Two people, three meals,

236
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
is the life you want.

237
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And what I want is

238
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
to see you every day.

239
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This is the future I want the most.

240
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We just heard

241
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
the bride and groom

242
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
coming from the bottom of our hearts.

243
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I know

244
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
their life is actually very simple.

245
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's just a happy moment.

246
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's just a happy moment in the living room,

247
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
a fire in the kitchen,

248
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
a hug in the bedroom.

249
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Then,

250
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
let's wish the bride and groom

251
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
to continue to

252
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
carry out their love

253
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and happiness.

254
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Let's welcome the bride and groom

255
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
to exchange their wedding rings.

256
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Let's give them a round of applause and blessings, okay?

257
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We just witnessed

258
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
the happiest moment of the bride and groom.

259
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Next,

260
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
we'll be the bride and groom.

261
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Let's welcome the guests

262
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
to come to our stage

263
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
to welcome the bride and groom

264
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
who are in charge of the wedding.

265
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Come, please.

266
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Let's go.

267
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Let's welcome the bride and groom

268
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
to come to the stage.

269
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Go.

270
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Okay.

271
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Let's go.

272
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Let's count down to 13 seconds.

273
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Ready,

274
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
three,

275
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
two,

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
one.

277
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This way.

278
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Great.

279
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Congratulations.

280
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Congratulations.

281
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Congratulations.

282
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You're so happy.

283
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The bride and groom will receive

284
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
the happiness and happiness you have.

285
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Next,

286
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
we'll be the guests

287
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
of the wedding.

288
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's welcome the guests

289
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
to take a happy photo

290
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
of the bride and groom

291
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
following the order

292
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and the bride and groom.

293
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Let's go.

294
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Go.

295
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I just realized

296
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
that the wedding is so romantic.

297
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Light,

298
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
atmosphere,

299
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
flowers,

300
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
music,

301
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
this scene is so romantic,

302
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
the emotions are natural,

303
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and the people are so beautiful.

304
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I got the flower.

305
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
How do I look

306
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
like the bride and groom

307
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
who left it for you?

308
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I got it, too.

309
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm so happy.

310
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You got it?

311
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The flower has to be

312
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
printed with its meaning.

313
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What kind of wedding do you want?

314
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
A wedding of a church

315
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
or a sea wedding.

316
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Actually,

317
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I think

318
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
the wedding of a trip is good.

319
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yiling.

320
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yiling,

321
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I won't return it.

322
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You know my situation very well.

323
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I can be very good to you

324
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
for the rest of my life.

325
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But I really don't want to

326
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
enter another wedding.

327
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But I promise

328
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
everything else you want

329
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
will be as good as I can.

330
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What can you give me?

331
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
A companion for the unruly?

332
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Or a lifetime of being in the same room?

333
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You can't even give me a marriage certificate.

334
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What's the use of

335
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
asking for your promise?

336
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Forget it.

337
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's not hard for me, either.

338
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Just do it.

339
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Go.

340
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Why didn't you go to grab the flowers just now?

341
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Flowers are like love and beauty.

342
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I have everything.

343
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Why would I grab them?

344
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,920
You can answer this question

345
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,400
and register for the textbook.

346
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,320
I'm so serious.

347
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,120
Don't you think

348
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,320
I'm still feeling sad?

349
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,760
No.

350
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,040
I'm worried that you'll be in a serious situation.

351
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,840
There's a saying that

352
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,360
only those who are right

353
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,000
can meet the right person.

354
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,400
So,

355
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,040
I'm the right person.

356
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,400
What do you think?

357
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,400
Many people are looking for

358
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,200
something that can make themselves happy

359
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,880
and be with you.

360
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,280
My heart is beating faster.

361
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
I want to be with you for the rest of my life.

362
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,920
Are you going to propose to me now?

363
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,760
What are you thinking about?

364
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,360
I don't want our proposal anniversary

365
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,920
to be their wedding anniversary.

366
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,440
Can you

367
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,240
know when can I propose to you?

368
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,640
If you want

369
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,320
you can make it here right now.

370
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
Ji Xun,

371
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,800
Do you want to

372
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,920
go home by car?

373
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,520
This idiot!

374
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,640
I'll go home by car.

375
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,040
I am so happy to see you.

376
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,560
Are you kidding?

377
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,720
Are you leaving?

378
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,960
Do you want to ride a car?

379
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,920
I want to ride a three-wheeled bike.

380
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,360
Now you see

381
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,600
my friend,

382
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,760
Miss Weiqiu Zi

383
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,880
and Mr. Shao Yicheng's wedding.

384
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,920
The little accessories

385
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,280
are full of elegance.

386
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,520
This is my friend.

387
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,360
Do you like it?

388
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,640
Hello?

389
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:47,880
Xiaomeng,

390
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,920
come and have a drink with me.

391
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,200
I am busy.

392
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,800
I am not going.

393
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,000
Didn't you say you like Uncle?

394
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,440
I invited him to the wedding.

395
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,360
Here he comes.

396
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,360
Hurry up.

397
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,280
I...

398
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,880
It's true.

399
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,520
It's really Uncle.

400
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,640
How is it?

401
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,440
It's good.

402
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
I know you like Uncle.

403
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,760
I invited him here.

404
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,000
Don't talk.

405
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:21,960
Listen to me.

406
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,320
It's the first time I see him.

407
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,960
Why is he even more handsome than TV?

408
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,200
I don't think so.

409
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,760
Don't talk.

410
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,640
Don't talk.

411
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,040
Is it okay for you

412
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,320
to say you like him?

413
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,760
Do you think

414
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,840
I can go find Uncle

415
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,840
and have a drink with him?

416
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,760
No need.

417
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,720
Mr. Uncle.

418
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,880
Can I have a drink with you?

419
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,520
Sure.

420
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,880
Sit down.

421
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,000
Take a picture.

422
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
Mr. Uncle.

423
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,920
The market is almost done.

424
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,600
Thank you.

425
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,080
I'll contact you if I have something.

426
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,680
Okay.

427
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,120
Thank you.

428
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,240
Su Linjian.

429
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,880
Did you take a picture?

430
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,560
Yes.

431
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,720
So,

432
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,480
you're taking a selfie

433
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
with me and the idol He Ying.

434
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,880
You're taking three people.

435
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,200
Isn't he inside?

436
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,680
He's out of his mind.

437
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,360
There's still a chance.

438
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:20,880
I...

439
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,440
Let me ask you.

440
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,840
Do you like Uncle?

441
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,560
What are you talking about?

442
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,320
I just want to make him happy.

443
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,640
Let me ask you.

444
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,960
What kind of character do you like?

445
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,760
Why did you send me a card last time?

446
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,960
Why do you like him so much?

447
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,400
You asked me all the time.

448
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,680
You liked white blood yesterday.

449
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,640
You like black blood tomorrow.

450
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,720
You're so mean.

451
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,960
Why do you always mention white blood?

452
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,680
Let me ask you.

453
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,800
Do I have a chance?

454
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,800
Of course not.

455
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,200
Xiaomeng.

456
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,800
Xiaomeng.

457
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,840
Where are you going?

458
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,040
To find Uncle.

459
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,040
I need time to prove myself.

460
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,080
I'm going to find Uncle.

461
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,080
I'm going to find Uncle.

462
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,080
I'm going to find Uncle.

463
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

464
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

465
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

466
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

467
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

468
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

469
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

470
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

471
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

472
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

473
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

474
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

475
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

476
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

477
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

478
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

479
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

480
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

481
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

482
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

483
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
I'm going to find Uncle.

484
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,660
You need to Goodnight.

485
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,080
What?

486
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,160
You could die of something.

487
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,320
Come on.

488
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,120
What's with that minute?

489
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,340
Three cycle hop,

490
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,420
Four cycle hop.

491
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,920
Six cycle hop.

492
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,340
Why did you come home so late?

493
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,880
You also drank so much wine.

494
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,920
Li Li.

495
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,220
Sorry.

496
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
I apologize to you.

497
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Are you not afraid of being alone

498
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
or not willing to be alone?

499
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
Don't be angry, Li Lian.

500
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
You really care about me.

501
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
Do you know

502
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
every time I feel sad because of you,

503
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
I feel even more sad than you?

504
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
I haven't felt this for a long time.

505
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
I'm sorry.

506
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Although I can't give you a home,

507
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
but I don't have a ring

508
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
which means I love you.

509
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,120
Don't leave me, okay?

510
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
Xiaoxiao,

511
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
let's break up.

512
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
Why do you have to

513
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
make a engagement

514
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
through marriage?

515
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
I'm sorry.

516
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Mr. Yuan,

517
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
the innovation technology

518
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
is about to be developed.

519
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
Don't you plan to

520
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
continue to let Han Ting go?

521
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
It's raining in the sky.

522
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
Many things can't be stopped.

523
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
What's the rush?

524
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
I'm not going to let you go.

525
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
I'm not going to let you go.

526
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
I'm not going to let you go.

527
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
I'm not going to let you go.

528
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
I'm not going to let you go.

529
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
I'm not going to let you go.

530
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
Han Ting is such a good match.

531
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,120
She always thinks about her husband.

532
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,120
I'm not in a hurry.

533
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
Mr. Zhou,

534
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
you're too exaggerated.

535
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
Even if Xing Chen succeeds,

536
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
Han Ting can't complete

537
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
the military command post

538
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,120
of the Gu family.

539
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
But I think

540
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,120
it's not that simple

541
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
for Han Ting to make the military command post.

542
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
When she returned from Germany,

543
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
she was confident.

544
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
She was confident

545
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,120
that she would be able to invest in the army.

546
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
Do you think

547
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,120
she would have any other

548
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,120
steps before she returned to the country?

549
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Mr. Yuan, Mr. Zhou,

550
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
I heard that the former

551
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
Chief of the Ministry of Finance, Yang Qiong,

552
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
was taken to the Eastern Yangtze River

553
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
and has been disliked.

554
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
She thinks that

555
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
the position of Luo Ping is

556
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,120
the same as that of Mr. Han.

557
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
I think we can

558
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,120
ask her about it.

559
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
We don't know the information.

560
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
Then let's start from the Western Yangtze River.

561
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,120
I see.

562
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Mr. Han.

563
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
Sit down.

564
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Tell me.

565
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
What's the matter?

566
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Mr. Han,

567
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
the matter about the Xianfeng project

568
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,120
is my personal report.

569
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
I really don't know

570
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
how to squeeze Xing Chen's name.

571
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
I'm really sorry.

572
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
I'm really sorry.

573
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
You're looking for me to do this?

574
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
I'm a person of a company.

575
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
But I believe in Mr. Han.

576
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
The relationship between Han Hai and Xing Chen

577
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,120
is a competition.

578
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
Even if Mr. Chen

579
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,120
takes the name of the evil person,

580
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
it's not normal

581
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
to do it on the market.

582
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,120
I'm afraid that

583
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,120
Mr. Ji would misunderstand.

584
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,120
What are you afraid of?

585
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
With Mr. Ji's relationship with you,

586
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
I'm afraid that

587
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,120
I'll offend the wife of the boss.

588
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,120
Mr. Han,

589
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
did I say something wrong?

590
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
Nothing.

591
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
I just wanted to check.

592
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
You're a person who's pursuing

593
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
the dream of technology.

594
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
You'll be forced to do it

595
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
before and after.

596
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
Have some tea.

597
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
Okay.

598
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
Mr. Han,

599
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
I heard that

600
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
Xing Chen is planning to have

601
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,120
a profit of A-Lun.

602
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Yes.

603
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
Mr. Han,

604
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,120
don't blame me for being too mean.

605
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Xing Chen and Han Hai's competition

606
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
is just a beginning

607
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
for the first-class project.

608
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
I'm worried that

609
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,120
more and more things will happen in the future.

610
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
It's not convenient

611
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,120
for you to announce

612
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
your relationship with Han Hai.

613
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
Mr. Ji is your girlfriend.

614
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,120
I'm not good at

615
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,120
talking about it.

616
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
You mentioned

617
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,120
that Jiang Han Hai and Xing Chen are ill.

618
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,120
If you continue to do this project,

619
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,120
what will you do?

620
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
That's great.

621
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,120
But it's not a problem.

622
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
It's a good opportunity.

623
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,120
To maintain the full face of Han Hai,

624
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,120
you need to maintain Xing Chen's creativity.

625
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
Think about it and answer me.

626
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
Don't think about it.

627
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
No problem.

628
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
I'll make a peace plan for you

629
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
when I get back.

630
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
Okay.

631
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
I'll do it now.

632
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Xing Chen.

633
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Did you see that?

634
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
The first-class project

635
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
has been signed by Han Hai.

636
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
Yichen told me.

637
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
No.

638
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
The first-class project

639
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
has passed.

640
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
Sit down.

641
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
Although it's passed,

642
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
Han Hai also reported

643
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,120
the last moment he was reported.

644
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
He also got this name.

645
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
Then,

646
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,120
do we still have a chance to fight for it?

647
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
No.

648
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
What's the reason for

649
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
them to crush us?

650
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Han Hai's popularity is bigger than ours.

651
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,120
This is normal.

652
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,120
But,

653
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,120
at the beginning,

654
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,120
we just gave him the name.

655
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
Why did we even sign it?

656
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,120
Besides,

657
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,120
the first-class project

658
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,120
is not for the middle-class enterprises.

659
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
Change the angle.

660
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,120
Does this also prove

661
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,120
that Xing Chen is getting better and better?

662
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
Han Hai

663
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
has taken us as competitors.

664
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
Come in.

665
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
Mr. Ji.

666
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
Mr. Chang from Tong Ke is here.

667
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,120
I'll let him wait for you in the meeting room.

668
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
Okay.

669
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,120
Mr. Ji.

670
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Mr. Chang,

671
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
why are you here?

672
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
I knew it when I saw you.

673
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,120
I'll go over first.

674
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
Okay.

675
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
Mr. Ji,

676
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,120
you suddenly came to the meeting room

677
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
to avoid the case of your work, right?

678
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,120
No.

679
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,120
Mr. Chang came to

680
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
the meeting room.

681
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
Before the meeting,

682
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,120
I had a good time with you.

683
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
Last time,

684
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
I met you and Mr. Han

685
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,120
in the office.

686
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
I was happy

687
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
and drank a few more drinks.

688
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,120
I only knew

689
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,120
that Mr. Han was too stubborn.

690
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
If you don't say it,

691
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
I'll forget it.

692
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,120
We're not like each other.

693
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
Mr. Ji.

694
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,120
You know my purpose

695
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,120
for coming to Xing Chen, right?

696
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
Will Tong Ke

697
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,120
have a chance

698
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,120
to be our A-Long-Long-Z?

699
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
You think I want

700
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,120
to invest Xing Chen's money,

701
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
so I want to

702
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
make a new production model

703
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
in order for Tong Ke to cooperate.

704
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
In the end,

705
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
it's for the development

706
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
and the profit.

707
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
Mr. Chang makes sense.

708
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,120
But

709
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,120
Xing Chen will be

710
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
the supervisor

711
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
of Mr. Han

712
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
for every important decision.

713
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,120
It's okay.

714
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
I, the investment Xing Chen,

715
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
don't want to take Dong Yi to the company.

716
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
I don't mind

717
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,120
working with him.

718
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
And I thought

719
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
you and Mr. Han

720
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,120
would separate the business and the relationship.

721
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,120
I and Dong Yi compete

722
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,120
for the two-line business.

723
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,120
As a businessman,

724
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,120
the first one

725
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,120
is the most important thing.

726
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,120
It's a bit hard to understand

727
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,120
how things are

728
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,120
going to change in relationships.

729
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,120
I know many women

730
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,120
who sacrificed their interests

731
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
for their relationship

732
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,120
and hurt themselves.

733
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
But

734
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,120
there are many women

735
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,120
who can take good care of them.

736
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
You should know that.

737
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,120
I understand.

738
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Of course, I want to take the most interest.

739
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
But

740
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
whether it's Mr. Han

741
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,120
or the other investors,

742
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,120
maybe they can give me

743
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
a higher interest than the same customer.

744
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120
Of course,

745
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,120
it's possible

746
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,120
that they will be in the same business

747
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,120
with the same customer.

748
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,120
I have to talk slowly.

749
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,120
If the other investors

750
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,120
are more competitive than me,

751
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,120
I will trust Han Ting.

752
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,120
I will give you the title

753
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,120
of shares distribution.

754
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
The stars are still in the sky.

755
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
He will give you the title

756
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
of shares distribution.

757
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,120
The stars are still in the sky.

758
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
To be honest,

759
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,120
I think the most suitable

760
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
for the A-Learned title of stars is

761
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,120
Zhong Li's third party.

762
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,120
Okay.

763
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,120
Let's talk about it later.

764
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
But

765
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,120
I still hope that Mr. Qi

766
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,120
can seriously consider it.

767
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
Let's see

768
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,120
if it's the conditions

769
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
that Tong Ge gave us

770
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,120
or the conditions that the others gave us.

771
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
Okay.

772
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,120
Sister Li.

773
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,120
What can I do for you?

774
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,120
Do you have time?

775
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,120
I want to ask you to watch a movie.

776
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,120
Why do you suddenly want to

777
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,120
watch a movie?

778
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,120
I heard that

779
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,120
the new drama is very good.

780
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,120
I think

781
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
you will be better

782
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,120
in the future.

783
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
I'll go to the movie.

784
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,120
I'll go to the movie.

785
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,120
Okay.

786
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
I'll go to work.

787
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
See you at work.

788
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,120
Hello.

789
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,120
I want to see Mr. Zeng.

790
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,120
Okay. Please come with me.

791
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Mr. Zeng,

792
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,120
there's a guest.

793
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,120
Come in.

794
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,120
You look so beautiful.

795
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
Mr. Chang.

796
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,120
Why are you here?

797
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,120
This is Dongyang Building.

798
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,120
It's the first time I come here.

799
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,120
You don't want me to sit here?

800
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,120
Isn't this your floor?

801
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,120
How dare I?

802
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
I just sent you a message.

803
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,120
I can't go back.

804
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,120
I just came to the room.

805
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,120
I didn't watch the phone

806
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
when I was dealing with the contract.

807
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,120
This is...

808
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
I asked people to choose

809
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
some office locations for you.

810
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,120
If you're satisfied with it,

811
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
I'll go to you.

812
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,120
You want me to move out of here?

813
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
Why?

814
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
I haven't got out of this breath yet.

815
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,120
Leave me

816
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,120
when you're out of breath.

817
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
I just got out of the Starry Sky.

818
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
I'm not going to leave.

819
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
I'm going to go to the movie.

820
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
I'll be out of the movie.

821
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,120
Starry Sky?

822
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,120
Why are you going there?

823
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,120
I'm looking for a reporter.

824
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,120
I can talk about

825
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,120
the matter of the company.

826
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,120
Is this the way you vent for me?

827
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,120
I'm not satisfied.

828
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,120
Unless the reporter

829
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,120
and Han Ting are in a relationship,

830
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,120
my reporter won't agree.

831
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,120
There's no absolute thing.

832
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,120
I can always find

833
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,120
the way I want.

834
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,120
Okay.

835
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,120
I'll go there now.

836
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,120
Sister Li,

837
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,120
the coffee is ready.

838
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,120
I have something to do.

839
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
Sorry.

840
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,120
I'll see you next time.

841
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
Is it Xiao Yu Xiao?

842
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

843
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

844
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

845
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

846
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

847
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

848
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

849
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

850
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

851
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

852
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

853
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

854
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

855
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

856
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

857
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

858
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

859
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

860
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

861
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

862
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

863
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

864
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

865
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

866
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

867
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

868
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

869
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

870
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,120
This gentleman is drunk.

871
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,120
Because he is our boss's friend,

872
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,120
we dare not touch him.

873
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,120
You are the emergency contact of his phone.

874
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,120
We can only find you.

875
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,120
Thank you.

876
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,120
I got it.

877
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

878
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

879
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,120
Wake up.

880
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,120
You are here.

881
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,120
I'm here to see you.

882
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,120
I'll take you back.

883
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,120
Where are you going?

884
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,120
Your home.

885
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,120
Or my home?

886
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,120
Xiao Yu Xiao.

887
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,120
Since you can't give me what I want,

888
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,120
don't go back to the factory.

889
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,120
We have already ended it.

890
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,120
Then why are you here?

891
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,120
Li Li.

892
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,120
Let's get along.

893
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,120
Okay.

894
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,120
Really?

895
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,120
Go to the doctor tomorrow.

896
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,120
I've called you, everyone.

897
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,120
Go back by yourself.

898
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,120
Xiao Zhou.

899
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,120
Why are you calling me so urgently?

900
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,120
What happened?

901
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,120
Mr. Su.

902
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,120
I wanted to add a class

903
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,120
and organize the report.

904
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,120
But the computer suddenly turned black.

905
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,120
I was restarting.

906
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,120
The information was missing.

907
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,120
Don't panic.

908
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,120
Let me see.

909
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,120
It should be solved.

910
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,120
I'm sorry, Mr. Su.

911
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,120
I wanted to find the company's website.

912
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,120
But they are off work.

913
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,120
So I can only call you.

914
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,120
It's okay.

915
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,120
I have time.

916
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,120
Okay.

917
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
Thank you, Mr. Su.

918
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,120
You helped me a lot.

919
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,120
If there's nothing else,

920
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
I'll leave now.

921
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,120
Mr. Su.

922
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,120
Anything else?

923
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,120
I like you.

924
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,120
I know you like Mr. Li.

925
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,120
So I just want to tell you my heart.

926
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,120
After I got into the company,

927
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,120
you helped me a lot.

928
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,120
From then on,

929
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,120
I liked you.

930
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,120
You are the vice president of the company.

931
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
You don't lack any skills.

932
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,120
You are very serious

933
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,120
when you work.

934
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:12,120
I hope you can think about it.

935
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,120
I'm sorry.

936
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:14,120
If you can get closer to me,

937
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:21,120
can you remember the beginning and end of the memory?

938
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,120
Time goes by so fast.

939
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,120
Let the lonely and unwavering be safe.

940
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:36,120
Don't let the understanding become a adventure.

941
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,120
Our time is short.

942
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,120
We can't afford to be afraid of being pushed back.

943
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:52,120
Love is always afraid.

944
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:59,120
Let each other be fresh and happy.

945
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:05,120
We can't be strangers.

946
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:10,120
We can't leave.

947
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:17,120
Let's leave this chance to you.

948
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,120
Don't be afraid.

949
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:23,120
You have to be brave.

950
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,120
I'm afraid that

951
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:32,120
love will become a mess.

952
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:36,120
I'm afraid that
