Xing, where are you?

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,480
Why haven't you come to work yet?

25
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,870
Hello.

26
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,520
(Ji Xing)
I...

27
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,840
(Ji Xing)
I'll be right there.

28
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,800
(Tu Xiaomeng)
Xing, where are you?

29
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,840
Xing, take some good rest at your friend's.

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,150
Go to bed early.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,240
OK. Say it, please.

32
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,360
What?

33
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,910
I know.

34
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,310
Go on.

35
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,080
OK. I get it.

36
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,710
Miss Ji?

37
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,150
I'm in a hurry.

38
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,800
I know.

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,750
OK. I get it.

40
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,200
Boss.

41
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,310
Miss Ji opened the door for me.

42
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,270
She has left

43
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,360
in such a hurry.

44
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,680
Looks like she has some emergency.

45
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,360
Here's this month's sales report

46
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,070
of Dongyang Medical's products you asked for.

47
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,560
The price of old products

48
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,510
can go down by 5%.

49
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,120
Clear out our inventory quickly.

50
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,430
For the next batch of new products,

51
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,680
bring the price up by 10%.

52
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,240
If the price goes up,

53
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,310
will...?

54
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,870
With excellent quality,

55
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,360
some people will buy it.

56
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,440
I get it.

57
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,620
(Xing)

58
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,720
(Xingchen Technology)
Remember

59
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,830
to have this file delivered.

60
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,880
OK.

61
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,000
Miss Ji.

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,950
- Morning.
- Xing.

63
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,030
Morning.

64
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,350
Be honest.

65
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,630
Where were you last night?

66
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,190
Coming to work with an unchanged outfit?

67
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,720
I...

68
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,160
I was at a friend's.

69
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,160
Friend? Which friend?

70
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,040
Do I know this friend?

71
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,560
Is it a man or a woman?

72
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,870
In Xinggang, you even have

73
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,390
a closer friend than Xiaomeng and me?

74
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,070
I'll be jealous.

75
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,870
Last night, I was with Han Ting.

76
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,360
This is good.

77
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,390
Why are you shy?

78
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,600
When will you have Mr. Han

79
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,160
invite us to dinner?

80
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,680
What relationship do you think

81
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,630
he and I are in?

82
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,800
Love relationship.

83
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,160
But he hasn't said he loves me.

84
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,430
You think you're still in college?

85
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,680
Does he have to play the guitar downstairs,

86
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,310
put a ring of heart-shaped candles,

87
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,360
and yell "I love you"?

88
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,630
I could tell he had feelings
for you a long time ago.

89
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,680
I didn't know he could hold it until now.

90
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,670
What's wrong?

91
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,480
What are you worried about?

92
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,000
I still think it happened too fast.

93
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,040
Don't rush, then.

94
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,430
Take your time.

95
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,240
Business isn't busy lately.

96
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,750
Go on a vacation and think about it.

97
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,510
Before that,

98
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,600
you have to sign this contract.

99
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,670
I should go.

100
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,000
Mr. Han.

101
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,190
Are you here for Xing? She has just left.

102
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,030
Left?

103
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,840
Where has she gone?

104
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,000
For some business,
she went back to her hometown

105
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,150
on annual leave.

106
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,320
If you want something, tell me.

107
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,200
I'll get the message to her.

108
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,320
No need.

109
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,390
I'll talk to her when she's back.

110
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,240
Goodbye, Mr. Han.

111
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,350
Let me guess.

112
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,240
Mr. Han, you want me at this moment

113
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,790
for emotional issues, huh?

114
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,630
Don't you think

115
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,840
it's really hard to guess

116
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,000
what some girl thinks?

117
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,960
Some girl? You just mean Ji Xing.

118
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,670
After I left last night,

119
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,390
what happened between you?

120
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,000
She's avoiding me.

121
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,350
Worse still,

122
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,240
she went back to her hometown on annual leave.

123
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,360
Mr. Han, she isn't avoiding you.

124
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,030
She's just being shy.

125
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
When a pure girl like Ji Xing

126
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,750
had intimacy with you,

127
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,120
she'd be shy.

128
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,150
You should give her some space.

129
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,360
Try to get her slowly but surely.

130
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,120
So, when I watch romantic dramas,

131
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,870
I can really learn something.

132
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,510
Kitties,

133
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,840
eat slowly.

134
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,080
Be patient.

135
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,560
(Han Ting)
Bon voyage.

136
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,270
You freaked me out.

137
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,670
Aren't you supposed to arrive tonight?

138
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,870
I want to give you a surprise.

139
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,360
What? You're on annual leave?

140
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,790
Such a good job.

141
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,380
(Han Ting: Bon voyage.)

142
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,120
Xing, stop checking your phone.

143
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,030
Come have lunch.

144
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,000
Hurry. Come have lunch.

145
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,000
Xing, work is always endless.

146
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,230
Be right there.

147
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,720
Don't let your father down.

148
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,790
He was cooking for a few hours

149
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,750
without leaving the kitchen.

150
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,360
My favorite beef balls.

151
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,550
The steamed fish head with chopped chili.

152
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,000
Such a big dish. Great.

153
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,790
Shall I drink with you, Dad?

154
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,240
- Come on.

I think I've been improving quite a lot.

Yeah. Come on, Miss Xiaomeng.

180
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,630
Have some water.

181
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,720
Oh, look. I have this, too.

182
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,000
An honor certificate. Look, son.

Besides the certificate

186
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,270
and the sparkling water,

187
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,110
nothing else?

188
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,910

If you don't like it, don't drink it.

190
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,270
Miss Xiaomeng, seriously.

191
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,270
I have to thank you so much.

192
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,080
You've taught me so well.

193
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,270
Or how could I possibly

194
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,670
win this award?

195
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,710
You flatter me.

196
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,390
If someone can marry you...

197
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,630
He'll be really lucky.

198
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,630
Ms. Han,

199
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,630
you're making me shy.

200
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,910
Don't be shy.

201
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,030
This is the truth.

202
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,120
It's getting late.

203
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,790
I should go home, Ms. Han.

204
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,000
It's late, indeed.

205
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,390
It's not safe for you to go alone.

206
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,670
- Linjia...
- I'll drive you.

207
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,870
OK.

208
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,270
No need. It's OK.

209
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,030
Don't bother. It's done.

210
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,150
(I still think it happened too fast.)

211
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,790
(Don't rush, then. Take your time.)

212
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,510
(When a pure girl like Ji Xing)

213
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,720
had intimacy with you,

214
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,080
she'd be shy.

215
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,870
You should give her some space.

216
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,390
(Try to get her slowly but surely.)

217
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,590
What are you doing?

218
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,550
You're laughing so much.

219
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,550
Not as much as you.

220
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,870
I'm not.

221
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,070
Look in the mirror.

222
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,310
Look what a big smile

223
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,480
you're wearing.

224
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,190
I'm not.

225
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,240
I really didn't expect this.

226
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,680
My fearless son

227
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,680
would be flushed someday.

228
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
What are you talking about?

229
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,480
Son, I'm serious.

230
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,030
I support you.

231
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,790
I want you to enjoy a relationship

232
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,160
and get married early.

233

234
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,750
Yes. I get it.

Let me show you.

236

Look at the photos.

237
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,820
(She sings beautifully. Confident lady.
She's so charming.)

238
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,350
Son, look at my photos.

239
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,960
Whose message are you reading?

240
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,000
You're lost in it.

241
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,150
Xiaomeng's?

242
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,840
Mom.

243
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,830
What happened to Xiaomeng?

244
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,160
You went viral.

245
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,750
I went viral? Come on.

246
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,480
What do you mean?

247
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,640
How did I go viral?

248
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,550
Come check out this video.

249
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,480

251
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,720
What?

252
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,070
Look.

253
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,440
All the comments

254
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,680
are praising your mother for her singing.

255
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,310
Mom, you've really gone viral.

256
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,960
My bar gets popular, too.

257
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,800
Really?

258
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,040
Today, my bartender told me.

259
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,070
Really a lot of people came today

260
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,270
because they watched the video

261
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,750
and they came for you.

262
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,190
Really?

263
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,430
Son,

264
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,640
I really didn't know

265
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,400
I could help you like this.

266
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,240
Now, I'm an Internet celebrity.

267
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,240
So...

268
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,480
I've made a decision.

269
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,110
What decision?

270
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,750
I'll buy into your bar.

271
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,070
I'll invest in it.

272
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,350
You will?

273
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,350
Yes, of course.

274
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,400
Thank you, Mom.

275
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,350
In this case,

276
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,750

279
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,080
for your dividends.

280
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,480
No. I want more than that.

281
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,920
Since I buy into your bar

282
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,160
as the second largest shareholder,

283
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,310
I'll regularly

284
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,070
visit your bar and sing

285
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,110
to attract more people

286
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,240

Yes.

Stop it. Stop.

290
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,590
I need to learn more songs.

291
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,790
I... I'll go practicing singing.

292
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,200
I need new songs.

293
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,590
I can't always sing Jasmine.

294
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,070
What shall I sing?

295
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,640
No, this isn't inappropriate.

- Miss Ji, Dr. Shao.
- Sit down. Hurry.

310
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,000
I told you many times.

311
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,960
You must rest and not move too much.

312
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,960
You have to listen to the doctor

313
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,200
so that you can recover soon.

Hi, Miss Ji and Dr. Shao.

Don't worry. The surgery was successful.

322

When you're invited,

it means Xingchen has made its presence

Yes.

is there anything

397
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,390
we need to modify?

398
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,590
No. This plan is clear.

399
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,200
From product research to market positioning,

400
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,590
everything is well planned.

When you give a speech,

When I first started my company, I had nothing.

I tried to get financing with one mere idea.

505
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,680
I guess I misunderstood

506
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,640
the definition of "angel investor".

507
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,880
I thought all investors were angles.

508

Indeed. She's intelligent.

566
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,400
She advertises her company with herself.

567
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,150
Young guys are awesome.

568
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,590
What do you think of your speech?

569
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,360
I feel good.

570
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,880
What do you think it is?

571
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,320
Excellent.

572
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,160
Oh.

573
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,880
After checking our strategy plan,

574
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,280
do you have any advice?

575
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,550
Didn't Su Zhizhou tell you?

576
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,200
He did.

577
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,800
I just want to confirm.

578
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,800
Then report to me personally next time.

579
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,030
The positioning is set.

580
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,920
Next, you should focus on the human problem.

581
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,670
It's the end of the year.

582
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,840
Bonus, promotion,

583
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,960
and other money-related problems

584
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,030
should be aboveboard.

585
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,360
Focus more on that.

586
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,190
I'll take care of that.

587
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,760
There you are, Mr. Han.

588
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,920
- Mr. Han.
- Mr. Han.

589
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,960
- Mr. Han.
- Hi, Mr. Han.

590
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,630
- Sit, please.
- Sorry to have kept you waiting.

591
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,800
Be seated.

592
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,030
Mr. Han,

593
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,230
the dishes are getting cold.

594
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,880
Mr. Han, tonight,

595
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,800
let's have a good drink.

596
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,070
I have something else to do.

597
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,760
Drinking tea instead,

598
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,960
I'd like to propose a toast.

599
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,360
Come on. Cheers.

600
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,030
Since Mr. Han is here,

601
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,630
let's start to eat and talk.

602
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,150
Mr. Han, I heard Dongyang Medical

603
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,800
had a new contract with Xinggang Hospital

604
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,230
for two years' procurement

605
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,320
and the price went down by 5%.

606
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,000
Tell us more about it.

607
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,480
Is it exclusive to this contract?

608
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,800
Or is it the same price

609
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,030
for every other partner?

610
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,800
It's the same.

611
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,800
The price of all old products goes down.

612
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,400
Even Dongyang Medical has to stay competitive

613
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,800
by reducing the price.

614
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,030
Looks like small companies like us

615
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,400
will have no choice.

616
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,590
In the last five years,
we've never reduced the price.

617
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,590
Now, the process is better

618
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,710
and the cost is lower.

619
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,480
The reduced price of old products

620
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,000
will be a reward for our partners.

621
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:18,910
Besides,

622
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,280
the market share is equal,

623
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,800
even if it's very little.

624
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,070
Previously, my company didn't want it.

625
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,000
But I want more shares.

626
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,760
So, I'd like to learn from you

627
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,230
about how to reduce the price.

628
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,670
Being fussy about it will hurt our harmony.

629
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,030
Instead of having a lose-lose game,

630
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,280
why don't we have a win-win cooperation?

631
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,550
You have big-picture thinking,
Mr. Han and Mr. Chang.

632
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,480
Come on. A toast to the two of you.

633
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,280
Cheers, Mr. Han.

634
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,840
Cheers.

635
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,280
Hello, everyone. I'm Xia Lu.

636
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,550
I'm honored to attend this forum

637
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,070
and get some guidance from you.

638
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,000
I'll drink it up first.

639
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,480
Xia Lu is from Gangxing Technology.

640
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,190
A company I invested in.

641
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,190
Please help her as much as you can.

642
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:31,990
Xia Lu.

643
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,440
These are big shots of our industry.

644
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,670
Proposal a toast to them one after another.

645
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,280
Have a good drink with them.

646
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,480
Then they can help you, huh?

647
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,360
OK. A toast to you, Mr. Han.

648
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,150
I'd appreciate your help.

649
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,120
Thanks.

650
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,760
You must be Miss Ji

651
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,320
from Xingchen Technology.

652
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,470
I'm Ji Xing.

653
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,360
Do you not drink, either?

654
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,510
Come on.

655
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,510
Come on, Miss Ji.

656
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,440
I don't usually drink spirit.

657
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,630
There's red wine. Here.

658
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,670
Here, Miss Ji.

659
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,590
I'll drink it up.

660
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,590
In this case,

661
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,760
I'd like to propose a toast.

662
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,230
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

663
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,360
Miss Ji, you can't drink with all of us

664
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,190
with only one glass of wine.

665
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,960
We're OK with it.

666
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,800
But Mr. Chang is a big shot.

667
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,880
Show some respect and drink with him alone.
