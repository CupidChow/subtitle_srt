1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,680
I will go to the sky to reach the ground

2
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,640
I will never hesitate to face the future

3
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,120
I am not afraid of the courage

4
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,360
So I will go to the sky to reach the ground

5
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,960
But I will never give up

6
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,240
I will always believe in miracles

7
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,320
Even if I have no hope

8
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,240
Meet Qiqi

9
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,480
Love True Choices

10
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,000
SK2 brings you to the right content

11
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,040
Hello, everyone.

12
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,680
First of all, let me introduce myself.

13
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,800
I am the boss of this bar.

14
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,200
That's the handsome guy.

15
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,760
I am his mother.

16
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,240
My name is Tan Yunmei.

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,920
I am very happy that everyone can come to my son's bar.

18
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,400
I hope you can drink well and play well here.

19
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,200
Thank you, Guang Ling.

20
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,040
Hello, I am here to report the purchase of the cloth.

21
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,800
Mr. Li told me that there is something wrong with the front desk.

22
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
I will take you there.

23
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,680
Thank you.

24
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,680
The company is so good at law.

25
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,360
Yes, I like it very much.

26
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,880
Me too.

27
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,080
The office is well.

28
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,600
Everyone works here.

29
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Come, this is your meeting.

30
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,320
Okay.

31
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,440
Mr. Su, the product that was promised yesterday is still a problem.

32
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,560
When do you think we can have time to talk about it?

33
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,920
Okay.

34
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,560
If you need anything, just go to the front desk.

35
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay, thank you.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,520
Let's go to the lab. We have a meeting tomorrow.

37
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,920
Hold on.

38
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:32,320
Have you read the reports of the managers of several departments?

39
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,520
I have a bold idea now.

40
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,720
We will change the strategy of the new city.

41
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,720
We will be a company that focuses on the structure.

42
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,720
Instead of chasing after others,

43
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,120
we should focus on our own products.

44
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,520
We should invest in them and make money.

45
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,120
We should also increase the supply of the lower cost.

46
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,320
Currently, the most experienced and supported in our company

47
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,920
is the Google direction.

48
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,720
From today on, we will focus on Google.

49
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,120
Okay.

50
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,120
According to the report of the contract,

51
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,920
the total number of medical equipment is about 1.5 billion.

52
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,120
Even if it is only one percent of the market,

53
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,720
the new city will be a future product.

54
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,720
If you have no objections,

55
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,520
we will quickly make the strategy before Mr. Han comes back.

56
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,720
Okay.

57
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,640
Mr. Han.

58
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,040
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,680
I'm sorry to say it too much.

60
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,720
Another...</

61
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,160
I will ask Mr. Han at B先.

62
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,080
Mr. Han,

63
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,480
Those three brothers had a great time.

64
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,560
They're having a great time.

65
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,000
How's going already?

66
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,160
There are no drinks and tea in it.

67
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,240
When will you be back?

68
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,360
Wake Portland had arrived.

69
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,200
You should call you now.

70
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,680
That means you're going to Singapore soon.

71
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,440
Yes.

72
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,840
See you in 30 minutes.

73
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
See you in a moment.

74
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,960
我也够吃饭

75
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,360
You want to get out of the door?

76
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,840
How come I'm caring about you?

77
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,760
What?

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,280
You want to invite me for dinner today?

79
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,160
You once closed your lunch box.

80
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,440
You have such a cute refrigerator.

81
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,320
Your KaS'2 has some human essence.

82
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,440
Who sent it?

83
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
Little gossip.

84
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
I have a question for you.

85
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
What gift do you think

86
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
girls should give their birthdays?

87
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
The male lead of the department of research

88
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
is making progress in the girl's birthday.

89
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
It seems that our president

90
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
is going to turn from a career lead

91
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,440
to a love lead.

92
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,440
If you really don't know what to give,

93
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
necklace, jewelry, bag,

94
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
and all are not the right choice.

95
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
As long as the girl doesn't think it's a negative.

96
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,440
What do you mean by negative?

97
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
It's meaningful to her.

98
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,440
You know what she likes.

99
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
Don't you know?

100
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
Nonsense.

101
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
I'm hungry.

102
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
You're leaving?

103
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
I want to eat.

104
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
I can cook.

105
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
You're a big sick man.

106
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,440
You shouldn't have put the fridge in the fridge.

107
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
You should have put it in your fridge.

108
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
Here you are.

109
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Thank you.

110
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,440
It seems that you're confident.

111
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,440
I've been thinking about going forward.

112
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
I didn't put the light

113
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
on myself.

114
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
I understand what you said.

115
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
I've thought about it.

116
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Xing Chen is going to be

117
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
a company that specializes in making stocks.

118
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Not bad.

119
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
It's gone.

120
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,440
Some people like to write

121
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,440
800 words in one sentence.

122
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Some people like to use

123
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,440
one sentence to summarize the general public opinion.

124
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
Then,

125
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
the person who likes to use

126
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
one sentence to summarize the general public opinion

127
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
can you expand it?

128
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440
What if the person who hears his words

129
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,440
wants to know more about the accurate information?

130
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
If the person who hears his words is not sure,

131
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,440
the person who speaks will probably tell him.

132
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
If he were to be changed,

133
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
he would do the same.

134
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
What would you do?

135
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
Specialize in making stocks?

136
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
This is the best way to make a new city.

137
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
You found it.

138
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
It's so simple.

139
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
How did I think of it now?

140
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
It's like a book.

141
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
When you go to school,

142
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,440
you'll feel that it's easy to learn.

143
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Have you always thought about it?

144
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Every time you tell me

145
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
that you're strategic and determined,

146
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
it's not right.

147
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
It's not the first time

148
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
you see a commercial plan and lose.

149
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
At the starting point,

150
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
you should be more careful.

151
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
You should be more careful.

152
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
You should be more careful.

153
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
You should be more careful.

154
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
I'm the one who's being reactionary.

155
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Are you?

156
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
I'll pour you another glass.

157
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Take your time.

158
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Just take it as

159
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,440
making 5% of your shares.

160
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,440
Just kidding.

161
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
I'm leaving.

162
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
I'll see you off.

163
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
How will you live

164
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
tomorrow's birthday?

165
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
How do you know that it's my birthday?

166
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
You have your identity

167
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
in the investment agreement.

168
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,440
I'll have dinner with my friends tomorrow.

169
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
I'll see you tomorrow.

170
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
I'll see you tomorrow.

171
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
See you.

172
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Okay.

173
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
I'm leaving.

174
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Goodbye.

175
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
I'm leaving.

176
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Coll engineering

177
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,480
15

178
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
Don't call me!

179
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Happy birthday!

180
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:43,120
Did he kill you?

181
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,560
tabii,

182
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,480
thank you,

183
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,840
to Troublesome,

184
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,000
you still got a snack.

185
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,360
I was just acting cheap.

186
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,400
Grandpa,

187
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,040
busy

188
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,000
is not an excuse.

189
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,640
Sometimes,

190
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,800
you practice words too much

191
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,080
and keep your heart in it.

192
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,880
If you don't even have time

193
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,240
to do something,

194
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,200
you won't be able to do it.

195
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,760
I know.

196
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,840
You just have to practice words

197
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,160
without any words.

198
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,760
But everyone wants to take the chance to break the roof.

199
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,320
I can only say that I can't break the roof.

200
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,680
In the past half a year,

201
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,760
you can see the smile of Dongyang.

202
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,840
I believe you know why I didn't practice words.

203
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,760
But the market price of Dongyi's

204
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,080
large-scale medical equipment

205
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,080
has dropped.

206
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,000
The low-end product is limited.

207
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,720
The market price is the price of medical equipment.

208
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,560
As long as we can keep it safe,

209
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,080
the customers who are old

210
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,200
will naturally come back to us.

211
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,280
Sister,

212
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,520
the water can flow forever.

213
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,920
If you want to do something,

214
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,160
you should practice words.

215
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,480
I know.

216
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,440
Grandpa.

217
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,720
I have something to do.

218
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,760
I'll go first.

219
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,280
Come on, sit down.

220
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,440
Don't even bring the table.

221
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,120
Don't move.

222
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,080
I'm tired.

223
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,560
Let me do some cardio first.

224
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,520
No.

225
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,560
Why did you come?

226
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,680
Thank God,

227
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,280
I could not make it.

228
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,680
OK.

229
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
Don't be so close to her.

230
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
Don't be so emotional.

231
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,680
And,

232
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
this Xiao Di

233
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,680
is a good person.

234
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
Grandpa,

235
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,680
she never thinks about the scope of my mind.

236
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,680
You have to choose

237
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,680
to keep your position

238
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,680
and leave the house at the right time.

239
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,680
My family's marriage

240
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,680
is never

241
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,680
enough to talk about love.

242
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,680
Grandpa,

243
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,680
I have been in Germany for years.

244
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
It's not that I depend on anyone.

245
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,680
I can do

246
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,680
the future development by myself.

247
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
You let me do it.

248
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
I can do it.

249
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
I just want to do it myself.

250
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,680
Okay.

251
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,680
Remember our agreement.

252
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
I said

253
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,680
it's not a lie.

254
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
I know.

255
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,680
I know.

256
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
Happy birthday, Mr. Zhu.

257
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,680
Please take it for me.

258
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
You don't have to send it back.

259
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
You really treat me like a legend?

260
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,680
Why don't you go up?

261
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
I'll wait for you.

262
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
Help me take this.

263
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
Here.

264
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
Wow.

265
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
Wow.

266
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,680
Wow.

267
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Wow.

268
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
Wow.

269
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Come on.

270
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Wow.

271
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
Don't you know it?

272
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
Don't worry.

273
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,680
You don't know it long ago.

274
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,680
You're a big man.

275
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
You'll find someone to go there next afternoon.

276
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
I'm not happy.

277
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,680
When the cake is done,

278
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
he'll bring it to me.

279
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
Come on.

280
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
Let's go upstairs.

281
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
Is that Shao Yichen?

282
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,680
Have more food at night.

283
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
Have fun.

284
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
Okay.

285
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
It's almost over.

286
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,680
Send me some messages.

287
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
I'll pick you up, okay?

288
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
Okay.

289
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Qiu Zi.

290
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
Qiu Zi.

291
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,680
Are you right, Qi Xing Xing?

292
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
When did you two be together?

293
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,680
We just started recently.

294
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
When did I start?

295
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,680
What are you playing?

296
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,680
I broke up with Dr. He.

297
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,680
Who are you playing with?

298
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,680
Why are you playing with Shao Yichen?

299
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,680
What did I do wrong

300
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,680
when I was playing with my lover?

301
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,680
You're a secret ex-boyfriend.

302
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,680
Don't you think you're proud of yourself?

303
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,680
I didn't see you so capable before.

304
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Didn't he already love Shao Yichen?

305
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
Can you stop talking?

306
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,680
I'm the one who's the main character.

307
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,680
It's not about Qiu Zi.

308
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,680
It's okay.

309
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,680
You two are free to be together.

310
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,680
But today is the birthday of Xing Xing.

311
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Shao Yichen, you should leave.

312
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,680
The day after tomorrow is coming.

313
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,680
Qiu Zi.

314
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,680
Come and send me a message.

315
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,680
I'll pick you up.

316
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Okay.

317
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
I'll be happy later.

318
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,680
Today is the birthday of Xing Xing.

319
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Can you stop making him unhappy today?

320
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
Okay?

321
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,680
Let's go.

322
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
Why are you so early today?

323
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,680
You're late.

324
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,680
I'm late.

325
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Can you give me a good time?

326
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Thank you.

327
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,680
I brought it too.

328
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
I'm here.

329
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
Thank you.

330
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,680
I'll buy you your favorite cake.

331
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
Thank you.

332
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,680
Qiu Zi, we haven't seen each other for a long time.

333
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,680
Yes.

334
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,680
I was too busy the other day.

335
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,680
Who's the one who didn't know about this?

336
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Me.

337
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
He Yaoweng?

338
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Look at his style.

339
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
Do you like it?

340
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
I like it.

341
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
I took pictures everywhere when I came here.

342
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
I said he would like it.

343
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Come on, eat it.

344
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
I'm hungry.

345
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
Okay.

346
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Come on.

347
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,680
You like to drink, Li Li?

348
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
You should drink it when you're hungry.

349
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
Drink it.

350
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Wait here.

351
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
I'll put it here for you.

352
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
You put that meat down.

353
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,680
Qiu Zi, the mushroom is also down.

354
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,680
The vegetables.

355
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
Come on, eat.

356
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Okay.

357
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,680
Who wants to eat this meat?

358
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
Eat it.

359
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
I want to eat that bowl.

360
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
This one.

361
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
Which pot do you want to eat?

362
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
You can have one.

363
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,680
One pot.

364
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,680
I'll give you one.

365
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
I think you should have one.

366
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
You should have more.

367
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
You're so slow.

368
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
You should have one more.

369
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,680
Where's this meat?

370
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
Why did you call me last night?

371
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,680
Did you send a birthday wish to Ji Xing?

372
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
You're so heartless to him.

373
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,680
Why didn't you go to his birthday party?

374
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
He's from the secret bureau.

375
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
He's a man.

376
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680
Don't gossip.

377
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
Think about how to make these people listen.

378
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
That's right.

379
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,680
The people who will come later,

380
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,680
there are many shareholder shares in their hands.

381
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
If we can get them,

382
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,680
you'll be more stable in the position of shareholder.

383
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
But

384
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
they seem to have a good relationship with your sister.

385
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,680
I'm afraid it's a little troublesome.

386
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,680
The business man is a god.

387
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
Hi, Mr. Shao.

388
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
Sorry.

389
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,680
It's late. Sorry.

390
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
Sorry.

391
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,680
Mr. Ling is still on the way.

392
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,680
He's coming soon.

393
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
We just arrived.

394
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Sit.

395
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
Sit.

396
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
So pretty.

397
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
So cute.

398
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
So pretty.

399
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
Come on.

400
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,680
Okay.

401
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,680
Don't film.

402
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,680
Come and eat cake.

403
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Come on.

404
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Xi Xin.

405
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,680
Xi Xin.

406
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,680
This is the strawberry cake

407
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,680
I bought for you.

408
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Thank you.

409
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
Come on.

410
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
I'll pour you some chili sauce.

411
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,680
Thank you, Mr. Ling.

412
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Thank you, Mr. Ling.

413
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
Yes.

414
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,680
Come on.

415
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
We're not bad.

416
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
This

417
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,680
represents our Xi Xin's forever eight years old.

418
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
Xiaoting.

419
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
Come on.

420
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Come on.

421
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
Xu An.

422
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
Qiu Zi.

423
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,680
I saw it just now.

424
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Actually, we're all single.

425
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,680
It's normal to be together.

426
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Shao Yichen and I

427
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
have nothing to do with each other.

428
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
From now on,

429
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
you don't have to carry me.

430
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,680
You should have told me earlier.

431
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
What are you doing?

432
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,680
Nothing.

433
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,680
Thank you for buying me a cake.

434
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
I like it.

435
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,680
I want to go out for a walk.

436
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Have the cake for me.

437
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
Okay.

438
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,680
Have some.

439
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
Thank you.

440
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
I love you.

441
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Are you okay?

442
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
I'm fine.

443
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
I'm really fine.

444
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:23,000
you就會

445
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,720
be nice to you

446
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,160
I shall be

447
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,140
I won't lose you again.

448
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,160
you will become my final daughter.

449
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,180
But you still want our children back.

450
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,740
What's wrong?

451
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,300
But you are my final son-in-娘.

452
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,540
What are you doing?

453
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,880
I'm not.

454
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,600
Wait a minute.

455
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,640
What's wrong?

456
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,440
The birthday party is going on.

457
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,120
I think something unexpected happened.

458
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,800
You stay here with them.

459
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,560
I'll go check it out.

460
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,160
No problem.

461
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,680
Come on.

462
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,320
Mr. Han.

463
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,080
Mr. Han, you have something to do.

464
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,040
I'll go with everyone.

465
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,800
Come on.

466
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,760
Hurry up.

467
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,840
I'll pick up Mr. Han.

468
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,360
Mr. Han.

469
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,040
Hello?

470
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,320
Where are you?

471
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,600
I...

472
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,400
I'm hanging up.

473
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,000
I'll go to the office with you.

474
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,000
Ding Wei sent me.

475
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,880
I'll pick you up.

476
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,360
Okay.

477
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,520
Bye.

478
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,160
Bye.

479
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,520
Xing Xing, where are you?

480
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,720
Do you need me to accompany you?

481
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,280
Let's change our clothes

482
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,460
and remove~!

483
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:05,100
Miss Guru, now you can work at the hospital to complete your search term working.

484
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,740
I was telling you.

485
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,280
It's your birthday, not yours.

486
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,720
I'm sad.

487
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,200
Got a little stylish.

Who is this?

499
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,620
Yang Ling'e?

500
00:28:59,740 --> 00:28:59,980
Zhen edge here.

501
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:01,660
In Hands.

502
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,860
Miss Tang Er looks highly-app���暖.

503
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,820
Thanks, Miss Tang Er.

504
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,700
Looks dep Lions'

505
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,140
still scandalous work here.

506
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,620
Using a Spielabout

507
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,660
to label him.

508
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,580
Its plaisir

509
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,780
wasulpash Blackstuff tea.

510
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,420
The brown features

511
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,540
worn every day

512
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,940
Those people are really hard to deal with.

513
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,220
I guess your sister

514
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,540
said hello to them in advance.

515
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,700
I didn't talk about anything now.

516
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,620
I didn't win the game either.

517
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,820
It seems that you can only go out on your own.

518
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,180
We've been talking about things for so many years.

519
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,460
He's the first one who doesn't force us.

520
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,740
Don't tell me.

521
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,380
Xing Yue is actually Han Ting.

522
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,860
I'm just a boss.

523
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,500
You're the boss here?

524
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,140
Han Ting is usually low-key.

525
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,220
He even went out on his own.

526
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,340
I guess now,

527
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,300
people who receive the delivery

528
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,100
don't know who made the dishes.

529
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,820
Okay, okay.

530
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,500
I'll send Han Ting to you.

531
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,340
Is it convenient?

532
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,380
It's convenient.

533
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,460
Have a rest.

534
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,060
I'll talk to him.

535
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,260
In the next episode

536
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,420
Let's meet after him.

537
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,260
Have fun!

538
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,460
Just play with me.

539
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:06,820
Ji

540
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:06,980
Enjoy your meal.

541
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,580
Thank you.

542
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,460
This lemon is perfect.

543
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,460
Thank you.

544
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,580
What a coincidence.

545
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,180
I know that I love lemons.

546
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,300
I ordered these on his behalf.

547
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,540
You've been looking at me while you've been shooting,

548
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,580
...but I could tell you aren't afraid of another.)

549
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,500
There is an attack on me even for a little while.

550
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,660
I'll open it for you.

551
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,900
Under the guise of shooting,

552
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:45,380
I was

553
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,480
Musik

554
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,820
You made the scene exactly after the same picture,

555
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,620
...but I think only the same...

556
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,620
Yes. It's delicious.

557
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,460
If you want to eat it,

558
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,460
tell me.

559
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,460
I'll contact the chef myself.

560
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,540
I...

561
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,060
Okay, thank you, Mr. Han.

562
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,700
I'll see you out.

563
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,620
Anyway,

564
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,300
just do as I say.

565
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,380
That's all for today.

566
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,220
Okay.

567
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,860
Xiao.

568
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:46,980
See you out.

569
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,060
I'll see you out.

570
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,660
Come on.

571
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,620
San.

572
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,100
She's really great.

573
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,340
Are you just waiting for me?

574
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,340
No.

575
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:18,900
지퍼.

576
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,460
Have you had a good time?

577
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,340
I'm sorry.

578
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,580
But I'm not in a hurry.

579
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,540
Mr. Han.

580
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,380
Give me the fire.

581
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,700
One more minute.

582
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,260
No wish, right?

583
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,420
Not yet.

584
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,140
I'll make it up for you.

585
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,380
Hahaha!

586
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,700
You don't even know what to make out of what you should凶.

587
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,660
I'll set up the peace of mind then.

588
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,180
You're a player

589
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,300
What do you want to see next?

590
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,580
I want to drink

591
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,900
OK

592
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,820
Do you really want to play games?

593
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:57,780
Don't go there

594
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,900
I'm very good at playing freezes

595
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,020
Can't be

596
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,380
I don't even need it

597
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,700
Then, say a word

598
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,500
What is the maintenant?

599
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,820
I will no longer play

600
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,020
If you lose

601
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:19,180
Let Xing Chen give me 3.4 out of 3

602
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:23,180
I'll give you 3.4% of the credit.

603
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,180
Okay.

604
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,180
Really?

605
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,180
If you win, I'll give it to you.

606
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,180
Okay.

607
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,180
I'll give you this.

608
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,180
What if you lose?

609
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,180
You can do whatever you want.

610
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,180
Really?

611
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,180
I can do whatever I want.

612
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,180
Of course.

613
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,180
Here.

614
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,180
Three.

615
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,180
Three.

616
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,180
Three.

617
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,180
Four.

618
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,180
Five.

619
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,180
Five.

620
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,180
Six.

621
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,180
Seven.

622
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,180
Five.

623
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,180
Five.

624
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,180
How about the party.

625
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,180
Party?

626
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,180
ciaited.

627
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,180
I won.

628
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:49,620
Go down.

629
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,300
Yes.

630
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,180
I just found out you've successfully compared a man with an old woman.

631
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,020
I'll go off now.

632
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,500
Okay.

633
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:15,980
Go, runاج.

634
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,020
Take another one.

635
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:23,260
alright, I will leave you alone

636
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,480
Happy Birthday

637
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:49,920
I know…

638
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,820
I'll put them on for you.

639
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,720
Yi Yang came earlier and she feels heart too.

640
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,020
She can't stay at the house anymore.

641
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:34,040
I heard she won't be able to accompany you around tomorrow.

642
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,560
I have something to discuss with Yihong.

643
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,800
I'm worried that Yihong and Zhen wrote that Wei Zhi's death is also a big deal.

644
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,060
What are you planning to do?

645
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,780
I'll do it.

646
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,340
If you lose,

647
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,580
will you really give me

648
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,780
3.4% of my shares?

649
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,500
Yes.

650
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,820
I'll give you 3.4%.

651
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,380
I would be happy if you couldn't lose.

652
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,820
Mom, what gonna happen now?

653
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,500

654
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:20,940

655
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,420
mom

656
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,340

657
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,540

658
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:25,940

659
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:26,820

00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,860

00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,500

662
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,220
happy

663
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,220
Xiaomeng said that Xing Xing is gone.

664
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,220
Ji Xing is with Han Ting.

665
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,220
Don't worry.

666
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,220
Do you know Han Ting?

667
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,220
Han Ting.

668
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,220
Han Ting is our Xing Yue's classmate.

669
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,220
The first time I met Ji Xing

670
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,220
was at his office.

671
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,220
I saw him together

672
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,220
at Xing Yue's office.

673
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,220
Xiaomeng, don't worry.

674
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,220
I contacted him.

675
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,220
He's fine.

676
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,220
He's at his friend's house.

677
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,220
Go to bed early.

678
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,220
That's good.

679
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,220
I'll be there in the afternoon.

680
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,220
Okay.

681
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,220
You should go to bed early.

682
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,220
Good night.

683
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,220
Good night.

684
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,220
I'll go back first.

685
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,220
I have something to do at home.

686
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,220
What is it?

687
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,220
I'll go with you.

688
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,220
No.

689
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,220
Go to bed early.

690
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,220
I'll be there with you the next day.

691
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,220
I'll go to bed early.

692
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,220
I'll go to bed early.

693
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,220
Xing, where are you?

694
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,220
You're not here yet.

695
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,220
Hello.

696
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,220
I'm here.

697
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,220
I'm here.

698
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,220
I'm here.

699
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,220
I'm here.
