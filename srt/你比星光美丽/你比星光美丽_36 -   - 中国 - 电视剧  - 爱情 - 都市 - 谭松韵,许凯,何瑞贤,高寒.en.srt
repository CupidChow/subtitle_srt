Di.

24
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,480
Will you give a thought

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,120
to taking our relationship to the next level?

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,920
Let Tongke wholly-own Guanghua.

27
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,590
Let me think about it.

28
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,960
Why do you need to think?

29
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,560
Do you not trust me?

30
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,150
That's not true.

31
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,430
After all, I established Guanghua.

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,240
It's just my life.

33
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,520
When I have to give it to someone else,

34
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,120
I can't be too cautious, right?

35
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,630
You can give it to me without concern.

36
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,630
Not only Guanghua, I mean.

37
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,960
I'm not Han Ting.

38
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
I'd never use my beloved woman.

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,910
I'll prove to you over time

40
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,150
that I'm trustworthy.

41
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,240
Sorry, I have to take this.

42
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,030
Mr. Zhu,

43
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,030
in this case,

44
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,520
I would like to help you.

45
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,750
But you know I...

46
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,910
Knock it off.

47
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,870
Chang He,

48
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,590
you used me many times.

49
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,590
Mr. Zhu,

50
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,310
that's where you're wrong.

51
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,960
We were cooperating.

52
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,310
And I promised

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,400
I would acquire your company at last.

54
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,150
You're in this trouble

55
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,910
and I'm very sorry about that.

56
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,150
Why don't you think

57
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,430
if you offended anyone?

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,150
I heard someone reported you

59
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,150
so that your company was investigated.

60
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,750
Except Han Ting,

61
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
who else could it be?

62
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,150
There's always someone to blame.

63
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,430
Sharpen your eyes and get the right guy.

64
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,830
What happened?

65
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,600
Among the experts hired by Dongyang Medical,

66
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,680
some suddenly changed their mind.

67
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,830
We should have been more thoughtful.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,240
We shouldn't have

69
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,720
invited them back to China so eagerly.

70
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,040
The top priority is to think

71
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,120
of a solution.

72
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,240
We need to communicate with them face to face.

73
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,680
I can contact overseas Chinese

74
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,870
from other colleges and institutes

75
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,830
and see if they can be reached.

76
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,310
I'll also go to Germany personally

77
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,800
to persuade them to come back.

78
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,750
I'll have some friends in Hong Kong, China

79
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,680
to assist you.

80
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,710
Your work

81
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,240
can be handed over to Miss Ji.

82
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,040
Miss Ji, keep pushing forward the talent pool.

83
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,000
The trouble we have now

84
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,480
is the tip of a substantial iceberg.

85
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,390
In the future, we will face

86
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,480
more problems.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,720
Hope we can work together

88
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,310
and make it through.

89
00:05:11,363 --> 00:05:13,284
(Lang Canteen)

90
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,310
When I dined with you here last time,

91
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,750
you rejected my love confession.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,870
I didn't know we would

93
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,320
say goodbye so soon.

94
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
It's not like it's goodbye forever.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,950
Have a triumphant return

96
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,800
and I'll give you a welcome dinner here.

97
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,950
Triumphant return?

98
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,720
That's a weird word.

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If I fail, will you not dine with me?

100
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,000
Consultant Qin, since when

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,160
have you ever failed?

102
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,560
What? Another magic?

103
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,160
Done once,

104
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,040
the magic is creative.

105
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,800
But done too many times,

106
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,830
it's just cliche.

107
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,510
Just to relax.

108
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,510
I thought about it.

109
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,750
I have to tell you something.

110
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,510
When we dined here for the first time,

111
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,750
Han Ting came, too.

112
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,430
He stood out there

113
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,120
and stared at you

114
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,560
instead of coming in.

115
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,710
I guess

116
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,560
he didn't want to dine with Tan Yuni.

117
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,830
He only cares about you.

118
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,920
If you care less about him,

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,750
I'll pursue you.

120
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,560
But I don't think

121
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,600
you have any space for me in your heart.

122
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,750
So, I'll just be a good guy.

123
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
The pursuit thing

124
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,920
will be your job.

125
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,240
Life is short.

126
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,560
Do not have regrets.

127
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,040
You and I met

128
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,430
by accident.

129
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,390
Since it started with an accident,

130
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,720
let's end it the same way.

131
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,920
Has anyone ever said

132
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,070
you look more like a poet

133
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,430
than a scientist?

134
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,040
Do you mean I sound schmalzy?

135
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,600
Very well. Schmalzy, indeed.

136
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,440
Ji Xing,

137
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,190
you're a very wonderful girl.

138
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
I really hope you'll live a happy life.

139
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,710
Thanks.

140
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,150
The same to you.

141
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,830
You're excellent and fun.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,120
You'll live a happy life, too.

143
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,560
Pity for you, anyway.

144
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,240
A smart and beautiful lady like you

145
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,950
finally missed a great man like me.

146
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,270
Such a shame.

147
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,460
(Dongyang Group)

148
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,150
Mr. Han, you wanted to see me?

149
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,470
Take your seat.

150
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,720
How's the handover with Qin Li?

151
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,440
Good.

152
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,200
He's professional, executive,

153
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,840
courageous, and responsible.

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,720
Without his help, getting back overseas talents

155
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,000
will move forward fast.

156
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,440
Have you been noticing Guanghua?

157
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,550
Do you mean the cooperation

158
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,600
between Guanghua and Tongke?

159
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,320
Yes. What do you think?

160
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,870
Affiliated with Dongyang Medical,

161
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,830
Guanghua was developing Bay.

162
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,000
It also depended

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,720
on the database of Doctorcloud.

164
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,270
When Dongyang Medical launches a medical robot,

165
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,030
it will exceed Bay soon.

166
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,440
That's right.

167
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,480
But Guanghua starts

168
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,120
to build its own database now,

169
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,720
it will be done in a couple of years.

170
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,240
Then, it can shed dependence

171
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,670
on our old database.

172
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
And now,

173
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,320
the market isn't what it used to be.

174
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,840
Our industry has rapidly developed.

175
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,870
It might take dozens of years before.

176
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,750
Nowadays,

177
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,550
it may only take five or ten years.

178
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,150
These years, Tongke hasn't been

179
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,320
as powerful as Dongyang Medical.

180
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
But now,

181
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,600
they imitate you in combing
software and hardware.

182
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,360
With the support of Guanghua,

183
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,120
it may stand a chance

184
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,200
to catch up.

185
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,790
But I understand.

186
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,550
Tongke is never Dongyang Medical's target.

187
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,320
The medical industry has diversified.

188
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,750
To realize a win-win

189
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,870
and give more benefits

190
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,000
to our people

191
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,790
are the future goals

192
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,750
of Dongyang Medical.

193
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,670
Miss Ji, looks like

194
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,200
when you're back from Germany,

195
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,840
you can think really big.

196
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,550
When you take care of the talent pool,

197
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,800
I won't be worried.

198
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,350
Thanks.

199
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,440
Good luck with your speech tomorrow.

200
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,460
(Shenzhen)

201
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,740
(The 5th Shenzhen AI
in Healthcare Expo & Summit)

202
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,720
Long time no see.

203
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,360
Long time no see, Miss Zeng.

204
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,750
When we meet again,

205
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,320
Guanghua and Tongke

206
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,630
have even cooperated.

207
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,200
Guanghua has technology

208
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,440
while Tongke has funds.

209
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,360
What's the problem with a win-win cooperation?

210
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,390
Hiring technical talents with a high pay

211
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,840
isn't a patent of Dongyang Medical.

212
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,510
We'll talk later. Be seated, please.

213
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,600
Everybody, welcome to Shenzhen

214
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,290
AI in Healthcare Forum.

215
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,150
Businessmen and entrepreneurs,

216
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,000
thank you

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,150
for offering us

218
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,510
this valuable chance to communicate.

219
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,320
Next, we'll have a leading guy

220
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,750
of this industry to give a speech.

221
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,270
He was also the opening guest

222
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,150
for last year's forum.

223
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,790
Mr. Han Ting, CEO of Dongyang Medical,

224
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,270
will give us a wonderful speech.

225
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,230
Come, please.

226
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,900
(Medical & Human)

227
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,750
It's me again.

228
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,510
My speech for last year

229
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,440
seemed to go pretty well.

230
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,440
Otherwise, I wouldn't have a chance

231
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,390
to stand here again.

232
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,870
In my previous speech,

233
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,480
I talked about the trends in the industry

234
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,630
and plans of my company.

235
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,550
Those are macro topics.

236
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,990
Today,

237
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,030
I want to tell you something different.

238
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,870
I'd like to talk

239
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,960
about medicine and human.

240
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,590
Two years ago,

241
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,080
Dongyang Medical organized

242
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,550
a medical activity in the countryside.

243
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,320
We went to Qingtian Fishing Village.

244
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,720
It has a beautiful scenery.

245
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,200
People there are simple.

246
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,960
But they have few medical resources.

247
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,440
There is only a small clinic.

248
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,600
Only minor illnesses

249
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,750
can be treated.

250
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,840
The trip to a city hospital is difficult.

251
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,150
So, in most cases,

252
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,320
when someone has a disease

253
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,870
that can't be handled in the clinic,

254
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
the first thing he does

255
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,550
is bear it.

256
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,790
A friend of mine

257
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,000
was also there

258
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,510
for this charity activity.

259
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,510
We met an old lady who lost her shank

260
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,790
and had to live with an artificial limb.

261
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,000
An unsuitable artificial limb

262
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,790
made it hard for her to walk.

263
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,720
For dozens of years,

264
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,510
she was living
with sensitivity and inferiority.

265
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,150
This case inspired

266
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,550
my friend's original aspiration.

267
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,390
She decided to start a company

268
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,030
of customized medical device.

269
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,960
She told me,

270
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,150
the meaning of developing medical technology

271
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,150
is to give everyone

272
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,120
medical resources

273
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,390
so that they can live a better life.

274
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,350
I guess

275
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,630
a medical worker

276
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,440
will feel the proudest

277
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,150
when he sees

278
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,510
his designed products

279
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,600
are used for patients.

280
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,750
Look how happy you are.

281
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,440
Your leg has recovered, huh?

282
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,240
You even play better than me.

283
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,840
That's right.

284
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,200
I have one artificial limb.

285
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,630
During the free treatment,

286
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,750
they made it for me.

287
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,360
According to them, it was customized for me

288
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,080
based on my own condition.

289
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,670
It works really well.

290
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,320
Now, Yuhong can walk

291
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,630
really agilely.

292
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,790
She and I plan

293
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,960
to go out for fun.

294
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,150
We will travel around.

295
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,320
Good idea.

296
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,870
Six months ago,

297
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,750
Dongyang Medical and Hanhai Xingchen

298
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,670
jointly went to remote places

299
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,630
to give a free customized treatment.

300
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,480
We helped this old lady

301
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,270
to get a suitable artificial limb.

302
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,630
Her life started to shine again.

303
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,320
I've participated
in many free medical activities.

304
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,960
I've seen many similar patients, too.

305
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,590
I've realized

306
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,870
our people actually have very simple

307
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,840
medical requirements.

308
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,840
Maybe...

309
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,840
It's just a truly medicative painkiller.

310
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,990
Or maybe...

311
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,080
It's just

312
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,360
a cost-effective customized artificial limb.

313
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,240
But look at us.

314
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,360
Sometimes, we only focus

315
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,200
on developing products

316
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,470
and playing with concepts

317
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,030
instead of carefully listening to

318
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,750
or feeling the real demands

319
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,600
of our people.

320
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,720
It's just like love.

321
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,630
I always gave you what I wanted to offer.

322
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,120
I only told you what I wanted you to know.

323
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,000
I thought I was protecting you.

324
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,750
But in the end,

325
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,000
they would just be pale excuses.

326
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,240
I ignored what you really wanted.

327
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,000
And what kind of love you wanted.

328
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,360
Love is mutual.

329
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,750
So is medical technology.

330
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,870
Technology for our country

331
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,910
and medical treatment for people.

332
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,030
Only when we know what people need

333
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,360
can we really heal them.

334
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,870
It's such a simple truth.

335
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
But I didn't realize it
before paying a big price.

336
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,630
Here, I'd like to announce something.

337
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,030
In the future, Dongyang Medical

338
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,080
will work with Hanhai Xingchen

339
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,120
to invest twenty million a year

340
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,960
in free customized treatments

341
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,030
throughout 30 towns

342
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,750
and 115 villages.

343
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,390
We'll help more patients in need.

344
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,550
We'll also offer follow-up service

345
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,840
to those involved patients

346
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,150
and always keep them healthy.

347
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,030
In one's life,

348
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,640
he only wants two things.

349
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,310
A dream to fight for all his life.

350
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:10,950
And a partner

351
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,110
to spend his life with.

352
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,070
At this forum,

353
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,200
I want to get myself a chance.

354
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,350
I hope the friend

355
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,830
who led me out of confusion

356
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,830
can give me a second chance.

357
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,310
As for my dream,

358
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,350
I'll keep working hard.

359
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,110
Everybody here, I hope

360
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,480
you'll remember why you started

361
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,070
and strive forward.

362
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,910

for what he just said.

382

As a member of the medical industry,

383

384
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,640

385
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,720
In the past ten years,

386
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,240
Tongke Medical

387
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,880
has been innovating and progressing.

388
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,640
Tongke and Guanghua

389
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,720
have signed a strategic agreement.

390
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,920

396
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,240
who led me out of confusion...

00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,640
she can never speak again.

Don't blame me.

479
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,960
Blame Han Ting instead.

480
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,750
I had planned to kidnap him.

481
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,750
But you were there in his flat.

00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,550

00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,070
really terrible

484
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,240
and it's all because of him.

485
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
Ten years.

486
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,400
My company developed for ten years.

487
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,790
My hard work

488
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,750
was completely ruined by him.

489
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,200
More than a thousand employees

490
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,750
lost their jobs overnight.

491
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,160
Did I mess with him?

492
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,960
Why did he do this to me?

493
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,960
Now, there's no turning back for me.

494
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,790
When he wants me to die,

495
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,550
he has to die with me.

496
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,440
To be honest,

497
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,070
I don't want the money.

498
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,640
I don't want reconciliation, either.

499
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,270

502
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,400
Ji Xing was kidnapped by Zhu Houyu.

503
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,680
In the old workshop of Xinggang Steel.

504
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,590
Call the police.

505
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,480
Where are you now?

506
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,670
Don't be impulsive.

507
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,680
Wait until we arrive.

508
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,440
Boss, do you hear?

509
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,350
Hello?

510
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,920
Come up here!

511
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,510
It's brave of you, Mr. Han.

512
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,590
Stop!

513
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,760
Mr. Han,

514
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,510
where's the money?

515
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,920
Do you not want to give it to me?

516
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,680
I'll give you the money.

517
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,000
Release her first.

518
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,680
Don't even try that.

519
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,560
Give me the money!

520
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,000
Otherwise...

521
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,960
- I'll push her off!
- Wait.

522
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,110
The money is in the car.

523
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,350
After you take the money,

524
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,550
you also need a car, don't you?

525
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,000
Fool me?

526
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,240
That's not five million!

527
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,310
You actually fooled me!

528
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,680
How can I get five million overnight?

529
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,350
What's in the bag

530
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,070
is worth two million.

531
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,960
The rest is in this card.

532
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,430
Let her go.

533
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,480
I didn't expect the extremely arrogant Mr. Han

534
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,400
to be a hopeless romantic.

535
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,760
Fine.

536
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,510
You set me up first.

537
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,880
Taking the money from you

538
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,830
is too good for you.

539
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,240
I promise.

540
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,110
When I take your money,

541
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,640
I won't ask for more trouble.

542
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,590
You also have to promise

543
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,030
you will let me go.

544
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,510
I want money and you want her.

545
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,880
Deal.

546
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,190
OK.

547
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,590
Leave.

548
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,160
From your full body check,

549
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,270
your organs are all right.

550
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,350
How's the injury on your hand?

551
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,200
It's OK. Just some scratches. It's wrapped.

552
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,590
How is he?

553
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,920
Don't worry. Nothing is serious.

554
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,000
The blood on his coat

555
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,150
was from his scratches.

556
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,870
But anyway,

557
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,840
he has a compression fracture
of the lumbar spine.

558
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,600
Recently,

559
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,590
you will feel intermittent pain.

560
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,510
Most importantly, you have to rest in bed.

561
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,360
Especially the bruises and scratches on him...

562
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,150
Take care of them carefully.

563
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,320
I'll get back to work.

564
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,920
Call me if you need anything.

565
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,800
OK.

566
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,760

What?

755
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:39,630
How's Xing?

756
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:42,230
She has some scratches.

757
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,400
When Xiaomeng and I arrived,

758
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,360
Mr. Han was resting.

759
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,550
So, we didn't disturb him.

760
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:49,630
Glad they're fine. Tomorrow,

761
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:51,030
shall we go and see them?

762
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,800
OK. See you tomorrow.

763
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,240
See you tomorrow.
