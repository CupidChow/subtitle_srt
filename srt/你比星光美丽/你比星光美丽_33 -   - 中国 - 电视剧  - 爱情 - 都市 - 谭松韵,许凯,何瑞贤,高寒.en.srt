206
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,300
I found a starfish.

207
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,140
It's pretty.

208
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,420
Such a pretty starfish.

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,260
You're awesome.

210
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,260

00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,220
Let me roll them up.

- No.

Honey, look. So many people are over there.

215
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,100
Let's go have a look.

216
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:10,970
I'll carry you, then.

00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,620

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,060
How dare you say that?

219
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,260
No. I just want to ask you

220
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,140
what you would like for dinner.

221
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,500
Hotpot.

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,700

232
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,890

240

he's been coming here every day.

He nearly becomes a wife-waiting rock.

242
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,220
Why is my nephew

243
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,340
torturing himself like this?

244
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,940
If it goes on like this, he'll be ruined.

245
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,580
Oh, no.

246
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,260
We must do something

247
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,780
to enlighten him.

248
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,700
I've arrived.

249
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,300
Where are you?

250
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,140
I'm in the VIP area.

251
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,380
Ting,

252
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,620
sit on the couch for a while.

253
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,540
Hey, Han Ting.

254
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,060
Give us five minutes.

255
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,020
We'll tell you a story about you.

256
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,620
What a big mountain!

257
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,500
I'll climb over it.

258
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,780
So exciting.

259
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,980
Give it to me.

260
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,340
Fly.

261
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,900
Caught it.

262
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,940
When will I

263
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,860
get a good friend

264
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,060
who can play with me?

265
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,540
I'm a hunter.

266
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,860
I look for prey.

267
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,740
I'm a hunter.

268
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,100
I look for prey.

269
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,500
Oh, prey.

270
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,220
Watch this.

271
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,460
Snake!

272
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,980
Help!

273
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,100
Snake!

274
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,700
Why is it dead?

275
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,060
- Hunter.
- Prey.

276
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,780
Put down my prey.

277
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,420
Did you shoot and kill this snake?

278
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,300
Yes, to some extent.

279
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,060
You're such a sharpshooter.

280
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,500
Don't flatter me.

281
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,780
I'll be shy.

282
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,220
Can we be good friends?

283
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,540
But I'm a hunter.

284
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,620
What does that matter?

285
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,580
You saved my life.

286
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,820
I will give you

287
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,660
my most precious gift.

288
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,900
But this is my prey.

289
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,860
Not this. Wait a second.

290
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,380
This star

291
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,820
is what I treasure most.

292
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,260
I'm giving it to you now.

293
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,420
I'm so happy! I have a friend!

294
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,780
- I'm so happy!
- Friend?

295
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,460
- I have a friend!
- Hey, wait.

296
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,220
I finally have a friend!

297
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,020
Wait a minute!

298
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,020
But

299
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,380
can a fox and a hunter

300
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,420
really be friends?

301
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,900
I'm a hunter. I look for prey.

302
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,820
I'm a fox.

303
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,900
I want chicken.

304
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,230
Look for... Prey?

305
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,250
Don't shoot.

306
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,180
Animals in the forest are my fellows.

307
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,620
Don't hunt them.

308
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,580
But I'm a hunter.

309
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,380
I'm born to hunt.

310
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,180
Then will you

311
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,140
also hunt me

312
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,180
like how you hunt them?

313
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,340
(If one day,)

314
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,980
I also hurt your interest,

315
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,420
will you also do this to me?

316
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,260
I won't.

317
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,660
One day, when Hanhai is powerful enough,

318
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,780
will it...?

319
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,420
Will it annex Xingchen?

320
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,020
Xingchen plans to go its own way.

321
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,140
But someday, will it

322
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,020
have nowhere to go?

323
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,780
I know Xingchen is your hard work.

324
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,700
I will protect it.

325
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,940
I swear.

326
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,180
I will never hunt you.

327
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,900
Because

328
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,900
you're my best friend.

329
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,780
Then...

330
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,300
Can you stop hunting?

331
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,580
But I'm a hunter.

332
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,420
Can a hunter not hunt?

333
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,940
Can you stop eating chicken?

334
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,780
I can.

335
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,580
Don't always

336
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,620
blurt it out.

337
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,900
Fine. I won't hunt today.

338
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,380
I'm going home.

339
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,380
You won't hunt?

340
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,500
A fox doesn't eat chicken.

341
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,380
A hunter doesn't hunt.

342
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,820
Can it really happen?

343
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,460
Oh, the fox.

344
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,590
- Help!
- Hey, chicken.

345
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,690
Stop running.

346
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,560
- Help!
- Stop running.

347
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,230
I don't eat chicken anymore.

348
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,740
You don't?

349
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,580
What else do you eat?

350
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,820
Grass.

351
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,770
Don't try to fool me.

352
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,700
- Help!
- Don't run.

353
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,020
Let me explain.

354
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,140
Who's eating chicken?

355
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,980
My star.

356
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,620
Who tried to kill me?

357
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,980
It's you?

358
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,410
It's you?

359
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,180
You tried to kill me?

360
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,180
Tell me.

361
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,590
Were you trying to kill me?

362
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,790
You promised

363
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,220
you would never hunt me.

364
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,260
Don't you remember?

365
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,060
I said, I'm a hunter.

366
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,340
If we have to be friends,

367
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,090
you can't eat chicken.

368
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,660
I didn't eat chicken.

369
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,860
If you don't believe me, cut my stomach.

370
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,860
See if it's only filled

371
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,260
with grass and worms.

372
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,980
I thought

373
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,740
when the fox didn't eat chicken,

374
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,180
the hunter would not hunt.

375
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,220
Looks like

376
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,900
I was so silly.

377
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,700
But hunting is my job.

378
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,340
Yeah. You always have a reason.

379
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,580
You're always right.

380
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,280
Turns out

381
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,820
we don't belong in the same world.

382
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,220
What do you mean?

383
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,300
I can't protect this star.

384
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,300
Nor can I protect our friendship.

385
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,460
Farewell,

386
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,500
my hunter friend.

387
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,540
Maybe

388
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,560
it's better to be separated.

389
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,100
Fox.

390
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,500
(The hunter didn't)

391
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,060
(stop the fox from going away.)

392
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,380
(Because he knew)

393
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,340
(if the fox)

394
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,540
(stayed with him...)

395
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,010
(This time,)

396
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,580
(the fox's star was broken.)

397
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,780
(Next time,)

398
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,780
(maybe its heart)

399
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,940
(will be broken.)

400
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,340
(If hurting you is the price)

401
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,300
(of being together with you...)

402
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,540
(I would rather leave you.)

403
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,260
(Now, I'm a free fox again.)

404
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,340
(I'm still a hunter)

405
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,580
(who doesn't miss a single shot.)

406
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,900
(Our meeting)

407
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,140
(may be a glorious mistake.)

408
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,580
(We can't be ourselves unless we split.)

409
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,100
(From this day on, I'm still me)

410
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,580
(and you're still you.)

411
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,700
(The broken star will join together.)

412
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,940
(But you have to give it)

413
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,980
(enough time.)

414
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,900
(Before that,)

415
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,100
(just wait patiently.)

416
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,340
(Time will heal)

417
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,780
(the harm you give me now.)

418
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,180
(After all,)

419
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,940
(I love you that much.)

420
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,140
Xing,

421
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,660
as long as you want it,

422
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,620
Xingchen is still yours.

423
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,180
(Share Transfer Agreement)

424
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,020
(Party A: Dongyang Medical)
Party B: Xingchen Technology)

425
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,900
You're terrible.

426
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,660
(Unless)

427
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,820
(your contradiction is reconciled,)

428
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,420
you will end up separated.

429
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,580
(Letter of Resignation, Ji Xing)

430
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,380
Can you give her some space?

431
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,820
It's good for both of you.

432
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,420
(So when?)

433
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,980
(Maybe,)

434
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,100
(it's when destiny brings us back.)

435
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,020
(In my opinion,)

436
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,860
(the technology research and development)

437
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,980
(knows no borders.)

438
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,980
(A quick aside here.)

439
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,100
(Some countries)

440
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,700
(lack this kind of awareness.)

441
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,820
(They use a variety of means)

442
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,820
(to detain research talents)

443
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,940
(who come for advanced courses.)

444
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,100
(About such a claim,)

445
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,460
(all I can say is...)

446
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,700
(I hope all of you)

447
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,860
(can have academic achievements)

448
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,260
(to make our lives better)

449
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,940
(instead of using your learned techniques)

450
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,940
(for some countries)

451
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,580
(to monopolize or bully others.)

452
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,260
(Weak parts)

453
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,540
Hello.

454
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,660
Hi, Dr. Qin.

455
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,300
Dr. Qin,

456
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,250
will you really not consider

457
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,180
working for our company?

458
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,860
Thanks.

459
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,100
If you're here

460
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,540
to invite me

461
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,500
to join your company,

462
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,020
I'm sorry.

463
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,940
I've decided to go back to China.

464
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,380
Dr. Qin, you're a genius.

465
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,460
We don't want you to go back.

466
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,140
If you stay,

467
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,380
my company will

468
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,220
fully support your research.

469
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,140
Scientific research knows no borders.

470
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,340
You're quite straightforward.

471
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,220
I meet you here

472
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,340
just because I appreciate your sincerity.

473
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,940
But I keep saying

474
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,100
I only want to go back to China.

475
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,140
In China, there's a phrase,

476
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,940
"regurgitation feeding."

477
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,500
My motherland nurtured me.

478
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,260
It's time

479
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,780
I should go back and construct it.

480
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,100
So, I don't think

481
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,700
we need to waste

482
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,220
each other's time.

483
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,900
If there are international projects,

484
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,780
- we can cooperate.
- But Dr. Qin...

485
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,340
The coffee is on me.

486
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,660
Have a nice day.

487
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,620
Catch the thief!

488
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,740
Thanks.

489
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,460
You're welcome.

490
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,100
Chinese?

491
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,540
I'm so lucky to meet

492
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,460
a compatriot here.

493
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,780
Hi. I'm Qin Li.

494
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,540
Hi, Dr. Qin. I'm Ji Xing.

495
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,460
You know me?

496
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,980
I've read about you.

497
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,300
Overseas Chinese all know about you.

498
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,540
You also work on AI?

499
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,740
Kind of.

500
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,220
I work on AI medicine.

501
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,140
We're kind of peers.

502
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,620
Shall I invite you to lunch?

503
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,620
Thanks for helping me.

504
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,940
No need. We're Chinese.

505
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,820
Don't mention it.

506
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,900
I have things to do. I should go.

507
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,700
Here.

508
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,860
(Yushan Bypass)

509
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,860
Smells so good.

510
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,860
Shall I make you some?

511
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,460
I'm not hungry. You just eat.

512
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,860
What are you divining? Love?

513
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,060
Not at all.

514
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,100
I'm diving my fortune of the year.

515
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,540
Your mother dances really well.

516
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,740
I don't know why,

517
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,860
but she's been fascinated with it.

518
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,900
She has?

519
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,620
After the New Year,

520
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,500
you and your mother

521
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
are on better terms, aren't you?

522
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,300
Su Zhizhou certainly

523
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,340
has a knack for it.

524
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,580
The first time I saw him in the rooftop house,

525
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,420
I thought he was

526
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,460
a little bit dumb.

527
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,180
But he turns out to be reliable.

528
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,020
I don't know why,

529
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,860
but he gets along very well with my mother.

530
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,420
Seriously,

531
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,980
Su Zhizhou

532
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,380
has been steadier than before.

533
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,340
Yeah. When Xing is away now,

534
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,740
Xingchen counts on the two of you.

535
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,980
He has to be steadier.

536
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,300
I've had video chats with Xing

537
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,780
and she looks very good.

538
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,220
Do you think

539
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,540
she has really got over Mr. Han?

540
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,220
He's a mere man.

541
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,460
Why would she not get over him?

542
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,260
Maybe in Germany,

543
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,620
she's got some romantic dates.

544
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,900
That's right.

545
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,020
Xing is gorgeous

546
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,020
and excellent.

547
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,050
Maybe she has known

548
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,620
five hundred cute German guys.

549
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,900
Anyway, she's coming back soon.

550
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,180
Ask her to give us some cute guys.

551
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,340
You really want cute German guys?

552
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,460
Oh, Qin Li.

553
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,620
You are

554
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,900
the best student I've ever had.

555
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,820
Your doctoral supervisor and college

556
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,900
want me to talk with you again.

557
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,900
If you agree to stay and work as a lecturer,

558
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,660
you'll be given the maximum R&D support.

559
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,740
No one has had

560
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,580
this offer before.

561
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Meng, say no more.

562
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,180
School authorities talked to me several times.

563
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,380
Their repetitious talks

564
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,700
really bore me.

565
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,900
I knew you would say something like that.

566
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,620
Come on.

567
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,580
If you don't want to do something,

568
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,980
no one can force you.

569
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,340
And if you want to do something,

570
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,500
no one can stop you.

571
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,020
My job

572
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,500
is to bring you the message.

573
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,100
The choice is yours.

574
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,420
Prof. Meng.

575
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,860
There you are, Ji Xing.

576
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,060
Ji Xing?

577
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,260
Oh, you met each other?

578
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,980
Earlier today, a guy stole my backpack.

579
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,420
She got it back for me.

580
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,780
It's not a problem.

581
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,540
Prof. Meng, I'm here to return the book.

582
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,180
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

583
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,980
It's time for my class.

584
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,620
You guys talk, then.

585
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,660
Ji Xing, if you want any books,

586
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,180
- get them by yourself.
- OK. Go ahead.

587
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,620
See you, Meng.

588
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,300
Ji Xing,

589
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,820
we're acquaintances now.

590
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,220
May I have your contact number?

591
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,100
OK.

592
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,620
I'll scan your code.

593
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,900
Sure.

594
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,530
I've basically read

595
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,620
all the books here.

596
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,700
What are you interested in?

597
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,780
I can recommend some.

598
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,380
Books about AI medicine.

599
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,300
What do you recommend?

600
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,460
Books by medical professors

601
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,020
at Johns Hopkins University.

602
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,100
They're worth reading.

603
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,460
Thanks.

604
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,060
By the way,

605
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,020
I only know

606
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,820
you're a genius in AI

607
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,580
and you've won countless research awards.

608
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,740
What exactly

609
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,780
is your focus?

610
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,460
Natural language processing.

611
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,300
That is, teach machines

612
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,340
to communicate and interact

613
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,500
in human language.

614
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,020
If the iteration succeeds,

615
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,940
many human language work

616
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,220
will be done by machines.

617
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,500
I hope one day, they can

618
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,420
help me handle

619
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,540
those unnecessary

620
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,260
online social events.

621
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,140
That's all, then.

622
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,820
Come on. I'll buy you lunch.

623
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,780
Don't say no.

624
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,220
Or I'll always think of that.

625
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,620
Fine. I'll go, then.

626
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,940
Let's go.

627
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,260
(Dongyang Group)

628
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,740
It's the first time I've been here.

629
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,180
It is far better

630
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,100
than my poor little office.

631
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,340
Look at the view.

632
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,100
Mr. Han, with such a good view around,

633
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,500
no wonder you can think big.

634
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,700
What?

635
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,300
I know you, huh?

636
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,220
My present indicates something.

637
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,660
Indicates what?

638
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,980
Gorilla.

639
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,020
In Chinese, it sounds like Xing.

640
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,180
It's a sign of the wonderful fate

641
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,140
between you and Ji Xing.

642
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,740
You know what? Forget it.

643
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,140
What do you want? Say it.

644
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,500
As the man behind you,

645
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,980
I'm here to remind you.

646
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,060
I hear Tongke and Guanghua

647
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,620
will have a strategic partnership.

648
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,180
The fruit of your cultivation

649
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,540
will be taken by Chang He.

650
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,940
Chang He just wants

651
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,220
to promote the concept

652
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,300
of AI medicine

653
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,340
and boost the stock price.

654
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,940
He may not digest the fruit.

655
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,380
You look calm.

656
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,580
Are you preparing big moves?

657
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,780
If you have too much free time,

658
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,060
please go out

659
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,180
and close the door from outside.

660
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,380
Since you broke up,

661
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,740
you've been more annoying.

662
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,620
No problem, Mr. Qian.

663
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,540
(Hanhai Xingchen)
It was confirmed at the online meeting.

664
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,740
The delivery time of each batch

665
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,740
will be just fine.

666
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,580
OK.

667
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,100
Where are those of Division 2?

668
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,580
They're out of the office except Mr. Su.

669
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,900
For facility maintenance.

670
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,300
Again?

671
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,340
In the past six months,

672
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,940
our technical guys

673
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,300
have either been sent

674
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,140
for some fieldwork

675
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,940
or staying in the office

676
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,980
with no work to do.

677
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,260
So, Hanhai will really

678
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,700
make our technical department a figurehead.

679
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,300
Mr. Su has been stressed out lately.

680
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,020
I can feel he has been

681
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,980
totally depressed.

682
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,020
Don't worry. You focus on your work.

683
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,020
I'll go talk to him.

684
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,340
OK.

685
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,820
Come on in.

686
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,940
Li?

687
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,260
What's up?

688
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,380
Mr. Su,

689
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,740
when the leader is stressed out,

690
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,740
the mood of the whole team
will also be affected.

691
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,700
I'm just fine.

692
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,220
Hanhai will make

693
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,500
our technical department a figurehead.

694
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,700
How could you be just fine?

695
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,420
Don't worry, Li.

696
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,580
I can hold that.

697
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,100
Anyway, don't tell Xing about it.

698
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,780
I don't want her to worry.

699
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,620
I know what I can't do.

700
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,220
But you...

701
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,300
Don't carry it all on your own shoulder.

702
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,900
We're a team.

703
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,180
How about we talk to Mr. Luo?

704
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,620
He is way too busy.

705
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,820
In some cases,

706
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,140
even if he has some arrangements,

707
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,020
his subordinates may disobey him.

708
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,460
If we complain, it may exacerbate the hostility

709
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,500
between the two divisions.

710
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,860
Recently,

711
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,740
I've been working on something great

712
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,980
with my men in Division 2.

713
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,580
It will be done soon.

714
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,700
Don't worry about us.

715
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,420
What is that?

716
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,300
It's a secret. You'll know.

717
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,260
Fine.

718
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,500
I have faith in you.

719
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,100
I'll wait and see.

720
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,400
Hope your division

721
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,120
won't lose to my department.

722
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,140
Let's wait and see.

723
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,060
Come in.

724
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,900
Mr. Su and Miss Li.

725
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,940
Just now, Hanhai

726
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,020
sent an email notification

727
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,700
that they'd give this batch of our products

728
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,580
to another client.

729
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,140
But one of our orders

730
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,620
will be due soon.

731
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,380
Mr. Qian's order?

732
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,540
Yes.

733
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,820
In four days, this order

734
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,980
will be delivered.

735
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,020
I think the salesmen of Hanhai

736
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,500
deliberately made this last-minute decision

737
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,180
to transfer away our products.

738
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,300
Based on our current productivity,

739
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,420
the production of this batch

740
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,700
will take at least one week.

741
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,660
I'll go call Mr. Qian

742
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,180
and see if he accepts an extension.

743
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,020
OK.

744
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,860
(Su Zhizhou)
Shang,

745
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,940
inform Division 2

746
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,260
to work overtime tonight.

747
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,850
♪When I'm used to being alone♪

748
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,140
Your bar has been

749
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,180
more and more popular.

750
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,420
Of course.

751
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,140
This bar is a milestone of my life.

752
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,140
Hey, Ms. Liu. What's up?

753
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,220
What?

754
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,660
OK. I'll be right back.

755
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,500
- What happened?
- My mother fainted.

756
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,780
They're going home from the hospital.

757
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,700
I have to go home now.

758
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,660
Zhou, take care of the bar.

759
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,220
I'll go with you.

760
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,660
They're back.

761
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,020
Do you remember

762
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,860
what I told you to do?

763
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,740
When I sink my head into my hands,

764
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,620
you can start.

765
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,020
OK. I remember that.

766
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,460
Do it better. Don't laugh.

767
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,020
Mom.

768
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,540
Are you OK?

769
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,420
Ms. Han.

770
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,740
How come you suddenly fainted?

771
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,980
I don't know.

772
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,860
All of a sudden,

773
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,940
I passed out.

774
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,820
I couldn't see anything then.

775
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,740
What did the doctor say?

776
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,060
According to the doctor, she is aged

777
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,180
and has many health problems.

778
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,140
Luckily, she was treated in time.

779
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,340
If it happens again,
she'll have a serious problem.

780
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,380
Shall we go back to the hospital?

781
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,980
In your case, is it better to be hospitalized?

782
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,380
That's right. Be hospitalized.

783
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,780
Let's go.

784
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,820
- Ms. Liu, get...
- No.

785
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,860
You two just stop arguing.

786
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,100
I felt dizzy.

787
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,380
Now, I feel worse.

788
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,380
All right, Ms. Han.

789
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,740
Just let her rest.

790
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,980
I'm dizzy.

791
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:38,820
Oh, Ms. Han.

792
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,060
I request to take a few days off.

793
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,540
Because my husband

794
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,660
has had a relapse of gout.

795
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,980
I have to go back and take care of him.

796
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,180
Come on, Ms. Liu.

797
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,620
My mother is sick.

798
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,820
You can't leave.

799
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,580
I know, Linjia.

800
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,660
But...

801
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,740
If I don't go back

802
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,180
to take care of my husband,

803
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,740
he will divorce me.

804
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,700
Liu, don't cry.

805
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,940
I approve. You can go home.

806
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,060
How can I

807
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,060
get you divorced

808
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,540
just because you have to take care of me?

809
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,820
I'm fine.

810
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,020
I'm just lying here.

811
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,380
I can take care of myself.

812
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,180
OK. You just go.

813
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,740
- Thanks, Ms. Han.
- Not at all.

814
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,740
Thank you, Linjia.

815
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,260
Ms. Han, how about I take care of you?

816
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,100
