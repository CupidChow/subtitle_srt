1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to the sky to the earth.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sure I won't be afraid.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll be the future.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to the sky to the earth.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't give up.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll be the future.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 1

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Be careful.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm 120.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Don't.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Call the doctor.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Mr. Jiang.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Come in.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Something happened to Mr. Han.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Someone was at the underground parking lot in the east.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He and Mr. Ji

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
helped Mr. Han get in the car.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Mr. Han didn't come back yet.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What happened last time

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
wasn't that simple.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Episode 1

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
When Xing Chen's patient

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
was in trouble,

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
he was just like now.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Then Xing Chen was back.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And another one was blackening me.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This time, I suddenly thought

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
about the new press conference.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I could interview the patient

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
who used Han Xing's product.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So, Li Jie contacted

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the Ministry of Public Security.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They introduced me to some of the patients.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
These are the contact information of the patient.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm going to make

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
live interviews and videos for them.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll use the actual example

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
to block the mouth of those black people.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But I want to make a live report first.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Can you please

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
contact them

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
for the interview time?

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You want me to help you?

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What do you think?

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Lu Lin Jia.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Open the door in your mind.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I was wrong.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I was wrong.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I asked you to change your clothes

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and go into the room.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Otherwise, the food will be cold.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No, no, no.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We'll make a live report.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
From where we got the file,

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
from where we got the file,

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Xiaofeng, you're the best.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll make a contact.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
1808, 08,

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hello.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Hello.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Hello.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can go first.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Please.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The final order of the East Medical Department

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
is to put each patient's interests

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
to the first one.

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's about health.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Why don't you take the risk?

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
After the product is fully recovered,

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll find the third-party institution

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
to make a test.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Stop looking.

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What's so good about it?

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Is there any problem with the product?

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm afraid you'll be

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
lost in the investigation.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's too late.

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm already like this.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The director is getting better and better.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I admire him.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Who do you think is the one who did this?

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Who is the one who divided the heart into two?

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Who is it?

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
By the way,

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the person who posted the video

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
contacted us today

99
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and said he wanted to apologize.

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's for the sake of the audience's interest,

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
but I didn't expect

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
to make such a big deal out of it.

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What do you think?

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Who is guilty of the Dongyang Group

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
for the sake of the audience's interest?

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
There must be someone behind it.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's hard to find out

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
the person behind it.

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
They must have made a deal.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You've already thought about

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
the solution.

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's because of this.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Let them apologize openly.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The public will blame him.

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He can also give Dongyi

116
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
a piece of paper to promote.

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It seems that our CEO Ji

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
has already made a perfect solution.

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Then I can rest assured.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You just have to rest.

121
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This thing must be

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
a pretty and beautiful thing for you.

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Here.

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Here.

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Eat with me.

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Sorry.

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Grandpa.

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
President.

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
How is it going?

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's good.

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay.

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Take some time.

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Hurry up and recover.

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Ji Xing.

135
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The company's business

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
has worked hard for you.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It should.

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I've read the news.

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The breakthrough world is doing well.

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's all because of him.

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes.

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes.

143
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
President.

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I've talked to Han Ting.

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He didn't contact me.

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Since you have money and money,

147
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
you should be more cautious

148
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
in the future.

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You should be more careful.

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes.

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
By the way,

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
the new contract

153
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I wrote for you last time

154
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
is in the new contract.

155
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I've already found someone

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
to sign it.

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
If you have time,

158
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
go and get it.

159
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's a gift

160
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
for you two.

161
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Thank you, President.

162
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You're so used to calling me President.

163
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Thank you, Grandpa.

164
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay.

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I have to go.

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Go on eating.

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Go on.

168
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Grandpa, goodbye.

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Goodbye.

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Goodbye.

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay.

172
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What's wrong?

173
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm eating oranges.

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Come on.

175
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You're eating oranges?

176
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Do you want to eat more?

177
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Grandpa.

178
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Xiao Yue.

179
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
No matter what you do,

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
you come here today

181
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
because you're still confused.

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Did he say anything to you?

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Xiao Ting never said

184
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
you were a boss before me.

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But what have you done?

186
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You think I'm really old?

187
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You can't even see this?

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If Xiao Ting

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
had a fight with you,

190
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm afraid you'd be helpless.

191
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Grandpa.

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Xiao Yue.

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You should tell him this.

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You two are brothers.

196
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You're blood and mud.

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Mr. Yuan.

198
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Mr. Ji from Han Xing wants to see you.

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Mr. Yuan.

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Sorry to bother you.

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Please come in.

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You've been taking care of Han Ting

203
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
in the hospital.

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Why do you come here?

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm here to see you.

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Why do you come here?

207
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I came here to thank you.

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Thank you?

209
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I saw you go to see Han Ting

210
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
in the hospital the other day.

211
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I know you've been taking care of her.

212
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And Han Ting was hurt

213
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and I didn't tell her.

214
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I believe you're helping her.

215
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's okay to thank her.

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I just don't want her to worry about this.

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What's the matter?

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The board of directors

219
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
wants you to help us

220
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
convince the directors

221
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
to pass the AI staff.

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I didn't hear it wrong.

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
How do you think I'll help you?

224
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
If the AI staff is done,

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
the profits will not only be the winter clothes,

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
but also the excellent AI staff

227
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and resources.

228
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And the entire company's profits

229
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
are the glory of the East Asian Group.

230
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's also the success of your vice-president.

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Han Ting has been in Germany for ten years.

232
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You've been in the East Asian Group.

233
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
For so many years,

234
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
the company has been developing

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and stable in your hands.

236
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's very good.

237
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's a blessing for you to pay for it.

238
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Han Ting suddenly went back to China

239
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and directly asked the East Asian Group for help.

240
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's hard to accept anyone else.

241
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You're better than Han Ting.

242
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Han Ting doesn't say it,

243
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
but he understands

244
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
your support for the East Asian Group.

245
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Sit down and talk.

246
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Thank you.

247
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I admit that the front view of AI staff

248
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
is indeed good.

249
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But it's not easy to get a discount here.

250
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Han Ting and I have already

251
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
prepared everything.

252
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
As long as the board passes,

253
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
the progress will be very smooth.

254
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Besides,

255
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
if this matter is not done well,

256
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
that will prove that Han Ting and I are incompetent.

257
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
At that time,

258
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
President Yuan should also take back the winter clothes.

259
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Thank you.

260
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You're thinking for me.

261
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
President Yuan,

262
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
the first-time vote for you

263
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
is a hundred percent of the best.

264
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You should support the staff

265
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
with all your efforts.

266
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,620
I believe that with your brotherhood and the

267
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,000
isolation, you will make more powerful judgments.

268
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's the patient in the second room.

269
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We need to observe it again.

270
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Okay, Dr. Shang.

271
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Ji Xing.

272
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yichen.

273
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
President Han is going to be discharged today.

274
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yes.

275
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Is there any problem?

276
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't be nervous.

277
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
He will recover well after he is recovered.

278
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
After he returns,

279
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
he must have more rest.

280
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
He can do some functional training

281
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
in the right time.

282
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
In addition to blood circulation,

283
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
there are some symptoms of disease.

284
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The cut is

285
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
to be changed to a new medicine in three days.

286
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
After a week,

287
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
he will come to the hospital to remove the line.

288
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
After a month,

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
he can normally be active.

290
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Remember,

291
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
if you have to go out,

292
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
you must use the wheelchair to take a walk.

293
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay.

294
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Thank you.

295
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You have worked hard these days.

296
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You are welcome.

297
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Seeing you and him going through so many things,

298
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I feel that

299
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
he might be the one who is most suitable for you.

300
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Xing Xing.

301
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Congratulations.

302
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Thank you.

303
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
By the way,

304
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I need to ask you for a favor.

305
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You are too exaggerated.

306
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I asked Shao Yichen specifically.

307
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He said that you can't walk more now.

308
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
If you have to go to the board tomorrow,

309
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
you have to wear the customized external fixed equipment.

310
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Even so,

311
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
the time of the exhibition

312
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
can't exceed one hour.

313
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's still the way to think about it.

314
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Leave the equipment to me.

315
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But you have to promise me

316
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
that you will be very careful tomorrow.

317
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I will listen to the plan of the CEO.

318
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What?

319
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You want to kiss me?

320
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I will have to wait for you to kiss me.

321
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Who said that I can't kiss you?

322
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Come here.

323
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Come here.

324
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Come here.

325
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Let's go.

326
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You can go by yourself.

327
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You are quite smooth.

328
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I will do it.

329
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
How is it?

330
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Is it a little more comfortable?

331
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's more comfortable.

332
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Don't worry.

333
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Tang Song,

334
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
drive slowly.

335
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Okay, CEO Ji.

336
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The meeting is over.

337
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Love is real.

338
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
SK2 is bringing you to the right content.

339
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We are back in our company.

340
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Still so headache.

341
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm so tired.

342
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This is really a hard experience.

343
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Just one time is enough.

344
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I can't take it anymore.

345
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I will go to the office.

346
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You take off your clothes.

347
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Why don't you move?

348
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I am a patient now.

349
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What do you mean?

350
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Help me.

351
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I will be back.

352
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I will be back.

353
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I will be back.

354
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I will be back.

355
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I will be back.

356
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I will be back.

357
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I will be back.

358
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I will be back.

359
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Mr. Han,

360
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
you have to practice more.

361
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You can recover faster.

362
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I can't do it myself.

363
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Help me.

364
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Then you beg me.

365
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Please, Ji Zou.

366
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
If you don't help me,

367
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I will not clean the dishes.

368
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay, okay.

369
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I will clean the dishes.

370
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Come, let me help you.

371
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Come, hands up.

372
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Be careful.

373
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Be careful.

374
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Be careful.

375
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Be careful.

376
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Be careful.

377
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't move.

378
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Be gentle.

379
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What? I am gentle enough.

380
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Ji Zou.

381
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Okay, okay.

382
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Raise your hand higher.

383
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You are like a child now.

384
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Ji Zou.

385
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
No, no.

386
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Go away.

387
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What's wrong?

388
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I am still very worried.

389
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,800
If you lose your stubbornness,

390
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,440
Even if you have the evidence,

391
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,920
you can't do it for too long.

392
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,440
Give me the mask tomorrow.

393
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,560
It will take too long.

394
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,960
You won't be able to lose.

395
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,360
Don't think too much.

396
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,880
You need to have a good health now.

397
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,520
Use the best condition

398
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,840
to face the colleagues.

399
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,840
Got it?

400
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,080
Go to sleep.

401
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,040
Nothing goes on.

402
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,400
Goodbye.

403
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
character

404
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,880
I've made all the cancellation.

405
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,440
I'm not nervous now.

406
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,320
You must take it easier.

407
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,760
I'll always be by your side.

408
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,320
Thank you.

409
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,920
I don't want to say thank you.

410
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,480
Wait for your safety

411
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,680
and thank me again.

412
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,120
For today's board,

413
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,800
can you give me a gift first?

414
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,840
Safety first.

415
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,000
Everyone

416
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,520
introduce yourself.

417
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,120
This is Shuanghai Given-には浦总 prepared.

418
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,440
I'm a retired AI person,

419
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,120
Good morning Director.

420
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,320
Sit.

421
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
Zhou Duo,

422
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,320
I have something to say.

423
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,320
At present,

424
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,320
we are investing in the top-level funds every year,

425
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
and we are moving to the society.

426
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
And after graduation,

427
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,320
we may not be able to work for our winter clothes.

428
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,320
Mr. Han,

429
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,320
Mr. Han,

430
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,320
you are not doing business.

431
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,320
You are doing charity with the interests of the shareholders.

432
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,320
Your concern is also the most important.

433
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,320
Did AI talent stock support the new profit point in the East and West?

434
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,320
The answer is definitely so.

435
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
Wang Jingle said,

436
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,320
recently, Han Xin has encountered a round-trip crisis.

437
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
Fortunately, Mr. Qin Li,

438
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
the consultant of AI talent stock,

439
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,320
has joined us in the cooperation of the German Gold and Gold materials.

440
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
Not only has he helped us through the southern gate,

441
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,320
but also helped us to establish a stable source of raw materials.

442
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Currently,

443
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,320
AI talent stock is developing rapidly.

444
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,320
And the potential of the technology is still at the stage of the laboratory.

445
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,320
Who can accelerate technology breakthrough and industrial application?

446
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,320
Who is the biggest winner of AI talent stock?

447
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,320
I believe that you all don't want to give up this big cake, do you?

448
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,320
I agree with Mr. Han's point of view.

449
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,320
The most important thing in the technology era is to take up the development of advanced machines.

450
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Otherwise, you will lose the competitive power.

451
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
Mr. He,

452
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,320
you should know that

453
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,320
AI talent stock is a project that is fully built and has a burning potential.

454
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
The potential investment is too big.

455
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,320
The waiting time for profit is too long.

456
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,320
The actual profit is not certain at all.

457
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
Mr. Ji,

458
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
you just said that

459
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,320
many technologies are still at the stage of the laboratory.

460
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,320
Then why can you guarantee that

461
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,320
it will be a big cake in the future?

462
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,320
Mr. Ji,

463
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,320
you are right.

464
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
Everyone,

465
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
as long as you are willing,

466
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,320
we will invest half a year of our sweat

467
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,320
into the construction of AI talent stock.

468
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,320
After AI talent stock is established,

469
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,320
we will be able to

470
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
make the profit.

471
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,320
How long has Han Xingcai been established?

472
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,320
How much profit can it have?

473
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,320
After you start building AI talent stock,

474
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
you will have no money.

475
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
You still have to give us money.

476
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,320
Han Xingchen,

477
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,320
you are right.

478
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,320
Han Xingchen has been established for only half a year.

479
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,320
We have made a decision for this half a year.

480
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,320
The profit is 6 million yuan.

481
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,320
If you are satisfied with the profit,

482
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,320
you should believe Mr. Ji's work ability.

483
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,320
My attitude is to support the profit.

484
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Thank you for your support.

485
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Han Xingchen has also made a prediction for the next half a year.

486
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,320
He has made a very good decision.

487
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
The prediction is very good.

488
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
I believe that the growth goal of next year

489
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
can be achieved.

490
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
So you don't have to worry.

491
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,320
We have enough money to cover the profit of AI talent stock.

492
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,320
Mr. Xiao, you are not just a long-time employee.

493
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,320
Mr. Zhou and Mr. Yang are afraid of hurting you.

494
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,320
They are also in love.

495
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
That's right.

496
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,320
After all, the profit of the sea is also part of the profit of the East.

497
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,320
In the end, the establishment of AI talent stock

498
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,320
is the money of the East.

499
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,320
So about the target of this year's business,

500
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
Mr. Han,

501
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,320
do you want to make another military coup?

502
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,320
Mr. Yang, Han Ting is very ambitious.

503
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,320
When I was joking with him last time,

504
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,320
I lost all the shares of the East.

505
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
If you do this,

506
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,320
I'm not afraid that he will kick you out of the board.

507
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,320
Mr. Yuan is joking.

508
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,320
Mr. Yang was also joking.

509
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,320
Since Mr. Han is so persistent,

510
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,320
I think we should still look at the final result.

511
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
Now start to express

512
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
the same hand.

513
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
Thank you for your support.

514
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,320
AI talent stock will not disappoint you.

515
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
You are so annoying.

516
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
I'm sorry.

517
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
I'm sorry.

518
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
What nonsense are you making?

519
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
You are actually helping Han Ting in the board meeting.

520
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
I'm just talking about the matter.

521
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,320
What is the matter?

522
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
The East is the core of the Group.

523
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
The East is not stable in your position.

524
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,320
Now you don't bring back the East.

525
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,320
The resources of the Group will be cleared up to the East.

526
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
No one will remember that you have said good things for him.

527
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
I have thought it through.

528
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,320
Developing the East is not necessarily a step in the East.

529
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
Han Ting is not far behind.

530
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,320
We are not good to the East.

531
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,320
If Han Ting's future layout is successful,

532
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,320
Mr. Zhou, you just need to wait and see.

533
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
Mr. Yuan.

534
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Mr. Zhou.

535
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,320
Since you don't recognize Han Ting's approach,

536
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,320
you don't need to worry about the East anymore.

537
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,320
You are also at the age to retire anyway.

538
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
You are...

539
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
Mr. Chu.

540
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
Go to study now.

541
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
Mr. Tang,

542
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,320
Manager Han said that he's going to be out of business for two weeks.

543
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,320
The news must be closed.

544
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Okay, Mr. Ji.

545
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
I'll leave now.

546
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
You can call me if you have anything to talk to me about.

547
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
It must be very painful.

548
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
Then you rest first. I'll cook.

549
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
With me.

550
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
Okay.

551
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
I'll cook.

552
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
Sister Li.

553
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,320
Peach blossom and star anise.

554
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,320
You're not feeling well.

555
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Don't drink.

556
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
There's one thing

557
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
I thought about.

558
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
I still have to tell you.

559
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,320
I called the German申請 again.

560
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
President Luo has been forced.

561
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
This is a good thing.

562
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
Congratulations.

563
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
Go to Germany.

564
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Take good care of yourself.

565
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,320
Study hard.

566
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Come on.

567
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,320
President Su.

568
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,320
President Li.

569
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
President Su. Congratulations.

570
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,320
Congratulations on your victory.

571
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,320
Thank you.

572
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
You two.

573
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,320
I'll go first.

574
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,320
Come on, President Su.

575
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,320
After you go to Germany,

576
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,320
we will all miss you.

577
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,320
You're quite smart.

578
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,320
Brother Shang told me.

579
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
I'll go to work now.

580
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,320
Brother Shang.

581
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
Come on.

582
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,320
Peach blossom and star anise.

583
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,320
You're not feeling well.

584
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,320
Don't drink.

585
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,320
President Su.

586
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
Congratulations on your victory.

587
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,320
Thank you.

588
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,920
And I want to see Miss membrane

589
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,880
The problem is

590
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,880
I want to see Miss membrane

591
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,280
I know

592
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,400
Watch out

593
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,120
Isn't it

594
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:31,880
Miss mermaid

595
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,960
Miss mermaid

596
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,160
Tell me

597
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,920
Miss mermaid

598
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,880
I'm not bad.

599
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,160
My brother has a good taste in people's eyes.

600
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,440
Does he know you want to cooperate with us?

601
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,080
He's more excited about Dongke than I am.

602
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,080
Dongke's smart Internet technology is very mature.

603
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,240
And Han Xin's 3D medical printing

604
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,680
can help Dongke

605
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,800
develop medical smart Internet business.

606
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,800
Han Xin and Dongke

607
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,440
must be very close.

608
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,000
Next week,

609
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,120
let's meet the technical department

610
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,440
and work together.

611
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:13,800
Okay.

612
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,760
Mr. Yuan.

613
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,080
Have a good cooperation.

614
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,880
Have a good cooperation.

615
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,840
Qixing,

616
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,760
we're a family in the future.

617
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,000
Don't call me Mr. Yuan anymore.

618
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,160
Call me Sister Yuan.

619
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,880
Okay, Sister Yuan.

620
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,560
Yes.

621
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,000
Mr. Li.

622
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I have something to report to you.

623
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,680
What is it?

624
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,480
It's a long story.

625
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,280
We'll have a meal together after work.

626
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
We can have a meal together.

627
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,360
Okay.

628
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
I'll go to work.

629
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,560
Why are you working again?

630
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,560
You're so good at this.

631
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,280
Deyi, you're not bad.

632
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,840
Is there anything else

633
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,360
other than this?

634
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,920
I miss you today.

635
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,040
I know.

636
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,240
What else?

637
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,600
I went to see Sister Yuan.

638
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,040
I want to work with Dongke.

639
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
Not only once?

640
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,800
I saw it before the board meeting.

641
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,280
She cares about your health

642
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,520
and cares about your opinion.

643
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,760
She even asked

644
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,000
if you want to work with them.

645
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,640
What do you mean?

646
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,880
Mr. Han is more excited about

647
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,920
the East Asia Technology than me.

648
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,560
Mr. Ji's level of fraud

649
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,840
is getting higher.

650
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,880
Isn't that Mr. Han's new voice?

651
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,240
Yes.

652
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,040
I didn't expect you'd find him.

653
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,240
I want to see your sister's struggle

654
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,080
and know who will be in the future.

655
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,320
But I know

656
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,560
it's not what you want to see.

657
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,040
Did Sister Yuan go to the hospital to see you?

658
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,520
I know.

659
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,120
She's my sister.

660
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,480
She's a strong woman.

661
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,560
Mr. Li, why don't you eat?

662
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,160
hebben

663
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,160
Mr. Manor.

664
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,480
Mr. Yuan,

665
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,400
have you run into any trouble

666
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,360
in your work recently?

667
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,160
Mr. Li,

668
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,440
Mrs. Su

669
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,840
sent me theknown

670
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,080
微hop to wish me good luck.

671
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,440
This is

672
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,280
Xiaozong,

673
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,240
you don't have to tell me this.

674
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,800
I'm just a normal friend of Mr. Su.

675
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,480
Mr. Li,

676
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,760
there are some things that are related to the audience.

677
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,440
Maybe you don't think so.

678
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,040
But in my opinion,

679
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,440
you don't have feelings for Mr. Su.

680
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,160
Mr. Su is about to leave the country.

681
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,040
It's impossible for me and him.

682
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,400
But you don't want to leave him, do you?

683
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,600
He likes you so much.

684
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,440
As long as you say it,

685
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,400
he will stay for you.

686
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,800
substances.

687
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:07,880
Mr. Li,

688
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,640
don't get me wrong.

689
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,800
I don't want to chase your personal life.

690
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,840
I only have a feeling for Mr. Su.

691
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,400
He is very nice.

692
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,880
I've also been going over him.

693
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,760
Although heans me politely,

694
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,920
but

695
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,080
I still hope he can be happy.

696
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,040
to be happy.

697
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,600
The adult world

698
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,080
is not a relationship

699
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,360
that has to be borrowed.

700
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,680
I have had a sense of

701
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,000
the beginning of the time.

702
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,720
The result is a mental injury.

703
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,640
For me now,

704
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,160
I don't want to repeat the responsibility anymore.

705
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,440
And Mr. Su is a great man.

706
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,800
When he sees a bigger world,

707
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,520
he won't have a feeling for the present.

708
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,040
Mr. Li,

709
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,760
you seem to be a little pessimistic

710
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,480
about my words.

711
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,040
Maybe the current trend

712
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,960
can't be underestimated by Mr. Su's feelings.

713
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,480
Instead, it will make him

714
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,920
more optimistic about his heart.

715
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,200
So,

716
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,280
do you want to give him another chance?

717
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,760
Mr. Su is different from the person

718
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,720
you met before.

719
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,400
In the years to come,

720
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,320
it's even more difficult to let his career go up.

721
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,200
I can't let him give up his career on his own.

722
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,040
Mr. Li,

723
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,480
you like Mr. Su,

724
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
right?

725
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,800
Eat it.

726
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,000
Okay.

727
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,320
All right, all right.

728
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,160
All right, all right.

729
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,320
You're so stubborn.

730
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,400
You're so stubborn.

731
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,240
Look at your shoes.

732
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,040
They're all gone.

733
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,040
Don't bother.

734
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,400
Go, go.

735
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,040
You're not like him.

736
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,360
You're so polite.

737
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,120
Have a good rest.

738
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,440
Whose letter

739
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,640
is so happy?

740
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,360
Grandpa,

741
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,440
Xiaoting said thank you.

742
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,800
Don't move.

743
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,000
Don't move.

744
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,000
Just a scratch.

745
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,320
Don't be nervous.

746
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,320
Let me kiss you.

747
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,240
Don't move.

748
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,480
I have a knife on my hand.

749
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,600
Please kiss me.

750
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,040
Don't move.

751
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,680
All right, all right.

752
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,360
Don't move.

753
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,640
I don't want to leave a mark

754
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,800
on such a beautiful face.

755
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,760
Wow, so thirsty.

756
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,640
I suddenly want to drink milk.

757
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,360
Come back.

758
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,960
Don't make me beg you.

759
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,880
I really can't.

760
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,560
I drank a month's stock.

761
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,400
It's all the taste of the stock.

762
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,160
I'm still making it for you.

763
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,560
What?

764
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,680
Lianhou brand stock?

765
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,000
The mountain medicine half stock.

766
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,080
The sea bag half stock.

767
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,200
The corn half stock.

768
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,080
Actually, I've recovered.

769
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,400
I'm alive now.

770
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,320
Look.

771
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,920
Be careful.

772
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,520
We can change the taste.

773
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,960
You don't need to drink the stock.

774
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,640
Actually, I drink with you.

775
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,080
But what about this pot?

776
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,520
Don't waste it.

777
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,960
I have a way.

778
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,640
First, we can make a bowl of soup by ourselves.

779
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,120
The weight of the bowl.

780
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,400
Then whoever makes the soup

781
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,760
will win the most gold 100 grams.

782
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,880
The loser will finish the soup.

783
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,880
No problem.

784
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,000
I'll go first.

785
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,520
You go first.

786
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,800
100 grams.

787
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
The quantity of foods I use

788
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,240
is pretty serious.

789
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,200
Fine.

790
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,800
Start.

791
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
102.

792
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,440
Go ahead.

793
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,800
I don't want to.

794
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,080
Let me.

795
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:14,920
All right.

796
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,800
Drink it first.

797
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,760
Just win.

798
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,800
boarding food Melon in naught.

799
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,920
I'm not afraid of you

800
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,920
I'm afraid of you

801
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,920
I'm afraid of you

802
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,920
I'm afraid of you

803
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
I'm afraid of you

804
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,920
I'm afraid of you

805
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,920
I'm afraid of you

806
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
I'm afraid of you

807
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
I'm afraid of you

808
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,920
I'm afraid of you

809
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,920
I'm afraid of you

810
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,920
I'm afraid of you

811
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,920
I'm afraid of you

812
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,920
I'm afraid of you

813
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,920
I'm afraid of you

814
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
I'm afraid of you

815
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,920
I'm afraid of me

816
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,840
I'm afraid of you

817
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,920
o exponential

818
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,680
We have to agree

819
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,880
because we are so tough

820
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,880
We have to agree

821
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,880
because we are so tough

822
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,880
We need to agree

823
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,880
because we are so tough

824
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,880
We need to agree

825
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,880
Because we are so tough

826
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,880
We need to agree

827
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,880
than give up

828
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:26,880
I'm looking forward to the day you will come back

829
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,880
Not to open the mouth and hold it

830
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,880
There is no red and red poisonous pig

831
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:43,880
Once again, even if I'm sad

832
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,880
I still have no worries

833
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,880
It's a passing time

834
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,880
I drank about 1314 glasses today

835
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,880
How about you?

836
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,880
I drank 521 glasses

837
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,880
I suddenly feel that the water is not good every day

838
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,880
Tomorrow, how about making another one?

839
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,880
You cook tomorrow

840
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,880
Where are you going?

841
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,880
It's convenient

842
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,880
This is the recommendation plan of the Guanghua data library

843
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,880
Our technical department has started to build their own data library

844
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,880
Xiaobai can slowly take advantage of the dependence on the East medical data library

845
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,880
I'm not worried about the business of Guanghua

846
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,880
Try it

847
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,880
Why don't you drink tea recently?

848
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,880
You changed to coffee

849
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,880
Isn't this what you like?

850
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,880
I just simply studied it

851
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,880
You didn't drink last time

852
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,880
You should try it this time

853
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,880
How is the taste?

854
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,880
Your hand-chopped coffee technique is better than your main tea

855
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,880
The color is more important

856
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,880
I tried it a few times

857
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,880
The chance of success is 50%

858
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,880
I wanted to bet this time

859
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,880
I didn't expect it to fail

860
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,880
How about this?

861
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,880
I'll try it a few more times

862
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,880
Next time

863
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,880
I'll definitely give you a successful one

864
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,880
President Chang has been very idle recently

865
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,880
What?

866
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,880
You're not satisfied with the quality?

867
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,880
What?

868
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,880
Do you think it's stable?

869
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,880
Dongge and Dongyi always have the same old relationship

870
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,880
I want to win the Han Ting because of Dongge

871
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,880
Xiaodi

872
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,880
You have been so persistent about Han Ting

873
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,880
Is it because you can't let him go?

874
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,880
President Chang

875
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,880
Am I such a silly woman in your eyes?

876
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,880
Since you signed the contract

877
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,880
Guanghua is completely in the same class

878
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,880
I hope we can win the same class like you

879
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,880
Okay

880
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,880
It will be fast this day

881
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,880
I'm afraid I can't win the Han Ting

882
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,880
I'm afraid I can't win the Han Ting

883
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,880
I'm afraid I can't win the Han Ting

884
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,880
I'm afraid I can't win the Han Ting

885
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,880
I'm afraid I can't win the Han Ting

886
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,880
I'm afraid I can't win the Han Ting

887
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,880
I'm afraid I can't win the Han Ting

888
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,880
I'm afraid I can't win the Han Ting

889
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,880
I'm afraid I can't win the Han Ting

890
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,880
I'm afraid I can't win the Han Ting

891
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,880
I'm afraid I can't win the Han Ting

892
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,880
I'm afraid I can't win the Han Ting

893
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,880
I'm afraid I can't win the Han Ting

894
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,880
I'm afraid I can't win the Han Ting

895
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,880
Must have the right to feel sorry

896
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,880
an idea of all kind

897
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:05,880
Feelings become the natural environment

898
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,880
No, not anymore
