1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to the sky to the top

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It will be hard to be firm

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'll do my best in the future

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to the sky to the top

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't give up

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll be more confident and remember

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Even if I don't know who I am

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If there's nothing else, I'll leave first

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Mr. Su

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I like you

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I know you only like Mr. Li

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I just want to tell you my heart

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
After I got into the company

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You helped me a lot

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I liked you from then on

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You are the vice president of the company

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You don't lack any armor

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You are very serious when you work

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I hope you can consider me

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You are a good girl

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I just treat you as a colleague and a normal friend

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm willing to wait

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I hope you don't waste your time on me

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I have a boyfriend

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And I'm sure of it

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So don't waste your time on me

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I know

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sorry

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's okay

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't have to get a reply

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll adjust myself

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Mr. Su

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Don't be too careless

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I hope we can be friends

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I will

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You can go back to rest

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm leaving

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll see you again

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll see you again

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's nothing

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,960
I'm just kidding.

54
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,400
These are all gifts you gave me.

55
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,920
I'll go back

56
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,320
to the housekeeper.

57
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,920
Can we

58
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,720
say nothing else today?

59
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,360
There's one more thing.

60
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,520
Xiao Yu Xiao.

61
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,840
Next time, drink more.

62
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,280
Don't call me again.

63
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,000
Grandpa.

64
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,960
Xiao Yu.

65
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,960
How long have you been looking for your home?

66
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,240
You know

67
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,560
you have this grandpa.

68
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,400
I've been busy with work lately.

69
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,720
These days,

70
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,960
I'm with your girl

71
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,920
in the US.

72
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,200
Come back to eat when you have time.

73
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,560
We'll talk.

74
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,040
Grandpa.

75
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,360
I want to take someone

76
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,320
to eat.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,800
Ji Xing.

78
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,640
Yes.

79
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,280
I'm with him.

80
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,680
I want to say that I'm with him

81
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,200
and I want to see you.

82
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,640
Okay.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,520
Grandpa.

84
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Don't be scared.

85
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,040
Okay.

86
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,120
I'll hang up.

87
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,600
What's the matter?

88
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,720
You don't look very happy.

89
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,320
We promoted theå¼• coffee lifts

90
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,080
to the press and went to Hong Kong.

91
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,560
I still need to tell them

92
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,800
that we mentioned Han Hai

93
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,240
in my debut album.

94
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,620
Like this...

95
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,240
time

96
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,760
will be better.

97
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,720
It's clear

98
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,840
that Hank's as good

99
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,520
asland is mature.

100
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,200
But I'molting

101
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
currentCEA

102
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,080
is fast-paced.

103
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,900
Now they can't de suka to others.

104
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,680
Don't worry.

105
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:06,520
Linteltree

106
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,320
and technology

107
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,640
are both infrastructure of a company.

108
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,240
Only one of them

109
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,800
will get domain

110
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,360
to ruleHa still up

111
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
I'm the one behind you.

112
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,360
And don't think too much

113
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
about me being behind you.

114
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Come on, Mr. Ji.

115
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Mr. Han,

116
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
the competition between Xing Chen and Han Hai

117
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,360
is just a beginning for the first-time project.

118
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm worried

119
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,360
that something like this will happen in the future.

120
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,360
It's not convenient for you

121
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
to announce the relationship between you and Han Hai.

122
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Mr. Ji is your girlfriend.

123
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,360
I'm not good at

124
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,360
handling Xing Chen's financial relationship.

125
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Where are we?

126
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
At Grandpa's house.

127
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
We've made an appointment.

128
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Let's have dinner together.

129
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Mr. Ji,

130
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,360
why didn't you tell me in advance?

131
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
I didn't prepare anything.

132
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
I should change my clothes.

133
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
I'm...

134
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
You look beautiful in the same way.

135
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,360
But I want to leave a good impression.

136
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Don't worry.

137
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
I prepared a gift for you.

138
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
This...

139
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
is a pair of shoes

140
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
from my new necklace.

141
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
I'll wear it now.

142
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
Okay.

143
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Come on.

144
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Be careful.

145
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Do I look good?

146
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
I've seen your parents.

147
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Now I'll take you to see my grandpa.

148
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
I'll do my best.

149
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Don't worry.

150
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
No.

151
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
I just want to tell you

152
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
that we've met each other's parents.

153
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
So you can't turn back.

154
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
In the future,

155
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
no matter what happens,

156
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
you can't turn back.

157
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
I don't know who's going to turn back.

158
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Let's go.

159
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
Grandma Gu.

160
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
You're here.

161
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Hello.

162
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
You're Ji Xing.

163
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,360
I'm prettier than a picture.

164
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
Okay.

165
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Don't scare her.

166
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Scared?

167
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
You're Lu Ling's mother.

168
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,360
You're so smart.

169
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,360
I heard from Xiaomeng

170
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
that his good friend Ji Xing

171
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
finally found someone today.

172
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Xiaomeng always told me about you.

173
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
Really?

174
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
What did he say?

175
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
He said you sing well.

176
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
He said your soup is delicious.

177
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
It's not a surprise that you sing well.

178
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
But my soup is really good.

179
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
I'll find a chance to

180
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
go to my house with Xiaomeng

181
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
and make you a soup.

182
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
Okay.

183
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
Come in.

184
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
Let's go.

185
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
I'm waiting for you.

186
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
I'm so bored.

187
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
Come on.

188
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
It smells good.

189
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
You're here.

190
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
You're Ji Xing, right?

191
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Let me introduce you.

192
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
This is my cousin Tang.

193
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
This is my aunt.

194
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
My uncle is here to cook.

195
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Hello, aunt.

196
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Hello, President Yuan.

197
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,360
You're so handsome.

198
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
This is my first time

199
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,360
to bring you some gifts.

200
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Thank you.

201
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
You're welcome.

202
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
Come on.

203
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Sit down.

204
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
Stand up.

205
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
Sit down.

206
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
Sit down.

207
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
Sit down.

208
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
President Han,

209
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
I'll let you go.

210
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
Go.

211
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Don't worry.

212
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
I'm here.

213
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
We can chat.

214
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Here.

215
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
What are you doing?

216
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Go and get someone to sit.

217
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
Sit down.

218
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Sit down.

219
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Have some tea.

220
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Okay.

221
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
Thank you.

222
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Fenghuang Dancong

223
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
has very little production this year.

224
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
These are

225
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,360
from the previous period.

226
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
I won't drink it.

227
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
Dancong is very good at stomach.

228
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
I'm not very comfortable recently.

229
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
The tea is very fragrant.

230
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
President Zeng is very good at it.

231
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
By the way, Jixin.

232
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Where are you from?

233
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
What do you do at home?

234
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
I'm from Chuan.

235
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
My mother works in the community.

236
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
My father is from the individual household.

237
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
You're from Chuan?

238
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
No wonder.

239
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
I said,

240
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
why is the child's skin so good?

241
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
You must have had a lot of trouble

242
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,360
with your daughter's family.

243
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
Fortunately, you met Xiaoting.

244
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Actually, I think

245
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Xiaoting met Xingxing

246
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
because of her luck.

247
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
What time is it?

248
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
It's time for dinner.

249
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
We don't drink tea.

250
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Let's go down and eat.

251
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
We can chat while eating.

252
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
Let's go.

253
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Go.

254
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
You two, come down quickly.

255
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
Come here.

256
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
Okay.

257
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
It's so lean.

258
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Eat more.

259
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Here.

260
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Xingxing, sit here.

261
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Love me.

262
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Don't be nervous.

263
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
Look.

264
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
Tell me what you want to eat.

265
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
I'll make it for you.

266
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
Thank you, aunt.

267
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,360
Why do you call me aunt?

268
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
You're so popular.

269
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
Besides,

270
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
Xiaoting called me aunt.

271
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
You called me aunt.

272
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
You're so clumsy.

273
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
You're just like Xiaoting.

274
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
You called me aunt.

275
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Aunt.

276
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,360
Xingxing.

277
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Grandpa.

278
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
This is my girlfriend, Xingxing.

279
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Hello, chairman.

280
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Hello.

281
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
Sit down.

282
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
Sit down.

283
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Come on.

284
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Let's eat.

285
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Let's eat.

286
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
I heard you and Han Ting

287
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
are college classmates.

288
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
It's been ten years.

289
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
She voted for you

290
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
once she returned to the country.

291
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
It seems she doesn't forget you.

292
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
President Yuan, you forgot.

293
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
You made a bet earlier than Han Ting.

294
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,360
If I hadn't been with her for years,

295
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,360
maybe I would have been in the east now.

296
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
Right.

297
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
I also snatched her from me.

298
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
I don't mind.

299
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
What's the problem?

300
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,360
The family is the same.

301
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Actually,

302
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
President Yuan gave me a good condition.

303
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
I was moved.

304
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
But Han Ting's mind

305
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
and the mind were more harmonious.

306
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
After I discussed with the partners,

307
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
I chose Dongyi.

308
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
Now it seems that the same rules are applied.

309
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
Dongyi and Dongke are all

310
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
East Asia Group's companies.

311
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
In the end,

312
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
we are all working for our Group.

313
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
In the world,

314
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
the most successful one

315
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
is Han Hai.

316
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
Xixing,

317
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
how long

318
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
will it take

319
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
to catch up

320
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,360
with Han Hai?

321
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,360
The product and technology

322
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
are a company's foundation.

323
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,360
Only by focusing on your own business

324
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
can you make up for your mistakes.

325
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
I'm afraid that

326
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
you will be disappointed.

327
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
I think

328
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Xincheng

329
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
can't surpass Han Hai

330
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
in a short time.

331
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Or,

332
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
surpass Han Hai

333
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
in the future.

334
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
The End

335
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
Episode 17

336
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Love is True Love

337
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
The S&K 2 brings you to the right content.

338
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
The door is open.

339
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Han Hai has been

340
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
working for five years.

341
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Now he is a model.

342
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,360
Instead of going to the wide range with them,

343
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360
I want to focus on

344
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,360
the field of stocks and stocks.

345
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,360
I want to make this a good idea

346
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,360
and make my own profit.

347
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
The family business is over.

348
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,360
The family business is over.

349
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
The work is over.

350
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,360
Let's eat, brother.

351
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Okay, let's eat.

352
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Let's eat.

353
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
Xixing,

354
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
eat some beef.

355
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Thank you.

356
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Eat more.

357
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,360
The End

358
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,360
Xiaoting is very busy

359
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,360
after returning from the country.

360
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,360
So she doesn't come back often.

361
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,360
Have you two been together?

362
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Has she bullied you?

363
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,360
No.

364
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,360
She treats me well.

365
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
So she looks

366
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,360
like she is very considerate to you.

367
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Xiaoting was very lively

368
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
when she was young.

369
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
She loved to laugh.

370
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,360
She was such a child.

371
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Later,

372
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,360
after her parents' accident,

373
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,360
she became more and more tender.

374
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
She was always alone.

375
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,360
She was not alone.

376
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
Especially after she went to Germany,

377
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
she became

378
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,360
a soldier.

379
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,360
She was always alone.

380
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,360
She didn't tell her family

381
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
about anything.

382
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,360
She was always alone

383
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,360
in all the hardships.

384
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
Be careful.

385
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
I asked her

386
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
about something in Germany before.

387
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
She always went there

388
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
with a lot of worries.

389
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
Maybe she didn't want

390
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
everyone to worry about her.

391
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,360
So she is independent and sensible.

392
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
She is always

393
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
caring about others.

394
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
But I found out

395
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
after Xiaoting was with you,

396
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
she changed.

397
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,360
She changed to say what she wanted

398
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
and to laugh.

399
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
She also knows how to love others.

400
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
To be honest,

401
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
I am really happy for you.

402
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Thank you, Mrs. Gu.

403
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
Xinxing.

404
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,360
Good night.

405
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,360
Your character is so beautiful.

406
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
I gave you this pavilion.

407
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,360
It's a pre-regional order

408
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,360
to accept the court.

409
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Great.

410
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
Thank you.

411
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
What's the meaning

412
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,360
of your parents' love?

413
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
They said

414
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
when I was born,

415
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,360
my eyes were big,

416
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,360
shining like stars.

417
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
That's why I named it.

418
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
It seems

419
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,360
you two are

420
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
far apart.

421
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
Yes.

422
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,360
We are quite far apart.

423
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,360
Stars are small and small.

424
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,360
But she is still

425
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,360
insisting on her light.

426
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,360
Xingxing can be far apart.

427
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,360
I think my parents

428
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,360
also hope that

429
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
their children

430
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
can be together.

431
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
This character is not dry at all.

432
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
I will give it to you

433
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,360
when I get the chance.

434
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
Okay.

435
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,360
I just had a meal

436
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,360
and it was like a bed.

437
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
What's wrong?

438
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,360
Are you scared?

439
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,360
No.

440
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
If the chairman can write

441
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,360
the stars and pavilion,

442
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,360
at least it's not annoying.

443
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,360
But she said

444
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,360
when I get the chance

445
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
to give this character to me,

446
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
not the scene,

447
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
it means

448
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
I haven't completely

449
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,360
taken it from her.

450
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
It seems that my grandfather's feelings

451
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
are very transparent

452
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,360
by your touch.

453
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
I'm with you all the time.

454
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,360
I can see

455
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
your heart

456
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
with this.

457
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Don't say that.

458
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
The chairman's words

459
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
are really good.

460
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
Of course.

461
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,360
My grandfather has been practicing

462
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
for decades.

463
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
His words are very powerful.

464
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
He is very natural.

465
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
Is your character

466
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
so good?

467
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
Is it a legend?

468
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Yes.

469
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,360
You have to practice more with me.

470
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,360
Maybe

471
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
you can also

472
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
pass on your grandfather's power in the future.

473
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,360
It's a legend.

474
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,360
I?

475
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
Guess.

476
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
Guess?

477
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,360
Why me?

478
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
What are you looking at?

479
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,360
You look so cute when you were young.

480
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
You are so bright and smiley.

481
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
Look.

482
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,360
Grandma Gu sent you a message.

483
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
Grandma Gu also told me

484
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
that

485
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,360
when you were in Germany,

486
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,360
you didn't want to tell your family.

487
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,360
I understand you.

488
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,360
But in the future,

489
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,360
you can tell me.

490
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,360
Okay.

491
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,360
You...

492
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,360
Are you sure it's her?

493
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,360
Yes.

494
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,360
This girl

495
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
is smart and proud.

496
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
She is very strong.

497
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
It's similar to you.

498
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,360
She has a lot of things

499
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,360
that I don't have.

500
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,360
She is

501
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,360
in a completely different life environment.

502
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,360
She is interested,

503
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,360
loves,

504
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,360
and thinks in a way

505
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
to look at the problem.

506
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,360
Even

507
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,360
values and love

508
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
are different.

509
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,360
Of course,

510
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,360
this is

511
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
the reason why you are breathing.

512
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,360
So the reason for the time

513
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
is the problem

514
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
that you have created.

515
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
We will work hard to merge.

516
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Combine?

517
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
How?

518
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
According to my observation,

519
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
you two are the same.

520
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,360
Once you have a problem,

521
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,360
you must have someone to help you.

522
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,360
You let her or she?

523
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
I let her.

524
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
Don't talk nonsense.

525
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
Think about it.

526
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Let's talk about it.

527
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,360
There are two people

528
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,360
who are not born.

529
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
I believe in our feelings.

530
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
This word

531
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
is not good.

532
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
No need to change it.

533
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,360
Not all words

534
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,360
should be changed.

535
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,360
Xin Xin.

536
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,360
Actually, Han Hai...

537
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
Who is it?

538
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,360
Chang He.

539
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
He said he wanted to invest in Xing Chen

540
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,360
and didn't mind working with you.

541
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,360
Why is he so interesting?

542
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
What do you think?

543
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,360
I can think so.

544
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,360
Of course, it's impossible.

545
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,360
He is your competitor.

546
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,360
I want to work with him.

547
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
I will betray you.

548
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,360
I know this point.

549
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,360
I will wash it.

550
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,360
I think

551
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,360
it's more convenient to like you.

552
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
Xin Xin.

553
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,360
Let's take video of Uncle and Aunt.

554
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,360
Let them know we are together.

555
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,360
OK.

556
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,360
My dear daughter,

557
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
what do you want to talk to me about?

558
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,080
Wait.

559
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,200
Old Ji, come here.

560
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,200
Your daughter is calling.

561
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:07,960
How is she?

562
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,040
She's fine.

563
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,360
Mr. Han is here, too.

564
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,200
Take it.

565
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:15,960
Hurry up.

566
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,480
Come on.

567
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,160
Let's go.

568
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,360
Uncle and Aunt,

569
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,440
I have something to tell you.

570
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
What is it?

571
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,600
We are together.

572
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,520
Han Ding is my boyfriend.

573
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,360
We are together.

574
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,800
What are you talking about?

575
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,080
I saw it earlier.

576
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,960
Good thing.

577
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,080
I'm so happy to see you.

578
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,800
Why?

579
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,360
When are you going to come home?

580
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,520
Aunt,

581
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,480
I'll go back with Xin Xin

582
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,960
next year.

583
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,480
Great.

584
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,800
Let's drink together.

585
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,080
You said you don't drink.

586
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,600
Yes.

587
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
Yes.

588
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,440
Fine.

589
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,760
Uncle drinks.

590
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,000
Drink some drinks.

591
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,840
Okay.

592
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,360
I'll drink with you.

593
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,920
I'll go back.

594
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,880
Bye.

595
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,960
Bye.

596
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,760
Uncle and Aunt, bye.

597
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,440
Bye.

598
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,160
Bye.

599
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,080
We've seen

600
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,440
the parents of the two families.

601
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,960
Please tell us what's going on.

602
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,520
The next day, it's going to be a meeting.

603
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,360
I have to get ready.

604
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,920
I can start from Rong Ying's team.

605
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,080
Yes.

606
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,920
I'm here to focus on my work.

607
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,240
I'm in charge of the marriage.

608
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,120
Mr. Yue.

609
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,680
There's news from Yang Qiong.

610
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,000
What did he say?

611
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,080
Yang Qiong told me

612
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,160
he's been talking to some

613
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,120
very close people with Mr. Han recently.

614
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,040
He knows that Chen Dingyang

615
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,520
was in Germany

616
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,080
when he first started working in Hanhai.

617
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,320
He and Mr. Han met each other during that time.

618
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,240
I checked the information.

619
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,000
After Mr. Han got admitted to East China

620
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,680
there was a close technical communication with Hanhai.

621
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,760
This is the technical communication information

622
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,800
of East China's Ministry of Industry and Industry.

623
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,840
Mr. Yue.

624
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,240
Are you in a hurry to see me?

625
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,040
Did something happen?

626
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,640
How's Xing Chen doing?

627
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,120
Xing Chen.

628
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,080
He's completely controlled by Han Ting.

629
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,080
All the things that happened in Beijing

630
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,800
are all up to him.

631
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,080
Oh, right.

632
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,320
I sent him a message last night.

633
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,040
He didn't reply until now.

634
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,000
He didn't reply.

635
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,600
I found some clues.

636
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,600
What clues?

637
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,440
Mr. Song.

638
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,200
Sister Yuan.

639
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,440
Mr. Song.

640
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:13,920
Sit here.

641
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,840
It's okay.

642
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,800
It's all up to him.

643
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,840
Xiaodi.

644
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,080
Han Ting brought the reporter to his house yesterday

645
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,360
and met with his grandpa.

646
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,680
Really?

647
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,200
Who would he take home with?

648
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,680
What does it have to do with me?

649
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,240
Since that's the case,

650
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,800
Han Ting will retire to the Guanhua Valley.

651
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,320
Why are you refusing?

652
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,840
Bring him back.

653
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,800
Mr. Chang.

654
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,920
Xiaodi is still young.

655
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,400
She'll help him in the future.

656
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,680
Mr. Qiao Yue said

657
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,000
I want to help him, of course.

658
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,320
But I have to

659
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,760
be qualified and famous.

660
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,760
Am I right?

661
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,160
Mr. Yuan.

662
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,160
You said half of it.

663
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,520
What's the clue

664
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
that you just mentioned?

665
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,200
I found out

666
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,000
Dongyi is responsible for the new product line.

667
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,800
There has been a very frequent

668
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,240
communication and communication with Han Hai.

669
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,000
Later, I found

670
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,240
an old man who sent Dongyi from Eastern Yang.

671
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,120
I found out that six years ago,

672
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,240
Han Ting was still in Germany.

673
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,600
She was very close to Han Hai's founders.

674
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,480
And no matter if it's in the capital or technology,

675
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,360
they gave them a lot of support.

676
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:17,880
Han Ting.

677
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,480
If Han Hai is Han Ting,

678
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,400
Han Hai and Xing Chen's business position

679
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,360
are basically the same.

680
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,680
And Han Hai is already in charge of the investment.

681
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,120
Why did he want to invest in Xing Chen?

682
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,320
So, the guy from Han Ting

683
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,440
took Xing Chen as his smoke bomb

684
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,400
and made a big deal out of it.

685
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,440
No wonder he can be so smart.

686
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,440
What a big game.

687
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,640
Since he treats Xing Chen as a pawn,

688
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,760
why don't we start from Xing Chen?

689
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,800
Okay.

690
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,400
Okay.

691
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,520
Here.

692
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,720
Mr. Yuan.

693
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,640
Mr. Yuan.

694
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,080
The door of Han Hai's annual

695
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,480
Feng's project is really basic.

696
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,120
Feng Teng was taken away by them.

697
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,600
The discussion about Huang Wei Wei

698
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,400
has a lot of influence on us.

699
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,240
I think

700
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,400
we have a lot more

701
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,040
on the stage than the one in Shenzhen.

702
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,720
Right?

703
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Xing is right.

704
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,720
Anyway,

705
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,240
there's Mr. Dong Yi and Han Hai

706
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,320
behind us.

707
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,120
Let's talk about it later.

708
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:55,960
Ji Xing.

709
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,200
Mr. Zeng.

710
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,600
Do you have time?

711
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,560
Go prepare the stage for the afternoon.

712
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,120
Let Xiao Shang prepare some publicity.

713
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:10,840
Okay.

714
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,520
Nan Ren.

715
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,000
There was a bad news.

716
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,480
Mr.Å¾e will be into a disaster.

717
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,240
Xiao bizai.

718
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,860
Xing Chen can

719
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,160
develop so quickly

720
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,120
in such a short period of time?

721
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,240
That's great.

722
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,640
Thank you.

723
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,960
You're very hardworking.

724
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,920
Do you think you've won me?

725
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,720
Guanghua is a medical engineer.

726
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,040
Xing Chen is a doctor.

727
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,640
We can work together.

728
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,120
We can't fight.

729
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,920
What's the point?

730
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,840
You haven't talked to Han Ting for a long time.

731
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,760
You've talked to Xue Leke for three points.

732
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,600
I grew up with her.

733
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,760
I didn't learn it.

734
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,520
You've won

735
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,600
this point.

736
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
If there's nothing else, I'll leave first.

737
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,760
Do you think you know Han Ting well?

738
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,560
Xing Chen has developed well,

739
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,480
but he can't compete with Han Hai.

740
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,720
It's not because of your skills.

741
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,960
It's because Han Hai has a big character

742
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,640
who's behind you.

743
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,520
When Han Ting was in Germany,

744
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,840
she invested in Han Hai.

745
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,240
She just returned to the country and was not stable.

746
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,040
What Han Yuan did was

747
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,760
to stop Han Hai from becoming a doctor.

748
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,240
She made a military order

749
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
to take time to change her clothes

750
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,960
and prepare for Han Hai to become a doctor.

751
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,800
As for Xing Chen,

752
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,640
it's just a smoke bomb

753
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,360
used to cover her eyes.

754
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,240
It's not a smoke bomb.

755
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,400
It's just a smoke bomb.

756
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,440
When the military order is done,

757
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,440
as for Xing Chen's life

758
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,040
or Xing Chen's death,

759
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,040
it depends on her mood.

760
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,240
Of course,

761
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,440
it depends on her preference for you.

762
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,040
You make her happy,

763
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,040
and she'll keep you.

764
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,840
If you don't like her,

765
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,040
she'll kick you to death.

766
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,840
You don't have to make a fuss about Li Jian.

767
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,440
Even if she invests in Han Hai,

768
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,840
it's her fault.

769
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,640
She didn't tell you

770
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,640
such an important thing.

771
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
I thought

772
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,240
you were talking nonsense.

773
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,840
Do you think you know her very well?

774
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,840
Yes.

775
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,240
If you really know her,

776
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,640
you can't stay with her.

777
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,840
She's a good man,

778
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,840
right?

779
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,440
It's hard for women to reject her.

780
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,840
But you...

781
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,640
You're stupid.

782
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,440
You never thought

783
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,440
she could not like you.

784
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,040
She likes you.

785
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,440
Is it simple?

786
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,440
Ji Xing,

787
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,440
the gift from the Secret Service

788
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
is only for you.

789
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,440
You only know to open it yourself.

790
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,840
You never thought

791
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,840
you'd pay the price

792
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,440
for the gift you received.

793
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,440
You're stupid.

794
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,640
You never thought

795
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,840
she could not like you.

796
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,840
She likes you.

797
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,640
Is it simple?

798
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,640
Why are you back?

799
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,840
What's wrong?

800
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,840
Today's exhibition

801
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,840
I found that Han Hai's development was too fast.

802
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,440
Xing Chen can't compare.

803
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,840
Xing Chen can't compare.

804
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,040
Xing Chen can't compare.

805
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,240
Xing Chen can't compare.

806
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,240
Han Hai has been stable for five or six years

807
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,840
and has advanced.

808
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,440
Xing Chen has developed very fast.

809
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,640
He has made many companies forget about him.

810
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,640
But when Xing Chen goes forward,

811
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,840
Han Hai won't stop.

812
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,240
What's wrong with you today?

813
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,840
Last time, you said that Han Hai

814
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,040
was not your goal.

815
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,640
You wanted to go your own way.

816
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,840
It's just an exhibition.

817
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,040
Did Han Hai let you go again?

818
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,840
When Han Hai is strong enough,

819
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,040
will he

820
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,240
be able to get Xing Chen back?

821
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,640
Xing Chen wants to go his own way.

822
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,640
But will he be able to go his own way?

823
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,640
The market needs Han Hai.

824
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,240
Xing Chen needs him too.

825
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,240
He doesn't have to go to compare.

826
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,640
I know Xing Chen is your blood.

827
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,240
I will protect him.

828
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,440
Fan Ting.

829
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,640
Do you love me?

830
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
Why do you love me?

831
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,040
You want to die for me.

832
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,840
Without me, the world is just him.

833
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,840
This is not my understanding of love.

834
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,240
What do you understand about love?

835
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,640
First, it's the right thing to do.

836
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,040
Xing Xing.

837
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
The right thing to do is not a perfect word.

838
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,640
Love is not that high.

839
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,640
It's hard to find the right person.

840
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,440
It needs to be three-dimensional,

841
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,840
time and spirit.

842
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,840
The harmony of soul.

843
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,040
Time and spirit.

844
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,040
The harmony of soul.

845
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,240
I'm a little tired today.

846
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,640
I'm going to take a shower first.

847
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,440
I'm going to take a shower.

848
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,440
I'm going to take a shower first.

849
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,440
I'm going to take a shower first.

850
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,440
I'm going to take a shower first.

851
