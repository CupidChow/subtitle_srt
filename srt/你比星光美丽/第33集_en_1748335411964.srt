1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,480
I will go to the sky and you to the ground

2
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,560
I will never hesitate to give up my future

3
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,000
I will not give up my unwavering courage

4
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,240
So I will go to the sky and you to the ground

5
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,240
I will never give up my faith

6
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,520
I will never give up my unwavering courage

7
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:10,240
Hi, Xiao Zhong. You are a strange girl.

8
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,240
You always surprise people.

9
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Your office is also the most special.

10
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,240
I will leave this bowl of small minced meat to you.

11
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,240
I hope you can take good care of it for me.

12
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,240
I will go to the sky and you to the ground.

13
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,240
I will go to the sky and you to the ground.

14
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:46,240
I will never give up my unwavering courage.

15
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:54,240
I will never give up my unwavering courage.

16
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:02,240
I will never give up my unwavering courage.

17
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,240
Why are you here?

18
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,240
Come to the office.

19
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
You have decided?

20
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
I have thought about it.

21
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,240
Now Xing Chen is a back-to-back Eastern Yang.

22
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,240
I will come to earn a lot of money and make a lot of money.

23
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,240
Mr. Ji, you will be my boss in the future.

24
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,240
What boss?

25
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,240
I will give you 100,000 yuan back then.

26
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,240
I will be the salesman.

27
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,240
Li Li, we are a new team.

28
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,240
You are usually hard to get a job.

29
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
I prepared a beer for you.

30
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
But after all, you are drunk.

31
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,240
You should drink less wine.

32
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,240
Zhizhou, thank you for giving me the first choice

33
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,240
of not being creative.

34
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,240
That's why I came here today.

35
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,240
I have been thinking about what I can give you.

36
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
I found that you can't express your gratitude to me

37
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,240
for any gift.

38
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,240
Senior, you should think about it with me.

39
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,240
Do you want to be with someone else forever?

40
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Xing, are you really going to be a professional with me?

41
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,240
I am.

42
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,240
I am so happy to win.

43
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,240
From the two of us, you are the biggest support

44
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,240
in today's team.

45
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,240
I will give you the new team in the future.

46
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
I believe that after we become the Han people,

47
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,240
we will be more united and stronger.

48
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,240
The new team is getting bigger and bigger

49
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,240
and the young team is getting more and more.

50
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,240
I hope that we can be friends

51
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,240
who can be trusted and be friends.

52
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,240
We can be friends who can be friends who can be trusted and be friends.

53
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,240
Although I am sorry that I can't continue with you,

54
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,240
I believe that we won't give up our original promise.

55
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,240
We will still let you have your own will

56
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,240
and live a better life.

57
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,240
I am so happy to win.

58
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,240
I am so happy to win.

59
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,240
I am so happy to win.

60
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,240
I am so happy to win.

61
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,240
I am so happy to win.

62
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,240
I am so happy to win.

63
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,240
I am so happy to win.

64
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,240
I am so happy to win.

65
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,240
I am so happy to win.

66
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,240
I am so happy to win.

67
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,240
I am so happy to win.

68
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,240
I am so happy to win.

69
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,240
I am so happy to win.

70
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,240
I am so happy to win.

71
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,240
I am so happy to win.

72
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,240
I called her on the phone.

73
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
Where did she go?

74
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
I am sorry.

75
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
I can't tell you.

76
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
I want to see her.

77
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,240
Can you please help me to tell her?

78
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
Mr. Han,

79
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,240
Xinxing didn't let me tell you.

80
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
She doesn't want you to go to her.

81
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,240
She doesn't want to see you at this time.

82
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,240
Can you give her some space

83
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,240
so that she can be nice to you?

84
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,240
I am sorry.

85
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Excuse me.

86
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
The mountain water is clear.

87
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Thank you for your encounter.

88
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
The river is wide.

89
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
I regret it.

90
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,240
Remember it.

91
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,240
I want to be closer to you.

92
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,240
I want to be closer to you.

93
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,240
I found that the company is not far from the future.

94
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,240
It has a conflict with the company's original plan.

95
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,240
It makes me unable to continue my position.

96
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
I want to resign.

97
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
I want to make a decision.

98
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,240
I can't see your eyes.

99
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Where is Xinxing?

100
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,240
Forget everything about drinking.

101
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Okay.

102
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,240
Han Ping, why are you drinking suddenly?

103
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
Do you want it or not?

104
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Don't move. I'll get you some medicine.

105
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
You can't drink it.

106
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
You're lying.

107
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,240
I can't forget everything.

108
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,240
I'm sorry.

109
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,240
I'm sorry.

110
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,240
I'm sorry.

111
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,240
I'm sorry.

112
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
I'm sorry.

113
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Xinxing, the same situation.

114
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,240
But you're gone.

115
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Those who look distant

116
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,240
But hate you in between

117
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
I don't drink.

118
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Because you don't drink?

119
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,240
You're so beautiful when I drink next time.

120
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Thank you.

121
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,240
You're welcome.

122
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,240
If I can get closer to you

123
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,240
Can I remember the past?

124
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,240
You said

125
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,240
To wish for the future

126
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,240
All wishes will come true.

127
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,240
I wish

128
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,240
Will you still be by my side?

129
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
I'm afraid

130
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,240
Let each other's heart

131
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,240
Be cruel

132
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:19,240
Pretend to be innocent

133
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,240
The past is the past.

134
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,240
Go forward.

135
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,240
It's a brave

136
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,240
We are a pair

137
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,240
We can't stop

138
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,240
The coldness of the heart

139
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,240
You're so beautiful when you drink.

140
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
You're so beautiful when you drink.

141
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Great.

142
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,240
You ate all the food.

143
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
I'll play with you.

144
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
It's okay.

145
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
What?

146
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
I'm so happy.

147
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
There are so many people there.

148
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Go and see them.

149
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
I'll carry you.

150
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
Are you pregnant again?

151
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Look, you dare to say that to me?

152
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
No, I just want to ask you

153
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,240
What do you want to eat tonight?

154
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Okay.

155
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
Han Ting.

156
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
Han Ting.

157
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
Han Ting.

158
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Han Ting.

159
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
You're all the closest people in Han.

160
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
I really can't help you.

161
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
I just can't help you.

162
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,240
Since she and Ji broke up,

163
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,240
she always comes here.

164
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,240
It's all a waste of time.

165
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,040
Nice to meet you.

166
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,160
Whenever it's raining,

167
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
it's hard for me.

168
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,080
Please don't worry.

169
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,460
Don't worry.

170
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,460
You're doing something great.

171
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,320
Um,

172
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,240
your brother is just doing whatever he feels like.

173
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,680
Say nice things and get something back.

174
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,680
I'm here.

175
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
Where's your person?

176
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,680
I'm in VIP zone.

177
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,680
Big Brother, let's sit on the sofa and have a seat.

178
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,680
Hey, Han Ting.

179
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,680
Give us five minutes.

180
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,920
to tell you a story.

181
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,680
.

182
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,760
� tariffs

183
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,720
It's a mountain of high funeral.

184
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,680
Look at such a windy road.

185
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,000
So exciting,

186
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,880
give me some money!

187
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,440
I am fine.

188
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:14,760
I will then find

189
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,800
a good friend

190
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,120
who can have fun with me.

191
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
I am a hunter looking for a prey.

192
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,120
I am a hunter looking for a prey.

193
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,720
A prey.

194
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
Look at the ball.

195
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,000
Snake. Snake.

196
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,240
Help me. Help me. Help me.

197
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Snake. Snake.

198
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,640
How come it's dead?

199
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,400
A prey.

200
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,040
A prey.

201
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,840
Put my prey down.

202
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,960
This snake.

203
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,360
It's a snake.

204
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,440
It's a snake.

205
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,280
It's a snake.

206
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
It's a snake.

207
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
It's a snake.

208
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,600
Is it your snake?

209
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,480
You can say that.

210
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,280
Your gun is too accurate.

211
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,640
Don't praise me like that.

212
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,160
I will be embarrassed.

213
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,400
Can we be good friends?

214
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,560
But I am a hunter.

215
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,680
What's the matter?

216
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,640
You saved my life.

217
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,960
I want to give you my most precious gift.

218
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,280
But this is my prey.

219
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,160
Not this.

220
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
Wait a minute.

221
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,480
This star is my most precious gift.

222
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,960
Now I will give it to you.

223
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,960
I am so happy. I have a friend.

224
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
So happy.

225
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,560
Friend.

226
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,160
I have a friend.

227
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Wait a minute.

228
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,560
I finally have a friend.

229
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Wait a minute.

230
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,160
But can Fox really be a friend with a hunter?

231
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,960
I am a hunter looking for prey.

232
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,960
I am a fox looking for prey.

233
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,360
Search for prey.

234
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,160
A hunter.

235
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Don't shoot.

236
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,160
The animals in the forest are my colleagues.

237
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,560
Don't kill them.

238
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,760
But I am a hunter.

239
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
The hunter is my god.

240
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,960
Will you kill me like the hunters?

241
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,360
If one day,

242
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,760
I will be the prey of the winter.

243
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,160
You will do the same to us.

244
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,160
No.

245
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,760
When the sea is strong enough,

246
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,360
will you be the prey of the star?

247
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,960
Star is to walk its own path.

248
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,160
But will there be a day when there is no path to walk?

249
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,160
I know that the star is your blood.

250
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,760
I will protect it.

251
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
I swear.

252
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,360
I will never kill you.

253
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,960
Because you are my best friend.

254
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,360
Then can you not hunt?

255
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,760
But I am a hunter.

256
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,360
Can a hunter not hunt?

257
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Then can you not eat chicken?

258
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
I can.

259
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Don't say anything.

260
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
Just come.

261
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Forget it.

262
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,360
I won't hunt today.

263
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,360
I am going home.

264
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
You won't hunt?

265
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,560
Fox doesn't eat chicken.

266
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,360
Fox doesn't hunt?

267
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,960
Really?

268
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,760
This is fox.

269
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
This is fox.

270
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
This is fox.

271
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
This is fox.

272
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
Fox.

273
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Xiaoji, don't run.

274
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
Don't run.

275
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
Don't run.

276
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
Don't run.

277
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
I don't eat chicken now.

278
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Don't eat chicken?

279
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,760
Then what do you eat?

280
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,760
I eat chicken.

281
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Stop touching me.

282
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
Help.

283
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
Don't run.

284
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,760
Explain to me.

285
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,160
Who is eating chicken?

286
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
My star.

287
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,760
Who is going to kill me?

288
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,960
It's you.

289
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,360
It's you.

290
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,160
You are going to kill me?

291
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,160
I ask you.

292
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,560
Are you going to kill me?

293
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,560
You promised me.

294
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,160
You will never hunt me.

295
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,360
Did you forget?

296
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,960
I said I am a hunter.

297
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,360
If we continue to be friends,

298
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,160
you can't eat chicken anymore.

299
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,760
I didn't eat.

300
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,360
No.

301
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,960
Just take my stomach out.

302
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,360
See if there are green grass and pebbles inside.

303
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
I thought

304
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,960
as long as Fox doesn't eat chicken,

305
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,160
the hunter won't hunt again.

306
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,160
It seems

307
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,960
I am too stupid.

308
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,760
But hunting is my job.

309
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,360
Yes. You always have a reason.

310
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,760
You are always right.

311
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
It seems

312
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,960
we are not the same people.

313
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,360
What do you mean?

314
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,360
I can't protect this star.

315
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,560
I can't protect our friendship either.

316
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
Goodbye.

317
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,760
My hunter friend.

318
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,760
Maybe

319
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,760
we can be better.

320
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
Fox.

321
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,760
The hunter didn't stop Fox from going far.

322
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,160
Because he knows very well

323
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,160
if Fox stays with him,

324
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,360
this time,

325
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
Fox will be the star.

326
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,360
The next time,

327
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,360
maybe

328
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,760
it will be his heart.

329
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,760
If the price of being together

330
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
is to hurt you,

331
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,760
it's better to leave it here.

332
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
I have become a free fox again.

333
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,160
I am still a hunter who is full of self-interest.

334
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,360
Our encounter

335
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,360
may be just a beautiful mistake.

336
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Only after we are separated,

337
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,160
can we be ourselves.

338
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,160
After that,

339
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
I am still the one.

340
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
You

341
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
are the one.

342
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
I am still me.

343
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,360
You are still you.

344
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,760
A broken star will always be together.

345
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,960
But you need to give it enough time.

346
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
Before that,

347
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,960
just wait patiently.

348
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,960
Time will be the damage you will give me now.

349
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,160
After all,

350
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,960
I love you so much.

351
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Qingqing.

352
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,760
As long as you want to,

353
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,360
I will still be your star.

354
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,360
It's so scary.

355
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,360
You two are so indecisive.

356
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,960
You will be separated sooner or later.

357
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,960
Can you give him some space

358
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,360
so that he can treat you well?

359
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,960
When is that time?

360
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
Maybe,

361
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,360
it's the time that the fate

362
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,960
makes us meet again.

363
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,760
To me,

364
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
we have no international experience

365
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,760
in the field of technology development.

366
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,960
Let me tell you an exception.

367
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,560
Some countries have such a sense of knowledge.

368
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,560
They use various means

369
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,560
to strengthen their knowledge.

370
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,960
For such a way,

371
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,160
I can only say that

372
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,560
I hope you can all learn something.

373
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,160
Let our lives become more beautiful.

374
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,760
Instead of learning the technology,

375
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,760
become some countries'

376
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,160
weapons of courage and oppression.

377
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,160
I hope you can all learn something.

378
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,160
I hope you can all learn something.

379
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
I hope you can all learn something.

380
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
I hope you can all learn something.

381
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
I hope you can all learn something.

382
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,160
I hope you can all learn something.

383
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
I hope you can all learn something.

384
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,160
I hope you can all learn something.

385
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,160
I hope you can all learn something.

386
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,760
I hope you can all learn something.

387
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
Hello.

388
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Good afternoon, Dr. Chen.

389
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,760
Dr. Chen, you really don't come to visit us?

390
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
Thank you.

391
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
Well,

392
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,760
I'd like to invite you

393
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,760
to take me back to China.

394
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,760
You know, Dr. Chen,

395
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,760
we don't want to see you

396
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,760
bringing people back to China.

397
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,760
We don't want to see you bringing people back to China.

398
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
We don't want to see you bringing people back to China.

399
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,160
Stay with us.

400
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Our company can fully support your research.

401
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,560
In scientific research,

402
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
you won't find any limits.

403
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,360
You are very direct.

404
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,360
Today I meet you

405
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,360
because of your honesty.

406
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,960
But I said

407
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,360
that I only want to return to China.

408
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,160
We have a goal.

409
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,160
It's called the Fund.

410
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,760
My fatherland has trained me.

411
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,760
Now it's time to build my fatherland.

412
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
That's why I thought

413
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,160
that it's not necessary to spend our time.

414
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,960
If you give me a chance, we can work together.

415
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
Dr. Chen.

416
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,360
The card is on me.

417
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,760
I wish you all the best.

418
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
Get off the car.

419
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
Thank you.

420
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
You're welcome.

421
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
Chinese.

422
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,560
I'm so lucky to meet Tong Baoke in Japan.

423
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,560
Hello, my name is Qin Li.

424
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
Hello, Dr. Qin.

425
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
My name is Ji Xing.

426
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
You know me?

427
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,160
I've read your report.

428
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,360
The Chinese know everything.

429
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,560
You also study artificial intelligence.

430
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,760
It's okay.

431
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,160
I'm a smart doctor.

432
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,160
That's a lot of money.

433
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,560
I'll treat you to a meal.

434
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,760
Thank you for your help today.

435
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:12,960
No need.

436
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,960
We're all Chinese.

437
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,760
You're welcome.

438
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,760
I have to go.

439
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,560
Here you are.

440
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
Oh, my.

441
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,960
I miss you so much.

442
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,760
I'll give you a bowl.

443
00:30:59,360 --> 00:30:59,960
I won't.

444
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,760
You can eat it.

445
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,960
What's your name?

446
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
Ai Xing.

447
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,160
What's Ai Xing?

448
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,960
I'm counting my pregnancy for 12 months.

449
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,960
Here.

450
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
Auntie, you're so good at this.

451
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,560
I don't know what happened.

452
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,560
She got this on her.

453
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,360
What?

454
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,360
I found out that after the break,

455
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,160
you and Auntie's relationship is much better.

456
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,160
Su Zhi Zhou has two brushes.

457
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,360
When I first saw her in my room,

458
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
I thought she was a fool.

459
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,960
I didn't expect her to be so reliable.

460
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,760
I don't know what happened.

461
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,560
She and my mom got together.

462
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,360
But to be honest,

463
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,160
Su Zhi Zhou has become much more mature than before.

464
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:54,960
Yes.

465
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,160
Xing Xing is not here now.

466
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,360
Xing Chen is up to you two.

467
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,760
Isn't it necessary to be mature?

468
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,160
I've been doing video with Xing Xing recently.

469
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,560
I see that he's in good condition.

470
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,360
Do you think he really has a good temper?

471
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
He's just a man.

472
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,560
He's not afraid of anything.

473
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,360
Maybe he's in Germany now.

474
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,560
He's already pregnant.

475
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,960
Yes.

476
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,160
Xing Xing is so beautiful and excellent.

477
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,960
I don't think he knows

478
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,960
500 handsome men in Germany.

479
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,960
Anyway, he's coming back soon.

480
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,960
When the time comes,

481
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,160
let him give me some.

482
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
You really like handsome men in Germany.

483
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,560
Qin Li.

484
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,560
You are the best student I've ever taught.

485
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,560
Your education and school

486
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
hope I can have a good talk with you.

487
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,760
If you're willing to leave school and take the class,

488
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,360
I'll give you the biggest support.

489
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,360
This is the so-called loan.

490
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,760
Meng, don't say that.

491
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,760
The school told me several times.

492
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,360
The smell of the car's goulou is getting worse.

493
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,160
I knew you'd say that.

494
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,960
You, kid.

495
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,960
You don't have to force yourself

496
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,360
to do anything you don't want to do.

497
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,960
You can't stop anyone from doing what you want to do.

498
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,760
I'm just responsible for bringing the school's words to you.

499
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,560
As for how to choose,

500
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,560
you can do it yourself.

501
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,560
Professor Meng.

502
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,160
Jing Xing is here.

503
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,360
Jing Xing?

504
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
Have you seen each other?

505
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,360
A kid stole my bag today.

506
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,960
He helped me find it.

507
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,560
Yes.

508
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,560
I know.

509
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,160
Professor Meng, I'm here to get the book.

510
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:35,760
Thank you.

511
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,560
You're welcome.

512
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,560
I'm going to class.

513
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,160
How about you two talk?

514
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,160
Jing Xing,

515
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,360
see what books you want to read.

516
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,160
Take them yourself.

517
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,960
Okay, you too.

518
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,360
Take care, honey.

519
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,760
Jing Xing.

520
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,360
We'll leave a contact information

521
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,960
for the first and second rounds.

522
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,560
Okay.

523
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,160
I'll sweep you.

524
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,160
Okay.

525
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:01,760
Okay.

526
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,560
Professor Meng, I've read enough books.

527
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
If you're interested,

528
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,760
I can recommend them to you.

529
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,160
Can you recommend books for medical treatment?

530
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,760
The professor of the University of Yuen An Huo Fu,

531
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,960
Professor Jin Si,

532
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,960
is worth a try.

533
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,160
Thank you.

534
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:31,760
By the way,

535
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,360
I've heard that you're a genius

536
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,560
in artificial intelligence.

537
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,360
You're good at talking,

538
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,760
so which direction do you study?

539
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
Of course, the language is

540
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,360
to communicate and interact with human language

541
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,560
through machine.

542
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
If you take it in a good way,

543
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,760
in order to complete the machine

544
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,160
for many human language work.

545
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,360
I hope one day,

546
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,160
they can help me

547
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,160
to deal with those unnecessary things.

548
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:01,760
Okay.

549
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,560
Right here.

550
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,360
Let's go.

551
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,360
Let's have a meal.

552
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,360
Don't reject me.

553
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,760
Otherwise, I'll be so mad at you.

554
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,760
Okay.

555
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
I'll be leaving.

556
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,160
Let's go.

557
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:30,960
Okay.

558
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,560
Huo,

559
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,560
this is the first time I've been here.

560
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,960
My office is much better than mine.

561
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,360
I'm so nervous.

562
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,760
Mr. Han,

563
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,160
you look at this view every day.

564
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,360
No wonder it's different.

565
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,560
How is it?

566
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,160
I know you well.

567
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,160
There's a sign for you.

568
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,760
What sign?

569
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:58,960
Star sign.

570
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,960
Star light.

571
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,160
There's a wonderful fate between you and Ji Xing.

572
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,760
I didn't say it.

573
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,560
I didn't say it.

574
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,160
What's the matter? Tell me.

575
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,360
As a man behind you,

576
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,960
I want to remind you

577
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,160
that Tong Ke and Guang Hua

578
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,560
have been preparing for the strategic cooperation.

579
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,160
The fruit you cultivate

580
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,360
will be taken by Chang He.

581
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,960
Chang He just wants to keep the wisdom treatment

582
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,960
and create a concept.

583
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
He's too old-fashioned.

584
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,360
He may not be able to digest the fruit.

585
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,960
Look at you.

586
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,160
Why are you so arrogant?

587
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,560
If you're free,

588
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
please take me out of the door.

589
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,960
Ever since you were ten years old,

590
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,360
you're no cuter than before.

591
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,440
Someone's here.

592
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,280
Nothing wrong withamos.

593
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,960
The meeting was then confirmed.

594
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,560
There's no problem with every delivery period.

595
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:21,760
All right.

596
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,400
and the rescue again.

597
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,440
Han Xin was sick for half a year.

598
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,080
The technical department

599
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,240
was sent out to do the outside cleaning.

600
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,040
They were not in the office.

601
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,960
Han Hai is really

602
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,920
going to be the technical department.

603
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,280
Mr. Su's recent work is quite big.

604
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,240
I feel that his entire teeth

605
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,080
are getting worse.

606
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,000
It's okay.

607
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,200
You can continue.

608
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,160
I'll talk to him.

609
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,200
Okay.

610
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,780
ACT

611
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,880
Han JUN.

612
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,880
Han Hai's marriage is about to start.

613
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
He said he's fine.

614
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
Don't worry, Sister Li.

615
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
You can bear it.

616
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
But don't tell Sister Xin.

617
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,880
I'm afraid she'll worry about you.

618
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,880
I know, Qin Zhong.

619
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,880
But you.

620
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Don't be so self-reliant.

621
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,880
We're a team.

622
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,880
How about we go to talk with Luo Zong?

623
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,880
Luo Zong is too busy.

624
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
There's something that

625
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
even if he arranges it,

626
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,880
the people at the bottom are so busy.

627
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,880
I'm worried that

628
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,880
he'll plan something different from the second step.

629
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,880
I'm working with the second step

630
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
to do something big.

631
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
It's coming up soon.

632
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
Don't worry about us.

633
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,880
What big thing?

634
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,880
The secret.

635
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,880
You'll know it when it's time.

636
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,880
Okay.

637
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,880
I believe in your ability.

638
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,880
I'll be a great master.

639
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
Don't lose to us

640
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,880
in the technical department.

641
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,880
Go.

642
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
Come in.

643
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,880
Mr. Su, Mr. Li.

644
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880
Han Hai just told us

645
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,880
to send the goods

646
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,880
to the customer

647
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,880
directly to others.

648
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,880
But our previous mail

649
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,880
will be delivered to the delivery office soon.

650
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
Is it the delivery of the money?

651
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
Yes.

652
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,880
The order will be delivered

653
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,880
in four days.

654
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,880
I think Han Hai's sales

655
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
must have lost

656
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,880
these stocks on purpose.

657
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
The current efficiency of your production department

658
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,880
will be driven out

659
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
after a week of delivery of the goods.

660
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,880
I'll call Mr. Qian first.

661
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,880
Let's see if it's possible to get it.

662
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,880
Okay.

663
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,880
Xiaosheng,

664
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
inform the technical department

665
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,880
to work overtime tonight.

666
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,880
Okay.

667
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,880
The new year is coming.

668
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,880
Yes.

669
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,880
This is the best year

670
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,880
in my life.

671
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,880
Hello.

672
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
Hello, Mr. Liu.

673
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
What's wrong?

674
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,880
What?

675
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
Okay, I'll be right back.

676
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,880
What's wrong?

677
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,880
My mom fainted.

678
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,880
They're going back from the hospital.

679
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,880
I'll be right back.

680
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,880
Let's go.

681
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,880
Watch the TV.

682
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,880
I'll be with you.

683
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,880
I'm back.

684
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
I've told you

685
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,880
that I'm going to be a customer.

686
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,880
I'll tell you

687
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,880
what I'm going to say.

688
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,880
You can tell me.

689
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,880
Okay, remember.

690
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,880
You're a little bit like her.

691
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,880
Don't be shy.

692
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,880
Mom.

693
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,880
How are you?

694
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,880
Aunt.

695
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
How come you fainted?

696
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
I don't know.

697
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,880
I fainted

698
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,880
all of a sudden.

699
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,880
I can't see anything.

700
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,880
What did the doctor say?

701
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,880
The doctor said

702
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
that you're old

703
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,880
and have more problems.

704
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,880
Fortunately, you found the emergency.

705
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,880
If you do it again,

706
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,880
the problem will be serious.

707
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,880
Are you going to the hospital?

708
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,880
Is it better to live in the hospital?

709
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,880
Yes, yes.

710
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,880
Let's go.

711
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
Aunt Liu, don't be noisy.

712
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,880
Don't be noisy.

713
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,880
I fainted all of a sudden.

714
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,880
Okay, okay.

715
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,880
Han, have a good rest.

716
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,880
I fainted.

717
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,880
Han.

718
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,880
I have to be on leave for two days.

719
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,880
My husband

720
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,880
has a stomachache.

721
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,880
I have to go back and take care of him.

722
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,880
No, Aunt Liu.

723
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,880
My mom is like this.

724
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
You can't leave.

725
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,880
Jiajia, I know.

726
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,880
But

727
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,880
if I don't go back

728
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,880
and take care of my dead ghost,

729
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,880
he will say that he wants to divorce me.

730
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,880
Han.

731
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,880
Han.

732
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,880
Xiao Dou, don't cry.

733
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
Don't cry.

734
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,880
I promise you.

735
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,880
You can go back.

736
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,880
How can I

737
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,880
divorce you

738
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,880
because you took care of me?

739
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
I'm fine.

740
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,880
I just want to stay here.

741
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,880
I can take care of myself.

742
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
Okay, let's go.

743
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,880
Thank you, Han.

744
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,880
You're welcome.

745
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,880
Thank you, Jiajia.

746
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,880
How about I take care of you?

747
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,880
Okay.

748
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
I'm sorry.

749
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,880
I'm sorry.

750
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,880
I'm sorry.

751
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,880
I'm sorry.
