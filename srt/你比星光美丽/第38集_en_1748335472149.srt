1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I visiting my hands to retrieve your dreams.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm leaving the quietfield that I belong to Чтобы.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
...and forgot to memorize...

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,600
...the meaning of my past life to consider it.

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm leaving the quietfield that I belong to...

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
...to steadfastly give up too.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,280
I will always believe

15
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,080
There are miracles

16
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,760
Even if I don't know

17
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,160
Who I am

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,160
Episode 1

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,400
This fish is so beautiful

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,240
It's tail is like a butterfly

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,280
Its name is called butterfly

22
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,480
It's also called good fish

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,480
So I believed once

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,960
I believe

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,440
They can take you back to me

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I can come back so confident

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But I will wait

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Episode 1

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Mr. Han is getting more and more sensible

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He knows when he is sending me to work

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He prepared me a morning coffee

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
sensible

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Tianshin

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I like it

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's good that you like it

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll prepare another one for you next time

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Then I want to order food

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Next time I want to eat carrot juice

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Zhizhou

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Xingjie

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There is an urgent matter

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have to report it to you

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What's wrong?

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Zuo Yang company

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Ended our contract on the single-page

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And no longer needs to be applied

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
In all our cooperation

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Zuo Yang company is the only one

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
To talk about technical materials

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We have a product in our company

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We have to use technical materials

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Otherwise the progress

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Can't be promoted at all

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I still asked the Ministry of Finance

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He knew it

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So I called you

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Talk about it

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What should we do next

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Is it a break-up or a contract?

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
According to the truth

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's a normal contract

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But I also asked the Ministry of Finance

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
All the cooperation is very successful

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So we don't know why

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He suddenly stopped working

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Contract

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If so

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No contract documents

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There is no way to follow

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes, that's right

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But we are now continuing their materials

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
To conduct production experiments

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
How about this

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll think of a way

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Make this month's supply and demand

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Just as soon as possible

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Need a little more money

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
understand

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But we can't

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
All of us are so clear and clear

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Xingjie

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I think after this time

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We need to find a new

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Stable material supply

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I came back from Germany

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I have a project

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Just right now

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Can try it

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What project

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Realize it first

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, that's it

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Bye bye

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Please change the destination

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Why don't you ask me

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What was the project just now

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Compared to the language description

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I directly look at the result with Qing Xiangyun

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Luo Ping went abroad to investigate this time

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Looks like Mr. Ji is very busy

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What's the way

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Who told me to take him to work

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But compared to Mr. Han

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's not a good idea

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes, Mr. Ma

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The raw materials of the department

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
There is a guarantee

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Han Xing has been working with the company

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We want to

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Mr. Li, aren't you now

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Han Xing's sales department

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
How to manage the work of the purchase

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
All a company

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Can help the department

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What kind of financial structure

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Sales department

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Mr. Li is really a business man

120
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Then I won't give you a rough explanation

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Did you contact me

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Is it because of the foreign goods

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Problems

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And we just got in from abroad

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
To talk about the material

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Mr. Ma is really smart

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Then I also opened the door

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You helped Han Xing

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We must remember

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The place Mr. Ma can find in the future

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Just open the door

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Mr. Li, you're welcome

133
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You opened the door

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This busy

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Of course it can help

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Mr. Ma is quick

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why don't we

138
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Just make the contract today

139
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Mr. Li, you know

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The whole market is short

141
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
With our stock price

142
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Even old customers are not enough

143
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You want to live more

144
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Really can't help

145
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
How about this

146
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The most is 100 jin

147
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The price is up to 30 points

148
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What do you think

149
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank you, Mr. Ma

150
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Mr. Ma

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Don't call

152
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
All waiting for the gold and gold

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Mr. Li, let's talk later

154
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You think about it

155
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Bye

156
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Come here

157
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Mr. Li

158
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't be so unlucky

159
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Drink something

160
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Keep your energy

161
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Thank you

162
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's my thanks to you

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The child wants to help us

164
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Solve the material

165
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I want to help you

166
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I want to help you

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Help you

168
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I want to help you

169
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I want to help you

170
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I want to help you

171
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I should help each other

172
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Besides

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I haven't solved it yet

174
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I ran a round of beauty materials in the morning

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Just contacted the scientific material

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No result

177
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Really headache

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Sister sent a message

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That the supply is fixed

180
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Really

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Look

182
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Great

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Tomorrow noon

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Do you have time

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I want to ask you to go to a place

186
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay

187
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
See you tomorrow

188
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm leaving

189
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Eat something

190
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Come

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So happy

192
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
When working

193
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Eat a bowl of noodles made by Mr. Han

194
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
By the way

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I solved the original material

196
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So fast

197
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
How to solve it

198
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I can't do it

199
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
How to solve it

200
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The president of the giant

201
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Recently came to Hong Kong for a business trip

202
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's good to have a good relationship with him

203
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I asked him for help

204
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And the president of Xu Group

205
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We reached strategic cooperation

206
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
They have a German high-tech material technology

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
One is the local material company

208
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
In this way

209
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Can solve the situation of the original material

210
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Unsafe

211
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Can also help the giant of Germany

212
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Develop Chinese market

213
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And Han Xin also has a stable original material supply system

214
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
This is a creative cooperation

215
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You are awesome

216
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
All over the place

217
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I learned from Mr. Han

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But I always think

219
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Zuo Yang suddenly canceled the cooperation

220
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Someone is doing something behind

221
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Already cooperated with Tong Ge

222
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The price is 15% higher than Han Xin

223
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Too small

224
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What small

225
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Poverty

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Badness competition

227
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The damage is not immediate

228
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Poverty is too small

229
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The mutual benefit is the big pavilion

230
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Not everyone

231
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Like Mr. Ji, there is a big pavilion

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Go to shower

233
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Go to bed early

234
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'll look at the materials later

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I will call the board of directors soon

236
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You go to wash the books first

237
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'll go there later

238
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
By the way, Mr. Ji

239
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
There is a document here

240
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Need to be held

241
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
OK

242
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
All right

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's it

244
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Can only be used once a day

245
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Can only be used once a day

246
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Can't even use the power of my boyfriend

247
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I can't use it

248
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I can't use it

249
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Can't even use the power of my boyfriend

250
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
All right, let me see

251
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What else can I use

252
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Accompaniment card

253
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Game card

254
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
How can I go to play?

255
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Let's see a good night movie

256
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Bless card

257
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Pizza card

258
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is good

259
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Press magic card

260
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Just so good

261
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Three pains

262
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Let's go

263
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Where to go

264
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Press magic for you

265
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Where is not comfortable

266
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Where is not comfortable

267
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Is there a needle at home

268
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'll make you a wine

269
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
A needle

270
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Is it a needle in the bed?

271
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Put it on the bed

272
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Let's go

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm going to play

274
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You specially prepared it for me

275
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Thank you

276
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You want to thank me

277
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I thought this time

278
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The raw materials of the new city

279
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Could cause them some trouble

280
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,840
No.

281
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,920
It seems that he won't use this trick

282
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,200
to get the foundation.

283
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,840
The machine is a bit capable.

284
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,560
But he has little experience.

285
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,480
He's lost his temper after a long time.

286
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,440
Don't you want to try it?

287
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,720
Hello.

288
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,520
I've done everything.

289
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,960
Okay.

290
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,960
That's it.

291
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,680
What's wrong?

292
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,400
I asked the other person to find a marketing company.

293
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,000
What do you want?

294
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,320
I won't bother you.

295
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,320
You can't offend women.

296
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,440
You're so kind.

297
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,840
You're not popular at all.

298
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,960
When I was popular,

299
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,240
I was not popular.

300
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,840
Didn't you say that

301
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,560
business competition

302
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,080
is not about love?

303
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,240
I'm leaving.

304
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,760
Thank you for your coffee.

305
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,520
I've finished ordering the food.

306
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,240
Look at what else you want to eat.

307
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,000
Add more.

308
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,080
I like to eat it.

309
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,520
There's nothing to add.

310
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,160
Actually,

311
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,680
they don't allow me to order food

312
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,640
as usual.

313
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,280
Or they think that I'm not good.

314
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,360
Or they think that

315
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,720
I have a lot of waste.

316
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,080
Being bound by you

317
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,460
and what you love eat with me.

318
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,600
I'm tbspless.

319
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,180
As an old friend of yours

320
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,280
and friend,

321
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm a bit програмmatic.

322
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,240
I'm not a coward.

323
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,560
Lili,

324
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,720
this is for you.

325
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,920
Maybe you don't remember

326
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,960
when you first came to the house,

327
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,720
but I was the same.

328
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,080
When I first met you,

329
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,640
I felt like

330
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,560
you were the light in the whole room.

331
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,960
I know

332
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,760
I was immature in the past,

333
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,040
and I did a lot of stupid things

334
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,080
to chase you.

335
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,080
But now I'm different.

336
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,120
Since Xingjue left,

337
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,000
we've been together to protect Xingzhen,

338
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,640
grow up together,

339
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,520
and experienced a lot together.

340
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,280
I...

341
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,720
I've become mature little by little.

342
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,160
Maybe you once said no

343
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,080
because I was childish and impulsive,

344
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,320
but I'm willing to be better

345
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,920
for you.

346
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,200
Do you have the most chance?

347
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,920
Lili,

348
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,760
I like you.

349
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,520
Miss Xiaoxiao,

350
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,120
do you think

351
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,520
Mr. Su is not afraid of Mr. Li?

352
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,560
I think he is not afraid of Mr. Li.

353
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,200
Mr. Li is also a good guy.

354
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,200
Mr. Su has his own thoughts.

355
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,600
But he came back from Germany

356
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,560
because of the new chief engineer.

357
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,960
It's a pity that he missed it.

358
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,240
Maybe this time,

359
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,520
I should tell you something.

360
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,960
I'm sorry.

361
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,120
It's okay.

362
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,160
Since I've done the construction

363
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,640
of the heart of confessing to you,

364
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
I've done it

365
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,760
and prepared it for you.

366
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,400
It's okay.

367
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Look at you.

368
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,040
You just said you're mature.

369
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,880
Now you're a little disappointed.

370
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,000
Are you really going to invite me to dinner?

371
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,760
I'm really going to invite you to dinner.

372
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,920
Actually,

373
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,800
this confession

374
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
is the last chance for me.

375
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,400
I sincerely hope you

376
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,680
be happy and happy.

377
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,840
Okay.

378
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,320
I'm kidding.

379
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,240
I'm sorry.

380
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,160
I've always been

381
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,080
watching your mature.

382
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,840
And

383
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,040
you said something wrong.

384
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,440
You didn't grow up

385
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,800
after you left Xixing.

386
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,960
Do you remember

387
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,840
when the sound machine was out of stock?

388
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,320
We went to borrow the sound machine together.

389
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,080
You also knew Xiaozuo was making a knife.

390
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,320
You were already the chief engineer at that time.

391
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,720
Remember,

392
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,480
you didn't change for me.

393
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,920
You have to take responsibility

394
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,640
for your own advantages.

395
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,920
You have to take responsibility for your own advantages.

396
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,200
I'm not as good as you said.

397
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,400
And you're very good at remembering.

398
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,640
I bought the flowers casually.

399
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,240
I don't remember what they looked like.

400
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,200
You still remember.

401
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,960
I took the flowers.

402
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,760
Let me tell you a secret.

403
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,840
I've been eating Xicana

404
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,360
in order to protect my image.

405
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,760
I actually like

406
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
stinky tofu.

407
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,160
Stinky tofu?

408
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,760
You like stinky tofu?

409
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
There's a very famous

410
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,360
street food restaurant nearby.

411
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,560
Yes, that's it.

412
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
I'll buy it for you now.

413
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,960
Wait for me.

414
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,160
Very soon.

415
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,560
Wait for me.

416
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,960
Wait for me.

417
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,960
Wait for me.

418
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,160
Wait for me.

419
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,360
Here you are.

420
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,960
I've prepared your favorite cake.

421
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Thank you.

422
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,560
What?

423
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,960
Why are you so shy to open the door and do business?

424
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
You...

425
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,760
I didn't find the big stone

426
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,160
in my eyes.

427
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
And I

428
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,360
didn't find the small tree

429
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,560
in the wind.

430
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
You've been so good at acting recently.

431
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,560
Give me a certificate.

432
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,160
I'll think about it.

433
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
I knew it.

434
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,760
I'm asking you for nothing.

435
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,360
Okay.

436
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,960
Don't be so angry.

437
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,160
Let me show you my account.

438
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,160
I've been making some changes recently.

439
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
What?

440
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Go and check it out.

441
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,160
I'm so busy.

442
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,560
Why do you want to turn the camera around?

443
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,960
So ugly. When did you take it?

444
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,160
You always ask me

445
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,560
when I can give you a certificate.

446
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,960
So now I'm the one.

447
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
Are you willing?

448
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
Yes.

449
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,760
I'm willing.

450
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
I'm willing.

451
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,560
I'm willing.

452
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
I'm willing.

453
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
I'm willing.

454
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
I'm willing.

455
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
I'm willing.

456
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
I'm willing.

457
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
I'm willing.

458
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
I'm willing.

459
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,560
I'm willing.

460
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,560
I'm willing.

461
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
I'm willing.

462
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Okay.

463
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Let me see it.

464
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
But

465
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,760
what's the date today?

466
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,160
You said you'd give me a certificate.

467
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,760
I think it's because of

468
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,160
Xing Xing and Mr. Han.

469
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
I think

470
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,160
nothing can be waited

471
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,160
in front of life.

472
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
I was going to prepare

473
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
and prepare for it.

474
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,160
It was a special day.

475
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
But now

476
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
I can't wait.

477
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
I can't wait either.

478
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Then

479
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
I'm sure

480
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
you're my rightful boyfriend.

481
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,160
Wait.

482
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,160
I want to check

483
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
how many pretty sisters

484
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
are in your watch list.

485
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,160
I like you.

486
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,160
My social platform is full of rags.

487
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
Pretty sisters?

488
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
From now on

489
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,160
I'll only share you one.

490
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,900
I would ignore all your warnings,

491
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,300
except...

492
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,760
Let's go upstairs.

493
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,420
Xingxing,

494
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,460
come.

495
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,500
This is the�니다

496
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,440
leader of A Little Haitian

497
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,820
who says her girlfriend is a goddess.

498
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,160
Miss Tan, I've seen your movie.

499
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,160
It's very beautiful.

500
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,160
Hello.

501
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,160
I originally invited Mr. Han to have lunch together.

502
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,160
Since Mr. Han's girlfriend is here,

503
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,160
I won't bother you.

504
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
Since Mr. Han's girlfriend is here,

505
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,160
I won't bother you.

506
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
Stop.

507
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,160
You're not paying. Stop.

508
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,160
She ran over by herself.

509
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
You're jealous?

510
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
I was looking for you to save me.

511
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,160
I've already heard you promote the rights of the host.

512
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,160
She won't come again.

513
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
You did a good job.

514
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
It's midnight. What do you want to eat?

515
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
Why don't we go to Langchun?

516
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
There are many celebrities there.

517
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,160
Okay.

518
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Next time.

519
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,160
I've already booked a restaurant.

520
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
Let's go.

521
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
What do you want to eat, Mr. Han?

522
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
Mr. Han.

523
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
I'll treat you to a meal.

524
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,160
A male guest?

525
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,160
What do you mean?

526
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,160
Come on.

527
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,160
Be careful.

528
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
Mr. Han.

529
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
Are you okay?

530
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
Mr. Han, please come in.

531
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
I'll call 120.

532
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
No.

533
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,160
Call Tang Cong.

534
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
Mr. Jiang.

535
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
Come in.

536
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,160
Mr. Jiang.

537
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
Mr. Han is in trouble.

538
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
What's going on?

539
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,160
I heard that Tang Cong is very busy.

540
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,160
He ran out of the office.

541
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,160
Someone in Dongke's underground police station

542
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,160
saw him and Mr. Ji

543
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,160
helping Mr. Han get in the car.

544
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Mr. Han didn't come back yet.

545
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,160
The last time he got injured

546
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,160
wasn't that simple.

547
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Is this going to tell Mr. Zhou?

548
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
Maybe.

549
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
Understood.

550
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,160
Let's go.

551
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,160
The result is out.

552
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
The director said

553
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,480
You need to get the surgery.

554
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,120
Okay.

555
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,840
It hurts, right?

556
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,920
It's okay.

557
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,640
Don't cry.

558
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,560
I'm not crying.

559
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,880
Have a good night's sleep.

560
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,880
I've been with you here all this time.

561
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,520
Emily.

562
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:55,960
媒ret.

563
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
I'm here.

564
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,080
Go have some tea.

565
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,840
Come on, put that down.

566
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,920
It's never going to dark.

567
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,240
I,

568
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,520
put this away.

569
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,640
Check out the teeth.

570
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,480
I'm pregnant.

571
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,440
You're already like this.

572
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,080
I'm still in the South of the sea.

573
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,120
I'm fine.

574
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,320
You're still saying you're fine.

575
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,240
You're just not a good memory.

576
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,360
These days,

577
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,160
I've been thinking about what you said to me.

578
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,760
I'll leave a place behind.

579
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,840
You're so stubborn.

580
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
Remember,

581
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
never use your life

582
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,640
to poison others.

583
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
I understand.

584
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,640
It's okay to do this.

585
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,640
I'm the one who made her suffer.

586
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,640
I came back from the South of the sea.

587
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,640
I didn't want to be a little girl.

588
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,640
I wanted to ask for forgiveness.

589
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,640
Your grandfather hasn't been confused yet.

590
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
Grandpa,

591
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,240
to me,

592
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,640
he's as important as Dongyang.

593
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,840
It's a good thing to be surrounded by love.

594
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,440
But love is a fake.

595
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,240
It's also a soft one.

596
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,640
You have to protect yourself.

597
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,840
You have to protect her.

598
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,440
I don't want to make these people

599
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,440
suffer from their problems all day long.

600
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,440
Grandpa,

601
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,640
get better soon.

602
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,640
Don't let a girl

603
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,040
worry about you.

604
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,640
I understand.

605
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,640
Don't worry about the company.

606
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,640
I've already told the public

607
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,240
that you have something to do at the funeral.

608
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,640
Okay.

609
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,640
I'm leaving.

610
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,840
Xingjian,

611
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,840
look at this video.

612
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,440
It says that

613
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,240
our direct-in-treat equipment

614
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,840
is out of the放-down machine.

615
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,040
The signal in the direct-in-treat equipment

616
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,240
should be used by the rescue team.

617
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,840
The quality is not good.

618
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,440
The signal is out of the放-down machine.

619
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,840
How much harm to the human body

620
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,240
will it cause?

621
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,040
This needs to be paid by the experts.

622
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,840
Han Xing, the dark star.

623
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,840
Han Xing Chen.

624
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
He's actually good at teaching this.

625
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,840
He's very good at teaching this.

626
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,640
I understand.

627
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,840
He's good at teaching this.

628
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
He's not afraid of the consequences.

629
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,640
Every time we go to the funeral,

630
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
it's all about Xingjian.

631
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,640
It's impossible to show the放-down machine.

632
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,640
It's obvious that he's trying to fool us.

633
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,840
Uncle,

634
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
I'll go to the public office

635
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,840
to see what he's up to.

636
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,240
Don't worry.

637
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,840
Someone can get our products

638
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,840
and use the so-called professional equipment

639
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,640
to do the detection

640
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,040
and then send it online.

641
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,040
It's not that simple.

642
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,640
If we contact them now,

643
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,440
they might

644
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,840
turn their back on us

645
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,440
and say we're doing this.

646
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,040
You're right.

647
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,440
I'll send a statement first.

648
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,240
I'll deny it.

649
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,440
Have you ever thought about it?

650
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
If someone is really

651
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,040
trying to trick us,

652
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,840
if we deny it,

653
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,240
maybe we'll be hit by someone

654
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,040
and then attack again.

655
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,040
When the two parties are together,

656
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,640
we can't tell the truth.

657
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,840
We'll have doubts.

658
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
Once we have doubts,

659
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,040
we'll be the one to be damaged.

660
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,440
The quality of the drug industry

661
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,440
is the limit.

662
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,240
I understand.

663
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
But I'm afraid

664
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,840
if it doesn't happen now,

665
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,840
the problem will be worse.

666
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,840
How about

667
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,440
taking a few more days?

668
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,840
Maybe things will be better.

669
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,440
We can't.

670
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
It's over as soon as we take it.

671
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,640
How about this?

672
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,040
You can contact the media.

673
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,040
At two o'clock in the afternoon,

674
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,840
you can have a meeting at the first floor.

675
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
I'll go to someone

676
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,840
to set up the meeting.

677
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,040
Okay.

678
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,440
Okay.

679
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,040
We'll go first.

680
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,840
Mr. Yuan,

681
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,440
Han Xing's case

682
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,440
is a good opportunity

683
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,440
to deal with Han Ting.

684
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,440
Whether we can get out of the game

685
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,640
depends on how we deal with Han Xing.

686
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,440
If we get out of the game now,

687
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,440
we'll be in trouble.

688
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,440
No need.

689
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,240
Are you sure you're not too late?

690
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,240
I'm not.

691
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,240
I'm not.

692
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,240
I'm not.

693
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,240
I'm not.

694
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,240
I'm not.

695
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,640
You can't be late at this time.

696
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,240
That little trick

697
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,840
is much more than ours.

698
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
Let's see.

699
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,640
This crisis

700
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,040
is likely to be caused by the East.

701
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,840
It will affect us too.

702
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,240
That's right.

703
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,240
But if they can't deal with it,

704
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,640
Mr. Yuan,

705
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,240
you can't do anything

706
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
with your own hands.

707
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,240
Don't be afraid.

708
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
I'll wait for you.

709
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,640
Mr. Yuan,

710
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
I'm sorry.

711
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,640
I'm sorry.

712
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,640
I'm sorry.

713
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,640
I'm sorry.

714
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,640
I'm sorry.

715
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,640
I'm sorry.

716
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,640
I'm sorry.

717
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,640
I'm sorry.

718
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
I'm sorry.

719
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,640
I'm sorry.

720
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,640
I'm sorry.

721
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,640
I'm sorry.

722
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,640
I'm sorry.

723
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,640
I'm sorry.

724
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,640
I'm sorry.

725
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,640
I'm sorry.

726
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,640
I'm sorry.

727
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,640
I'm sorry.

728
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,640
I'm sorry.

729
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,640
I'm sorry.

730
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,640
I'm sorry.

731
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,640
I'm sorry.

732
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,640
I'm sorry.

733
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,640
I'm sorry.

734
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,640
I'm sorry.

735
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
I'm sorry.

736
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,640
I'm sorry.

737
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,640
I'm sorry.

738
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,640
I'm sorry.

739
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
They're gone.

740
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
They're gone.

741
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,640
They're gone.

742
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,640
The money is gone.

743
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,640
They're gone.

744
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,880
Hello, hello.

745
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,000
It's long gone.

746
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,980
Isn't Although you try to ask me with my hands?

747
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:19,360
Believe me, it won't work out and they won't admit it.

748
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,040
As long as I am not worried,

749
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,020
I can try to help once more.

750
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,920
It won't work after all.

751
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,480
OK, feel free.

752
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,580
Great!

753
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,800
Great!

754
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,440
are all certified by the drug bureau

755
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,440
and have medical equipment to help with the test.

756
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,640
There will be no negative effect.

757
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,040
What are you talking about?

758
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,640
Why do you guarantee that the products of Han Xing

759
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,040
don't have a chemical substance?

760
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,440
But there are chemical substances

761
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
that contain human body.

762
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
It will cause a huge damage to the patient.

763
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,240
Is Han Xing

764
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,840
the life and death of such a non-medical patient?

765
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,040
Did you use special means

766
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,240
to pass the test?

767
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
Your products have been greatly invested in the clinical bed.

768
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,240
If there is a problem,

769
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
what should we do?

770
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,040
For the video that is on the Internet,

771
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,440
please explain it to us.

772
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,240
The reporters are too much.

773
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,640
What are they doing to the customers and the staff?

774
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,440
They haven't investigated the situation yet.

775
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,040
They have already put the country on the line.

776
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,840
Okay. Don't worry.

777
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,440
The machine can handle it.

778
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
Don't worry.

779
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,840
This is a chemical substance test device

780
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,440
that you can see on the video.

781
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,240
This is the chemical substance

782
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,840
that you can use to catch the fusion gas.

783
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,640
That's right.

784
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,240
It's more than normal.

785
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
Does this look like it?

786
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
Yes.

787
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,640
It's still more than normal.

788
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,640
I'll use your notebook.

789
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,840
I...

790
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,240
It's a little bit too much.

791
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
It's okay.

792
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,040
It's too close.

793
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,440
You can see that

794
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,440
this kind of test device can handle it.

795
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,840
It's not reliable.

796
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,040
But to make our patients feel relieved,

797
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,840
I, Han Xin, announced that

798
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,240
we will review a group of test devices to the society,

799
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,440
review the products,

800
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,040
and publicize the test results.

801
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
It looks pretty reasonable.

802
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,840
Let's see.

803
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,040
Let's see.

804
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,440
Since you think there is no problem,

805
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,240
why do you have to check the data on the data?

806
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,640
Do you have a problem?

807
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,040
The key point of Dong Yi

808
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,640
is to put every patient's interests in the first place.

809
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,240
It's about health.

810
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,840
No matter how careful it is, it's not too much.

811
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,840
After the product is fully recovered,

812
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,040
I will find the third-party machine to do the test,

813
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,440
and the whole process will be live broadcasted.

814
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,640
Is there a problem with the product?

815
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,040
At that time, you will have your own judgment.

816
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,240
The result of the test?

817
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,040
Isn't it a result?

818
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,640
This child

819
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,640
has clearly said the Dongyang attitude.

820
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,040
According to the evidence we know now,

821
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,240
the video release

822
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,640
used to have the power of fake evidence.

823
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,040
If you are interested in the media friends,

824
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,640
you can go and dig it up.

825
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,040
It will be a good social topic.

826
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,240
I sincerely hope that

827
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,840
you don't help the victims

828
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,240
to create the public environment.

829
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,640
We have reported this matter.

830
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,040
After the deep investigation,

831
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,240
the result will be given.

832
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,040
I also made a reservation to you

833
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,440
for this opportunity.

834
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,840
I invite you to come to Dong Yi, Han Xin,

835
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,840
to visit our research center

836
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,040
and production base.

837
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,440
To know more about

838
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,840
the strict requirements for each product.

839
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,640
If you are interested,

840
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,240
after the public meeting,

841
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,240
you can contact the staff around me.

842
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,040
We will see each other later.

843
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,840
We will go and see.

844
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,240
The car is so washed.

845
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,240
It's not washed.

846
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,040
I just misunderstood.

847
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,840
Thank you very much for coming to the media friends today.

848
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,040
Please pay attention to the subsequent results.

849
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,240
Thank you.

850
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:27,840
Director Ji,

851
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,020
Director

852
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,840
director

853
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,780
OK.

854
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,480
Director J

855
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,640
You were cheating the director.

856
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,640
What wecorき

857
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,200
Mr. Jie,

858
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,600
your press conference was great.

859
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,160
Not only did you show

860
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,440
the sincerity of winter clothes and Han Xing,

861
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,320
but also freeed a media to help you make ads.

862
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,040
You're really overestimated.

863
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,880
But now,

864
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,680
the sales department and the public officials are all here.

865
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,560
The sales department is responsible for

866
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,080
all the products of the same brand.

867
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:14,960
At the same time,

868
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,720
An Fu has already used the patient of the product.

869
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,320
He promised to keep the job.

870
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,520
The public officials are responsible for

871
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,160
the internet redness of this video,

872
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,600
and keeping all the evidence.

873
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,040
At the same time, they are looking for the third-party company to do the test.

874
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,880
The results of the actual announcement are

875
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,480
noticed in the public opinion.

876
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,600
Okay, then let's go to work.

877
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,080
Mr. Chen,

878
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,280
I have something urgent to do.

879
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,200
I have to go.

880
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,760
Then you go to work.

881
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,200
I'll keep an eye on other things.

882
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,320
Thank you.

883
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,840
I see.

884
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,480
President Qi.

885
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:02,920
How is he?

886
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,540
The surgery was really successful.

887
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,520
Great.

888
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,040
I'm so happy to see you.

889
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,040
I'm so happy to see you.

890
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,040
I'm so happy to see you.

891
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,040
I'm so happy to see you.

892
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,040
I'm so happy to see you.

893
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,040
I'm so happy to see you.

894
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
I'm so happy to see you.

895
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,040
I'm so happy to see you.

896
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
I'm so happy to see you.

897
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
I'm so happy to see you.

898
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
I'm so happy to see you.

899
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,040
I'm so happy to see you.

900
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,040
I'm so happy to see you.

901
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
I'm so happy to see you.

902
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
I'm so happy to see you.

903
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,040
I'm so happy to see you.

904
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,040
I'm so happy to see you.

905
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,040
I'm so happy to see you.

906
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,040
I'm so happy to see you.

907
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,040
I'm so happy to see you.

908
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,040
I'm so happy to see you.

909
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,040
I'm so happy to see you.

910
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,040
I'm so happy to see you.

911
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
I'm so happy to see you.

912
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,040
I'm so happy to see you.

913
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,040
I'm so happy to see you.

914
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,040
I'm so happy to see you.

915
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
I'm so happy to see you.

916
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,040
I'm so happy to see you.

917
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,040
I'm so happy to see you.

918
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,040
I'm so happy to see you.

919
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,040
I'm so happy to see you.

920
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,040
I'm so happy to see you.

921
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,040
I'm so happy to see you.

922
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,540
I'm so happy to see you.

923
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,040
I'm so happy to see you.

924
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,040
I'm so happy to see you.

925
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,040
I'm so happy to see you.

926
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,040
I'll go and get some tea for you.

927
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,040
What's so urgent?

928
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,040
You even came back here on purpose.

929
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,040
You came with me? I knew it.

930
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,040
Wang, this isn't good.

931
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,040
What's not good?

932
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,040
Sorry for the day.

933
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,040
Sorry for the day.

934
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,040
If you want it, wait till night.

935
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,040
It's urgent.

936
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,040
The cucumber dishes will be cold.

937
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,040
I got it.

938
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,040
Xiaomu, why do you think you're so fierce?

939
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,040
What are you doing?

940
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,040
What are you doing?

941
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,040
Xiaomu, you're going to be on live?

942
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,040
It's not the end yet.

943
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,040
Of course I'm going to be on live.

944
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,040
I must be on the hot topic.

945
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,040
The press conference is over.

946
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,040
When the press conference is over,

947
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,040
I have to go back to the press conference.

948
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,040
When Xing Chen's volunteer was in trouble,

949
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,040
he was the same as now.

950
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,040
