I'm so tired of this

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Forget yourself

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
without dreaming

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Myfound

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'd try to go on, disperse in a bowl

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sure of it

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't hesitate

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The future comes

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I have no fear

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
at all

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
My own courage

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So I'd try to go on, disperse in this bowl

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I am not giving up

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will believe

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Even if there is no end

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I will do my best

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000

Yeah, we are making this

I'm a hundred-mile man

All aloof

104
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
No more diamonds in the sky

105
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,240
Ha

106
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,920

00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
I'm going to the hotel.

114
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920

00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
I'm going to the hotel.

122
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,040
The plane leaves at thrird of this time.

123
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,040
Has arrived at 10 Cottage.

124
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,080
I'll drop you off.

125
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
It's okay.

126
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,980
I'll come with you other students.

127
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,520
The love is blind but at least we've fallen tried

128
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,720
I'll keep in mind the days you by my side

129
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,920
Goodbye, my dearest past of mine

130
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,720
Just leave me behind

131
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,120
Go and leave your lies

132
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:55,720
Good night, the love is blind but at least we've fallen tried

133
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,720
I'll keep in mind the days you by my side

134
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:10,720
I'll keep in mind the days you by my side

135
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,320
Go and leave your lies

136
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Why are you here?

137
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,720
I came to see you.

138
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,720
What?

139
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
Don't you want me to go in?

140
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,720
I don't want to use your time.

141
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,240
Intro.

142
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,200
He talked to you the other day.

143
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,080
He said you've been managing your business well.

144
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,480
You'll be here in Germany

145
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,840
for a few days.

146
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
Relax.

147
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,160
I told him

148
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,360
you must be full of your plans.

149
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,440
Congratulations.

150
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,280
Here.

151
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,440
When did you start

152
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,800
to be interested in

153
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,880
these cute little things?

154
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,200
My friend gave them to me.

155
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,480
It seems like you don't know

156
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,680
enough about your friend.

157
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,000
You don't drink anymore.

158
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
It's getting late.

159
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,640
I'm going to bed.

160
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,360
You should go back too.

161
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,320
Okay.

162
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,000
Have a good rest.

163
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,320
Good night.

164
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,320
I saw the photo of

165
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,760
the photo of you going to Germany.

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,760
Please don't bother me.

167
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,440
I'm so upset.

168
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,640
Are you happy?

169
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,560
No.

170
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,440
I'm just looking at my head.

171
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,160
Are you feeling better?

172
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,440
Much better.

173
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,280
You're not in a good mood.

174
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,760
Don't eat spicy food.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,840
Drink less.

176
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,360
What's the relationship

177
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,280
between drinking and eating spicy food?

178
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,080
Old man is sick.

179
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,600
You should sleep here.

180
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
I'll go get you some porridge.

181
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,840
I don't want to drink.

182
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:12,960
Good boy.

183
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,040
You're so hungry.

184
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,120
It's even more uncomfortable

185
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,960
if you don't eat something.

186
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,840
Just talk to me.

187
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,160
Okay.

188
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,200
I'll go with you.

189
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,840
Chang Wei Yan is actually

190
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,800
an old man.

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,880
He was sick when he was little.

192
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
So little?

193
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,120
How could he be Chang Wei Yan?

194
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,920
My parents divorced.

195
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,600
I lived with my mom.

196
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
My mom was busy with her work,

197
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,960
and she couldn't eat with me.

198
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,120
Every time I feel bad,

199
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,960
I'm all alone and healthy.

200
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,400
I was thinking

201
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
that there will be a

202
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,280
caring person

203
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,360
in the future.

204
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,440
There will be a

205
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,360
loving family.

206
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,160
I used to think

207
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,960
things were far away from me.

208
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,640
Now I feel

209
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,120
I'm already brave.

210
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,400
Silly girl.

211
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,360
I'll take care of you in the future.

212
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
I'll take care of you in the future.

213
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,200
You're so good at teaching.

214
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Aunt,

215
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,880
your progress is really getting bigger.

216
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,480
Really?

217
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,120
The weather is much better.

218
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,000
Really?

219
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,560
Come, have some water.

220
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,400
Come, have some water.

221
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,040
Come, drink some water.

222
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,640
Okay.

223
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,240
Drink some water.

224
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,080
Why are you wearing such a fancy

225
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,080
and skinny dress?

226
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,480
Why?

227
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,480
You only came back after midnight.

228
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,760
Why didn't you sleep longer?

229
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,960
I'm busy with my career now.

230
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,920
I'm full of energy.

231
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,840
I'm so energetic.

232
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,600
You're busy with your career.

233
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,920
I think you should

234
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
use your time to be right.

235
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,240
For example,

236
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,000
for example,

237
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,840
find a girl

238
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,000
who loves to talk and love.

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,600
Don't make that bar all day.

240
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,080
It's not a business every day.

241
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,480
Ms. Han,

242
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,080
you're a businesswoman.

243
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,080
Why don't you make a bar

244
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,240
when you're a businesswoman?

245
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,160
Yes, Aunt Han.

246
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,480
I want to hear

247
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,560
from Lu Lingjia.

248
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,000
I've been to her bar

249
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,920
for a while.

250
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,120
She's very considerate.

251
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,280
She's very considerate.

252
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,960
Don't talk to her.

253
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,920
Look at her.

254
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,120
She's not a few years older than her.

255
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,480
She's young and mature.

256
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,320
She's more mature than she is.

257
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,400
She's so mad.

258
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,800
Ms. Han,

259
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,600
I'm going to tell you this.

260
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,400
My bar

261
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,680
is my biggest investment.

262
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,320
A mature and mature person

263
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,920
will invest in the business.

264
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,000
Besides,

265
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,120
I'm open-minded.

266
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,640
She's here to investigate.

267
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,120
She's not here.

268
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,280
You'll know

269
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,200
if you don't see her.

270
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,880
She's just a show-off.

271
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,160
You really think you're good at it?

272
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,520
Aunt Han.

273
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,520
Have some tea.

274
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,000
I've made soup.

275
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,720
Have some soup.

276
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,480
Okay.

277
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,640
Thank you, Aunt Han.

278
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,000
Hey.

279
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,400
I saw you on the live show two days ago.

280
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,360
Is your pulse a bit bad?

281
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,800
Yes.

282
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,880
So sometimes,

283
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,960
I bought a mobile phone

284
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,800
on the live show.

285
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,040
How is it?

286
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,040
Is it good?

287
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,840
It's good.

288
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,320
I bought a more

289
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,280
in-house pulse.

290
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,440
How about

291
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,680
you take it and use it?

292
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,480
It's free anyway.

293
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,560
Just be a little too much.

294
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,600
Don't be polite.

295
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,920
We're good friends now.

296
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,080
Okay.

297
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,440
Thank you.

298
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,320
Sure.

299
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,520
I'll send it to you later.

300
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,280
Okay.

301
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,320
Have some grass.

302
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,800
Did you wash it?

303
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Yes.

304
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,480
Here.

305
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,280
Yeah?

306
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,880
Here.

307
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,280
Take the towel.

308
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,800
Yes.

309
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,760
This lamp is pretty interesting.

310
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,920
What are you doing here?

311
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:48,620
It's a

312
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,640
saving position lunar

313
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,660
Suppose it's just the light.

314
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,700
What's this?

315
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,420
What?

316
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,700
How about this?

317
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,540
DJ stage.

318
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,140
Be a DJ.

319
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,860
Come on.

320
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,020
What DJ?

321
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,740
This is a live broadcast.

322
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,020
You can use it to make music for the year-end.

323
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,340
But it's not for the year-end.

324
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,740
So you usually broadcast here?

325
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,420
I put on makeup, put on light,

326
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,260
and then

327
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,060
here,

328
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,100
start.

329
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,340
It's pretty cool.

330
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,860
It's pretty cool.

331
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,860
You're on the show.

332
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,380
Look, you're on the show.

333
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,620
What show?

334
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,540
Okay, you can go now.

335
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,420
Xiaomeng.

336
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,460
Are you free these days?

337
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,540
I'll treat you to a meal.

338
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,380
Why are we eating alone?

339
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,060
I'm hungry.

340
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,420
I just want to

341
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,460
discuss with you about the bar.

342
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,660
To know what girls like now.

343
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,980
After all,

344
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,220
you're the one who

345
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,900
is the unique girl

346
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,300
in the past.

347
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,420
That's why you can

348
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,900
catch the salesman, right?

349
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,860
Don't play the rainbow.

350
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,500
I didn't.

351
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,020
Okay.

352
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,460
Then you can call me

353
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,260
when you have work to do.

354
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,220
I'll do it.

355
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,900
Okay, you can go back.

356
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,460
I'll help you pack your things.

357
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,380
Come on.

358
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:42,200
Blue

359
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,380
knew you would come back

360
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,780
to have breakfast at this point.

361
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,660
I've already ordered for you.

362
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,940
Thank you.

363
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,580
These are the ones you previously liked.

364
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,380
I'm sorry.

365
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,460
I saw the scenery of the road

366
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,660
on the way back to the hotel yesterday.

367
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,220
It's really a good time

368
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,260
for us to study together in Germany.

369
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,420
After you finish your work,

370
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,340
take me to the Eastern Yangtze.

371
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,900
I haven't been back for a long time.

372
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
If you want to go,

373
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,700
I can arrange a reception for you.

374
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,820
Okay.

375
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,260
Don't rush back.

376
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,260
Stay with Mr. Han for a few more days.

377
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,220
Don't talk nonsense.

378
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,780
Yi, I'll check the spicy.

379
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,660
We've seen you for so many years.

380
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,700
For you.

381
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,760
Then we should serve the party!

382
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:04,920
Hello.

383
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,780
chilli sauce with wine

384
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,440
Lao Fei.

385
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,420
All right.

386
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,320
Lastly,

387
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,240
I'm going to take my work and guys' work.

388
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:10,640
Thanks.

389
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,200
I have some other work to finish.

390
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,320
I will stay here for 10 minutes.

391
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,040
Alright.

392
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,960
If it's our wedding,

393
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,160
we'll propose to a family

394
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,640
like you and your birthday休息.

395
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,580
What?

396
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,200
Let's eat!

397
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,160
Smells good.

398
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,760
Thank you.

399
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,540
OK, I'll take it away.

400
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,080
Thanks.

401
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,160
I'll go get a pad.

402
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,940
I can't wait to eat with you.

403
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,920
Looks like you've loved eating bacon

404
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,520
and looked forward to it.

405
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
Don't play this game anymore.

406
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
Han Ting.

407
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
I don't understand.

408
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
We've known each other since we were kids.

409
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
You know I've always liked you.

410
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
From family,

411
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
power,

412
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,520
and convenience,

413
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
I can help you.

414
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,520
We should have been the best.

415
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,520
Why don't you choose me?

416
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
I didn't choose you.

417
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,520
You never chose me.

418
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
What about him?

419
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
You want to choose Ji Xin?

420
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
Do you think

421
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
Grandpa Han and your family will accept him?

422
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
This is my business.

423
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
You don't have to worry about it.

424
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
I've told you before.

425
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
We can be friends.

426
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,520
We can be partners.

427
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
Nothing else.

428
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
It's impossible.

429
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
This way, please.

430
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
We can be friends.

431
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
We can be partners.

432
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Be careful.

433
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
Who is the dress designer

434
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
in the restaurant just now?

435
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
Mr. Han from East Asia.

436
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Who's that beauty?

437
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,520
Maybe it's her girlfriend.

438
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,520
She's pretty.

439
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
They look good together.

440
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
Yes.

441
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Mr. Ji.

442
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Mr. Tang.

443
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Mr. Qi.

444
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
This is Mr. Han's breakfast.

445
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Thank you.

446
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
Wish you a safe journey.

447
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
Goodbye.

448
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,520
Goodbye.

449
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Let me help you.

450
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,520
Thank you.

451
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
Ji Xin.

452
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
We just got the wrong CP.

453
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
Sorry.

454
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
Just a normal meal.

455
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,520
Don't mind.

456
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
No need to explain.

457
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
See you.

458
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
I'm here.

459
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
I'm here.

460
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
I'm here.

461
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
I'm here.

462
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
I'm here.

463
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
I'm here.

464
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,520
I'm here.

465
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,520
I'm here.

466
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
I'm here.

467
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
I'm here.

468
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
I'm here.

469
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
I'm here.

470
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
I'm here.

471
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
I'm here.

472
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
I'm here.

473
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,520
I'm here.

474
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,520
I'm here.

475
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,520
I'm here.

476
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,520
I'm here.

477
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
I'm here.

478
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
I'm here.

479
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
I'm here.

480
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
I'm here.

481
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
I'm here.

482
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,520
Of course, we don't need to hide.

483
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
Because we can't hide.

484
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
The market is big enough.

485
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
We don't need to worry about the company's communication.

486
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,520
But no matter what,

487
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,520
their talents are important to us.

488
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
The number of developers is also our number.

489
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
We can't sell these products.

490
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,520
A person can use at least a few

491
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
and he will definitely choose the head.

492
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,520
The best way to say it is to say it.

493
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,520
We can choose the most weak

494
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,520
among their products.

495
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
I'm thinking about a question.

496
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,520
Have we ever known ourselves well?

497
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,520
It seems that every time we think about Han Hai

498
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,520
and our competitors,

499
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,520
it seems that we don't have enough analysis.

500
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,520
So,

501
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
we each have to be responsible

502
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
for our own analysis.

503
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
We can do everything we want.

504
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
Think about what we are good at.

505
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
Which track do you want to focus on the most?

506
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,520
What is your specialty?

507
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
Send it to me tomorrow night.

508
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
Okay.

509
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,520
I'm here.

510
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
I'm here.

511
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,520
I'm here.

512
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
I'm here.

513
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
I'm here.

514
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
I'm here.

515
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
I'm here.

516
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
I'm here.

517
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Okay.

518
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
Let's do this first.

519
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,520
Okay.

520
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
This is the exclusive purchase of the purchase.

521
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
I've chosen it.

522
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Take a look.

523
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,520
If you can, I'll bring it to you.

524
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
You've said it's done.

525
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,520
It must be okay.

526
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,520
You're the one who's more qualified.

527
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
I've been working hard

528
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
for this period of time.

529
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
What are you working hard for?

530
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
By the way,

531
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
tonight,

532
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
we're having a party.

533
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
We'll have a wedding.

534
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
What do you want to eat?

535
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
It's okay.

536
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
You decide.

537
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
I'll keep an eye on it.

538
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
Okay.

539
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,520
Here you are.

540
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Look at this.

541
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
Do you want to change it?

542
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
I'll put it in.

543
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
Okay.

544
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
Okay.

545
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
What's up?

546
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
Do you feel better?

547
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,400
Much better.

548
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,080
Your position is just right.

549
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,560
We'll have some food tomorrow.

550
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,800
How's the porridge?

551
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,640
Ji Xin is back.

552
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,640
We're going to pick her up tonight.

553
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,920
Can you go with me?

554
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,280
Hello?

555
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,720
Are you still here?

556
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,360
Yes.

557
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,600
You don't want to go?

558
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,680
How can I?

559
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,040
It's just that you're in a secret situation.

560
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,320
It's not convenient for me to go.

561
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,240
I'm not familiar with it.

562
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,760
Ji Feng is going to the office tonight.

563
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
Have fun tonight.

564
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
I'll go to you tomorrow.

565
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,240
But I want to see you tonight.

566
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,960
I want to see you in person.

567
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,960
I hope you can be here.

568
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,840
I'll be there for you.

569
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,000
Bye.

570
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,160
marks

571
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,920
Congratulations to the previous one.

572
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
You're

573
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,040
It's so late.

574
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,480
There are so many things in the company.

575
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,160
It's only five minutes.

576
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,040
It's not too late.

577
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:34,960
Yes.

578
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,880
You should understand

579
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,960
our business.

580
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,640
Where's Qiu Zi?

581
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,920
Qiu Zi said he has something to do.

582
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,080
He won't come today.

583
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,640
Li Yi,

584
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,640
don't you have any surprise for us?

585
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,640
Let's order first.

586
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,680
No one is here.

587
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,640
Order.

588
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,960
Cheers.

589
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,400
Welcome back home.

590
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,480
Thank you.

591
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,560
Li Yi.

592
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,960
You drink so much

593
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,160
when you're drunk.

594
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,560
Drink less with us.

595
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,680
I drink.

596
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,400
I'm happy.

597
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,440
Let him drink.

598
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,560
Isn't it uncomfortable?

599
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,840
Why do you still drink?

600
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,160
Mr. Xiao.

601
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,320
You don't know him?

602
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,840
The new boss.

603
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,800
I've seen him a few times.

604
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,240
Welcome back home.

605
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,560
Li Li.

606
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,280
Is this the place for me?

607
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,600
So,

608
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,280
you said it was a surprise.

609
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,160
Let me introduce it to you.

610
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,080
This is my boyfriend.

611
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,160
Xiao Yuxiao.

612
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,280
Thank you.

613
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,160
Thank you for buying the bill.

614
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,720
Where are they?

615
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,040
They're home.

616
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,160
I'll send you home.

617
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,760
Go there.

618
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,000
How much did you drink?

619
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,120
I'm happy

620
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,280
that you're here today.

621
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,480
But I know

622
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,960
you're the boss of Xin Yue.

623
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,240
I'm your girlfriend.

624
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,520
I only know you're a investment.

625
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,880
I don't know anything else.

626
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,000
Tell me, boyfriend.

627
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,200
I don't even know you know Ji Xing.

628
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,640
We only met once before.

629
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,000
And I'm not used to it.

630
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,520
We have a mutual understanding, right?

631
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,400
You're so nice.

632
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,880
You don't let me go

633
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,760
or get close to you.

634
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,040
Xiao Yuxiao.

635
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,440
You're so unreasonable.

636
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,160
I didn't mean to

637
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,440
apologize to you.

638
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,120
Okay.

639
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,600
I'll go back soon.

640
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,440
L obligation.

641
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,320
Lě yī.

642
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,560
I'll send you to the door.

643
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,760
I won't be going in.

644
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,080
What's wrong?

645
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,600
Something to do all of a sudden.

646
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:47,760
Nothing.

647
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,920
Take your time.

648
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,800
Li Yixing.

649
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
You should be there soon.

650
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:56,800
Sorry.

651
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,000
It's okay.

652
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,200
Let me do it.

653
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,360
Sit down.

654
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:19,920
Mr. Chen.

655
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,720
Coming.

656
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,720
Why are you back so early?

657
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,120
Isn't it a date?

658
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,160
He has something urgent to do at home.

659
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,240
I'll go back first.

660
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,000
What's the matter?

661
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,480
You can go in advance with Li Li's girlfriend.

662
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,280
I know.

663
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,120
Maybe it's urgent.

664
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,840
Okay.

665
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,720
Don't be unhappy.

666
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,200
Come on, let's analyze it for you.

667
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,600
Xing Xing.

668
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,080
You knew Mr. Xiao before, right?

669
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,000
Tell me about his relationship.

670
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,400
I've seen him a few times.

671
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,440
I knew he was the boss of the new music.

672
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,760
He's very rich.

673
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,000
Well.

674
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,880
Tell me about your understanding.

675
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,440
Me?

676
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,520
What?

677
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,040
You don't want to gossip about him?

678
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,920
I don't know him that well.

679
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,840
What I said

680
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,680
is gentle,

681
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,480
handsome,

682
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,480
and considerate.

683
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,040
I can't say it anymore.

684
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,920
I want to know all about him.

685
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
He only shows me half of his.

686
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,000
Why am I not in the right condition?

687
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,560
I've heard that

688
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,760
all the people who are worse than me are in the list.

689
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,560
Mr. Chen.

690
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,040
You're not in the right condition.

691
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,120
Or you can help me.

692
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,480
Please help me to add some more.

693
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,840
I don't know.

694
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,720
I'm not good at this.

695
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,120
I'm sorry.

696
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,840
I've told you many times.

697
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,840
I can't solve your problem.

698
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,520
Mr. Ji.

699
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,080
This is the first test you wanted yesterday.

700
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,200
Okay, thank you.

701
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,800
Help me to find a way.

702
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,000
What's going on here?

703
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,360
It seems that the patient

704
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,520
can be free to pursue a surgery.

705
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,760
He came to report.

706
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,200
He seems to be in a round.

707
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,920
But he's not ready to be taken.

708
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,120
Okay, Mr. Ji.

709
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,080
I'll go back to work.

710
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,760
Okay.

711
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,640
Mr. Ji.

712
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,880
I heard that

713
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,200
you're Mr. Ji.

714
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,920
Have you been in the hospital?

715
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,280
Can you help me?

716
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,480
Why can't they treat me?

717
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,680
Please help me.

718
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,800
Well, I think you're not good.

719
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,280
Why don't we sit over there?

720
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,080
Sit down and talk.

721
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,160
Mr. Ji.

722
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,280
Mr. Ji, I don't know.

723
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,000
My family...

724
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,240
My family is a little old and small.

725
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,520
I'm the only one who cares about them.

726
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,320
I've been sick for a long time.

727
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,000
No one cares about me.

728
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,320
What's wrong with your hand?

729
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,840
There's a child in the family.

730
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,520
The child is too naughty.

731
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,720
I was thirsty when I chased her.

732
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,320
I think you're so young.

733
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,440
You don't have a child, right?

734
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,080
You don't know

735
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,560
that the child is mom's daughter.

736
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,800
I'm just a child.

737
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,440
What should I do with my child?

738
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,760
Dad is so young.

739
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,800
Please let me go.

740
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:42,960
Yichen.

741
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,000
Ji Qing, sit.

742
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,800
I'm reading the previous report

743
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,240
of the clinical trial.

744
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,960
The operation is very serious.

745
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,680
It's good to recover after the surgery.

746
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,440
Thank you.

747
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,440
Do you have any feedback on our fusion device?

748
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,600
It's better than expected.

749
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,120
Our lab team

750
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,880
has a high evaluation of your new process of tracking fusion devices.

751
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,280
They said that no matter from India or India,

752
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,120
the fusion device is the best.

753
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,160
Great.

754
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:13,920
By the way,

755
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,240
please check the information for me.

756
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,880
It's not suitable for our clinical trial.

757
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,560
Just look at the information from it.

758
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,880
It's suitable for the test.

759
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,840
Okay, I got it.

760
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,000
I'll go and check the patient now.

761
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,320
I've already arranged it.

762
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,240
Come here.

763
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,840
Take the machine over.

764
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,600
Okay.

765
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,400
Thank you.

766
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,560
This way, please.

767
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,040
Yichen.

768
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,240
Qiu Zi.

769
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,320
What did you bring?

770
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,640
A lot.

771
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,160
Open it.

772
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,560
I just saw you go there.

773
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:08,880
Oh.

774
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,000
She came to talk to you.

775
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,800
I knew she would eat with me.

776
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,120
By the way,

777
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,360
Yichen.

778
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,840
Is Xing Xing

779
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,280
still not aware of our relationship?

780
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,400
Isn't this a suitable opportunity?

781
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,320
I also want

782
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,200
to get your blessings earlier.

783
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,000
I was afraid Xing Xing would be unhappy.

784
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,600
But a few days ago,

785
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,640
I heard that

786
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,480
Xing Xing was also chasing after me.

787
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,960
I'm looking forward to seeing

788
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,480
each other's happiness.

789
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
That day will come.

790
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,720
Eat it.

791
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,760
Eat it.

792
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,640
I made your favorite sweet and sour pork ribs.

793
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,360
I'll get it for you.

794
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,120
This is fresh broccoli.

795
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,960
Fresh broccoli.

796
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,160
Your favorite.

797
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,680
Aren't you on a diet?

798
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,360
Yes.

799
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,480
But for the Zhong Xiaoxing company,

800
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,040
you should not think about the real world.

801
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,040
You should learn to use the wind and the sheep's milk

802
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,360
to open the pavilion.

803
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,160
From a young age,

804
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,320
you should be a brick and a gold.

805
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,560
This is the first step.

806
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,080
I don't know

807
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,240
if this answer can solve the problem you mentioned.

808
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,000
From a young age,

809
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,520
you should be a brick and a gold.

810
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,680
Hello, Zhizhou.

811
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,440
Xing Xing,

812
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
I just saw in my technician's report

813
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,280
a great person, Zhang Fengmei,

814
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,280
I think it's you.

815
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,360
I saved him in his list.

816
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,080
However, Xing Xing,

817
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,800
I'm not sure the這是

818
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,440
the decision-making engineer

819
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,680
for this wolvesboy team

820
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,660
only has

821
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,260
an awesome selection before.

822
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,620
In this case, it's going to be worth it.

823
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,500
I'll let you talk over it.

824
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
I gave her medical power to Dr. Shao.

825
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
Dr. Shao's condition is

826
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,500
suitable for the standard.

827
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
I think they are not easy.

828
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
Can you help?

829
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Okay.

830
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,500
I understand.

831
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Then it's okay.

832
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,500
Okay.

833
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
Think about the market positioning.

834
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,500
Okay, Xin Xin.

835
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,500
I'll hang up.

836
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Bye.

837
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,500
What are you doing in front of the building?

838
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,500
Is there anything wrong with that?

839
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,500
Chief SeeDUlg لمu

840
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
is a judge.

841
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,500
Jiayu depennered from Qing mountain

842
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
foramelREx方面.

843
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,500
To mark your trip again.

844
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,500
Good.

845
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,500
You can understand us as people by itself.

846
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,340
she is.

847
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,720
Ms. Han?

848
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,660
How could you recognize me

849
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,820
when she treats me like this?

850
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,180
You're my best son.

851
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,120
Why are you wearing such a nice look today?

852
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,420
You come to Bar的

853
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,020
but I have to talk to your mother, right?

854
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,200
Thank you, and give me a new hairstyle.

855
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,260
So pretty.

856
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,140
Oh.

857
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,420
Over your head!

858
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,040
Over your standards!

859
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,100
So.

860
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,220
What do you want to see?

861
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,220
Look.

862
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,100
The wine bottle is still open.

863
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,140
Why don't you drink anything?

864
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,820
This one.

865
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,060
What?

866
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,060
I don't see you.

867
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,740
I don't see you.

868
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,580
I'll be right there.

869
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,900
So many people.

870
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,820
Okay.

871
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,700
The wine bottle is good.

872
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,500
This one is definitely suitable for you.

873
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,260
Okay.

874
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,260
Drink it.

875
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,620
Drink it.

876
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,420
Son.

877
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,060
It's really good.

878
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,780
Drink it.

879
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,500
Come on.

880
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,740
What are you doing?

881
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,140
Why didn't you use it?

882
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,740
This is a wine bottle.

883
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,740
You don't need it.

884
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,020
Xiaomeng told me before

885
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,420
that you're so interested in this wine bottle.

886
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,540
I don't believe it.

887
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,700
I believe it this time.

888
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,060
Xiaomeng, wait for me.

889
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,180
Don't mess with me.

890
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,500
It's our game season now.

891
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,140
Look at that.

892
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,940
That's good.

893
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,540
Yes.

894
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,380
The light will be on.

895
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:31,820
That's right.

896
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,220
That's right.

897
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:32,860
That's right.

898
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,500
The light is on.

899
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,940
You're the first one to find it.

900
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,820
That's a wine.

901
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,500
I'm looking forward to it.

902
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,900
We'll drink it first.

903
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,580
Mom.

904
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,900
You're not the one who's playing.

905
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,700
I'm you.

906
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,900
You're playing me?

907
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,580
Yes.

908
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,500
The beauty next to Mr. Lu.

909
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,300
Please come on.

910
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:46,940
I'm not...

911
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,780
I'm just trying to...

912
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,220
I'm trying to...

913
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:48,820
You're the one.

914
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,820
Beauty?

915
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,540
Come on.

916
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,540
I'm so sorry.

917
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,100
Mom.

918
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,900
Come on.

919
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,540
Come on.

920
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,260
Come on.

921
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,060
Come on.

922
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,100
Here.

923
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:57,500
Everyone.

924
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,300
Let me help you.

925
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,500
Is it really that hard?

926
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,700
Thank you.

927
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,500
Hello, everyone.

928
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,980
First, let me introduce myself.

929
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,580
I'm the boss of this bar.

930
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,060
That's the handsome guy.

931
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,060
I'm his mom.

932
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,700
My name is...

933
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,780
Han Yunmei.

934
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,580
I'm glad that everyone can

935
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,700
enjoy my son's bar.

936
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,100
I hope you can enjoy it here.

937
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,220
Have fun.

938
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,700
Thank you for your light.

939
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,180
Next, I'll sing a song for you.

940
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,260
This song is my new song.

941
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,060
A very gentle song.

942
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,900
I'll sing it for you.

943
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,540
Thank you.

944
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,500
I'm a little nervous.

945
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,180
For you, it's me.

946
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,300
For you, it's happiness.

947
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,400
Thank you.

948
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:32,460
I met the color of love

949
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,560
Love needs to practice

950
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,760
Let's be together

951
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,720
Absolutely discipline

952
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,660
Meet a one-ZA smile

953
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,760
I'm not afraid of the future.

954
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
I'm afraid of the future.

955
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,760
I'm afraid of the future.

956
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,760
I'm afraid of the future.

957
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
I'm afraid of the future.

958
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,760
I'm afraid of the future.

959
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,760
