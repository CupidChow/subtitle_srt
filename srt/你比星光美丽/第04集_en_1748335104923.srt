1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I wish I could be myself.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll go to the heaven, to the earth.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's not necessary to make the future come in time.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm afraid.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'll go to the heaven, to the earth.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I won't give up.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll always believe,

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,720
Youth business should be relaxed.

16
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,000
Lilao Less is More will bring you to the right content.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The End

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Is grandma okay?

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Grandma, she's fine.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Thank you, little girl.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's so hard to look at your teeth.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's been two hours.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
She's running away.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What should we do?

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Her teeth...

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Director Li, the wisdom doctor system is broken.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Can I go and see it?

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Qi Gong, you're the engineer of Qiqi's little white.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Is it possible for you to make a system that is so complicated?

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's all mess now.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why don't you let me try it?

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Come on, give me a position for you.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Are you all right?

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Excuse me?

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We're very excited.

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,800
Where's the toilet?

37
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Well,

38
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
you can restart all the computers.

39
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Thank you so much, Mr. Gong.

40
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
You're really a great engineer.

41
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
You're the most outstanding engineer.

42
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Dongyang's products

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
are very professional.

44
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
I'm just a regular employee.

45
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
You're not.

46
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Our hospital system

47
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
is so big today.

48
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Thank you for being here.

49
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Can you consider

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
working with Xiao Bai?

51
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Well,

52
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
I can't tell you directly.

53
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Your robot Xiao Bai

54
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
is actually a task for us.

55
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Xiao Bai is really good

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
in the detection and initial treatment.

57
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
But after the patient is treated,

58
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
we need to confirm it again.

59
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
In fact, for us,

60
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
the comprehensive hospital,

61
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
it's complicated.

62
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
But

63
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
your robot is really good.

64
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
The diagnosis is also very professional.

65
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
I understand what you mean.

66
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Well,

67
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
if we push this device

68
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
to the medical resources,

69
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
the relatively short-term hospital,

70
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
the diagnosis,

71
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
will it be more suitable?

72
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
This idea is good.

73
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Director Li.

74
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Mr. Han.

75
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Mr. Han.

76
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
It's really dangerous today.

77
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Thanks to the great engineer,

78
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
we solved the problem.

79
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
If we are exposed by the media

80
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
for a while,

81
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
or if there is any dispute,

82
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
we will be affected

83
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
by you and me.

84
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Sorry, I'm in trouble today.

85
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
The team of Dr. Jiang Huai will

86
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
thoroughly review and examine the system.

87
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
We will completely repair the bug.

88
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
There will be no such problem in the future.

89
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Mr. Han, I'm relieved

90
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
to hear that.

91
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Mr. Han.

92
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Today's system is in a mess.

93
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
It doesn't look like an accident.

94
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
I saw someone

95
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
very accurately said

96
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
that Dongyang Medical Treatment

97
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
is the name of Dr. Yun.

98
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
You guys are fine.

99
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
It's a new system.

100
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
It's called a smart doctor, right?

101
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Dongyang Medical Treatment

102
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
is a big company.

103
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
It's a big company.

104
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
It's a big company.

105
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
It's not like I'm a big company.

106
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
It's like we're in a big business.

107
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
It's a big company.

108
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
It's a big company.

109
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
It's a big company.

110
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
It's a big company.

111
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
It's a big company.

112
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
There is someone

113
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
taking pictures with their phone.

114
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Do you want to check it?

115
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Thank you for today.

116
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
You're welcome.

117
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Just take it as a help

118
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
to your previous life.

119
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
I think I'm making money.

120
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
The reporter prepared

121
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Dr. Yun's new report.

122
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
I'm afraid it's not an accident.

123
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
The problem with this system

124
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
can be solved in time.

125
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Otherwise,

126
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
it might affect

127
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Dr. Yun's falling into other hospitals.

128
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Anyway,

129
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
I owe you one.

130
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I just hit a hard-hit.

131
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
I'm just in a hurry.

135
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
The system is currently running.

136
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
But the system

137
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
needs to be upgraded as soon as possible.

138
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
This way,

139
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
it can avoid the problem of the back of the head.

140
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Don't worry.

141
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
I'll handle it.

142
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Let's go.

143
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Get in the car.

144
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
I'll go back by myself, Mr. Han.

145
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
I'm not sure.

146
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm afraid they'll say something.

147
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
You saw the post on the Internet, too?

148
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
I guessed it.

149
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
What?

150
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
I can't bear this kind of grievance.

151
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
How?

152
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Ji Xin,

153
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
don't care about others' eyes.

154
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
The sound of the chain of the wound

155
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
can't fly high.

156
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Be yourself.

157
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Don't live in other people's bad luck.

158
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
I'll be right back.

159
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Bye.

160
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Miss.

161
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Can I borrow a phone for you?

162
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
My son said

163
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
he'd give her a call after the check-in.

164
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
It's safe.

165
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
I don't have a phone.

166
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
It's okay.

167
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
You can use mine.

168
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
You can just call me directly.

169
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Okay, thank you.

170
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Bye.

171
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Hello, son.

172
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,800
I'm done with the teeth.

173
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
I can't get the car.

174
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
I'll be back soon.

175
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
I'll hang up.

176
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
I don't have a phone.

177
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
I borrowed it from a girl.

178
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
I'll pay for it.

179
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
I'll hang up.

180
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Okay.

181
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Thank you.

182
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
You're welcome.

183
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,800
You solved the problem.

184
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Thank you so much.

185
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
If it weren't for you,

186
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
we'd have been in vain.

187
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
You're welcome.

188
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I should have done it.

189
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
You're young people.

190
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
You love Qianxu.

191
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Okay, I'll go.

192
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Okay.

193
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
If you have time,

194
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
go to our village.

195
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
It's beautiful.

196
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Okay.

197
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Bye.

198
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Take care.

199
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
You're welcome.

200
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Take care.

201
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
I didn't expect

202
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
to send him to the New Hong Kong Hospital.

203
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
He even made a contribution in front of the kendo.

204
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
But in this way,

205
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Ji Xing's ability is really strong.

206
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
This time, he helped Dong Yi

207
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,800
solve the problem of the wisdom doctor.

208
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
He also helped us to increase the light.

209
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
If it hadn't been solved,

210
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
it would have affected Dong Yi

211
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
and the cooperation of the New Hong Kong Hospital.

212
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
It would have made the situation worse.

213
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Who will take this responsibility?

214
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
You or me?

215
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
You or me?

216
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Yes.

217
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
This is...

218
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
This is what I want to do.

219
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Ji Xing is in a hurry.

220
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Song Lin.

221
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Sometimes, the person who holds the kendo

222
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
is a good person.

223
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
But if he gets too fast,

224
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
it might affect your position.

225
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
I see.

226
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
I'm going to teach him.

227
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Ji Xing.

228
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Have you finished working on the New Hong Kong Hospital?

229
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
I need to talk to you.

230
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Come with me.

231
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
I'm from the hospital.

232
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
I'm here to see a doctor.

233
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
I'm a doctor.

234
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
I'm preparing a small amount of money

235
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
to develop treatment for the lower body.

236
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
I've already helped you.

237
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Shouldn't he be responsible for the people in the market?

238
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
Why do you want to see me?

239
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Ji Xing.

240
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
I know

241
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
you think the lower body

242
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
is a bitter and tiring thing.

243
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
But the more it is,

244
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
the more it can show

245
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,120
You should work hard and be responsible.

246
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,440
You should do your best

247
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
and let the leadership be satisfied.

248
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,640
Then,

249
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,560
I might find another chance

250
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,560
to give you a promotion.

251
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,240
What I said before was that you would give me a promotion

252
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,640
after the end of the first round.

253
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,560
Why do you still need to find another chance?

254
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,520
Ji Qing,

255
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
I'm about to

256
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
tell you this.

257
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,280
I was going to

258
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,800
ask Director Ren Li

259
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,520
to apply for promotion.

260
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,240
But this time,

261
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,480
you're so noisy.

262
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,760
Everyone has some ideas.

263
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,440
You know that sometimes,

264
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,040
it's not me who said it.

265
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,280
I'm also trying to help you.

266
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,680
Now, it seems

267
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,240
that the possibility of promotion is not high.

268
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,760
Xiao Bai's project bonus

269
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,240
might be reduced.

270
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,320
How much?

271
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,880
I don't know

272
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,240
what you mean.

273
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,280
You're so noisy.

274
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,280
Everyone has some ideas.

275
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,680
To balance everyone's emotions,

276
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,240
I have to sacrifice you.

277
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,080
What do you mean?

278
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,920
I'm the victim.

279
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,120
And Director Chen,

280
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,840
are you sure I can't get promoted

281
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,680
because of the celebration?

282
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,840
What do you mean?

283
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,440
You're the biggest cake in my life.

284
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
You're the biggest cake.

285
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,880
You're the most important thing for me.

286
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,280
You even went to Director Ren Li's face

287
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
to make me look like a man.

288
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,600
You made me look like a man.

289
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
I heard it all.

290
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,480
No.

291
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,200
No, Ji Qing.

292
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,160
Where did you hear these things from?

293
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
No, Ji Qing, don't be so excited.

294
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,760
If you know something,

295
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,440
I'm not in a hurry.

296
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,120
Okay.

297
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,360
If you can't get promoted,

298
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,120
I'll go and ask the people who can.

299
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,120
You...

300
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,040
... Tube egy мне.

301
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,720
You station love me.

302
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Okay, let's do it.

303
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,920
Every gig does as I say.

304
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,080
That's my secret plan.

305
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,800
I'm sorry.

306
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,440
Mr. Zeng,

307
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,640
I just want to ask

308
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,280
why I'm going to

309
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,120
do the market department

310
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,640
and the insurance department.

311
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,080
This is the result of Mr. Chen and the Human Resources Department

312
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,320
communicating.

313
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,880
You come to ask me.

314
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,520
Is it inappropriate?

315
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,480
I'm sorry. I know I'm in a hurry.

316
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,520
But Mr. Chen said he couldn't do it.

317
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,400
I came to you.

318
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,200
I came to the company

319
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,960
and met Xiaobai.

320
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,880
I've been working hard.

321
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,280
In addition to the likes of this project,

322
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,360
I have to live.

323
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,720
Mr. Chen promised to finish Xiaobai's work

324
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,480
and give me a promotion.

325
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,040
The project bonus is also down.

326
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,880
It's okay for me to do other departments.

327
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,640
No problem.

328
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,240
But

329
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,160
if I don't get the money,

330
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,720
I think it's unfair.

331
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,240
Ji Xin,

332
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,880
if you hit Zhu Lei

333
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,920
because of Chen Songlin,

334
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,200
but you're not satisfied,

335
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,080
you're too petty.

336
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,200
Besides, Zhu Lei also paid for it.

337
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,120
You don't have to be jealous of others.

338
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,400
I believe Mr. Chen

339
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,840
will have his own decision.

340
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,600
I'm willing to do it.

341
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,360
How will he manage the development department?

342
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,960
No, Mr. Zeng.

343
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,480
Ji Xin,

344
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,800
I know you're capable of doing it.

345
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,680
But the company also gave you space for development.

346
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,400
I hope you can be more open-minded.

347
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,120
You have to know that

348
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,720
not every company

349
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,840
can let you do what you like.

350
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,720
I have a call.

351
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,760
Zhu Linjia,

352
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
do you have a decision?

353
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,280
No.

354
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,280
I'm a bodybuilder.

355
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,840
I'm so tired.

356
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,120
Hey, alien.

357
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,800
Dianjie.

358
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,000
Tired.

359
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,160
Let's hear from alien.

360
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,800
Five five alien.

361
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,080
Dianjie.

362
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,360
Tired.

363
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,680
Let's hear from alien.

364
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,720
Tired.

365
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Let's hear from alien.

366
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,960
Alien.

367
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,280
The first place in the national sales.

368
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
To balance everyone's emotions,

369
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,680
I can only sacrifice you.

370
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,760
Not every company

371
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,960
can let you do what you like.

372
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,200
All right.

373
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,440
Ji Xin.

374
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,480
Send me the 27th plan.

375
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,080
Okay.

376
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,880
Ji Xin.

377
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,000
You've always been my most important subordinate.

378
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,160
If I have to say something

379
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,320
and make you misunderstand,

380
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,360
don't take it to heart.

381
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,600
We're in the same boat.

382
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,600
If Xiaobai is good,

383
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,240
we can both go up.

384
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,600
Xiaobai is your heart.

385
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,120
You're so responsible.

386
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,960
You can't just waste it.

387
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,240
Ji Xin.

388
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,320
You're still young.

389
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,120
You'll have a chance in the future.

390
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,280
But for this little thing,

391
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,160
what if you offend Mr. Zeng?

392
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,600
Then you'll be in trouble.

393
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,600
Do you know how hard it is to find a job?

394
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,680
A person like you

395
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,760
can't get into the core project

396
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,560
and experience and ability to break the path.

397
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,760
Then the job is over.

398
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,400
I'm here for you.

399
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,560
It's all for your own good.

400
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,560
All right.

401
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,040
Don't be angry.

402
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,400
Hurry up and arrange the plan.

403
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,120
Send it to me.

404
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,080
All right.

405
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,480
78 FabricLink sent you an email.

406
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,160
My resignation.

407
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,840
This...

408
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,120
This...

409
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,640
AllIES?

410
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,800
Ji Xin.

411
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,960
You've gotten it right?

412
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,280
Your signature

413
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,880
CambricLink signing contract will be signed.

414
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,280
If I'm fired,

415
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,240
you cannot work in

416
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,560
this industry for two years.

417
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,080
It's all sent to you because I was so fired.

418
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,600
Okay.

419
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,800
Okay.

420
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,600
Even if you insist,

421
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,520
you still have a month to deal with it.

422
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,600
You have to do

423
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,000
the things on your head.

424
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,200
You must obey the company's arrangement.

425
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,280
Just do as I say.

426
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,280
Okay.

427
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,880
It's Mr. Ravi's relative

428
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,280
who has left.

429
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,920
Yes!

430
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,720
It happens with us.

431
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,800
I'm afraid

432
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
The project is gone.

433
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Our buy-off is going to be delayed.

434
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Little silly,

435
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
compared to the house,

436
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
I hope you live happily.

437
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
It's good to die.

438
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Okay, okay.

439
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
If we don't want to do it,

440
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
we won't do it.

441
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
We won't regret it.

442
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
I suddenly feel

443
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
that people are more complicated than the code.

444
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Promise me.

445
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Don't think about it these days.

446
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Have a good rest and relax.

447
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
When I finish this project,

448
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
I'll come back to you for the first time.

449
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Okay?

450
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Bye.

451
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Yichen, are you busy?

452
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
No,

453
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
why do you still eat instant noodles?

454
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
Director Liu,

455
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
we're having a big meal tonight.

456
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Let's go.

457
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
This is enough for me.

458
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
You go ahead.

459
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
I'm busy today.

460
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Can't you go to the restaurant?

461
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
No, I'm busy today.

462
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
I'm busy today.

463
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
I'm busy today.

464
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
I'm busy today.

465
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
I'm busy today.

466
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
I'm busy today.

467
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
I'm busy today.

468
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
I'm busy today.

469
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
I'm busy today.

470
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
I'm busy today.

471
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
I'm busy today.

472
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,800
I'm going to prepare all the memory data today.

473
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
When the concert is over,

474
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
I can submit the summary report.

475
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
This report is not urgent.

476
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
When the concert is over,

477
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
we can write it slowly.

478
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Besides,

479
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
we've already made a deal.

480
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
After that,

481
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
we can go back to the nearby village.

482
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Next time,

483
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
when the concert is over,

484
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
I'll prepare to go back to Xinjiang.

485
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
I miss my girlfriend.

486
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Okay.

487
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
I won't disturb you.

488
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
If you need anything,

489
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
call me.

490
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Eat well and drink well.

491
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
I'll leave you to it.

492
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Okay.

493
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
I'll be back.

494
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
Bye.

495
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Bye.

496
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Bye.

497
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Bye.

498
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Bye.

499
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
I'll be back soon.

500
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
I'll be back soon.

501
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Bye.

502
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Bye.

503
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Bye.

504
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
Bye.

505
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Bye.

506
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Bye.

507
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Bye.

508
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
Bye.

509
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Bye.

510
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,320
Yes.

511
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,400
Thank you.

512
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
Wait for me.

513
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,340
It disappears

514
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,280
Send

515
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,120
Time is running slow

516
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,320
Let's go

517
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,340
Let's go

518
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,980
What do we do?

519
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,760
Why didn't you come to work at 10?

520
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
I resigned.

521
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
Resign?

522
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,760
You suddenly chose to resign?

523
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
Silly you.

524
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,760
You chose to resign.

525
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,760
You can't get the compensation.

526
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,760
Not only compensation,

527
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,760
there is no prize prize for the project.

528
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,760
Did you know about the Young Doctor?

529
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
I know.

530
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,760
I'm pressing his finger to rest and let go.

531
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,760
Uncle, do you want to sleep naturally?

532
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,760
Now you can sleep peacefully.

533
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,760
Go to sleep.

534
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,760
Life is like this.

535
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,760
You can't sleep if you want to.

536
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,760
It's okay.

537
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,760
You don't have to worry.

538
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,760
I'll just sit and let go.

539
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,760
I'll just sit and let go.

540
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,760
Sister Xing, I've covered the proposal again.

541
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,760
When will you have time?

542
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,760
I'll go find you.

543
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,760
Now, now.

544
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,760
Now I have time.

545
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,760
Now, now, now.

546
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,760
The coffee is here.

547
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,760
Be careful.

548
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,760
Cheers.

549
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,760
I resigned. You're so happy.

550
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,760
Of course I'm happy.

551
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,760
Come on, Sister Xing.

552
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,760
Think about the things you did with me.

553
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,760
The three-dimensional treatment is very good.

554
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,760
And it's because of all the barriers.

555
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,760
I'm still thinking about it.

556
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,720
I'm still thinking about it.

557
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,720
I don't want to think about work for now.

558
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,720
I understand.

559
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,720
Sister Xing, although I'm not sure,

560
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,720
I've been in a bad mood.

561
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,720
But I can feel that

562
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,720
you're very unhappy this time.

563
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,720
But why are you unhappy?

564
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,720
Think about it.

565
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,720
When we were in school,

566
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,720
you laughed a lot and acted a lot.

567
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,720
The romantic side of that guy.

568
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,720
But for love,

569
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,720
we stuck together with you.

570
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,720
That's why,

571
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,720
you turned away from her all the time.

572
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,720
Master,

573
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,720
don't have to take poison.

574
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,720
Take it.

575
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,720
No.

576
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,720
Okay, it's fine.

577
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,040
and keep taking medicine.

578
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,960
It's hurting again these days.

579
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,600
Qingtian's village is too far from the hospital.

580
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,600
I just want to ask what to do.

581
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,440
Should I keep taking medicine

582
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,480
or go to the hospital?

583
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,440
Grandma, I'm not a doctor.

584
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
I don't know.

585
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,640
Go to the hospital and have a look.

586
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,800
You're not a doctor?

587
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,400
I saw you fix the thing

588
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,680
at the hospital that day.

589
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,120
I thought you were the doctor there.

590
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,600
I'll wait for two more days.

591
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,120
If it hurts again,

592
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,560
I'll follow the car

593
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,960
and run away.

594
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,280
Okay, I won't fight anymore.

595
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,280
It's okay.

596
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,080
Goodbye.

597
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,840
Who is it, bro?

598
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,840
I met an old grandma in the hospital.

599
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,760
She took me as a doctor.

600
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,360
She lives in the village.

601
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,560
She's far away.

602
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,480
She went to the hospital

603
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,960
to see a flight attendant.

604
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,880
Indeed.

605
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,160
The condition of the incense stick is worse.

606
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,160
It's not easy for these old people.

607
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,680
Tell me about your business.

608
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,000
Look at your plan.

609
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,040
Come on.

610
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,680
Please take a look.

611
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,080
There's even a windscreen.

612
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,680
People always want to enter.

613
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,640
You two are so busy.

614
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,200
You can't meet people in the morning.

615
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,320
Especially,

616
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,040
you can't get rid of the paper.

617
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,200
I'm so busy.

618
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,640
I'll just hand over the work.

619
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,720
Baby.

620
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,880
I have a big client.

621
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,680
I can only find a software engineer.

622
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,280
How about I recommend him?

623
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,400
I have a junior.

624
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,120
He told me that

625
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,760
he wants me to start a business with him.

626
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,280
I admire him.

627
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,920
He's brave and powerful.

628
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,640
I'm actually a little bit

629
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,440
interested in what he said.

630
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,960
Are you crazy?

631
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,080
How much money do you need to start a business?

632
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,280
Yes.

633
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,080
It's too hard to start a business.

634
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,080
But I don't know what I should do.

635
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,960
If I go to a new company,

636
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,520
I'll be in trouble for two or three years

637
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,800
and meet some bad things.

638
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,600
I'll be like this

639
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,800
when I go to the trouble.

640
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,000
Forget it.

641
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,800
I won't say that.

642
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,720
Eat.

643
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,280
Don't be silly.

644
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,120
Qingtian Fish Village?

645
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,600
What?

646
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,280
Guan Hua helped the doctor

647
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,840
in the treatment activity.

648
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,640
Qingtian Fish Village?

649
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
What?

650
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,760
Are you out of your mind?

651
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,920
Why do you want to go?

652
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,760
Don't go.

653
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,920
No one wants to go to the trouble.

654
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,320
The boss is worried about you.

655
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,080
But I heard that

656
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,680
Qingtian Fish Village is pretty.

657
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,480
Let's go to the trouble together some other day.

658
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,600
Sure.

659
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,600
Just go to the trouble with Xingxing.

660
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,440
I'll go to the trouble.

661
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
What's fun?

662
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,200
I'll take a look.

663
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,520
You can catch crabs.

664
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
You can also make fast food and fish.

665
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,280
It's not that far.

666
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,120
We need to make the fourth line of the subway first.

667
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,800
Then change the 915 route

668
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,120
and 309 route.

669
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,880
How many hours do we have to go down?

670
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,640
It's too far.

671
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,520
I won't go.

672
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,920
It's so painful.

673
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,160
How painful?

674
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,280
We have a car in the next street.

675
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,200
Shen Hao,

676
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,300
you spend more

677
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,000
the weather on the subway.

678
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:21,720
Changsheng,

679
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,400
some place here,

680
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,240
some partners.

681
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:23,920
Do you see

682
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,880
any frozen crabs?

683
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,120
You'reaf cie пу.

684
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,680
Look up,

685
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:43,480
you drive through the

686
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,240
Honestly?

687
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,080
At Tianyu Village,

688
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,920
I also do it at Jin Tianyu Electronics.

689
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,960
I'll arrange for it.

690
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,280
I'm coming.

691
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,280
I just got off.

692
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,280
The equipment is all here.

693
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,280
Okay, then send me the location of the clinic.

694
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
Okay.

695
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,280
Okay.

696
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,280
Okay.

697
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
Okay.

698
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,280
Okay.

699
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,280
Okay.

700
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,280
Okay.

701
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
Okay.

702
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,280
Okay.

703
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,280
Okay.

704
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
Okay.

705
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Okay.

706
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,280
Okay.

707
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Okay.

708
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
Okay.

709
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,280
Okay.

710
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,280
Okay.

711
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,280
Okay.

712
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,280
Okay.

713
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,280
Okay.

714
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,280
Okay.

715
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,280
Goodbye.

716
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
Mr. Han.

717
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
Don't bother.

718
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,280
I'll take you there.

719
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,280
You're still here to participate in the treatment project?

720
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
I promised you before.

721
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,280
The final draft.

722
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,280
Dr. Jiang is going to take over Dongyi's AI department.

723
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,280
He's in charge of the development and operation of Dr. Zhihui's medical field.

724
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,280
Wow.

725
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,280
He's good at taking over Dr. Jiang's position.

726
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,280
Join Dongyi.

727
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,280
He knows that you've solved Dr. Zhihui's medical field before.

728
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
I want your resume.

729
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,280
I hope you can join his team.

730
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,280
No.

731
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
I have a business plan.

732
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,280
I can help you.

733
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
The salary is low.

734
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,280
I'm sure it's better than when you were in Guanghua.

735
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,280
If you have any requirements, just tell me.

736
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Thank you for inviting me at this time.

737
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,280
But I'm like this now.

738
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
What now?

739
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,280
You're busy and I'm suspicious.

740
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,280
Do you think it's fair to report it to the public?

741
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,280
You always have a unique number.

742
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,280
I always think it's right to report it to the public.

743
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,280
But now I realize that

744
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,280
the human affairs are more important than professional skills.

745
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
I realized that

746
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
you're a person who's smart.

747
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,280
You need to learn from the machine.

748
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,280
You need to adapt to the environment.

749
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,280
You need to be honest with me.

750
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,280
You're right.

751
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,280
But I don't want to be called a fairy.

752
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,280
I don't want to be like that.

753
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,280
The easiest way to be called a fairy

754
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
is to find your own group.

755
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
Dr. Jiang is like you.

756
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,280
He's a person who doesn't want to be involved in any technical issues.

757
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,280
Maybe you two can create a different world

758
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,280
with different people.

759
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
With your current situation,

760
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,280
it's better than working with Dr. Jiang.

761
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
Think about it.

762
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,280
It's okay.

763
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,280
Just take this and line up there.

764
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
Okay, thank you.

765
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
Hello, ladies.

766
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,280
This is our Guanghua.

767
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,280
We're here for a whole day.

768
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,280
There's an introduction on the top.

769
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,280
If you want to check your teeth or something,

770
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
you can line up there.

771
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
It's free.

772
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
It's free.

773
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Look at it.

774
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
It's you, little girl.

775
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
Hello, grandma.

776
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,280
Hello.

777
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
You don't say you're not a fairy.

778
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
You're a fairy.

779
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,280
Hello.

780
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,280
You don't say you're not a doctor?

781
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
I'm not a doctor.

782
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,280
Look at that white machine.

783
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,280
It's called a white machine.

784
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,280
I'm the engineer of that machine.

785
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
I'll come with her to check your teeth.

786
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
How's your teeth?

787
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,280
Is it better?

788
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,280
Do you want to check it again?

789
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,280
No, no.

790
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
I called you before.

791
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,280
I was too anxious.

792
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,280
I took some medicine.

793
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
The little machine is famous.

794
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,280
I participated in design and research.

795
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,280
You're right.

796
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,280
That's great.

797
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
We can finally go to the hospital

798
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
without a car.

799
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,280
I have an old friend.

800
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
Niu Yuhong.

801
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,280
Hello, grandma.

802
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,280
Hello.

803
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,280
She's been feeling unwell these days.

804
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,280
She doesn't go to the hospital.

805
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,280
She always takes medicine.

806
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
I told her

807
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,280
that you little machine can check her teeth.

808
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,280
Okay, okay.

809
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
Grandma,

810
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,280
take this.

811
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,280
Take this.

812
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,280
I'll take you to the line.

813
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,280
Let's go.

814
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
No, no.

815
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,280
I can walk by myself.

816
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Okay, okay.

817
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
Follow me.

818
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,280
Niu.

819
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,280
Hello.

820
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,280
Your report shows that

821
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,280
the left jaw of the first teeth is also red.

822
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,280
That's the spot.

823
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,280
It has deep teeth.

824
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,280
It has a strong liquid output.

825
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,280
Fortunately, you came here today.

826
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,280
If you think this development of the disease

827
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,280
will cause your liver and teeth to absorb.

828
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,280
That is to say,

829
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,280
this tooth can't be preserved.

830
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
What should we do?

831
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
What should we do?

832
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,280
This is going to be used to

833
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
super-lip-edidiculate the number of cells.

834
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,280
That is to say,

835
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,080
it will be used to

836
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,280
remove the dead skin cells

837
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
and then use it

838
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,280
to remove the surface of your teeth.

839
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,280
Then, it will be re-used

840
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,280
to the medical department.

841
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,280
Is it that troublesome?

842
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,280
It's not troublesome.

843
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
How about this?

844
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
I'll give you some salt.

845
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,280
Hello, uncle.

846
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Hello, hello.

847
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,280
Hello, hello.

848
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,280
Han Zuo.

849
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
Don't worry.

850
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,280
We are being promoted.

851
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,280
We will definitely

852
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
use this

853
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
wisdom cloud doctor system.

854
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Thank you for your cooperation.

855
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
We should thank you.

856
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,280
This system

857
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,280
is too big

858
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,280
for our remote mountains.

859
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
Grandma,

860
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,280
you remember what the doctor said, right?

861
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,280
Don't worry.

862
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,280
It's very convenient

863
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
to use this super-lip-edidiculate number.

864
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,280
This is your

865
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,280
report. Take it.

866
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,280
Here.

867
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
Thank you.

868
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,280
It's okay. Don't mention it.

869
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,280
What's wrong?

870
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
Take it slow.

871
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,280
Don't be convinced.

872
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
Don't be convinced.

873
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,280
I can walk on my own.

874
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
Yu Hong.

875
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,280
When she was young,

876
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,280
her leg was broken by a car.

877
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
Now, she is a fake.

878
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
She is very confident.

879
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,280
She never let anyone help her.

880
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
Don't mind her.

881
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,280
No.

882
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
Let's go tonight.

883
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,280
I'll go tomorrow.

884
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,280
Then you can go to my house today.

885
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,280
No need to bother, grandma.

886
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
Our company has arranged

887
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,280
a famous house

888
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
in the village.

889
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,280
Okay.

890
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,280
I'll go now.

891
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
I'll walk you out.

892
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
No need.

893
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,280
Go ahead.

894
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,280
Yu Hong.

895
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,280
It's good to see you today.

896
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,280
What should we do with this?

897
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
Just eat this.

898
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,280
Ask her.

899
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Just eat it.

900
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,280
Now, this system

901
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,280
is like the clinic

902
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
for us.

903
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
It's like a professional

904
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,280
in a big hospital.

905
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
It's good to help everyone.

906
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,280
There are no problems in the later period.

907
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,280
You can contact our engineer anytime.

908
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Okay.

909
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
Then you go first.

910
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
I'll walk around.

911
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,280
Okay.

912
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,280
What are you thinking?

913
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
Seeing what I'm doing

914
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
helps me

915
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
to help everyone.

916
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
It's quite a success.

917
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,280
Yes.

918
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,280
I'll go to work now.

919
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,280
I'll go now.

920
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,280
Okay.

921
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,280
Thank you for the committee

922
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
of the competition

923
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
to recognize

924
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
our designer.

925
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
Although he's just a chef,

926
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
we will keep doing our best

927
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,280
until we really invest in it

928
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
and help the people

929
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,280
who need more help.

930
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,280
Grandma Liu.

931
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
Mother.

932
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
Why are you here?

933
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,280
I'm here to find you.

934
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,280
This is a fish liver made with red fish.

935
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
It's delicious.

936
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,280
She asked me to give it to you.

937
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,280
No need.

938
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,280
You're being too polite.

939
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,280
It's not something that's worth money.

940
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,280
If you don't take it,

941
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,280
she'll be upset.

942
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
Okay.

943
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,280
Come.

944
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,280
Sit here.

945
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
Okay.

946
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,280
I'll go to see her.

947
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,280
Let's go.

948
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,280
I'll go.

949
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
Okay.

950
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,280
Okay.

951
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,280
Sit down.

952
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Where's Grandma Liu?

953
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,280
She doesn't like to go out.

954
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
By the way,

955
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,280
isn't her fake finger a match?

956
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,280
I think she's not feeling well.

957
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
Yes.

958
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,280
Her leg was injured a long time ago.

959
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,280
The fake leg she's wearing

960
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
was bought by the cashier.

961
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
When she was feeling unwell,

962
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,280
she asked the doctor.

963
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,280
The doctor said

964
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,280
it's best to make a decision

965
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
based on your own leg.

966
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,280
How much money do we have?

967
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,280
We don't know about it.

968
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
We know that if we make a fake leg,

969
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,280
we can buy a house in the city.

970
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,280
How can she afford it?

971
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,280
You don't even know.

972
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,280
When her knee was badly damaged,

973
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,280
it was all blood.

974
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
It hurts.

975
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,280
She used to be a pretty person.

976
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
But she's now a person

977
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,280
who has been a part of her life

978
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,280
because of her leg.

979
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,280
Grandma, don't worry.

980
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,280
Our medical level is developing rapidly.

981
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,280
It will be better and better.

982
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,280
I hope so.

983
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
Okay. I'm leaving.

984
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,280
You should rest early.

985
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,280
I won't bother you.

986
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,280
It's okay.

987
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,280
I'm leaving.

988
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,280
I'll see you off.

989
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,280
No need.

990
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,280
You can go.

991
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
Okay.

992
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,280
Good night, grandma.

993
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,280
Okay. See you.

994
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,280
Yes.

995
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,280
She used to be a beautiful person.

996
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,480
I've been a person for a lifetime.

997
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,480
What's wrong?

998
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,080
I'm so upset.

999
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,880
I can walk by myself.

1000
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,280
Today is a good day.

1001
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,280
Xin.

1002
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,680
Think about it.

1003
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,080
It's a good thing to be with me.

1004
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,480
The three-day medical record is good.

1005
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,280
And it's a good thing to have all the patients.

1006
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,880
With your current situation,

1007
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,880
it's not better than

1008
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,080
working with Dr. Jiang.

1009
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,880
You're still up late.

1010
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,080
You're blowing the wind here.

1011
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,080
I can't sleep.

1012
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,080
I'm out of breath.

1013
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,280
What about you?

1014
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,480
I can't sleep.

1015
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,480
I'm out of breath.
