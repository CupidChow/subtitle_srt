1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to the sky to the earth.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sure I won't be afraid.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll make the future come true.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll be brave.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'm going to the sky to the earth.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I won't give up.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000

The End

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yuchen,

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
after I'm done with this,

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
let's go to see Uncle and Aunt.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Buy some tea for Uncle.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Aunt, buy some food.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's watch the movie first.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yuchen,

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
after we're old,

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
let's go to such a beautiful place.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's live well.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Do you still remember

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
when we said

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
we should go to Yunnan to see a famous tree?

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
At that time,

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
you said I was good at cooking.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm good at being a chef.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're a front-line cook.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But you also said

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
you didn't want me to be too hard.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Why don't you just stay here

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and help us?

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
In this way,

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
we can go fishing,

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
climbing the mountains,

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and go to all places we want to go.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If we're bored in one place,

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
we'll go somewhere else.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Then we'll be old.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We'll sit at the door of our house every day.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Shake it.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Shake it.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We'll be safe and sound forever.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We'll be safe and sound.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Xingxing,

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
if we can really do this,

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
how good would it be?

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000

Hello.

Why haven't you come down yet?

244
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Master, you're here.

245
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Wait for me two minutes.

246
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Come down right away.

247
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
No.

248
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The road is not easy to park.

249
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No.

250
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
No.

251
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The road is not easy to park.

252
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay.

253
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I know.

254
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The road is not easy to park.

255
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll come down right now.

256
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Bye.

257
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yicheng, I'm leaving.

258
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The meeting today is very important.

259
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000

Please have a big dinner

263
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
at dinner time.

264
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yicheng,

265
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
let's break up.

266
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What did you say?

267
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I said

268
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
let's break up.

269
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll be angry

270
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
if you play with me.

271
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Shao Yicheng.

272
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I've been waiting for so long.

273
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Why haven't you come down yet?

274
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You can't stop.

275
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I said I'll come.

276
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll come.

277
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Wait for me.

278
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What's wrong?

279
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Why can't you wait for me?

280
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm so sorry.

281
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Go.

284
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Thank you.

285
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll give you the choice.

286
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll give you the choice.

287
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll give you the choice.

288
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll give you the choice.

289
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll give you the choice.

290
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll give you the choice.

291
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Hello, I'm here.

292
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Can I make up on the car?

294
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yicheng,

295
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
draw it.

296
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Thank you.

297
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yicheng.

298
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yicheng.

299
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yicheng.

300
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I think

301
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
no matter how big it is,

302
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
no matter how much you look at it,

303
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
it's not a big deal.

304
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Think about it.

305
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You'll get there.

306
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Thank you, master.

307
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll go to the car later.

308
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Where?

309
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Mr. Han, we're about to start.

310
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Please come to the backstage to prepare the performance.

311
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay.

312
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Mr. Han, please go ahead.

313
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'll go first.

314
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Let's go.

315
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Let's go.

316
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Please enjoy the performance.

317
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Ji Qing.

318
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Ji Qing.

319
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Mr. Han.

320
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Mr. Shen.

321
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
This is the new technology of Xing Chen.

322
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Although the company just started,

323
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
it's still a bit of a challenge.

324
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Excuse me.

325
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Nice to meet you, Mr. Shen.

326
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Mr. Shen, hello.

327
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So, you're the new one Mr. Han recently invested in.

328
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Mr. Han can be seen as a promising man.

329
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Thank you for your kind words.

330
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'll learn more from you in the future.

331
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Mr. Han and I are going to have dinner.

332
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Let's have a meal together.

333
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Let's have a chat.

334
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Mr. Shen.

335
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Long time no see.

336
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Ji Qing is here, too.

337
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Mr. Shen.

338
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Mr. Shen, do you know Mr. Ji?

339
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Of course.

340
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You don't know him, do you?

341
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Ji Qing used to be our brand ambassador

342
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
for a long time.

343
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Okay.

344
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Ji Qing,

345
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Mr. Shen is a big man in the industry.

346
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If you don't know him, please call him.

347
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Don't play with him.

348
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Ji Qing.

349
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You can directly ask him

350
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
how to contact Mr. Shen.

351
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Mr. Shen is a good person.

352
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Come on, Ji Qing.

353
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We'll make a call.

354
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

355
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll scan your number.

356
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Here.

357
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Okay.

358
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Let's go over there.

359
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Let's chat while eating.

360
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Okay. Let's go.

361
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
We'll go together

362
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
for an after party later.

363
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Okay.

364
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Mr. Shen, are you interested?

365
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Since you're here,

366
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I just want to have a conversation with the whole industry.

367
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Mr. Ji, what about you?

368
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
We just started the company.

369
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We have a lot of things to do.

370
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm not going.

371
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Ji Qing,

372
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I suggest you go.

373
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You're different now.

374
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You're not like before.

375
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You can hide in the public.

376
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You're the boss now.

377
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You should go out and get more people.

378
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's not a good chance.

379
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The chance of a good job is coming.

380
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's useless

381
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
to have no chance to be good.

382
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Ji Qing,

383
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I need to make a call later.

384
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'll go get ready.

385
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Come with me.

386
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You're not good with your hands.

387
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What are you thinking?

388
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Nothing.

389
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Fei Jin is dying

390
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
to get the ticket.

391
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But now,

392
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
he shouldn't be like this.

393
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Maybe it's because

394
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I didn't have dinner with him.

395
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That's why I didn't have dinner with him.

396
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't know what to do.

397
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm not good with my hands.

398
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't know what to do.

399
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I just want to have a meal with you.

400
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't know what to do.

401
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm not good with my hands.

402
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm just thinking about

403
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
the situation in the company.

404
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I don't know what to do.

405
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I don't know what to do.

406
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I didn't have dinner with him.

407
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm a little bit tired.

408
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'll be fine in the afternoon.

409
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What's wrong?

410
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Nothing.

411
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'll adjust myself.

412
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Adjust yourself.

413
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Get up.

414
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Go.

415
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's red.

416
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Don't be so quiet.

417
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I...

418
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Am I quiet?

419
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I just want to remind him

420
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
not to let him

421
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
think that the staff

422
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
from Guang Hua

423
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
don't have any social benefits.

424
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Is there anything wrong?

425
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Nothing.

426
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Don't worry.

427
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'll teach him in the future.

428
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Then he has to work hard.

429
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
After all, your requirements are high.

430
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I don't think it will result in

431
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
any conflicts.

432
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,000
The tool is smart.

433
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I packs the cards

434
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and sets my待 bucks.

435
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Just ten days is a project

436
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,040
and it will cost

437
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Capital성 to review

438
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
those goods.

439
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Then,

440
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
let's fix some issues.

441
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Thanks.

442
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Don't thank me because

443
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
it requires a lot of silence at night.

444
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,960
It feels so good!

445
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,720
We just got on the brake.

446
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,680
Don't bother, Director Han.

447
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,280
I'm making a call.

448
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,400
Just don't delay the time behind me!

449
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,720
Thank you.

450
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,280
Mr. Han,

451
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,280
I'm sorry for the condition.

452
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,920
I won't do it again.

453
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,480
It's not good to know that you're not eating.

454
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,760
You have to eat at the right time.

455
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
Leave me alone.

456
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,160
I feel bad for Mr. Han.

457
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,320
What does it mean for you to know?

458
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
It says he just loved you.

459
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,600
Please leave him alone for only a few days.

460
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,280
I don't want to keep at it.

461
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,560
Sun Isha,

462
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,560
We count the diamonds in the sky

463
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Then you smile

464
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Bring me my dark world sunlight

465
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,560
Time goes by

466
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,560
You go away a hundred miles

467
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
Overnight

468
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,560
No more diamonds in the sky

469
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Then you come to our company

470
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,560
And look at the stars together

471
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,560
As for your future

472
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,560
It starts

473
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,560
It's our future

474
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,560
Hello

475
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,560
Open the door

476
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Look at this

477
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,560
The contract with Dongyang Qing

478
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
It's on Zhang Lang's boss

479
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560
Look

480
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
Look

481
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
And

482
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
The first batch they gave me is here

483
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Look

484
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,560
Very soon

485
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
Xing Chen will be hurt soon

486
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,560
Xing Xing

487
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
Congratulations

488
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,560
Xing Xing

489
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,560
Congratulations

490
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
Xing Xing

491
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
No one else

492
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
Only you

493
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,560
Only you all the time

494
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:22,560
Xing Xing, don't cry

495
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
I'm not your girlfriend

496
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,560
Why do you care about me?

497
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Can't you wait for me?

498
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,560
I said I would be very fast

499
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,560
Can you wait for me?

500
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,560
Can you wait for me?

501
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
Can you?

502
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
I can't wait

503
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
I can't just be by your side

504
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
You need me to be by your side

505
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
And you don't need me

506
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,560
I'll become a background

507
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,560
Sorry

508
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,560
It's my fault

509
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Sorry

510
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,560
I won't be like this again

511
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
I won't be like this again

512
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
Sorry, Yichen

513
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,560
Sorry

514
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Xing Xing

515
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,560
We can't be involved in each other's lives anymore

516
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
It's all my fault

517
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
You can't get the investment

518
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Can't buy the equipment

519
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,560
Can't get the evaluation

520
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,560
You meet the big news every day

521
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,560
And you have a hard time

522
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
But I give you

523
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
The comfort of those hidden things

524
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
I can't give you anything

525
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
I don't need you to give me

526
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,560
Those are all jobs

527
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,560
I don't need you to give these to Yichen

528
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,560
But I need Xing Xing

529
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,560
I can't just be a side-view

530
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
I can't see your life

531
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,560
But I can't do anything

532
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,560
So don't say sorry

533
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
You didn't say sorry to me

534
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,560
Xing Xing said we were going to the same road

535
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
Actually last night

536
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,560
I saw your proposal proposal

537
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
But Xing Xing

538
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,560
I can't promise you sorry

539
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
Because what I want

540
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,560
Is to live a peaceful and lonely life

541
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,560
But what you want

542
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
Is the value of your life

543
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,560
So I really can't go on like this

544
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
Xing Xing

545
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
I hope you can be good

546
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,560
I hope you can be happy

547
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
healthy

548
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
successful

549
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,560
I hope you can get everything you want

550
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
I hope you can be happy

551
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,560
I hope you can be happy

552
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,560
I hope you can be happy

553
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,560
I hope you can be happy

554
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,560
I hope you can be happy

555
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
I hope you can be happy

556
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,560
I hope you can be happy

557
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,560
I hope you can be happy

558
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,560
I hope you can be happy

559
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,560
I hope you can be happy

560
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,560
I hope you can be happy

561
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,560
I hope you can be happy

562
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,560
I hope you can be happy

563
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,560
I hope you can be happy

564
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,560
I hope you can be happy

565
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
I hope you can be happy

566
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
I hope you can be happy

567
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,560
I hope you can be happy

568
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,560
I hope you can be happy

569
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,560
I hope you can be happy

570
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,560
I hope you can be happy

00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:22,880
Wait.

764
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,880
Why are you drinking so much?

765
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,000
Do you have honey?

766
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:32,960
Honey?

767
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,960
I'll go and buy some.

768
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,480
Come on.

769
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,440
You're going out alone at night.

770
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,160
It's dangerous.

771
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,800
Okay.

772
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,800
Then you...

773
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,400
I'll go with you.

774
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,560
Gure...

775
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,180
Gure...

776
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,760
Gure...

777
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,820
Here.

778
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,920
Slow down.

779
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,040
Slow down.

780
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,200
Don't move.

781
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,480
Don't move.

782
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,520
Don't move.

783
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,960
Okay, okay.

784
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,840
Don't move.

785
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,440
Don't move.

786
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,400
Don't move.

787
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,360
Don't move.

788
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,400
Don't move.

789
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
Don't go.

790
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,960
Don't go.

791
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,960
Don't go.

792
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,960
No.

793
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,960
No way.

794
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,960
I'm not familiar with the world.

795
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,960
Those who seem distant

796
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,960
but hate each other.

797
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,960
I want to test who has crossed the border.

798
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,960
If I can get closer to you,

799
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,960
can I re-enact the memories?

800
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,960
Time goes by so fast.

801
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,960
Let the lonely be safe at least.

802
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:15,960
Don't let the understanding become a adventure.

803
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,960
We are a couple.

804
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,960
We can't stop.

805
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,960
We can't stop.

806
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,960
We can't stop.

807
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:39,960
Let the other side be fresh and calm.

808
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,960
We can't stop.

809
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,960
We can't stop.

810
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:57,960
Let the other side be fresh and calm.

811
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:03,960
Don't let the understanding become a adventure.

812
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,960
We can't stop.

813
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,960
Let the other side be fresh and calm.

814
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,960
Don't let the understanding become a adventure.
