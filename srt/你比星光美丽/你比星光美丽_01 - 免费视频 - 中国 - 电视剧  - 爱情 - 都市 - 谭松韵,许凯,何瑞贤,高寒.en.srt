23
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,970
Xing, how is it going with the flat?

24
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,480
(Xinggang)
I saw a dozen more flats after work yesterday.

25
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,090
I prefer the one from before.

26
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,280
It's close to the subway station.

27
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,480
Then, it'll be convenient

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,970
for us to go to work and children to go

29
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,970
(September)
to school.

30
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,210
And that flat

31
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,600
is just the right size.

32
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,650
When I get the year-end bonus

33
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,120
(AI Medical Robot)
and Bay project bonus,

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,680
Yichen and I

35
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,050
will afford the down payment.

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,160
OK. Glad you've picked the flat.

37
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,880
In this case,

38
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,770
your marriage thing

39
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,330
should also be put on the agenda.

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,370
Arrange for us to meet his parents

41
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,400
to set the wedding date.

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,930
Now, it's hard

43
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,050
to book a hotel.

44
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,490
I hear you need to wait

45
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,050
for two or three years for reservation.

46
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,050
No rush.

47
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,090
Yichen and I have a stable relationship.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,560
Buying a flat matters more.

49
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,120
A good flat waits for no one.

50
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,490
What if it's sold out?

51
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,280
When we buy the flat,

52
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,210
getting married is just a matter of formality.

53
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,530
That's true.

54
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,680
Why are you packing so many things?

55
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,000
Stayed up late again?

56
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,930
You're a robot engineer.

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,720
Don't make yourself a robot, OK?

58
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,050
OK. I get it.

59
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,120
Don't worry, Mom.

60
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,370
I'll say no more. I'm going to work.

61
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,960
Bye-bye.

62
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,210
Dear Dahuang,

63
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,680
Mom is going to work for your food.

64
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,520
Be a good cat.

65
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,560
Tu Xiaomeng, why are you up so early?

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,970
Did you see my bag?

67
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,370
It's under the cushion.

68
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,120
OK.

69
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,970
I didn't actually sleep.

70
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,930
I had a livestream and went over it.

71
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,770
After eating this, I'll go to bed.

72
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,770
I brought you breakfast. Have some.

73
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,440
I'm so jealous of you.

74
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,530
When will I not have to

75
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,090
get up early or punch in?

76
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,090
It's good that I don't get up early.

77
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,250
But I can't go to bed early.

78
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm on call 24 hours for live streams

79
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,090
and compete desperately

80
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,070
with Internet celebrities.

81
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,970
Thanks. I'll leave Dahuang to you. Bye.

82
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,170
Rest assured.

83
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,330
When you eat, don't take in the wind.

84
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,440
Or you'll burp.

85
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,770
Bye-bye.

86
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,800
Ms. Yuan, rest assured.

87
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,330
Your grandpa

88
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,040
has Han Ting in charge of Dongyang Medical.

89
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,920
But everybody knows

90
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,330
Dongyang Medical is your hard work.

91
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,240
Don't be too anxious.

92
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,090
Just back from abroad,

93
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:29,970
he must be ignorant.

94
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,160
Besides, you have us.

95
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,360
He won't keep this position

96
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,770
for a long time.

97
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,320
Don't worry.

98
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,570
At the board meeting,

99
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,530
we'll play rough.

100
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,650
Rest assured, Ms. Yuan.

101
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,280
See you at the board meeting.

102
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,530
Mr. Han?

103
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,720
Mr. Wang, long time no see.

104
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,040
Aren't you supposed

105
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,090
to fly from Germany to Xinggang?

106
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,450
I'm here to protect you.

107
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,090
So, I took a transfer

108
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
and flew from Shenzhen on your flight.

109
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,010
Don't be kidding, Mr. Han.

110
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,720
What will you protect me from?

111
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,570
This Property Sale & Purchase Agreement shows

112
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,920
a supplier of Dongyang sold you

113
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,280
his mansion in Europe

114
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,530
at one-tenth of the market price

115
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,800
that was extremely cheap.

116
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,600
Oh, Mr. Han.

117
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,650
This supplier

118
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,720
was in urgent need of money

119
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,040
and sold it to me at a low price.

120
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,160
I trust you, of course.

121
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,400
But if the chairman

122
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,770
sees this agreement,

123
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,240
I really wonder

124
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,400
how he'll feel about it.

125
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,400
You've been working for Dongyang for years.

126
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,330
It's normal that you have a mansion.

127
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,770
When I'm back in China

128
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,920
to take charge of Dongyang Medical,

129
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,970
I need your strong support.

130
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,240
When the price of shares rises,

131
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,650
with the dividends,

132
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,840
you can even buy

133
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,720
a lot more mansions.

134
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,330
Mr. Han,

135
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,770
what do you want me to do?

136
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,480
(Yuanshan Station)
This station is being maintained.

137
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,720
Sorry for the inconvenience.

138
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,400
Look at the time. We'll be late for work.

139
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,400
It's a short notice anyway.

140
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,890
Taking a taxi will get us stuck in traffic.

141
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,130
- Let's take a taxi.
- We have to.

142
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,280
- Let's go.
- We don't know, either.

143
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,380
(Temporary closure from Nov. 10 to 20, 2022)
Can you settle on a time?

144
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,600
I'm not sure. It's hard to tell.

145
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,890
- We can't get in?
- Sorry.

146
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:36,730
You can't. Sorry.

147
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,720
Sorry for this.

148
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,450
Let's go to the next station.

149
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,260

Where are you?

154
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,840
After you're back in China,

155
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,360
this is your first board meeting.

156
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,970
If you're late

157
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,970
and offend the directors,

158
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,720
I can't help even as your cousin.

159
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,890
Sounds like you weren't informed.

160
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,770
Ms. Yuan, Mr. Wang said something happened

161
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,800
and he couldn't come.

162
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,090
I'll hang up.

163
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,040
I guess you have a lot of calls to make.

164
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,450
Ms. He,

165
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
Mr. Wang said

166
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,010
he couldn't attend today's board meeting.

167
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,600
Do you know what happened?

168
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,480
Ms. Yuan, I was about to tell you this.

169
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,720
My gout is flaring up.

170
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,010
I can't attend today's board meeting.

171

(Third Quarter Financial Statement)

172
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,860
Boss,

173
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,920
you've been away from Xinggang for a decade.

174
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,400
Your grandpa got you back

175
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,530
from Germany

176
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,530
for Dongyang Medical.

177
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,010
It's such an important event.

178
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,890
Instead of attending the board meeting

179
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,330
to back you up,

180
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,690
he went to Hainan

181
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:04,600
on a vacation.

182
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,920
Rather broad-minded.

183
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,090
If I can't even take

184
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:07,970
some directors,

185
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,440
why would Grandpa make me CEO.

186
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,440
That's right.

187
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,090
Today, Ms. Yuan had planned

188
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,130
to play rough.

189
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,130
Unexpectedly,

190
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,280
you just disabled

191
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,360
the board meeting.

192
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,570
She must be furious now.

193
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,920
If my cousin knew when to stop

194
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,280
and gave up on Dongyang Medical,

195
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,920
I wouldn't have done this to her.

196
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,160
Did you tell Zeng Di I was going to Guanghua?

197
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,570
Yes.

198
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,210
Miss Zeng said everything was ready.

199
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,840
(Huang Weiwei)
Xing, where are you?

200
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,840
I'll be arriving after one last turning.

201
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,170
I see Lin Zhen printing out

202
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,450
the report you uploaded last night.

203
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,810
He does that every time.

204
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,880
I'm quite used to that.

205
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,600
In this report,

206
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,720
I set a little trap.

207
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,410
If he reports, he'll get stuck.

208
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,410
Then Director Chen

209
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,640
will know it's my report.

210
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:04,770
It's OK.

211
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,090
It's not OK.

212
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,480
Our investors,

213
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,240
Miss Zeng,

214
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,930
and all the department heads have come.

215
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,600
Director Chen won't say

216
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,120
it's your report, will he?

217
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,520
I'll be right there.

218
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,000
Only five million, huh?

219
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,880
Just a small amount of money.

220
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,690
Hey, don't go!

221
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,000
She rode away so fast.

222
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,810
Boss, I'll take care of it.

223
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,000
This must be an expensive car.

224
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,240
I really can't afford the repair.

225
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,640
I've taken the photos.

226
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,600
The detailed compensation

227
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,480
will be confirmed
after the damage assessment.

228
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,600
Damage assessment?

229
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,560
Damage...

230
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,210
Yeah. It's her.

231
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,810
Just now, a man riding a bike

232
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,760
nearly hit me.

233
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,170
To dodge me,

234
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,810
this man accidentally hit your car.

235
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,970
I was riding after him

236
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,810
but didn't catch up.

237
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,450
I'm responsible for this, too.

238
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,720
If he hadn't dodged me,

239
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,880
he wouldn't have hit your car.

240
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,170
Check how much the damage will cost.

241
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,290
I'll share it with him.

242
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,840
Of course, I request

243
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,720
you find that man.

244
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,720
He rode while talking on the phone.

245
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,720
He violated traffic rules

246
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,210
and must take full responsibility.

247
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,290
(It's her.)

248
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,130
I have things to do.

249
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,480
May I leave you a contact number?

250
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,450
When you need anything,

251
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,410
contact at any time.

252
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,480
Tang Song,

253
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
get their numbers and let them go.

254
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,010
OK.

255
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,090
Give me

256
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,240
your contact number.

257
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,570
I'll contact you after damage assessment.

258
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,840
OK.

259
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,290
All right.

260
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,480
(Huang Weiwei)
The bosses are here.

261
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,210
Lin Zhen just went up to report.

262
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,420
(Dongyang Group)
Come quickly.

263
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,480
It is generating

264
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,520
your preliminary medical test report.

265
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,210
The results are as follows.

266
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,640
Your upper central incisor

267
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,640
non-caries hard tissue defects

268
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,520
and needs a dental restoration.

269
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,450
Your second left molar

270
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,760
has dental plaque

271
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,570
and needs the periodontal technique.

272
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,090
Your other teeth are in good condition.

273
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,520
Bay wishes you good health.

274
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,300
(Guanghua Technology)

275
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300
(Diagnostic Report)

276
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,360
Everybody,

277
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,880
this is the dental diagnostic report

278
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,810
Robot Bay just made for me.

279
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,930
And this is

280
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,290
the medical report I had

281
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,360
(Hospital Test Report)
in the hospital the other day.

282
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,520
We can see

283
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,760
Robot Bay

284
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
(Dental Diagnostic Report)
can give the same diagnosis

285
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,210
as the hospital.

286
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,720
Mr. Han, please review it.

287
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,050
Robot Bay Phase I

288
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,290
specializes in dental diseases.

289
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,330
By today,

290
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,120
it has successfully given diagnoses

291
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,970
to 1,600 patients.

292
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,240
Its diagnostic results are 99.9% consistent

293
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,600
with those from medicine specialists.

294
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,050
Come on.

295
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,600
You're just in time
to see him steal your thunder.

296
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,760
And a big result.

297
00:12:59,090 --> 00:12:59,930
When Lin Zhen steals it...

298
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,570
The overall plan of Phase II.

299
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,050
He'll get promoted while you get down.

300
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,810
Who knew the big boss would come?

301
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,450
Is he sitting in the first seat?

302
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,410
Yes.

303
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,450
I hear he's not only

304
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,760
the investor of our company

305
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
but also the airborne CEO

306
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,720
of Dongyang Medical.

307
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,090
He's just back in China today,

308
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,050
and he came here on a whim

309
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,880
to be briefed on Bay Phase I.

310
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,330
So, he must be valuing our project.

311
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,600
He has good taste.

312
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,050
For the planning

313
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,210
of Robot Bay Phase II,

314
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,760
the first step is to...

315
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,140
(Nodule detection, Lung recognition,
Network building, DICOM conversion)

316
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,820
(Market Plan of Bay Phase II)

317
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
The first step

318
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,000
is the market expansion.

319
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,450
- It's divided into...
- Stop.

320
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,000
Back to the last page.

321
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,000
It's the model of the core algorithm, huh?

322
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,520
Go into the details.

323
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,720
He knows about our work.

324
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,000
The model of the core algorithm

325
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,050
hasn't been fully prepared.

326
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,120
Our team has been working day and night to...

327
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,960
So,

328
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,170
this report isn't made by you.

329
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,290
What's going on here?

330
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,290
Mr. Han and Miss Zeng,

331
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,690
the report is made by the team.

332
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,520
About the planning of Phase II,

333
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,640
Ji Xing, our product engineer,

334
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,880
is in charge.

335
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,480
Ji Xing, come do the report.

336
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,010
Go.

337
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,410
This is Ji Xing,

338
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,320
our product engineer of Bay.

339
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,000
(Han Ting?)

340
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,120
Give me the laser pointer.

341
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,000
The best feature of the medical robot is

342
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,360
during its working process,

343
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,750
it has a lot of collaborative interaction

344
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,810
with doctors and patients.

345
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,290
So, in terms of algorithms,

346
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,520
we should pay great attention

347
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,480
to two parts.

348
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:17,930
First,

349
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,520
the receipt of data

350
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,330
and the self-learning.

351
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,520
Namely to deal

352
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,970
with relevant data on diseases

353
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,880
received by sensors

354
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,170
and distinguish them.

355
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,930
The second part is...

356
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,170
Algorithm of integrated data processing.

357
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,170
Yes.

358
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,810
With the receipt of data,

359
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,520
the system will quickly mark the diseases

360
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,520
through self-learning.

361
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,810
Corresponding indicators

362
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,120
and predicted results

363
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,810
of different diseases

364
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,930
are directly correlated

365
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,000
to patients' medical records

366
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,810
for comprehensive data analysis and judgment.

367
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,620
(AI Creative Competition)
I'd like to thank the committee

368
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,670
for approving the medical robot

369
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,880
we've designed.

370
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,090
I'd also like to thank my partners.

371
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,760
Because this is a product

372
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,360
we've been working on together.

373
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,880
Now, it is only

374
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,970
a crude prototype.

375
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,970

But we'll keep improving it

376
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,000
until it's put into use

377
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,290
to help more people in need.

378
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,450
For Bay Phase II, we'll focus

379
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,760
on cardiopulmonary diagnosis.

380
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,210
There'll be more variables.

381
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,410
So, for the sake of precision,

382
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,570
we suggest Bay receive

383
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,970
(Cardiopulmonary Diagnosis)
great data from different hospitals

384
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,170
to reserve more

385
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,120
for image recognition

386
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,090
and precision learning.

387
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,410
The detailed plan of Bay Phase II

388
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,330
will be elaborated

389
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,520
during our formal proposal.

390
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,520
Thanks for listening.

391
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,930
Thank you, everybody.

392
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,760
So much for this meeting.

393
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,560
Thanks to Boss,

394
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,560
your hard work paid off.

395
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,130
This year, you'll certainly

396
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,170
get the highest project bonus

397
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,280
of our team.

398
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,080
Lin Zhen used to show off.

399
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,690
Today, he was embarrassed, huh?

400
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,410
Luckily, our investor

401
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,760
was sharp-eyed enough

402
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,610
to see him through.

403
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,760
So much for this meeting.

404
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,300
(CEO of Dongyang Medical)

405
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,260
(New CEO of Dongyang Medical.
Can Han Ting lead the charge?)

406
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,500
(New leader in Dongyang Group.
Can Han Ting quell the controversies?)

407
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,060
(Overseas R&D Center, Dongyang Base)

408
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,800
(Studied in Germany?)

409
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,850
(So, it's him.)

410
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,760
(He can't recognize me?)

411
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,080
(Or when he's a CEO,)

412
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,370
(he pretends he doesn't know me?)

413
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,580
(Su Zhizhou)

414
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:42,770
Hello, Zhizhou.

415
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:43,970
Hello, Xing.

416
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,890
I'm in the coffee shop near your company.

417
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,410
What about black coffee?

418
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,720
Anything. You choose.

419
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,000
Just send me the location.

420
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,920
OK.

421
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,480
Bye-bye. See you later.

422
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,320
See you later.

423
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,080
Black coffee. Your favorite beans.

424
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,860
(Layout of Visual Interface)

425
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,740
(Various medical robots...)

426
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,160
What?

427
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,040
Bay looks more like the assumption

428
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,130
you told me about in Germany,

429
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,610
doesn't it?

430
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,880
Mm.

431
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,540
(Core R&D Members of Bay)

432
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,320
(Name: Ji Xing)

433
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,760
More interesting than expected.

434
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,410
Interesting?

435
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,320
For the success of Phase I,

436
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,560
I'll hold a celebration party at the weekend.

437
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,760
Would you like to come by?

438
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,610
OK. Text Tang Song the time and place.

439
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,010
Sure.

440
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,080
Umm,

441
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,450
will you go back with me for dinner?

442
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,480
Grandpa knew you were back

443
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,210
and asked me to feast you.

444
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,800
I'll visit Grandpa Zeng another day.

445
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,720
Mr. Li invited me for tonight.

446
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,210
Mr. Zhao of Ren'ai Hospital will also go.

447
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,170
You go and tell him about Bay.

448
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,970
We'll meet at Xingyue Club at eight.

449
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:08,810
OK.

450
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,370
Oh, Mr. Li.

451
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
He's been close to your cousin lately.

452
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,450
It's just business.

453
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,370
Do you invite me

454
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,800
just for business?

455
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,170
Get well prepared.

456
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,520
A possible cooperation

457
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,720
will be good for Bay's market expansion.

458
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,800
OK. I get it.

459
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,410
Don't worry, Mr. Han.

460
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,210
Everything you want will be done.

461
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,320
I should go.

462
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,930
Let me walk you out.

463
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:51,810
Xing.

464
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,920
Your coffee.

465
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,210
Thanks.

466
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,480
This is your start-up plan.

467
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,080
I modified it. Have a look.

468
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,920
OK.

469
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,240
Analysis of industry development...

470
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,930
You even made a data expansion?

471
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,370
So, you made a new plan for me.

472
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,130
Such a good friend.

473
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,370
You want to make

474
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,560
medical devices, huh?

475
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm also gathering string on the subject.

476
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,450
I'm thinking if I can combine

477
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,450
the hardware and the software

478
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,650
on the subsequent market expansion

479
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,130
of Robot Bay.

480
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,240
So, I typed more.

481
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,130
It's nothing.

482
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,490
Xing,

483
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,800
how about you join me?

484
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,210
No, no, no. I...

485
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,930
My work is pretty stable.

486
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,610
And I'm going to buy a flat.

487
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,130
I'll pay for housing loans.

488
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,800
I won't take the risk.

489
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,610
But in life,

490
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,610
people take risks.

491
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,320
When you were making this plan,

492
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,480
did you not have

493
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,720
passion or impulsiveness?

494
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,210
Seriously, Xing.

495
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,760
Think about it.

496
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,170
Will you be an employee for a lifetime?

497
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:00,770
Besides,

498
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,720
you'll only invest with technology.

499
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,170
My father said, if I start up a business,

500
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,130
he'll give me a big gift.

501
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,410
You know. My parents run supermarkets.

502
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,970
I guess

503
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,450
my father will give me

504
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,850
a good start-up capital.

505
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,450
Think about it.

506
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,480
We have technology.

507
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,210
My father has money.

508
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,040
Why do you hesitate?

509
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,050
But...

510
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,220
(Miss Zeng)

511
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,210
Miss Zeng.

512
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,520
Hello, Ji Xing.

513
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:35,770
Occupied?

514
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,320
No.

515
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,210
Go ahead.

516
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,970
Go somewhere with me tonight.

517
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,210
Send me your location.

518
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,410
I'll pick you up at seven thirty.

519
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,610
- OK.
- Oh,

520
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,850
dress up a little bit.

521
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,080
We're going to meet

522
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,240
someone important.

523
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,210
Is it done? My waist is sore.

524
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,520
Do what I tell you.

525
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,560
It'll make your eyes look brighter.

526
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,650
What on earth did you do?

527
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,800
My eyelids are so heavy

528
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,130
- that I can hardly see.
- Let me see.

529
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,650
Don't move.

530
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,040
Look up.

531
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,170
It's done. Here. Look.

532
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,840
What do you think?

533
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,720
Such long eyelashes?

534
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,610
They make your eyes look bigger.

535
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,690
You just don't understand.

536
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,080
Well, just don't get in the way.

537
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,920
Come on.

538
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,010
But...

539
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:35,850
Relax.

540
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,290
Xing,

541
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,170
your boss is taking you to dinner.

542
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,800
Is it a hint for a promotion or pay raise?

543
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,520
Maybe.

544
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,560
During today's presentation,

545
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,760
I did a good job.

546
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,410
Maybe she thinks highly of me.

547
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,850
Really?

548
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,170
Then you're one step closer

549
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,210
to your dream flat.

550
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,280
- Hurry. Coming.
- I'll go.

551
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,130
Go open the door.

552
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,320
You sit still.

553
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,040
Queen Li Li, what are you doing here?

554
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,280
Come in, Li Li.

555
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,000
Don't change shoes. Just get in.

556
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,970
Quickly.

557
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,210
Your makeup...

558
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,650
You did that, huh?

559
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,370
Is it good?

560
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,320
This is a very important dinner.

561
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,410
So, I need you to check on me.

562
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,610
What do you mean?

563
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,210
You didn't trust me

564
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,130
and got another helper.

565
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,890
Li is a top seller

566
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:33,730
with much experience.

567
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,480
She can check in so many ways.

568
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,760
In every dimension, you know.

569
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,690
Look at me.

570
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,930
Tu Xiaomeng spent two hours on the makeup.

571
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,240
What kind of dinner?

572
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,650
Well, I don't know.

573
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,760
Boss didn't say.

574
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,450
She just said we would meet someone.

575
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,370
But she reminded me

576
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,560
to dress up a little bit.

577
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,850
How old is your boss?

578
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,410
28 or 29.

579
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,720
She's almost our age.

580
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,320
You know what? She's 1.7 meters tall.

581
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,610
She walks like this.

582
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,800
Gorgeous and rich.

583
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,130
She has her company, too.

584
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,370
Really impressive.

585
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,170
I think I know her style.

586
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,930
Go take off your makeup first.

587
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,690
Boss, your office has been decorated

588
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,520
based on your preferences in Germany.

589
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,520
The presents sent here

590
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,800
have been put away, too.

591
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,130
I'll show you the list later.

592
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,720
If you have no objection,

593
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,370
I'll prepare the return gifts accordingly.

594
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,450
Some gifts weren't supposed to be accepted

595
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,650
and I rejected them for you.

596
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,690
What is this?

597
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,250
A lamp.

598
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,480
From Mr. Xiao.

599
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,240
It's said
to be a 1:1 scale replica of a gorilla.

600
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,820
(Wish you a happy new job! Smile.)

601
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,110
(Gorgeous Li Li)
Xing,

602
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,130
is my scarf warming you

603
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,800
on my behalf?

604
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,720
(Ji Xing)
Li, it is my blessing

605
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,930
to have a best friend like you.

606
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,760
Have waited a long time, huh?

607
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,400
No.

608
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,320
Ji Xing, you've worked
in Guanghua for three years, huh?

609
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,560
It's hard to work on Bay, right?

610
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,690
No.

611
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,760
It's my favorite project.

612
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,370
It makes me feel happy.

613
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,080
It gives me a sense of fulfillment, too.

614
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,040
I've seen how hard you work.

615
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,210
Without you,

616
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,760
Bay wouldn't be developed so fast.

617
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:37,850
You owe a great merit.

618
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,360
Don't worry.

619
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,320
Guanghua never mistreats

620
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,520
those who work hard for it.

621
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,760
Thank you, Miss Zeng.

622
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,000
When we're there,

623
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,370
let's both behave well

624
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,720
and try to take Mr. Zhao.

625
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,080
Who's Mr. Zhao?

626
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,240
The son of Chairman Zhao of Ren'ai Hospital.

627
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,850
Ren'ai Hospital?

628
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,480
It has many branches nationwide.

629
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,560
Yes.

630
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,210
So, tonight,

631
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,170
if he can approve

632
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,320
our cooperation,

633
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,130
our future development will be smooth.

634
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,370
What do I have to do?

635
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,610
You know best about Bay.

636
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,520
When you're there,

637
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,320
introduce Bay to him

638
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,520
and play it by ear.

639
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,210
No problem.

640
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,720
If we manage to cooperate with him,

641
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,520
I'll double your bonus.

642
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,130
Thank you, Miss Zeng.

643
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,140
(Xingyue Club)

644
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,240
Full house.

645
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,690
Pass.

646
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,280
Mr. Zhao, tonight,

647
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,970
you're being lucky. You win all the time.

648
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,520
I'm indeed lucky lately.

649
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,410
Besides playing cards,

650
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,850
everything of mine has been smooth.

651
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,520
Pair of eight.

652
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,600
Yeah.

653
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,970
Guokang and Ledi projects you invested in

654
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:02,810
are both profitable.

655
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,600
Pair of ace.

656
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,930
Mr. Li, you help me when I'm just back.

657
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,610
I think I'll learn more from you.

658
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,050
Pair of two.

659
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,720
We're all friends.

660
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,800
That's why I've invited you here.

661
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,800
In Germany,

662
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,210
you were doing very well.

663
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,210
But here in China,

664
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,610
you should consult your cousin more.

665
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,010
Four of a kind.

666
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,000
Speaking of doing business,

667
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,410
your cousin is awesome.

668
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,320
Only when the two of you work together

669
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,240
can partners like us

670
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,850
develop better.

671
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,170
Tonight, we gave you the feast

672
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,410
to welcome you back.

673
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,610
This is Mr. Xiao's club.

674
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,650
I hold some shares, too.

675
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,930
When you need social gatherings,

676
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:35,930
feel free to come here.

677
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,210
Yeah, Mr. Han.

678
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,620
Come here often.

679
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,930
Thanks to Mr. Li these years,

680
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,280
I've made some investments

681
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,130
with some bosses.

682
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,170
But for medical investments,

683
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,610
help me more, the inexperienced guy.

684
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,130
Come on, guys.

685
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,280
Let's just play cards.

686
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,560
What's the point of this talk?

687
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,690
If you keep talking about this,

688
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,560
I won't come anymore.

689
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,410
You hear that?

690
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,170
- Four of a kind.
- Overpass.

691
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:58,970
Four of a kind.

692
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,920
- Five of ace.
- Show hand.

693
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,560
How come you won again?

694
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,650
Can I make a turn tonight?

695
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,490
Han Ting.

696
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,010
Mr. Li.

697
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,450
Mr. Zhao,

698
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,370
you laughed the loudest.

699
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,130
You must have won a lot, huh?

700
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,410
Look at them.

701
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,320
The whole night,

702
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,080
Mr. Xiao and Mr. Li didn't win a round.

703
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,610
- Really?
- When Mr. Han played cards,

704
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,520
he even did calculations.

705
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,720
Isn't it boring?

706
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,000
In anything about winning,

707
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,040
he's always serious.

708
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,520
Miss, do you need me

709
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,410
to hang your coat up?

710
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,720
This is Zeng Di of Guanghua Technology.

711
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,610
- Miss Zeng,
- OK.

712
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,520
you know Mr. Zhao and Mr. Li.

713
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,690
This is Mr. Xiao Yixiao,

714
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,170
owner of Xingyue Club.

715
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,370
I've heard about you, Mr. Xiao.

716
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,170
Your Xingyue Club

717
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,240
has been a place of gathering

718
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,170
for the big shots.

719
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,320
I've heard about you, Miss Zeng.

720
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,000
You're not only capable

721
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,170
but also young and pretty.

722
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,800
That's right.

723
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,130
Miss Zeng is a famous beauty

724
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,370
in our circle.

725
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,690
I'm not like you.

726
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,610
You play and make money at the same time.

727
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,720
Just so-so.

728
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,490
Come on.

729
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,000
Let me introduce her.

730
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,170
This is Ji Xing, our employee.

731
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,720
You look young, Miss.

732
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:13,810
You just graduated, huh?

733
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,170
I graduated three years ago.

734
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,610
What did you major in?

735
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,520
Computer of Xinggang University.

736
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,760
Bachelor's and master's degrees.

737
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,800
That's an awesome major.

738
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,040
You're such a pretty girl

739
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,320
with a good academic qualification.

740
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,450
Of course.

741
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,720
My company only recruits

742
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,040
beautiful talents.

743
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,410
You're playing Guandan?
[*Chinese card game]

744
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,250
Guandan.

745
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,600
Can you play it?

746
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,760
- A little.
- That's good. Come on.

747
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,610
- Take your seat.
- Sit next to Mr. Zhao.

748
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,520
- Come on.
- Keep an eye on him

749
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,650
and see if he's cheating.

750
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,650
Seriously?

751
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,930
I'll go get you some hot tea.

752
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:46,970
- OK.
- How about I go?

753
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,170
Don't bother. You just sit.

754
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,040
See? Mr. Zhao

755
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,130
has been so smooth.

756
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,040
Now, a pretty girl sits beside him.

757
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,800
Playing like this

758
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,720
is quite boring.

759
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,640
Mr. Han,

760
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,320
shall we switch seats?

761
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,130
Let me get some luck from Mr. Zhao.

762
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,210
I don't care.

763
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,690
Anyway, whoever partners with me

764
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,560
will certainly win.

765
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,450
Come on.

766
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,170
I'll deal the cards.

767
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,210
Have some hot tea.

768
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,410
I'll count on you, Mr. Zhao.

769
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,970
Don't worry. As my partner,
you don't even need to think.

770
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,520
Mr. Zhao, you're kind of cocky.

771
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,040
Because I'm emboldened.

772
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,650
I'll do...

773
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,080
Oh...

774
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,650
Mr. Zhao, can I have a try?

775
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,000
Go ahead. Here.

776
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,050
Pair of three.

777
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,400
Pair of six.

778
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,360
Pair of nine.

779
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,920
Pair of Jack.

780
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,880
Pair of ace.

781
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,560
Pass.

782
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,080
Four of a kind.

783
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,010
Pass.

784
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,080
Pair of two.

785
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,560
Full house.

786
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:23,690
Two cards only.

787
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,400
Full house.

788
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,720
One last card.

789
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,850
A few rounds of full house.

790
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,370
I guess you don't have many cards.

791
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,240
You don't have enough cards now.

792
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,970
Han Ting, any four of a kind?

793
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:28,290
Full house.

794
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,930
Are you so confident

795
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,370
I don't have higher cards?

796
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,970
You passed the last round.

797
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,770
And you did a lot of full houses.

798
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,610
You can't have more.

799
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:41,850
You are

800
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,200
way too overconfident.

801
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,040
Then why did you not overpass me?

802
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,310
So, you're waiting

803
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,120
to give me one last blow.

804
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,170
Yeah.

805
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,770
I counted your cards.

806
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,520
To play cards, you calculate probability

807
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,370
and set me up. Aren't you tired?

808
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,450
You won't be able to win

809
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,810
unless I concede to you.

810
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,960
You won.

811
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,120
Wait. What cards do you have?

812
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,290
- Let me check.
- See?

813
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,560
We can't win unless we partner

814
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,770
with Mr. Zhao, huh?

815
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,410
He's meant to win.

816
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,680
That's not true.

817
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,520
Some battles we win, some battles we lose.

818
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,730
Yeah. A rookie is usually lucky.

819
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,330
Even a sure winner may lose.

820
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,640
I don't quite agree.

821
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:41,930
Ji Xing didn't win by luck.

822
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,520
I know what cards I had.

823
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,480
Ji Xing won

824
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,410
with her strength.

825
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:50,640
What's wrong?

826
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,730
Nothing. Just the static.

827
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,410
Mr. Zhao, you take my seat

828
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,160
and play for me. I'll call someone back.

829
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,160
Come on, Mr. Zhao. Come sit here.

830
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,200
This is a lucky seat.

831
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,040
Fine, then.

832
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,970
Ji Xing, play with them a little longer.

833
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,810
- OK.
- Come sit here.

834
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,930
Show some mercy.

835
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,880
Rest assured.

836
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,370
Look at us.

837
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,450
We were partners.

838
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,410
Now we're rivals.

839
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:26,770
What's wrong?

840
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,520
You have your employee play with them.

841
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,370
Is this the way you promote your project?

842
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,200
Ji Xing is the product engineer.

843
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,640
She knows best about Bay.

844
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,730
I brought her here

845
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,040
so that she can introduce Bay

846
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,770
to Mr. Zhao.

847
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,600
You're the boss of Guanghua.

848
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,730
But you can't even introduce your product?

849
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,370
I'm good at managing.

850
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,640
About technical details,

851
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,600
a professional engineer

852
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,770
always knows better.

853
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,370
Everyone has his strong point.

854
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,330
You play cards very well, young girl.

855
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,810
Are you from the PR Department of Guanghua?

856
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,520
I'm an engineer

857
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,370
from the R&D Department.

858
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,410
I work on Project Bay.

859
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,450
Bay?

860
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,370
I hear Bay of your company

861
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,330
is a good project.

862
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,290
How about you tell us about it?

863
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,880
OK.

864
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,730
Bay is a medical robot

865
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,970
we've been developing.

866
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,480
It can do a basic face-to-face diagnosis.

867
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,850
With the access to cloud,

868
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,850
it will also offer

869
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:23,970
a complicated diagnosis.

870
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,040
It's a hot spot for future smart medicine.

871
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,850
Now, we mainly

872
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,120
assist big hospitals

873
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,600
in a fast detection of underlying diseases.

874
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,810
In Phase I, we focus

875
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:35,770
on the dental diagnosis.

876
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,250
It has been put into the market.

877
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,890
In Phase II, we'll focus

878
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:39,890
on cardiopulmonary diseases.

879
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,000
Have you watched Big Hero 6?

880
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,000
- Yes.
- I have.

881
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,850
What does it have to do with Bay?

882
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,450
Bay is just like Baymax in the film.

883
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,160
Baymax can simply screen with its eyes

884
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,040
to figure out

885
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,410
the health conditions.

886
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,640
But Bay...

887
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,200
Let me show you.

888
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,840
What?

889
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,250
When someone opens his mouth,

890
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,520
Bay can stretch its hand into it

891
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,410
for the detection.

892
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,410
In the future, it'll be like Baymax.

893
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,970
When it touches someone, it can heal him.

894
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,480
Come on. Is that true?

895
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,570
Yes.

896
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,330
When this robot is made,

897
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,770
it'll be so cool.

898
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,970
It's much more interesting

899
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,410
than the cold machines

900
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,000
my friends have invested in.

901
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,600
It's what we'll be working on.

902
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,160
The whole night,

903
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,330
we've made Mr. Zhao

904
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,770
very happy.

905
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,770
Besides,

906
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,410
you also let us win deliberately.

907
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,560
Let her go.

908
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,040
This is a private gathering.

909
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,770
I'm not used to a stranger around.

910
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,480
OK. Got it.

911
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:52,930
Now, we don't have

912
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,410
enough samples,

913
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,000
but if we can cooperate

914
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,370
with a big hospital,

915
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,450
over time, our robot

916
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:00,520
will be able to share more work

917
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,850
of complex diagnoses.

918
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,410
The sample problem...

919
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,160
Why do I think Mr. Zhao's hospital

920
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,330
can help you with that?

921
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,410
Mr. Xiao,

922
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,770
don't try to set me up.

923
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:24,560
Young girl,

924
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,520
this is also why

925
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,930
you play cards for me, huh?

926
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,040
It's no big deal.

927
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,600
I'll tell my father when I'm home.

928
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:41,850
But later,

929
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,560
give me a more detailed introduction,

930
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,400
OK?

931
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,850
OK. Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

932
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,680
Come on. Let's befriend each other on WeChat.

933
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,930
Come on. Just sit.

934
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,250
Ji Xing.

935
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,520
Come out here.

936
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,450
Excuse me.

937
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,040
Miss Zeng.

938
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,200
Thank you for tonight.

939
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,080
You can go back home now.

940
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,250
Don't overthink.

941
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,640
Mr. Han has something private

942
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,160
to talk with them about.

943
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,000
It's not convenient to have a stranger around.

944
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,730
You take a taxi back.

945
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,200
Take the receipt

946
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,040
and claim it.

947
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,200
Stay safe.

948
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,640
- Mr. Han.
- Four of four.

949
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
High cards so fast.

950
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,040
Overpass.

951
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,480
- Pass.
- Pass.

952
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,080
Miss, your coat.

953
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,920
Thanks.

954
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,000
(Xingyue Club)
Let's go.

955
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,850
Come on, let's call it a day.

956
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,200
We'll meet another time.

957
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,160
- OK.
- Come often.

958
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,850
- OK.
- Come, Mr. Li.

959
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,920
Good boy.

960
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,810
OK. I should go.

961
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,480
Be careful.

962
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,250
Miss Zeng, hope we will cooperate pleasantly.

963
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,450
Do bring Ji Xing next time.

964
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,210
OK.

965
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,480
Goodbye, Mr. Zhao.

966
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,480
Have some rest early.

967
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,560
Come when you have time.

968
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:48,770
I should go.

969
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,610
Han Ting,

970
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,730
are you available later?

971
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:56,970
I have something to tell you.

972
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:01,160
I'm tired after the trip. Maybe next time.

973
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,850
You drank some wine. Get to sleep early.

974
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:30,220
(Laosi Wonton Shop)

975
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,740
(Laosi Wonton)

976
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,040
Sir, one coriander wonton.

977
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,330
Long time no see. Back in China, huh?

978
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,290
Yes.

979
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,290
This is a very chic shop.

980
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,850
So much fancy food in Xingyue

981
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:03,200
can't be as good as wonton, huh?

982
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,640
I just love this.

983
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,600
So, in Germany, you kept talking

984
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,600
about this wonton shop.

985
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,250
Would you like some? Tastes great.

986
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,330
No, thanks. I had a lot at dinner.

987
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,160
