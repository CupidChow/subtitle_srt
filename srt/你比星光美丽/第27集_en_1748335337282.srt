1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to pass through the water

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Even if I encounter a miracle

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll be lost in the mist

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the mist

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I can't see the crowd

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to go to the end of my life

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Forget the original self

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to go to the end of the world

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sure I won't hesitate

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the future

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the mist

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I want to go to the end of the world

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But I won't give up

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll always believe

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the mist

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So I want to go to the end of the world

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The End

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Love is True

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
S.K.2 brings you to the right content

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Episode 1

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Look, she doesn't have a single call.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
How could she do that?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
She doesn't know I'm angry.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You can't do that to your girlfriend.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You'll be sad and unhappy.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Understand?

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Tu Xiaomeng, are you stupid?

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You forgot the key.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What are you doing here? I'm busy.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm still looking for the information.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So busy? I'll go first.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Contact me.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You Zhi.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You are not as good as you thought.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What are you doing here?

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
To tease my girlfriend.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Who is teasing her?

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We're not in a relationship.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm not in a relationship.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We don't talk.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
When will you continue to be in a relationship?

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Who doesn't talk?

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Who left without telling me yesterday.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And left me alone in the rain.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm angry. I'm angry.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're angry.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What's not to be satisfied?

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You can tell me.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Can you say anything?

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Of course.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I scolded you last night.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I didn't offend you.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Are we in a relationship?

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You know that Zeng Di has feelings for you.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You still want to eat with him.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We're talking about something.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What is it?

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The painting machine.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm going to give him the gold shares.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm not doing it on purpose.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I didn't come to you for the past few days.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But you were with him when I first met you.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I feel uncomfortable.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You didn't contact me these days.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I feel uncomfortable.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I met you the first time.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm not in a relationship.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm not in a relationship.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You were with him.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I met you.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You were with him, too.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I...

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I want you to contact me.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm dealing with a beautiful thing.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You can send me a message when you're out of the palace.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But I can contact you.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I should wait for you to come to me.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm not right.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But we've been busy with the company for days.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't know when you'll be busy.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
How to find you.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Do you have any idea?

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
If...

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Give me your phone.

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Give me your phone.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I may not be able to contact you

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
for the next few hours.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But you can see me wherever you want.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You don't need to be in a relationship.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Have you smiled?

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Tu Xiaomeng.

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Xiaomeng went to class.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
She won't come back so early.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Why did you bring me here?

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
To relax.

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
To see the sea.

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
To relax.

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Your brain is relaxing.

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Some say that

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
when people relax and relax,

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
brain is the most active.

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't you know that?

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Some say that

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
the sound of waves

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
can calm your mind.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Actually,

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
after I've been through this,

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I've been a little confused.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I have a classmate who is a music teacher.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And he is a singer.

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Only I can do anything.

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I can't do anything.

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I feel a little wasted.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Do you know how long the sea has existed?

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Forty-six billion years.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
How big are we?

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm 23, you're 22.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We humans are so small.

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't talk about youth.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The whole life is so micro-automatic

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
in front of him.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Look at me.

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I just want to understand this.

128
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So I won't think about

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
the things you said.

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm just going to think about

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
the things you said.

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let's just do

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
what we don't regret.

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If we always think about

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
what we lost and what we got,

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
that's what makes us waste our youth.

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Fine.

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You're right.

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I should look at the sea.

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The bigger the waves,

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
the bigger the noise.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I can still go live.

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Come on!

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What are you doing?

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Guess what I'm drawing.

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Green onion, green pepper,

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
potato.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Do you want to eat the third line?

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What third line?

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Forget it.

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm drawing love and lemon.

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Are you okay?

154
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What? Nothing.

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
My favorite CD

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
is from my favorite singer,

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I gave it to you.

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You can use it.

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Of course.

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's your first time to give me stuff.

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's go.

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's go.

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Let's go.

164
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Let's go.

165
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Don't say that.

166
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Your helmet is quite similar to mine.

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Of course.

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This is the VIP helmet

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
that Xing Xing prepared for us.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Your ride is too slow.

171
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let me do it.

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
How fast can you ride?

173
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Get on the car.

174
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay.

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Sit tight.

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Let's go.

177
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let's go.

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The wind is the electric car.

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I can't tell.

180
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The car is quite cool.

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm not overstepping.

182
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm riding a horse.

183
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I can't walk.

184
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm not close.

185
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's go.

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The live broadcast is quite big.

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You don't know me.

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You should watch my live broadcast.

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm not a fan of you.

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm just a fan of you.

191
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm just a fan of you.

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm just a fan of you.

193
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm just a fan of you.

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You should watch my live broadcast.

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Don't forget that I introduced you to the train.

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
At least I have a car.

197
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's mine.

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'll give it to you.

199
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm ready.

200
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Is it that scary?

201
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Mr. Han.

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Miss.

203
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You are...

204
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Your house is here.

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What am I wearing these two dresses?

206
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Put them on.

207
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Xin Xin.

208
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Let me introduce to you.

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Han Ting.

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
My boyfriend.

211
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
He's laughing.

212
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,120
This is officially introduced to us.

213
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,920
It's officially introduced.

214
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,320
Why are you looking at us?

215
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,120
What's wrong with you two?

216
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,120
Right.

217
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,480
What's wrong with you two?

218
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
We're just friends.

219
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
I just brought Lu Lingjia

220
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,520
to listen to my hidden CD.

221
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:51,960
Right.

222
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,880
We can't disturb

223
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,200
the two-person world of

224
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,280
the female boss and the young man.

225
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,720
Xiaomeng, go get the CD.

226
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,520
I'll be home soon.

227
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,400
Right away.

228
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,720
My mom is at home.

229
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,960
Come on, let's go.

230
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,040
Xinxin, we're leaving.

231
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,040
Mr. and Mrs. Cheng,

232
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,760
this is Xifeng.

233
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,720
Let's go to the banquet together.

234
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,800
Let's go.

235
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,520
Okay.

236
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,880
Luo Jinling?

237
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,120
I'm going to bring you a newよ.

238
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:46,160
Crazy diversion

239
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,260
Really?

240
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,560
You don't even have a daughter yet!

241
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:53,960
You sure?

242
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,360
How dare youי� and pedophile

243
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,680
slander our love wives!!!

244
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,520
Right, right.

245
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,680
I can draw a picture like this.

246
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,640
Then, Ms. Han,

247
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,960
I'll listen to the song with Xiaomeng.

248
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,200
What song?

249
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,440
What song?

250
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,640
Tell me again.

251
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,680
How did you two go in?

252
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,400
How did you see Xiaoting

253
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
and that girl?

254
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,840
Xiaoting was wearing

255
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,720
that girl's water pants.

256
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,200
Mom, you've heard it eight hundred times.

257
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,000
You're like a gossip reporter.

258
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,080
Think about it.

259
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,720
Think carefully.

260
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,760
Do you have any details about the broken one?

261
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,480
Okay.

262
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll tell you one last time.

263
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,200
Xiaomeng and I went to the CD store.

264
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,720
Then Xiaomeng opened the door.

265
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,520
She opened the door.

266
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,320
We went in and saw Xiaomeng.

267
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,480
Xiaomeng was the last one.

268
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,920
Xiaomeng was the last one.

269
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,280
Xingxing,

270
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,880
open the door for me.

271
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,720
Coming.

272
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,280
How much is the password?

273
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,680
951103.

274
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,280
My birthday?

275
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,120
Use the owner's birthday password.

276
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
Is that strange?

277
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,200
I want to put it on the owner's seat

278
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,960
with this move.

279
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,360
What do you want?

280
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,600
I want to manage the whole line.

281
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,120
If you make me angry later,

282
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,760
I'll let you stand in front of the door.

283
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,200
I'll do whatever you want.

284
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,320
I'll do whatever you want.

285
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
I'll do whatever you want.

286
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,200
Welcome home.

287
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,840
I'm so happy to see you.

288
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,240
I'm so happy to see you.

289
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,520

I'm so happy to see you.

291
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,080
I'm so happy to see you.

292
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,240
I'm so happy to see you.

293
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,400
I'm so happy to see you.

294
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,560
I'm so happy to see you.

295
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
I'm so happy to see you.

296
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
I'm so happy to see you.

297
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,560
I'm so happy to see you.

298
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
I'm so happy to see you.

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,560
I'm so happy to see you.

I'm so happy to see you.

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,560
I'm so happy to see you.

302
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
I'm so happy to see you.

303
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
I'm so happy to see you.

304
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,560
I'm so happy to see you.

305
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,560
I'm so happy to see you.

306
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
I'm so happy to see you.

307
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
I'm so happy to see you.

00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,560

Have you prepared the cat's paw?

323
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
Did you plan to bring the yellow one?

324
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,560
Yes, but not just to bring the yellow one.

325
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,560
It's so spicy.

326
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,560
Try it.

327
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Try it.

328
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
It's spicy.

329
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Then...

330
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Don't put it in.

331
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Don't put in the pepper.

332
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
You can't eat spicy food.

333
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
I'm used to it.

334
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
It's okay.

335
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
I can eat it too.

336
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
Try the food you like.

337
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Don't put the pepper in the cat's paw.

338
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Spicy food is painful, not a taste.

339
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
And people who are used to eating spicy food

340
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,560
can't eat it on a regular basis.

341
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
Why do you eat spicy food?

342
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,560
It will make you feel pain.

343
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,560
But it's easy to make people feel dizzy.

344
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Why?

345
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
Because the light of the stomach

346
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
will stimulate the brain to keep the mood.

347
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,560
It will make people feel happy.

348
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,560
It's painful, but it can bring happiness.

349
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,560
It's painful, but it can make people feel happy.

350
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
The food you want to put in the pepper

351
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
is always heavy.

352
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
You need to use a big fire to heat it up.

353
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,560
I can't believe these dishes can't be trusted.

354
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
Believe me?

355
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Am I a hot and spicy?

356
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
I'm good at tempering.

357
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
I'm good at tempering.

358
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
I'm good at tempering.

359
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,560
I love life.

360
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
You're talking more and more.

361
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,560
Is there any difference between beef?

362
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,560
Beef's water and nutrition

363
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,560
will be stuck in the mouth when it's high temperature.

364
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
The taste will be more delicate.

365
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,560
People say that cooking can show the attitude of a person's life.

366
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
I'm not as surprised as you.

367
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,560
Will we often quarrel in the future?

368
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
People are different.

369
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,560
There are things that are difficult to distinguish.

370
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,560
Fights

371
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,560
can also be secretive.

372
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,560
Once I make such a dish,

373
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,560
maybe I'll think about quarreling with you everywhere in the future.

374
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,560
Then I'll use the poison I eat to stop you from making a fuss.

375
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
Mr. Zhu,

376
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
it seems that you've become used to

377
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
dancing and playing.

378
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,560
Chang'an,

379
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,560
am I thinking about

380
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
the top staff for the company?

381
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,560
I just want to give you a little bit of love.

382
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
Thank you for your patience.

383
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,560
Dongyi is on the sale price.

384
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
He's not available.

385
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,560
It seems that Dongyi is not much more important to you than Zhu Shi.

386
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Brother Tong can continue

387
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,560
to make the price of the restaurant.

388
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,560
What you mean is...

389
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
Next,

390
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
you can be assured to go to the restaurant with Dongyi.

391
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
The price is still high.

392
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,560
It's just that the price now is already accepted by the same customer.

393
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Even if we don't have a cooperation,

394
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
I will let Han Ding

395
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
make a big deal.

396
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Chang'an,

397
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
I'm relieved to hear that.

398
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
But,

399
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
if Han Ding withdraws,

400
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,560
your Zhu Shi medicine can only be accepted by me.

401
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,560
And the first round of the price

402
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
given by B-FB is

403
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
less than five points.

404
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Boss,

405
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,560
the meeting is over.

406
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
I see.

407
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
I didn't expect that

408
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Han Zuo personally sent me to work one day.

409
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,560
What a great honor.

410
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,560
You are more than your boyfriend's honor than me.

411
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
You are so lucky.

412
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
I'm lucky.

413
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,560
I'm not motivated.

414
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560
I might not be able to send Mr. Ji to work.

415
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Are you motivated?

416
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,560
As the boss,

417
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,560
it's okay to go to the company later.

418
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,560
It's okay.

419
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
Han Ding.

420
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
Han Ding.

421
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
Xin.

422
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,560
Come in.

423
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Close the door.

424
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
Sit down.

425
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,560
Xin, what's wrong?

426
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,560
I received an anonymous email

427
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,560
from the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

428
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,560
It says that someone in the company is drunk

429
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
and has to take the job.

430
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
I'm going to be in the year to send the award later.

431
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
I guess some people

432
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
can't bear it.

433
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,560
According to our new mechanism,

434
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,560
the outstanding staff

435
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,560
is at least 45 times higher than the ordinary staff.

436
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,560
How about this?

437
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Let's make the award more average.

438
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,560
How?

439
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
What is an outstanding staff?

440
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,560
It's better than what others do.

441
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,560
Such people are more reasonable.

442
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,560
Yes, I understand.

443
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,560
But our surname is so small.

444
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,560
We don't have a low-end company.

445
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
I'm afraid that we'll have to

446
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,560
make a little profit

447
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,560
about the award.

448
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,560
The reward is not divided.

449
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,560
The profit will be more important.

450
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,560
I agree with Xin Xin's point of view.

451
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,560
Go to ask someone casually.

452
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,560
Shang Goufeng.

453
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
He has a good relationship with Xu Youyou.

454
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
His award is higher than Xu Youyou.

455
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
Do you ask him

456
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
if he's willing to give Xu Youyou a little?

457
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
That's right.

458
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,560
If you want to get a high award,

459
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,560
you have to use your brain and heart

460
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
to make excellent achievements.

461
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,560
We have to make the rules of award

462
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,560
to encourage everyone to do well.

463
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,560
If the sky is wet with water,

464
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
it's a little bit of a waste.

465
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,560
And you want to get a high award.

466
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Isn't that a joke?

467
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
I understand.

468
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,560
Let's deal with the work.

469
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,560
I've been careful

470
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
about everyone's mood these days.

471
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,560
Besides,

472
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,560
I have another idea.

473
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,560
What do you think?

474
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,560
It's starting from the next quarter.

475
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,560
Give everyone a little salary.

476
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,560
This depends on their work.

477
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
How to distribute it.

478
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
We'll discuss it later.

479
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
If so,

480
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,560
we won't have any objections to the high award.

481
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
We can also offer some

482
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,560
low-earning employees.

483
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
I think we can.

484
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,560
I have no objections.

485
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
Okay.

486
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,560
Then go back to work.

487
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
Okay.

488
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,560
How's the thing going?

489
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
I'm looking for a chance.

490
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
It will be soon.

491
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,560
The award is being distributed.

492
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Brother Xia.

493
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
Don't hide it.

494
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,560
You didn't get a lot of awards, did you?

495
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Half of them.

496
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,560
But you are modest.

497
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,560
As an employee of the company,

498
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,560
why don't you

499
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
have to do this?

500
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
I'm not.

501
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
I'm not.

502
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
I'm not.

503
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
I'm not.

504
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,560
I'm not.

505
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Why don't you have to do this?

506
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
It's almost done.

507
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Go back to work.

508
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
Wait for your meal.

509
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
Except for the 3rd and 1st place,

510
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,560
the winning rate is higher.

511
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
But the others...

512
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
Why do I only have 30,000 awards in my annual award?

513
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,560
I don't want to talk about

514
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
the friendship between you and your colleagues.

515
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,560
You just joined the East Asia.

516
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
I joined the East Asia.

517
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Why don't you go to the top?

518
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,560
Weiwei, sit down.

519
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
Sit.

520
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,560
Our annual award is

521
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
based on the company's system and calculations.

522
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
The system is set.

523
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,560
It's not because we are old colleagues.

524
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
I'll give you more awards.

525
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,560
It's not fair to other colleagues.

526
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
Okay, okay.

527
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
I understand.

528
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,560
You said that

529
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
the bottom line is

530
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
the book you don't want.

531
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
Fine.

532
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,560
That's all for the annual award.

533
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
Then...

534
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,560
When will my share be given to me?

535
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
Share?

536
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,560
Yes.

537
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
I'm the founder of Xing Chen.

538
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,560
I should share it.

539
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Who said that we would share it?

540
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,560
Didn't we say

541
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
we would share the same idea

542
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
when we were in the interview?

543
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Why didn't I share it?

544
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
Mr. Su.

545
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,560
You promised me that.

546
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
If we work together,

547
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Xing Chen won't let you down.

548
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,560
We are the same business.

549
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
We don't lack

550
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
the same power and strength.

551
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
I'm sorry, Weiwei.

552
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,560
I may have some problems

553
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
with my words.

554
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,560
We were in the business stage at that time.

555
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
But I mean the basic power.

556
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,560
For example,

557
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
the annual award and the project prize

558
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
are guaranteed.

559
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
Weiwei.

560
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
We signed the contract.

561
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,560
You are an employee, not an shareholders.

562
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
Maybe Zhizhou misunderstood you.

563
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
Misunderstanding?

564
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
You can use misunderstandings to solve it?

565
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,560
I'm a technical entrepreneur.

566
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
I'm involved in the manufacturing and engineering

567
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
of the foundation of the Ronghe Club.

568
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
Weiwei.

569
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,560
Look.

570
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,560
We have been together for so long.

571
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
You are so considerate of Mr. Ji.

572
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Okay, Mr. Su.

573
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
I'm very emotional.

574
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,560
I don't want to make things worse.

575
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
But you must

576
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
give me a statement.

577
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,560
Otherwise, I won't give up.

578
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
Weiwei.

579
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
Let's think about it.

580
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
We'll talk about it later.

581
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,560
Okay?

582
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
Okay.

583
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,560
I'll wait for your news.

584
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,560
There's one more thing.

585
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
I quit.

586
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
I quit my job.

587
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,560
I'm not a professional.

588
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
I'll be in the scene of my resignation.

589
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
I'll follow the procedure.

590
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
Before that,

591
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
I hope that I can record

592
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
the shares.

593
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
Sister Xing.

594
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Isn't this a priceless trick?

595
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,560
I've already done it

596
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
as you said.

597
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
They...

598
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
They don't want to

599
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
but they don't have a chance to say it.

600
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,560
They said they need to discuss it.

601
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
Okay, I understand.

602
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
I'll tell you what to do

603
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,560
when we have more arrangements.

604
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,560
Why are you so serious?

605
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
We've known each other for years.

606
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,560
I don't think he wants to rob me.

607
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,560
He really thinks

608
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,560
he should take the shares.

609
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
But he's not an antique.

610
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
Don't you think

611
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
it's a fact?

612
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,560
He's the original owner

613
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
of Xingcheng's company.

614
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
It's a big deal.

615
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
I think

616
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
he's a real person.

617
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,560
He's a real person.

618
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
He's a real person.

619
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
He's a real person.

620
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Xingcheng is a member of the company.

621
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,560
He doesn't have any shares.

622
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
Then it's fine.

623
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
Please take a look.

624
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
Tang Songfa said

625
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
he has already made a contract with the owner

626
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,560
and has signed the contract.

627
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,560
What's the matter?

628
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
Come with me.

629
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,560
We'll settle the matter soon.

630
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
We'll have dinner together.

631
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,560
Stay here.

632
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,560
Where's your clothes?

633
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,560
No.

634
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Considering Zhuo Cheng and Yuande's siren,

635
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
we must see

636
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,560
in our guesthouse.

637
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:35,560
You take a rest inside

638
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,520
I'm sorry, Mr. Han.

639
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,280
You're so busy.

640
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,160
I'm sorry to bother you.

641
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,760
It's really rude to say this on the phone.

642
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,760
I have to apologize to you.

643
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,360
It's a big deal.

644
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,960
It's normal to be so sincere.

645
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,160
But I heard from the subordinates that

646
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,360
you've already signed the contract.

647
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,960
Mr. Zhu is not satisfied.

648
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
I'm sorry.

649
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
I'm sorry.

650
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
I'm sorry.

651
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,560
I'm sorry.

652
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,960
Mr. Zhu is not satisfied.

653
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,160
Mr. Han,

654
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,160
is it a good idea to kill people?

655
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,960
Mr. Zhu is going to be a newbie

656
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,960
for more than ten years.

657
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,360
I have to make a high price.

658
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,760
Now, there are higher conditions for other families.

659
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360
I'm really touched.

660
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,960
I can understand

661
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,160
all the problems in the factory.

662
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,160
Who will give up the benefit of the hand-pulled?

663
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,560
This is why you were so greedy before.

664
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Then you came back to the company.

665
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,560
Dongyi didn't have any idea.

666
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,560
After all, doing business

667
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,760
is not a business deal.

668
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
It's a deal.

669
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,360
There are many things to do.

670
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,960
Dongyi will never care about these little money.

671
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,160
Come on.

672
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,760
But there is a limit.

673
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,760
Mr. Zhu is going to return to the company again and again.

674
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,760
I think this family is not over.

675
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,760
Dongyi is a good dancer.

676
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,760
I feel Dongyi is good at bullying.

677
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,160
Look at what you said.

678
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,360
Dongyi is a big man.

679
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,960
I dare not go with you.

680
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,560
If I can't go with you, I'm just a small person.

681
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,160
I have no idea.

682
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,960
You talk about the style and the principle of the hand-pulled.

683
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,560
I'm different.

684
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,560
I have to walk around and see.

685
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,960
If I talk about the things that are necessary to me,

686
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,160
I have to make a lot of money.

687
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,160
Walk around and see.

688
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,760
Take me here to wait for the market.

689
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,760
Mr. Han is joking.

690
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,080
Hong She,

691
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,920
give me some more peace.

692
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,720
Why do you make plans?

693
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,420
Why?

694
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,860
How to?

695
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,360
God bless you.

696
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,360
Right.

697
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,760
You have made the decision about this.

698
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,160
Mr. Zhu.

699
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,420
Don't you think this is familiar?

700
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,960
I don't know if you know it.

701
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,960
If Dong Yi leaves the house,

702
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
what will the result be like

703
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
if he wants to write the address?

704
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
You...

705
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,960
can't add it to 20 million, right?

706
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,960
It's okay.

707
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,960
But I don't want to.

708
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Mr. Han,

709
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
you'd rather be the same as him.

710
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,960
You don't want to discuss it anymore?

711
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
The last chance.

712
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
Agree.

713
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Sign.

714
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
Disagree.

715
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
And cancel the contract.

716
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
I don't get used to this tea.

717
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
The food in the city of the two-three lines

718
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,960
is good in combination with the competition.

719
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,960
If you really sell it to Tong Ge,

720
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,960
don't regret it.

721
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,960
Boss.

722
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,960
Last time you asked me to investigate

723
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,960
Zhu Houyu and Chang He.

724
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
I found that they did meet each other under the bed.

725
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,960
It should be about the negotiation.

726
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
Chang He is very dissatisfied with Zhu Houyu

727
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
and the two-line arrangement.

728
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
If we withdraw now,

729
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,960
they will be in the same contract.

730
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,960
Tong Ge will definitely take the money.

731
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,960
Right?

732
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,960
Okay.

733
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
I'll do it now.

734
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
Let's go.

735
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,960
Let's go.

736
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,960
Let's go.

737
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,960
Let's go.

738
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
Let's go.

739
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Let's go.

740
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,960
Let's go.

741
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,960
Where are we going?

742
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
We're going to have dinner with my girlfriend.

743
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,960
Let's go.

744
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,960
Why did you bring me to see Zhu Houyu today?

745
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
I don't understand.

746
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
You did it on purpose.

747
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,960
It's not on purpose.

748
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,960
It's normal to have a fight in the mall.

749
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,960
But I'm different from Huang Weiwei.

750
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
We were colleagues before.

751
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
We had feelings.

752
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
Boss and employee

753
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
have always been in the same contract.

754
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
We can't trust people's heart.

755
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,960
Only by making a difference

756
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,960
can we get a good result.

757
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
To get along with each other

758
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,960
only makes the other person have a chance.

759
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
I'm a member.

760
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
You

761
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,960
always think of giving others a umbrella.

762
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,960
But not everyone is worthy.

763
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,960
Some people don't only thank you

764
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,960
but also take your umbrella

765
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,960
to make you have a bigger one.

766
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
This is the reality.

767
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
Besides the rules,

768
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,960
there are good people and good emotions.

769
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
But the common people

770
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,960
have to cooperate with the rules.

771
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,960
The uncoordinated people

772
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,960
will only be able to

773
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,960
eliminate the power

774
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,960
that is easily established through the system.

775
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
Do you know

776
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
when you're in a bad mood,

777
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,960
you don't want to listen to these big things?

778
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
Han Fengshu.

779
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
Okay.

780
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
I won't say anything.

781
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
I'll give you some meat.

782
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,960
Here.

783
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
Let me think about it.

784
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
He will remind you

785
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
of a bad mother.

786
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,960
You'll feel better.

787
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,960
You're not talking.

788
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,960
I'm not.

789
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,960
What's wrong?

790
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,960
You look upset.

791
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,960
I asked you to drink.

792
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,960
How much do you drink?

793
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
You don't drink.

794
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,960
I just drink a small bottle.

795
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,960
It's okay.

796
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
Then drink less.

797
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,960
You can forget everything

798
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
when you drink.

799
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
Everything?

800
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,960
I'll help you.

801
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,960
Eat.

802
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,960
Beobile.

803
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,960
Hello?

804
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,960
Look at me?

805
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,960
Look over there.

806
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,960
Hello?

807
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
Mr. Ji says

808
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,960
you're gonna get the medical checkup.

809
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
Okay.

810
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,640
I'm sorry.

811
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Are you looking for me

812
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
to talk about shares?

813
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,160
Did you think about

814
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
leaving last time?

815
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,160
If you're willing to stay in Xingchen,

816
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,160
I'll promise you

817
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,160
that I'll pay you next time.

818
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,160
But Xingchen's shares

819
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,160
are impossible to give you.

820
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,560
What's so great about the new one?

821
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,760
The salary is only 20,000 yuan.

822
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,560
Xingchen is a creative company.

823
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,960
Who would dare to do it for you

824
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,960
without shares?

825
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,160
Do you think I'm thinking of you as my dream?

826
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,960
I'm not thinking of you.

827
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,360
Xingchen gave you the salary.

828
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,160
You should have done it.

829
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,760
You didn't pay for the fund,

830
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,560
or sell the human rights.

831
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,760
You didn't participate in the management.

832
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,760
Moreover, when you were in the position,

833
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,160
Xingchen accepted the investment of Dongyi.

834
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,960
If you want to get shares,

835
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,960
then you have to take all the employees' shares.

836
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,960
I didn't expect that I've shared with you for so long.

837
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,160
You actually came here for profit.

838
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,560
I came here for profit?

839
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,760
Our labor contract

840
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,160
doesn't have this kind of money.

841
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
If you can get the evidence

842
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,960
and say that you're Gu Dong,

843
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,360
I'll accept it.

844
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,560
There's no evidence

845
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,560
for the agreement on the contract.

846
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Let me tell you.

847
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,160
I'm the old Xingchen.

848
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,360
When technology entered the stock,

849
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,360
Xingchen's shares

850
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,360
were at least 3%.

851
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,960
Weiwei,

852
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,960
I can't promise you.

853
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,160
Fine.

854
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,560
You said it.

855
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,360
What's wrong?

856
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,360
You didn't blow your hair?

857
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,160
I'm a little tired. I don't want to move.

858
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
I know you had a conversation with Huang Weiwei today.

859
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,960
You did a good job.

860
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,960
I think it's too hard to see this thing.

861
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,360
I met him four or five years ago.

862
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,760
But this time,

863
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,360
I think I've seen him

864
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,960
who I've never seen before.

865
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,760
The wine you know may not know him.

866
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,360
People are complicated.

867
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,160
If you don't design profits,

868
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,160
most people will only show the side of friendship.

869
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,560
When more people come,

870
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,160
the love of the cause and effect will be seen by you.

871
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,560
That means you're going to be the best.

872
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,160
Han Tian,

873
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,560
how many noodles do you have?

874
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,960
A thousand.

875
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:34,960
Okay.

876
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,360
This is a small gap in your thin teeth.

877
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,760
Don't think about it when it's solved.

878
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

879
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,160
I'm afraid I'll be late.

880
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

881
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

882
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

883
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

884
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

885
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

886
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

887
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

888
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

889
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

890
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

891
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

892
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

893
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
I fear they might kill me.

894
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,640
I'll show you why am I the only one

895
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,320
chasing them in my furore bag.

896
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,360
I'll try my best.

897
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

898
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,120
I'm afraid I'll be late.

899
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

900
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,360
I'm afraid I'll be late.

901
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:07,360
I don't want to
