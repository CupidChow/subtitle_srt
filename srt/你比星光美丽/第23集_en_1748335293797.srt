1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,560
I want to go to the sky, to the ground

2
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,520
I will never hesitate to tell the future

3
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,040
I am afraid of the courage I have not given up

4
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,240
So I want to go to the sky, to the ground

5
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,880
But I will never give up

6
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,160
I will always believe in miracles

7
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,140
Even if I don't think about it

8
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,380
Have fun together

9
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,080
Love is the pick

10
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,120
Xinxin

11
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,080
Where are you?

12
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,520
You're not in the company yet

13
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,560
To be honest,

14
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,760
police didn't want us to be the same con

15
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,500
but they also wanted us to be different people

16
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,340
and keep us form each other.

17
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,660
Cool.

18
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,320
I'm now...

19
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,640
I'm going there now.

20
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,520
Xinxing, where are you?

21
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,920
Xinxing,

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,600
have a good rest at my place.

23
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,720
Go to bed early.

24
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,640
Eh?

25
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,080
asp.

26
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,000
You see hello.

27
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,040
I'm resting.

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,920
Lu Cheng.

29
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,320
Lu Cheng,

30
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,480
I've heard this message before.

31
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,120
Do you remember what did That Cheng told you...

32
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,200
to see me all over station?

33
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:23,680
οι gasoline.

34
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:23,900
較聰明會告訴你,

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,480
yet it's not那味道還過早,

36
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,440
it was gravity.

37
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,000
So like that,

38
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,600
if the navigation you've been training

39
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,080
was right about that.

40
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,000
Why you get lost really.

41
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,460
What?

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,520
I'm so sure.

43
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,440
Let's go.

44
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,840
The number you have called is trying too hard.

45
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,600
Mr Ji.

46
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,480
Master!

47
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,120
Does it take more time!

48
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,040
It's urgent.

49
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,200
Eat your fried egg.

50
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,920
OK, the address is important.

51
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,360
Mr. Ji opened the door for me.

52
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,440
He's gone.

53
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,440
He looks anxious.

54
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,760
He looks like he has something to say.

55
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
This is the sales of

56
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,760
the products of the full-time

57
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,200
winter clothes you want.

58
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,720
Next, the old products will start to be sold out.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
It can be around 5%.

60
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,240
The price of the new product

61
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,640
will be high-end.

62
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,760
The price will be high-end.

63
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,360
If it's on sale, will it be...

64
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,120
The quality of the product is too hard.

65
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,520
Someone will be able to sell it.

66
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,480
I understand.

67
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,660
Well...

68
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,760
I'll send out their products

69
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,080
as soon as you remember.

70
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,600
Okay.

71
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,120
Mr. Ji, morning.

72
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,600
Mr. Ji, morning.

73
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,440
Where did Zuo An go?

74
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,120
I'm not going to work.

75
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,880
I...

76
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,720
I went to a friend's house.

77
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,880
Friend?

78
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Which friend?

79
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Don't you know him?

80
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,120
A boyfriend or girlfriend?

81
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
You're in the heart of the heart

82
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,120
and you're even better than Xiaomeng and me.

83
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,720
I'm jealous.

84
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,920
I'm not jealous.

85
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,120
I'm not jealous.

86
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
I'm not jealous.

87
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
I'm not jealous.

88
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
I'm not jealous.

89
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,920
I'm not jealous.

90
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,320
I was with Han Ting yesterday.

91
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,720
This is good.

92
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,520
Why are you shy?

93
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,920
When will you let your boss Han

94
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,320
eat with us?

95
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,120
Do you think I have something to do with him

96
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,720
or what kind of relationship is this?

97
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,120
He's my girlfriend.

98
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
But he didn't say he liked me.

99
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,720
You're still in college?

100
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,720
He's still playing guitar in the building

101
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,320
and playing the guitar.

102
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,520
I love you, Han.

103
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,920
I've seen him interesting to you.

104
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
I didn't expect to endure it now.

105
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,720
What's wrong?

106
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,520
What's wrong with you?

107
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,920
I still feel a little too fast.

108
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,320
Don't worry.

109
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,520
Take your time.

110
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,120
You're not busy with your work now.

111
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,720
Go to the repair shop and think about it.

112
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,720
Before the repair shop,

113
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
you have to sign this contract.

114
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,720
I'm leaving.

115
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,520
I'm leaving.

116
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,720
I'm leaving.

117
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,920
I'm leaving.

118
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
I'm leaving.

119
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,120
I'm leaving.

120
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,320
I'm leaving.

121
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,520
I'm leaving.

122
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,720
I'm leaving.

123
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
I'm leaving.

124
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,920
I'm leaving.

125
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,120
I'm leaving.

126
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,320
I'm leaving.

127
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,320
I'm leaving.

128
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
I'm leaving.

129
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,520
I'm leaving.

130
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
I'm leaving.

131
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
I'm leaving.

132
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
I'm leaving.

133
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
I'm leaving.

134
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
I'm leaving.

135
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
I'm leaving.

136
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
I'm leaving.

137
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
I'm leaving.

138
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
I'm leaving.

139
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
I'm leaving.

140
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
I'm leaving.

141
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
I'm leaving.

142
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
I'm leaving.

143
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
Mr. Han.

144
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,720
Are you here for Xing?

145
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,120
He just left.

146
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Just left?

147
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Where did he go?

148
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,920
He said he had something to do

149
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
and invited him to go back to his hometown.

150
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,320
Tell me what happened.

151
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
I'll send him back.

152
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,320
No need.

153
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,520
Tell me when he comes back.

154
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
Mr. Han, goodbye.

155
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Goodbye.

156
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Let me guess.

157
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,520
Mr. Han asked me to ask you

158
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
if you want to ask me for a favor.

159
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
Do you think

160
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,720
it's hard to guess

161
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,320
some girls' feelings?

162
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
Some?

163
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,920
It's just a memory.

164
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,920
After I left last night,

165
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,720
what happened to you two?

166
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Mr. Han.

167
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
Mr. Han.

168
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,120
He's hiding from me now.

169
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
He's suddenly

170
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,320
going back to his hometown.

171
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
Mr. Han.

172
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,120
He's not hiding from you.

173
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,920
It's called love.

174
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,520
A girl like Ji Xing

175
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
will be hurt

176
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,120
if she's with you.

177
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,320
You need to give her some space.

178
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,520
You need to keep your distance.

179
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
Do you understand?

180
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,820
Yes.

181
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,320
So,

182
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,320
the吧at that table

183
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,520
allows you to learn something.

184
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,320
Excuse me, porcupine.

185
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,920
episode 2

186
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,660
A safe journey

187
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,900
gia jud

188
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,520
What the hell?

189
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,400
Just you're laughing

190
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,200
Didn't you come here this late in the night

191
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,360
I just want to do some freshness for you

192
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,580
What?

193
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,780

It's a hard day

203
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,860

Please open the book now.

214
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,220
Ever since you taught me to sing,

215
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,820
I discovered the brush kindness doesn't answer.

216
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,940
That's not a good idea.

217
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,020
Ten times.

218
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,220
Nine times.

219
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,100
Just one time.

220
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,980
Right.

221
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,580
We need to practice at home.

222
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,020
This is the award you got for the competition.

223
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,420
Yes.

224
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,420
Come on, Mr. Xiaomeng.

225
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,420
Drink some water.

226
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,580
No.

227
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,580
And this one.

228
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,980
And a certificate.

229
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,740
Son.

230
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,460
He's so sensitive.

231
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:07,980
See?

232
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,220
Except for the certificate,

233
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,060
and these few boxes of soda water,

234
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,660
it's gone.

235
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,780
What do you mean?

236
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,220
You're going to get a hold of yourself.

237
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:15,780
No.

238
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,820
Mr. Xiaomeng.

239
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,540
I'm serious.

240
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,380
I really appreciate you this time.

241
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,220
If it weren't for your teaching,

242
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,620
how could I get a full-fledged award?

243
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,980
No.

244
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,780
Who will marry you in the future?

245
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,780
Isn't this his great fortune?

246
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,780
Aunt,

247
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,980
I'm sorry for what you said.

248
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,060
What's the big deal?

249
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,220
I'm telling the truth.

250
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,220
It's getting late.

251
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,620
I'm going back.

252
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,020
The weather is really late.

253
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,020
You go back alone.

254
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,620
It's not safe.

255
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,220
I'll let Jiajia...

256
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:55,820
I'll send you home.

257
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,020
Okay.

258
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,620
No need.

259
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,620
It's okay.

260
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,620
It's okay.

261
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,620
I've cleaned it.

262
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,220
The content of the video...

263
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,420
I still feel a little too fast.

264
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,820
Don't worry.

265
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,020
Come on.

266
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,120
You don't have the time to tell me

267
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,360
who did it

268
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,580
to pay for,

269
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,460
so late.

270
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,380
Give me a break.

271
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,840
When I've taken off

272
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,860
in order to help you属 Ceちゃん,

273
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,860
I didn't have time.

274
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,260
I call you Feishan.

275
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,380
Feishan.

276
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,420
This time,

277
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,540
you tried to rape her.

278
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,660
That was very dangerous.

279
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,820
You also tried to hurt us.

280
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,900
Now,

281
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,900
I'm not a fool.

282
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,900
I'm not a fool.

283
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
I'm not a fool.

284
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
I'm not a fool.

285
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,900
I'm not a fool.

286
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
I'm not a fool.

287
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
What are you doing?

288
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Why are you laughing?

289
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
I'm not laughing because you're happy.

290
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
I'm not happy.

291
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,900
You're taking a photo of yourself.

292
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,900
Look at your smile.

293
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,900
You're so lovely.

294
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,900
I'm not.

295
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,900
I didn't expect that

296
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,900
a son who is not afraid of the sky and the earth

297
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,900
would have a red face one day.

298
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,900
What are you doing?

299
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
Son, tell me the truth.

300
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
I support you.

301
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,900
I hope you can have a good relationship

302
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,900
and get married early.

303
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,900
Let's get married first and then get divorced.

304
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
Yes, yes, yes.

305
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,900
I know.

306
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
Look.

307
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
Look at the photo I took just now.

308
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,900
Son, look at the photo I took.

309
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,900
Whose information is this?

310
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,900
It's a secret.

311
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,900
Xiaomeng.

312
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,900
Mom.

313
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,900
Something happened to Xiaomeng.

314
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,900
You're red.

315
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,900
I'm red?

316
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,900
What do you mean? I'm red?

317
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,900
Where am I red?

318
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,900
Look at this video. You're red.

319
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,900
What?

320
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
What?

321
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,900
Look, look.

322
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
It's all on the screen.

323
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,900
Your mom is so good.

324
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,900
Mom, you're really red this time.

325
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
My bar is on fire.

326
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
Really?

327
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
My shop's bar today.

328
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,900
It's said that many customers came today

329
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,900
because of this video.

330
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,900
Really?

331
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,900
Son, I didn't expect

332
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,900
to help you in this way.

333
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
Mom is red.

334
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,900
So I made a decision.

335
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,900
What decision?

336
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
I'm going to drink your wine.

337
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,900
I'll invest in it.

338
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,900
Really?

339
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,900
Of course.

340
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,900
I'm red.

341
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,900
Really?

342
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,900
Then, Mom, you're my second-large shareholder.

343
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,900
I'll make money for you.

344
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
I'll pay you back.

345
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,900
No.

346
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
I don't want to pay you back.

347
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,900
Since your mom has entered your bar,

348
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,900
and you're second-large shareholder,

349
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
I'll go to your bar

350
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,900
regularly to pay you back.

351
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,900
I'll pay you back.

352
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,900
Are you happy?

353
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,900
Yes.

354
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,900
Stop it.

355
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,900
You have to learn new songs.

356
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,900
I'll go to that bar.

357
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,900
I'll go to the new bar.

358
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,900
You can't sing old songs.

359
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,900
What songs?

360
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
We...

361
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,900
We're not suitable for this.

362
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,900
That's the love.

363
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
I'm sorry.

364
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,900
I'm sorry.

365
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,900
I'm sorry.

366
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
I'm sorry.

367
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,900
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,900
I'm sorry.

369
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,900
I'm sorry.

370
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
I'm sorry.

371
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,900
I'm sorry.

372
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,900
I'm sorry.

373
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,900
I'm sorry.

374
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
I'm sorry.

375
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,900
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,900
I'm sorry.

377
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,900
I'm sorry.

378
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,900
I'm sorry.

379
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,900
I'm sorry.

380
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
I'm sorry.

381
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,900
I'm sorry.

382
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,900
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,900
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,900
I'm sorry.

385
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,900
I'm sorry.

386
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,900
I'm sorry.

387
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
Boss, Mr. Ji is back.

388
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,900
He went to the innovation center

389
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,900
to see Zhang Fengmei.

390
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,620
Is the new company's strategic book still on?

391
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,460
I'll go check it out.

392
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,860
Please send Mr. Ji back as soon as possible.

393
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,340
Why are you out of bed?

394
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,700
Mr. Ji.

395
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,340
Have a seat.

396
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,060
Have a seat.

397
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,060
Director Ding, you've changed a lot.

398
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,900
You must rest easy and don't move.

399
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,820
You need to listen to the doctor more.

400
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,060
This will make you recover faster.

401
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,660
I just want to go out of bed

402
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,820
and work out.

403
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,260
I'm a little tired.

404
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,180
Thank you.

405
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,980
This is our mouth.

406
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:52,860
Mr. Ji,

407
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,060
this is what I often mention to you.

408
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,820
Mr. Ji.

409
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,060
This is Mr. Ji.

410
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,220
Mr. Ji, what's wrong?

411
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,700
Don't worry.

412
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,180
The operation is successful.

413
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,980
It's good to recover after taking it.

414
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,220
You can check it out again.

415
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,340
It's okay.

416
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,900
You can go out of the hospital after some time.

417
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,500
Well,

418
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,580
you need to take care of your wife.

419
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,380
Mr. Fang,

420
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,420
I'm just listening.

421
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,820
I have something to do.

422
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,780
I'm not good at this.

423
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,700
When can I get off work

424
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,780
like her?

425
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,340
ıklев whom I didn't know

426
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,260
was consisting of you.

427
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,260
He's just your wife.

428
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,300
Bye.

429
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,300
Bye.

430
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,780
Mr. Tong.

431
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,620
Your husband is a liar.

432
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,820
Excuse me,

433
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,220
your husband is my......

434
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,820
What's wrong with you?

435
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,420
Uncle...

436
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,060
Please.

437
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,020
Stop laughing.

438
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,980
I've said that

439
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,540
unless you really get into a high position,

440
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,460
or else,

441
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,900
I won't go.

442
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,500
Let's see who it is.

443
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,860
The manufacturing and medical industry

444
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,020
is excellent for the businessmen to communicate with the meeting.

445
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,940
That's good, Xing.

446
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,140
This meeting is very expensive.

447
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,380
It can be invited.

448
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,620
It means that

449
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,780
Xing Chen has already found a head-to-head in the industry.

450
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,980
So,

451
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,540
if you can perform well in this meeting,

452
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,020
can Xing Chen give us an advertisement?

453
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,340
Such an important opportunity,

454
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,980
should I prepare well?

455
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,780
Of course.

456
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,260
Or if you don't want to report,

457
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,180
you can go to the speech.

458
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,380
You...

459
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,500
Xing,

460
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,660
the company is in the middle of the valley.

461
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,020
Go to the speech.

462
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,420
I'll go to see Han Zao.

463
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,860
I'm not afraid.

464
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,500
I'm not afraid.

465
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,540
I'll go.

466
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,940
It's a deal. I'll go.

467
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,540
We've got the papers.

468
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,500
Boss, Xing Chen's staff is here.

469
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,320
That's Su Zhizhong's copy.

470
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,580
Please come in.

471
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,500
...Mr. Han,

472
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,100
this is seasoned reguar Fern Wert.

473
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:25,040
T

474
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,980
Xing's role as the lead actor.

475
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,100
She wrote this?

476
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,420
Yes.

477
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,180
It's mainly

478
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,740
Xing's ideas and concepts.

479
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,100
Mr. Han,

480
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,620
do you think

481
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,220
we need to change anything?

482
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,380
No.

483
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,420
I'm sure.

484
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,980
From product development to market positioning,

485
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,500
I think it's all right.

486
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,060
Okay.

487
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,420
Thank you, Mr. Han.

488
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,060
Xing Chen is really strong.

489
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,780
Mr. Ji is worthy of being invited.

490
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,580
Go.

491
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,340
Okay.

492
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:09,860
Mr. Han, goodbye.

493
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,420
Ask Tang Cong to come in.

494
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:13,820
Okay.

495
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,500
Boss.

496
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,300
Did you have a meeting with the founder

497
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,620
of the communication conference two days ago?

498
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,260
Yes.

499
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,460
I've already decided for you.

500
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,540
But the host team has been fighting.

501
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,580
I'll tell them that you can join.

502
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,420
Yes.

503
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,940
During departments three, we have

504
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,420
several meetings and controversy.

505
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,700
Every pillar becomes like this.

506
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,460
A lot of things to do.

507
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,220
The talk is very good.

508
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,700
I'm not talking about myself.

509
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,540
How's special?

510
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,580
Of course,

511
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,300
about paintings,

512
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,920
That won't do.

513
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,820
For the top of instead of Zunbaoros and boys,

514
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,140
you can choose Zunbao

515
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,200
or Zunman!

516
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,920
Everyone

517
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,580
please get to know

518
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,580
about the development of cycling.

519
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,920
Sorry I have been keeping you a secret for quite some time.

520
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,220
But for the hired staff here,

521
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,200
don't try too hard,

522
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,880
you need to takelining pressures first,

523
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,880
then construction,

524
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,400
then start from the beginning.

525
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,500
Where are the funds?

526
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,660
I'm going to sell metal in my style.

527
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,580
This re-grubbing is cost-effective.

528
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,900
Here's your PLUS

529
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:09,860
Go

530
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,380
Can I help you?

531
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,420
Wait

532
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,760
Alaska

533
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,220
Your treat

534
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,260
Everything you wanted me to be

535
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,060
I tried to let you be my destiny

536
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,940
To start the shining through the day and night

537
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,940
And I see

538
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,780
All my hate and false tendency

539
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,420
Commonly from this side to me

540
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,220
We are the one that God keeps forcing

541
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,020
I honestly

542
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,060
You are everything

543
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,860
Everything you wanted me to be

544
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,740
I only need you to be my destiny

545
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,660
I try to let you be my destiny

546
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,780
To start the shining through the day and night

547
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,500
And I see

548
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,780
All my hate and false tendency

549
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,260
Commonly from this side to me

550
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,180
Commonly from this side to me

551
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,660
We are the one that God keeps forcing

552
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,500
I honestly

553
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,500
You are everything

554
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,580
Mr. Wang, you're here.

555
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,140
I'm leaving.

556
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,900
Long time no see.

557
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,380
Look, the development of the industry is still good.

558
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:06,980
Yes.

559
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,060
Why are you here?

560
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,780
Why aren't you here?

561
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,260
Are you hiding me from me?

562
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:31,980
Nope.

563
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,340
Then why did you confess to state the order

564
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,540
Won't I arranged a bill?

565
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,060
I'm keep it to myself

566
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,180
Let me take a look at this.

567
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,820
Brother�in Danko,

568
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,820
I'll see.

569
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,980
Your writing is quite good.

570
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,140
Really?

571
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,900
The style can be familiar.

572
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,660
It might be like

573
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,220
I'll say it.

574
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,220
It's about to start. I'll go first.

575
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,020
Remember,

576
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,220
when you're talking,

577
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,420
you don't just need to get the words,

578
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,020
but you also need to get out of the way

579
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,420
and start over.

580
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,820
I'll go first.

581
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,820
Come.

582
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,620
Do you have anything to say?

583
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,820
What's wrong?

584
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,620
I have a meal tonight.

585
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,420
It's all about the right people.

586
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,020
Let's go together.

587
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,620
Next, let's welcome the new president of Xing Chen Technology,

588
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,420
Ji Xing.

589
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,220
Actually, I'm a very bad founder.

590
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,420
I didn't have anything in the beginning of the industry.

591
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,420
I took a concept and went to invest.

592
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,820
Maybe I misunderstood the word

593
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,620
angel investment at the time.

594
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,020
I thought the investors were angels.

595
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,620
I'm not afraid of you guys.

596
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,620
I wanted to pull 1,500 million of the investment,

597
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,420
but only 20% of the investment.

598
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,420
I met a liar once.

599
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,820
After he talked to me, he told me,

600
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,020
girl,

601
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,220
I thought I was already very good at it.

602
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,820
I didn't expect that you're better than me

603
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,420
after meeting the expert today.

604
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,820
I used to have a lot of things I didn't understand,

605
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,420
but I kept learning.

606
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,620
There are many people in this world

607
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,220
who are ready to take action.

608
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,020
There are people like me

609
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,820
who go out first and study

610
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,020
all the way.

611
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,020
I think people like me

612
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,620
are not bad.

613
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:12,020
I took Xing Chen to the capital with me.

614
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,620
The products we're focusing on

615
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,220
have entered the clinical experiment.

616
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,020
Some other ancient products

617
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,420
are also in the planning.

618
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,020
A while ago,

619
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,620
Xing Chen went to the clinical experiment

620
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,820
with the fusion device.

621
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,220
He received a volunteer outside the plan.

622
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,020
He has a serious waist disease.

623
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,020
He is well recovered after the treatment.

624
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,220
This volunteer is not in a good family.

625
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:39,220
The only person who can get the treatment

626
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,220
is only the clinical experiment.

627
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,420
But the test is limited.

628
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,620
There are many people like him.

629
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,620
Xing Chen has more power and production.

630
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,220
He can lower the cost of the product.

631
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,020
His price is also lower.

632
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,620
The direct entry to the treatment is limited.

633
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,620
The people who help him

634
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,220
are more likely to have a better life.

635
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,620
This is the future of Xing Chen.

636
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,020
I'm Ji Xing.

637
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,420
I'm a technology student.

638
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,420
Please look forward to the future of Xing Chen.

639
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,220
Thank you.

640
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,820
This girl is good.

641
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,820
She is very flexible.

642
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,020
She is indeed good.

643
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,620
She is smart.

644
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,220
She chooses to work on her own.

645
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,220
She is very good.

646
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,220
Thank you.

647
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,420
What do you think of today's speech?

648
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,420
I feel good.

649
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,020
What do you think?

650
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,420
Very excellent.

651
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,220
By the way,

652
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,420
what do you think of

653
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,620
after reading the book of Xing Chen?

654
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,420
I didn't tell you.

655
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,620
I just want to confirm it.

656
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,620
Next time, you come to see me personally.

657
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,820
The company's direction is ready.

658
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,020
Next, you should leave a person's question.

659
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,620
It's almost the end of the year.

660
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,620
The problems of the promotion of gold,

661
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,020
and interest are all over the table.

662
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,420
You need to pay more attention.

663
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,220
I will deal with it well.

664
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,820
attic

665
00:38:47,620 --> 00:39:02,220
spells

666
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,340
Okay.

667
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,820
Chairman Han is here.

668
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,220
President Han, president Han.

669
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,300
President Han.

670
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
Please wait a moment.

671
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,140
Sorry.

672
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:23,660
Sit down.

673
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,020
President Han,

674
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,900
this dish is almost cold.

675
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,020
We must have a good drink tonight.

676
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,300
We have other things to deal with today.

677
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,220
I've had a cup of tea and a toast.

678
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:43,980
Okay.

679
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:44,820
Thank you.

680
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,260
Mr. Han is here.

681
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,900
Let's have a chat while we're eating.

682
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,740
Mr. Han,

683
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,300
I heard that Dong Yi

684
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,340
signed a contract with Hong Kong Hospital for two years.

685
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,340
He even paid off his debt.

686
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,140
You can have a chat with everyone.

687
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,540
Is it just a one-off?

688
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,340
Or do you want to say this to other partners?

689
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:16,740
It's the same.

690
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,060
The old products are all paid off.

691
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,300
Dong Yi is even trying to get the market's competitive power

692
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,940
by paying off his debt.

693
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,180
It seems that our little bosses

694
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,420
can't leave.

695
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,660
Dong Yi didn't pay off his debt in the first five years.

696
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,660
Now he's paid off his debt

697
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,860
by paying off his debt.

698
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,540
He's paid off his debt

699
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,140
as a return to the company.

700
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:40,900
Besides,

701
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,340
the market share is not as expensive as it used to be.

702
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,820
It's also meat.

703
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,140
The previous people didn't want to fight for it.

704
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,060
I wanted to take more.

705
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,500
So,

706
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,820
I naturally want to learn from you

707
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,380
how to pay off your debt.

708
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,020
It's hard to avoid these

709
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:02,700
business harmonies.

710
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,940
Instead of two hundred business deals,

711
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,100
I think

712
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,100
it's better to share it with everyone.

713
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,420
Mr. Han and Mr. Chang are so stubborn.

714
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,500
Come on.

715
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,380
I'll have another toast.

716
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,340
Come on.

717
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,260
Mr. Han.

718
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,340
Come on.

719
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,340
Life should be walking againstami forever.

720
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,700
グッ Across my mind and drink up all the wine.

721
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,340
Hello, everyone.

722
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,020
I'm Xia Lu.

723
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,220
It's wonderful to

724
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:54,760
participate in the

725
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,320
business general's左右 temple.

726
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,240
Don't be mad.

727
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,120
Come in.

728
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,560
Make a good circle.

729
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,040
I'll take care of you.

730
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,840
Right?

731
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,360
Okay.

732
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,600
I'll have a toast to Mr. Han.

733
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,480
I hope you'll be happy.

734
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,280
Thank you.

735
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,080
Xing Chen Technology.

736
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,280
Mr. Ji.

737
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,520
Ji Xing.

738
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,520
You don't drink wine, either?

739
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,440
Come on.

740
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,640
Come on, Mr. Ji.

741
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,680
I don't know how to drink white wine.

742
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,320
Red wine is good.

743
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,000
Come on.

744
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,800
Come on.

745
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,800
Come on, Mr. Ji.

746
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,680
I'll drink it first.

747
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,600
In that case,

748
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,800
I'll have a toast to you.

749
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,160
Come on.

750
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,360
Come on.

751
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,480
Mr. Ji.

752
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,720
You don't drink wine.

753
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,160
You can't make a circle.

754
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,040
We don't care.

755
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,800
Mr. Chang is a great man.

756
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,920
You should at least give him a drink.

757
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,160
I'm afraid that I'll be late.

758
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,280
I'll be late.

759
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,240
I'll be late.

760
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,400
I'll be late.

761
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,560
