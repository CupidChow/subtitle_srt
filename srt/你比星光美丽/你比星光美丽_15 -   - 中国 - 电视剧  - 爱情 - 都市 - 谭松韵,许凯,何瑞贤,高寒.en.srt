- Cheers.

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,400
To Xingchen's new office.

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,480
Thanks.

26
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,400
Indeed, fried chicken
and beer pair well together.

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,070
After having too many light meals,
I still think fried food

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,430
makes me happiest.

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,280
My pretty bosses,

30
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,310
hope you don't mind this humble gift.

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,840
We don't.

32
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,870
Since I started a company,

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,680
we haven't had dinner together

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,070
for a long time.

35
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,120
Yeah.

36
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,000
Luckily,

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,520
your efforts aren't wasted.

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,470
The two of you

39
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,240
have your own offices now.

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,870
I'd like to thank the lady

41
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,400
who always has my back

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
and the lady who works hard with me.

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,910
Because you've convinced me

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,190
Xingchen will be a great stage.

45
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,840
When the product is done,

46
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,750
I won't make you regret

47
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,910
hiring me.

48
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,750
She's a top salesgirl.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,870
I've been feeling lucky, you know?

50
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,630
Now, with a new start,

51
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,910
our future will be more smooth.

52
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,000

(Xingchen Technology)
Hi, interviewers.

57
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,680
My name is Xu Youyou.

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,520
I'm Zhang Jie.

59

Hi, I'm Feng Yu.

I'm Chen Zuo.

61
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,800
Hello, I'm Jiang Jingxuan.

62
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,590
Jiangyang Technology and Business University.

63
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,630
I majored in business administration

64
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,520
with a bachelor's degree.

65
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,310
Xinggang University of Engineering Science.

66
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,150
I have a master's degree.

67
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,240
Jingxi University Of Technology.

68
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,870
Xinggang University of Engineering Science.

69
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,000
I majored in product engineering.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,080
I graduated from Computer Science
of Xinggang University

71
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,000
with a bachelor's degree.

72
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,310
We're from the same school.

73
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,280
What are your salary requirements?

74
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,400
As a new graduate,

75
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,870
I have no requirements.

76
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,000
I hope

77
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,000
my salary is about 50,000.

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,590
I want that, too. Next.

79
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,240
Why did you leave your last company?

80
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,120
I resigned.

81
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,030
My last company is too small.

82
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,310
The environment is so poor.

83
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,910
It's old in winter and hot in summer.

84
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,430
A rather terrible workplace.

85
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,910
You've got a good office.

86
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,240
- Next.
- Next.

87
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,840
What is your dream?

88
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,840
Dream?

89
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,630
I don't have a dream.

90
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,470
I want to be admitted

91
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,680
to a top Fortune 500 company.

92
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,590
I want the products I design

93
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,470
to be patentable.

94
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,280
I just want to do something I like.

95
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,000
Write programs or codes, for example.

96
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,240
I can do it all day.

97
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,550
Li,

98
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,750
from today's interviews,

99
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,800
I realize you are really awesome.

100
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,800
You're as good

101
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
as professional HR roles.

102
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,790
You had a long day. Have some water.

103
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,590
Let's just see the next interviewee.

104
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,470
Next.

105
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,270
Hello, I'm Huang Weiwei.

106
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,190
You used to be Miss Ji's colleague, huh?

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,040
Miss Ji told us

108
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,480
that you would come.

109
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,800
You're an acquaintance,

110
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,240
but we have to keep it professional.

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,680
I want to ask you some questions.

112
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,950
You don't mind, do you?

113
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,120
No, I don't.

114
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't want to take advantage of Xing.

115
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,240
Feel free to ask.

116
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,450
(Work Experience)
You're experienced.

117
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,720
You've also worked
in this field for many years.

118
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,040
You're exactly what we want.

119
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,430
However...

120
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,660
Xingchen can't be as good

121
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,640
as a big company like Guanghua.

122
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,190
We can't tolerate too many mistakes.

123
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,510
When I worked in Guanghua,

124
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,000
I did make some mistakes.

125
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,070
But since Ji Xing left,

126
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,630
they've set me up for more mistakes.

127
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,240
I've grown a lot, too.

128
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,870
In the future,

129
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,310
I'll do my best

130
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,950
and take my work

131
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,920
more seriously.

132
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,430
If you join Xingchen,

133
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,480
can you guarantee

134
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,950
you won't make the same mistakes?

135
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,960
Yes.

136
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,240
I can have a probation period

137
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,600
like anybody else.

138
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,190
You can see how I work

139
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,070
before you decide if you'll keep me.

140
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,270
Well, you'll have a three-month probation.

141
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,000
Hope you'll do a good job.

142
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,560
Thank you.

143
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,240
I really want to join you.

144
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,680
If we can work together,

145
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,310
we will not let you down.

146
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,430
Every one of us

147
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,430
does the business together.

148
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,510
The welfare and bonuses

149
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,630
will be offered.

150
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,800
OK. Next.

151
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,560
Check it very carefully.

152
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,560
What's going on, Huang Weiwei?

153
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,000
It's not time to knock off yet.

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
You're here just in time.

(Letter of Resignation)

156
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,630
Come on, you...

157
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,730
Are you having any trouble at work?

158
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,600
Or is there a misunderstanding
between the colleagues?

159
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,870
Don't rush to pack your things.

160
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,310
Come on. Let's talk in my office.

161
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,950
No need, Director Chen.

162
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,630
I've made up my mind.

163
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,600
Guanghua can't give me what I want.

164
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,430
Tell me the real reason.

165
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,800
In my letter of resignation,

166
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,680
I've explained everything.

167
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,390
Since Ji Xing left,

168
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,600
I've been the scapegoat of our team.

169
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,800
You and Lin Zhen took turns

170
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,720
to do mean things to me.

171
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,160
What are you talking about?

172
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,430
What's the point of working here?

173
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
I would rather join Ji Xing

174
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,830
for a business.

175
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,320
Huang Weiwei,

176
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,000
you'd better think carefully.

177
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,800
Xingchen is a startup company.

178
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,430
Nobody knows how it'll end up.

179
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,680
So what?

180
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,190
Xingchen and Guanghua

181
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,600
are both invested by Mr. Han.

182
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,070
When I join them,

183
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,480
I'll be a founding member.

184
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,710
Sadly,

185
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,630
you offended Ji Xing too much.

186
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,000
You won't have a chance.

187
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,630
What are you looking at?

188
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,630
Focus on your work!

189
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,310
A snobbish employee like her

190
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,630
won't stay long in any company!

191
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,670
Everybody,

192
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,310
after nearly six months,

193
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,360
our company has completed

194
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,630
its preliminary HR reform.

195
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,560
This is Dr. Jiang Huai,

196
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,000
director of the AI Department.

197
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,750
You know him.

198
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,240
These days,

199
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,240
he led the team of Doctorcloud

200
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,480
to have quickly completed

201
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,870
the upgrades

202
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,240
(Dongyang Medical)
and cooperated

203
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,750
with many hospitals.

204
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,630
This is Luo Ping,

205
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,160
new director of the Product Department.

206
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,950
The former director

207
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,830
was assigned

208
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,070
to Dongyang Base in Germany.

209
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,630
From this day on,

210
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,120
our product lines

211
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,630
will be in the charge of Director Luo.

212
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,390
Nice to meet you, everybody.

213
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,800
The combination of software and hardware

214
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,600
is the strategy we've been sticking to.

215
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,510
I hope Dr. Jiang

216
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,240
will work with Director Luo

217
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,270
to fully achieve business upgrades.

218
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,470
Besides,

219
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,800
I have another thing to announce.

220
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,630
Zhang Xinhua, the former director
of the Sales Department

221
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,510
resigned for some personal reasons.

222
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,310
Wang Chong,

223
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,830
the former deputy director,

224
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,600
will be the new director.

225
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,870
You're experienced professionals.

226
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,000
I want you to do your own part.

227
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,720
If you need any help in business,

228
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,120
I'll give you as much as I can.

229
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,590
I, Han Ting,

230
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,320
only focus on the result.

231
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
What are you doing here?

232
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,270
What's up?

233
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,630
Isn't Ji Xing going too far?

234
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,790
When she just moved in here,
she poached my employee.

235
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,030
Some days ago,

236
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,630
I even gave her a bouquet.

237
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,630
Dongyang Medical encourages
free movement of employees.

238
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,390
Isn't it normal
that an employee gets another job?

239
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,510
It's the crucial period

240
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,080
for Bay Phase II.

241
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,240
When she has my employee,

242
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,870
things are hard for me.

243
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,510
When a mere engineer is gone,

244
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,440
things are hard already?

245
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,440
She poached

246
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,000
a core member.

247
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,790
With a slower progress,

248
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,960
it's Dongyang Medical

249
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,030
that will finally be affected.

250
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,000
But if Dr. Jiang Huai

251
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
can serve as our consultant soon,

252
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,960
the effect won't be too terrible, I think.

253
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,480
Don't worry.

254
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,440
I remember what I promised you.

255
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,790
Dr. Jiang Huai's team

256
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,600
will be in Guanghua in a day or two.

257
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,790
Really? That'd be great.

258
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,270
- I just...
- Ms. Yuan.

259
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,480
There you are, Ms. Yuan.

260
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,480
You guys talk.

261
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,670
I should go.

262
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,120
What's up, Yuan? Come and sit.

263
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
Don't play dumb.

264
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,080
You know what I'm here for.

265
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,320
Dongyang Medical is a big company.

266
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,150
Personnel changes are normal.

267
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,030
If you defend those old employees
who made some mistakes,

268
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,030
isn't it unnecessary?

269
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,230
Han Ting,

270
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,960
either as the vice president

271
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,840
or as your family,

272
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,790
I need to remind you something.

273
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,670
If you want to reform,

274
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,910
don't be too radical.

275
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,200
Take action slowly.

276
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,510
Haste makes waste.

277
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,910
You rushed

278
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,630
to replace those core directors

279
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,200
with your own men.

280
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,910
Anyone with a discerning eye can see

281
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,910
what you really want.

282
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,750
What I want

283
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,840
is to race against time.

284
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,870
After all, in front of the directors,

285
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,000
I made a pledge.

286
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,390
Time is pressing.

287
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,960
I can't do anything slowly.

288
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,480
Am I right?

289
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
You have a good reason.

290
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,630
But don't forget.

291
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,960
Those old employees who you fired

292
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,080
worked for Dongyang Medical

293
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,270
for a lot of years.

294
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,790
When they're gone,

295
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,390
a lot of things have to start from scratch.

296
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,870
Thank you for reminding me.

297
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,240
Now, I know

298
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,080
Dongyang Medical
hasn't developed all these years

299
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,630
depending on the healthy operation

300
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,480
of the company itself,

301
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,390
but on those old employees.

302
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,440
In this case,

303
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,840
we can't keep them.

304
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,320
You're terribly set on it.

305
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,630
Will Grandpa approve?

306
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,840
Grandpa only values the result.

307
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,120
I'll prove it with my accomplishments.

308
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,150
I have things to do.
Do yourself a favor and leave.

309
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
OK. I'll wait and see.

310
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,240
No problem. I won't let you down.

311
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,720
(Ji Xing)
Mr. Han, at four this afternoon,

312
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,910
Xingchen will hold

313
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,440
its first official meeting of the year.

314
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,390
Do you have time to attend it?

315
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,600
It depends.

316
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,460
(Han Ting)

317
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,840
Li, be seated.

318
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,450
Thanks.

319
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,720
Hi, Mr. Su.

320
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,320
- Miss Ji.
- Miss Ji.

321
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,240
Miss Ji, everybody is here.

322
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,510
OK. Let's get started.

323
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,120
This has...

324
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,870
This is...

325
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,670
So handsome.

326
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,080
This has been the first meeting

327
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,390
we've had since we moved

328
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,030
to Dongyang Building.

329
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,360
We're going to discuss

330
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,080
Xingchen's future strategy

331
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,120
and detailed work arrangements.

332
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,870
Any ideas?

333
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,120
Miss Ji, the parameters

335
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,750
have been perfect.

336
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,630
So, I wonder if we should

337
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,870
expand into new directions.

338
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,200
I have some ideas.

378
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,750
Hope we can be

379
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,720
comrades-in-arms at work

380
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,790
who completely trust each other.

381
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,790
In daily life,

382
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,960
hope we can communicate

383
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,320
like friends.

384
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,510
Let's work hard together

385
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,560
for our future.

386
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,670
OK. So much for the meeting. Dismissed.

387
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,710
Weiwei,

388
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,360
who is that man?

389
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,000
Our investor,

390
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,270
Mr. Han Ting,

391
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,270
CEO of Dongyang Medical.

392
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,240
Seriously?

393
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,600
The big boss came personally

394
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
for our meeting.

395
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,840
He thinks so highly of us.

396
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,230
Miss Ji,

397
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,030
don't you invite me to your office?

398
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,200
This way, please.

399
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,120
Come in, Mr. Han.

400
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,720
Mr. Han, you've never attended

401
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,120
a meeting of a startup company, huh?

402
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,550
Just the opposite. I've witnessed a lot.

403
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,550
Then do you have any advice

404
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,030
for our meeting?

405
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,080
Sell dreams, build dreams,

406
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,150
and paint a rosy picture
with sympathy and dream

407
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,600
to drive its employees to work hard.

408
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,510
Most startup companies

409
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,680
are doing this.

410
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,120
I didn't paint a rosy picture.

411
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,360
We're different from those companies

412
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,270
that sell dreams and emotions.

413
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,960
What's the difference?

414
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,840
We have real dreams.

415
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,150
And for my employees,

416
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,030
I really hope

417
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,910
they can get along like friends.

418
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,390
My company will

419
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,630
offer them

420
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,870
a free and open

421
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,440
work environment and platform.

422
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,870
They can develop

423
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,310
and grow together.

424
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,480
Even if one day,

425
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,920
someone leaves my company,

426
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,310
I still want Xingchen

427
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,920
to be where they have improved.

428
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,350
Don't stare at me like this.

429
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,480
We're indeed different.

430
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,640
In the future,

431
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,880
we will achieve something great.

432
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,240
You really have

433
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,750
way too much confidence.

434
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,750
In Qingtian Fishing Village, who reminded me

435
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,790
to always remember my dream
and original purpose?

436
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,960
Yes. It's a good thing to have a dream.

437
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,440
But realizing the dream

438
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,440
is another thing.

439
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,440
To start and manage a company,
you need to be practical

440
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,160
instead of convincing your employees

441
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,000
with mere sympathy.

442
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,550
Whoever joins a startup company

443
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
has no shortage of dreams.

444
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,280
As the boss,

445
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,270
you should get them down to earth.

446
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,440
Make them work steadily

447
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,400
works better than chanting.

448
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,270
When the experiment proposal is done,

449
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,800
report it to me.

450
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,680
Thank you, Mr. Han, for your support.

451
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,720
Otherwise,

452
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,750
Hanhai wouldn't have gone this far.

453
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,590
I owe you this

454
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,350
and I'll always keep it in mind.

455
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,350
I just did what an investor

456
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,440
should do.

457
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,640
Hanhai has gone this far

458
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,920
because you're capable, Mr. Chen.

459
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,960
But Mr. Han,

460
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,830
is Luo Ping reliable?

461
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,070
After all, he just joined Dongyang Medical.

462
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
If he knows

463
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,920
you're the investor of Hanhai,

464
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,760
will he...?

465
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,030
Don't worry about this.

466
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,270
Before we employed Luo Ping,

467
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,830
I had fully investigated him.

468
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,160
I'll be relieved, then.

469
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,560
Mr. Han.

470
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,640
Let me introduce you.

471
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,680
This is Mr. Chen Ningyang,

472
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,160
CEO of Hanhai Technology.

473
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,750
This is Luo Ping,
product director of Dongyang Medical.

474
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,310
Nice to meet you, Mr. Chen.

475
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,240
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Luo.

476
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,080
Take your seat.

477
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,080
After you.

478
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,270
I'll get straight to the point.

479
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,750
Next, Dongyang Medical

480
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,070
will strengthen its main product line.

481
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,510
We need technical support from Hanhai.

482
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,880
You two can communicate more.

483
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,920
However,

484
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,160
keep it very secret.

485
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,950
- Got it.
- Got it.

486
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,950
To be honest, Mr. Han,

487
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,240
you kept saying

488
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,640
we would combine software and hardware

489
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,070
and start 3D medical printing.

490
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,790
I used to think

491
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,920
we would cooperate with Xingchen Technology.

492
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,880
I worried that we had to wait for too long.

493
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,480
Unexpectedly, we can work with Hanhai,

494
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,720
such a big company.

495
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,070
Now, my confidence is rising.

496
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,720
You flatter us, Mr. Luo.

497
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,550
Hanhai just started a few years

498
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,310
earlier than Xingchen.

499
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,240
Mr. Han invested in Xingchen

500
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,510
and this company must have

501
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,510
something remarkable.

502
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,240
Based on Dongyang Medical's resources,

503
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
Xingchen will soon develop.

504
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,830
By then, they'll work with us

505
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,480
to support Dongyang Medical.

506
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,830
That's right.

507
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,160
I trust Mr. Han's taste.

508
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,640
I believe in Miss Ji's capability, too.

509
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,350
Cheers.

510
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,680
What?

511
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,440
In a bad mood?

512
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,080
No.

513
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,440
Why would I be in a bad mood for your date?

514
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,030
What would you like to drink?

515
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,920
Whiskey, please.

516
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,800
OK.

517
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,030
What do you want me for?

518
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,640
Must I ask you out for something?

519
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,350
Why do you suddenly give me a gift?

520
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,400
I heard

521
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,270
your parents have gone abroad on a vacation

522
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,310
with your grandfather.

523
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,110
If I knew you would
spend the festival alone in Xinggang,

524
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,680
I wouldn't have gone to another city.

525
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,960
I'd have stayed here to keep you company.

526
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,640
It's a belated New Year's gift.

527
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,030
It looks good on you.

528
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,070
Be straightforward.

529
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,830
What do you want from me?

530
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,070
I heard Han Ting invested in a new company.

531
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,830
Before they achieve anything,

532
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,270
they've moved to Dongyang Building.

533
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,480
What's that girl's name?

534
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,480
Ji Xing?

535
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,480
You've really been focusing

536
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,880
on whatever Han Ting does.

537
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,480
I don't focus on Han Ting.

538
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,310
I focus on you.

539
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,960
Now, Xingchen is above your company.

540
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,030
They're obviously competing.

541
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,200
Guanghua and Xingchen

542
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,240
do different businesses.

543
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,350
What do you mean, "competing"?

544
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,110
Competing isn't only about business,

545
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,680
but also about love.

546
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,270
Anyway, she used to be your employee.

547
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,200
Now, Han Ting has invested in her.

548
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,920
Your companies are so close.

549
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,440
When she keeps wandering around,

550
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,240
you'll certainly get upset.

551
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,270
She's just a former employee.

552
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,110
I won't bother.

553
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,160
And you stop worrying about me.

554
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,510
Recently, Han Ting

555
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,780
has been reforming Dongyang Medical

556
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,830
with plenty of changes.

557
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,310
It puts such strains on your company, huh?

558
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,960
That's why I need you and Guanghua.

559
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,680
Mr. Chang, I can't accept it for doing nothing.

560
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,630
I...

561
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,870
Di,

562
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,680
timing is important

563
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,480
for business and love.

564
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,750
I'm patient enough to wait.

565

682

this is such a pretty bag.

683
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,720
Miss Li, a friend of mine told me

684
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,270
this bag had been sold out.

685
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,200
It's not available in Xinggang for the moment.

686
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,510
It's so popular?

687
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,790
Of course.

688
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,350
This brand doesn't have an online store.

689
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,160

690

691
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,000

692
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
distinguish the bags?

693
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,440

694
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,590
Li Li,

695
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,640
did your boyfriend buy you this bag?

696
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,680
I'm sure he loves you pretty much.

697
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,270
He spent so much money on you.

698
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,960
You're such a happy girl.

699
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,800
OK. No more talking.

700
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,790

705
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,110

706
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,310
Wear glasses properly,

707
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,150
or take them off.

708
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,960
You know nothing.

709
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,790
You're young but so old-fashioned.

710
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,070
This is fashion.

711
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,720
By the way,

712
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,350
I've got the supply channels.

713
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,960
For wine lists and menus alone,

714
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,170
(Cocktail)
I designed three editions.

715
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,270
Every festival, big or small,

716
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,590
there will be special activities.

717
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,070
I often visit bars.

718
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,390
I'm very familiar.

719
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,030
(Proposal of Tell Mother)

720
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,550
Tell Mother.

721
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,550
What are you going to tell her?

722
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,160
It's the name of the bar,

723
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,000
you old-fashioned...

724
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,070
You cool guy.

725
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,680
You know what?

726
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,000
This bar will be a hit.

727
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,350
It has a good location

728
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,440
and a perfect size.

729
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,030
I took you there, remember?

730
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,400
Where Ji Xing got drunk.

731
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,920
The positioning isn't clear.

732
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,400
The mode is too average.

733
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,350
It's not different from other bars.

734
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,880
Within 200 meters of that street,

735
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,590
there are at least five or six bars.

736
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,880
Why will people visit yours?

737
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,400
Your proposal has no highlight.

738
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,790
Even if I want to advertise,

739
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,200
I don't know where to start.

740
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,590

742
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,070
Ji Xing is right.

743
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,160
You're a capitalist

744

746
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,110
- Taste it.
- OK.

747
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,400
I had this tea

748
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,510
brought back from Hangzhou.

749
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,840
OK.

Not at all.

752
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,510
But I wonder

753
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,310
if I will offend Mr. Han.

754
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,160
After, he's the investor

755
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,550
of Xingchen.

756
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,310
It's not that you won't
give them the raw materials.

757
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,000
You'll just do it late.

758
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,400
Besides,

759
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,480
a lot of companies have placed orders.

760
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,350
First come, first served, right?

761
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,680
Oh, Mr. Ma,

762
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,200
my grandpa said

763
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,310
he would invite you to dine at our house.

764
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,880
If Dean Zeng needs me,

765
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,070
call me at any time.

766
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,920
OK. No problem.

767
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,240
I'll make an appointment with you.

768
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
OK.

769
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,150
Sorry,

770
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,400
the subscriber you dialed

771
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,030
cannot be connected.

772
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,280
Please redial later.

773
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,960
Mr. Ma still doesn't answer.

774
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,670
Han Ting is right.

775
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,880
Dining with them a million times

776
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,720
won't help.

777
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,510
Come on. Don't think too much.

778
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,000
I'll think of another way.

779
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,000
I'll keep contacting Mr. Ma.

780
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,760
In the worst case,
I'll visit him in his company.

781
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,670
I'm going now.

782
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,000
The roast meat is ready. Enjoy it.

783
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,840
Thanks.

784
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
Now, our progress is stuck in raw materials.

785
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,710
Qiuzi, I hear your institute

786
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,550
is very close to Kebo Material.

787
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,590
Mr. Ma came from your institute, too.

788
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,070
Tell me about him

789
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,590
and I'll see what I can do.

790
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,680
Mr. Ma?

791
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,320
He used to do academic work.

792
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,280
He's a simple man

793
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,920
and he's straightforward.

794
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,430
Oh.

795
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,000
He's crazy about wine, I think.

796
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,960
When he's available,

797
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,320
he often visits Dean Zeng

798
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,190
and drinks with him.

799
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,670
But you know.

800
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,550
New employees like us

801
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,920
can barely talk

802
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,230
to a big shot like him.

803
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,710
If I have a second choice,
I don't like to see him.

804
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,480
The point is, we don't need
a lot of raw materials

805
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,400
for the first batch,

806
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,480
but we need many types.

807
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,590
Only Kebo Material can offer them.

808
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,670
We can't even find a Plan B.

809
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,950
It's OK.

810
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,590
I'll see what I can do.

811
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,550
Xing...

812
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,710
Will she not help?

813
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,800
Now, there are a multitude of things to handle.

814
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,110
She doesn't have time.

815
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,400
I'll take care of this.

816
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,360
How's she doing lately?

817
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,710
She broke up with Yichen

818
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,110
a long time ago.

819
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,360
Is she still single?

820
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,320
She has no time for a relationship.

821
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,760
Someone's pursuing her, though.

822
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,360
Who's pursuing her?

823
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,670
Come on. Let's not gossip now.

824
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,070
That doesn't matter.

825
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,150
Career matters most for a woman.

826
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,710
You just said Mr. Ma was crazy about wine.

827
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,760
What's his favorite wine?

828
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,360
Hi, Mr. Ma.

829
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,320
Miss Li.

830
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,190
Mr. Ma is really stubborn.

831
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,070
I wasted several bottles of good wine.

832
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,030
Where's he now?

833
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,510
Vomiting on the toilet.

834
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,320
I'll think of another way.

835
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,990
Bye.

836
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,440
What happened?

837
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,320
You're so anxious.

838
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,360
We have to wait a very long time

839
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,710
for the raw materials.

840
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,150
We don't have that much time.

841
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,320
Just now, I visited Mr. Ma of Kebo Material.

842
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,110
But he would not help.

843
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,710
Come on. Work never ends.

844
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,760
Don't let my problem

845
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,110
upset you.

846
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,360
Where do you work now?

847
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,670
Xingchen. Xingchen Technology.

848
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,510
No wonder you often get off

849
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,840
at Dongyang Building.

850
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,710
So, you've joined Xingchen.

851
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,150
You've heard about my company?

852
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,240
A little bit.

853
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,070
- Well...
- Didn't enjoy the lunch, huh?

854
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,150
What would you like to eat?

855
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,550
You pick the food and I'll pick the canteen.

856
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,600
Spicy food.

857
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,710
The spicier, the better.

858
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,640
Let's go.

859
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,320
My bar will be profitable.

860
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,150
Why do I have to make a proposal?

861
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,070
I'm not a writer.

862
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,550
Why do I have to type this much?

863
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,640
Done.

864
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,710
Hello, sweethearts.

865
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,280
This is Smart Lemon.

866
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,360
Today, let me show you around a cafe.

867
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,800
This is the fancy cafe

868
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,960
my best friends and I often visit.

869
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,760
Let's immerse ourselves here.

870
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,940
Shh.

871
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,110
The moment I step in, I smell

872
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,960
strong coffee.

873
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,920
Look, so many plants here.

874
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,590
How refreshing!

875
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,550
Here.

876
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,800
The spots of my best friends and me

877
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,360
with an ocean view.

878
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,070
OK. Let me reverse the camera.

879
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,960
I can't wait

880
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,360
to order a cup of coffee.

881
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,400
This chair

882
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,800
is very big, soft, and comfortable.

883
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,510
If any of you want to work here

884
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,800
for a long time,

885
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,670
this seat will be

886
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,710
your best choice.

887
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,880
I've put a link of the address

888
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,710
below the video.

889
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,550
Thanks.

890
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,510
Thanks for the gift from Mr. Lu.

891
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,190
Thank you, sweethearts, for your follow.

892
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,000
(Mr. Lu is a fan now.)
Let me see.

893
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,030
(Smart Lemon won't lose!)
Mr. Lu commented,

894
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,590
"Now, young people

895
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,150
love to go to bars.

896
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,760
Few of them visit a cafe."

897
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,280
Anyway,

898
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,760
we're visiting a cafe.

899
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,070
Yeah. So, we'd better

900
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,360
talk about the coffee thing.

901
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,440
Please.

902
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,780
(Bar Proposal)

903
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,670
Please.

904
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,590
Well, I thought about it.

905
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,510
I think Mr. Lu has brought up

906
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,670
a good proposition.

907
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,320
If any of you have an idea

908
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,590
about the bar thing,

909
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,280
comment on the screen.

910
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,150
We can prepare

911
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,920
for a bar visit, huh?

912
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,880
(Many cool guys are in the bar.)
"I love a place with many young guys."

913
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,070
"Cool guys and pretty girls." That's right.

914
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,150
Looks like you have good ideas

915
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,550
about the bar thing.

916
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,630
OK. Later, I will plan

917
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,670
a visit to the bar.

918
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,880
Mr. Lu asked again,

919
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:00,070
"Smart Lemon, what kind of bar do you prefer?"

920
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,670
I personally think

921
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,920
a livehouse is good.

922
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,590
Singers sing on the stage

923
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,510
while the guests

924
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,110
can drink and chat off the stage.

925
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,280
It won't be too noisy.

926
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,190
And because I'm a live streamer,

927
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,670
I think it will be

928
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,510
a good idea

929
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,030
to have a big screen in the bar

930
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,920
where the guests

931
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,920
can express their emotions

932
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,400
and feelings

933
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,880
through bullet comments.

934
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,110
This idea

935
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,320
may be fun.

936
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,190
Thanks.

937
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,510
Thanks for Mr. Lu's big gift.

938
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,670
Thank you.

939
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,800
All right, sweethearts.

940
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,320
Follow me and give me a like.

941
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,590
Then you'll find me next time.

942
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,020
(You're welcome! The name of the bar?)

943
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,550
Today, I'm visiting a cafe, huh?

944
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,360
I can't wait to order a cup of coffee.

945
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,360
I'll go.

946
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,280
I feel so relaxed.

947
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,480
Let's come and see

948
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,360
how coffee is made.

949
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,260
(Bar proposal. You're welcome! Name of the bar?
Sour-Sweet Livehouse)

950
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,590
(Mr. Ma)
Miss Li, I have

951
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,230
moved up the material delivery for Xingchen.

952
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,360
Within one month, it'll be sent to you.

953
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,550
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

954
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,110
I'll invite you to dinner someday.

955
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:37,700
(Xiao Yixiao)

956
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,630
You're just in time.

957
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,840
The problem is solved.

958
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,160
That's good.

959
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,000
You helped me, right?

960
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,030
A friend of mine knew Mr. Ma

961
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,630
and I asked him to set us up.

962
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,030
Didn't I tell you?

963
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,670
I don't need you

964
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,030
