I love gazing at the stars.

56
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,280
When I first came to this city,

57
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,710
I was stressed out.

58
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,120
I felt confused and lonely.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But every time I looked up at the stars,

60
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,280
I would feel

61
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,270
very relaxed.

62
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,310
It was romantic, too.

63
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,950
At that moment, I thought

64
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,870
it gave me the right to dream.

65
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,720
What's more romantic is...

66
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,070

to eliminate negative effects.

191
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,360
When a nail

192
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,480
is nailed into a board,

193
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,750
even if the best carpenter

194
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,080
can pull it out,

195
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,000
do you think

196
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,510
there will leave no trace?

197
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,000
Grandpa, you have a point.

198
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,510
I believe Ji Xing

199
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,910
will manage to prepare for the worst.

200
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,550
She wasn't aware.

201
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,670
If Zeng Di makes trouble again,

202
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,510
Ji Xing will respond better.

203
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,120
Di?

204
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,550
What does it have to do with her?

205
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,790
It's Zeng Di

206
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,120
who instigated Zhang Fengmei's husband.

207
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,080
I watched this girl

208
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,550
grow up.

209
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,000
Don't drink that much.

210
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,600
You nearly finish this bottle all alone.

211
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,550
People come to a bar

212
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,790
to drink, don't they?

213
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,840
The first time I met you, you were

214
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,200
just back from Germany
to start a company.

215
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,240
We met at a party, right?

216
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,320
At that time, you were glowing.

217
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,320
In the crowd,

218
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,510
I saw you at first sight.

219
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,440
Since Han Ting came back,

220
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,960
you've been more and more depressed.

221
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
I'd like to ask you.

222
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,390
What more does it have to take

223
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,600
before you turn back?

224
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,630
Since I'm already crashed,

225
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,510
there's no point in turning back.

226
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,420
I'm going to the restroom.

227
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,320
Mr. Chang,

228
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,030
(Zhu Houyu)
Dongyang Medical's new offer

229
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,910
isn't very low.

230
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,160
Raise your last offer a little bit.

231
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,670
Tomorrow, let's meet.

232
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,560
(Li Li)
OK.

233
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,720
(Ji Xing)
Li, did you watch Xiaomeng's new video?

234
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,790
What "whitewashing"?

235
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,510
I'm telling the truth.

236
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,870
Before the result comes out,

237
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,480
why is Xingchen Technology to blame?

238
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,270
And since the clinic test,

239
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,390
nothing has been wrong

240
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,750
with Xingchen's products.

241
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,600
When you don't know exactly,

242
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,120
why can you accuse Xingchen of being evil?

243
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,960
(Li Li)
Why is everybody commenting to curse her?

244
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,320
(Ji Xing)
For Zhang Fengmei, I guess.

245
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,390
(Li Li)
I'll be right there.

246
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,000
This drink tastes really good.

247
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,150
What are you doing?

248
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,910
Why do you stare at me like this?

249
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,990
Xiaomeng,

250
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,510
these days,

251
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,440
don't read the comments.

252
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,630
Their curses

253
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,120
don't bother me at all.

254
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,960
Do you think a pretty girl like me

255
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,910
will be beaten by the trolls?

256
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,510
I'm sorry, Xiaomeng.

257
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,160
Because you defended Xingchen, you...

258
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,960
Don't get sappy on me.

259
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,870
My best friends are slandered.

260
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,120
If I didn't stand out,

261
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,720
I wouldn't be what I always was.

262
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Besides, that case is over.

263
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
These guys are still

264
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,360
parroting what others say.

265
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,550
The Internet has truth mixed with fiction.

266
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,510
I'll pretend

267
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,910
they're increasing my popularity.

268
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,120
When I get popular,

269
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,840
I'll have a new account for live streaming.

270
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,240
I'll piss them off.

271
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,000
All right.

272
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,390
Don't worry about me.

273
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,320
Come on.

274
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,200
It's OK.

275
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,910
So cramped.

276
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,120
Don't worry.

277
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,150
Glad you're fine.

278
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,040
You're the brave Sailor Moon, right?

279
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,030
It's so great to have you.

280
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,160
You had spicy sticks.

281
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,200
Come on, Li Li.

282
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,000
Whatever it is,

283
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,550
I'll stick to the two of you

284
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,960
for the rest of my life.

285
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,030
With best friends like you,

286
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,240
I'll wish for nothing else.

287
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,320
Yichen,

288
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,200
we want to apply for the Pioneer Project.

289
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,910
Do you think we stand a chance?

290
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,150
Xingchen's skeleton project

291
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,000
has a very high success rate

292
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,030
among all the clinical tests

293
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,000
of our hospital.

294
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,390
Well, I'll introduce you to my colleagues

295
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,750
who know about the project.

296
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,600
We can have lunch together tomorrow.

297
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,110
That's great.

298
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,200
Thank you.

299
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,230
You're welcome.

300
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,510
So romantic.

301
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,870
I'm in a good mood today.

302
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,840
Why?

303
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,960
I saw on the news

304
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,910
that Xingchen finally got through.

305
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,990
Come on.

306
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,320
Let's celebrate.

307
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,160
Cheers.

308
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,200
You're quite happy today.

309
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,910
Of course. Xing is my best friend.

310
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,790
I truly feel happy for her.

311
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,150
But...

312
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,870
When the three of them celebrate,

313
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,720
I can't join them.

314
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,550
Maybe she and I

315
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,510
won't communicate too much anymore.

316
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,160
Qiuzi,

317
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,360
do you

318
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,080
have any regrets?

319
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,720
Since you became my girlfriend,

320
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,680
you and Ji Xing,

321
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,240
and other best friends

322
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,310
have drifted apart.

323
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,200
Since you're my choice,

324
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,640
I will never regret it.

325
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,870
Qiuzi.

326
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,920

It's been cold.

336
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,070
Wear more when you go out.

337
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,920
Brother, taste this.

338
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
I dried the tea myself.

339
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,440
Don't be burned.

340
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,110
What on earth is this?

341
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,350
You taste it yourself.

342
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,400
It tastes good.

343
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,590
You just never

344
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,960
accept fresh things.

345
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,270
I'll put the tea here.

346
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,480
Don't dump it.

347
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,000
You don't like it,

348
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,070
but I'll leave it to your grandchildren,

349
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,000
the young guys.

350
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,070
You're one day late.

351
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,830
Ting came yesterday.

352
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,630
He did?

353
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,160
Not a long time ago.

354
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,400
Come on. Ting is so busy.

355
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,440
What was the occasion

356
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,750
did he have to come for?

357
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,070
Just the volunteer's case

358
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,750
that spreads all over the city.

359
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,590
Oh, that.

360
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,480
That was cleared up, wasn't it?

361
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,160
I watched many clarification videos.

362
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,550
Speaking of this,

363
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,920
that volunteer

364
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,760
is really pitiful.

365
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,750
How will she and her daughter live?

366
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,270
She has such a terrible husband.

367
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,350
Just a monster.

368
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,160
She's in poor health, too.

369
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,480
Her daughter is little.

370
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,550
Brother, shall we...?

371
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,160
Come on. Don't bother.

372
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,920
Xingchen Technology

373
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
will arrange for her

374
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,350
a second surgery

375
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,590
and fund her until she recovers.

376
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,550
You don't need to worry, OK?

377
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,440
I didn't know that. Why couldn't I ask?

378
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,960
If it's true,

379
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,070
that's great.

380
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,480
Brother,

381
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,790
this idea

382
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,960
- is from the girl of Xingchen, huh?
- Wait.

383
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,830
She's so kind-hearted.

384
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,790
You don't even know her name.

385
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,350
Ji Xing.

386
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,350
Oh, Ji Xing.

387
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,400
I told you.

388
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,000
Ji Xing is kind-hearted and thoughtful.

389
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,240
Am I right, Brother?

390
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,790
Come on, Brother. I beg you.

391
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,320
You don't actually hate Miss Ji Xing, do you?

392
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,550
This girl

393
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,830
thinks big.

394
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,790
But how far

395
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,310
she can finally go

396
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,550
remains to be seen.

397
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,200
Brother, I really admire you.

398
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,480
People like us

399
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,270
have only organs in our bodies.

400
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,630
But Brother,

401
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,590
you have a whole lot of schemes.

402
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,400
Stop talking, will you?

403
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,640
Just eat and drink.

404
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,160
This one is good.

405
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
How awful does it taste?

406
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,550
You're just picky.

407
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,070
All the time,

408
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,960
I don't know much about you.

409
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,160
You and I

410
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,160
appear to be intimate.

411
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,400
But it's just fake.

412
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,750
Think carefully about it.

413
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,750
There seems to be glass between us.

414
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,030
All the while,

415
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,270
I've never got into your heart.

416
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,000
I used to think

417
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,640
a couple could stay together

418
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,480
just for fun.

419
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,270
Since you want to know about me,

420
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,640
I'll tell you everything.

421
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,960
I had meant to tell you last time.

422
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,790
But that day, something happened

423
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,790
to your company.

424
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,640
So, I didn't bring it up.

425
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,080
Li Li,

426
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,240
I was married.

427
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,030
My wife Wang Tian

428
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,440
died in childbirth five years ago.

429
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,350
We have a daughter Beibei.

430
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,040
Usually,

431
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,550
my mother raises her for me.

432
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,550
Now, you know everything.

433
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,670
Will you stay

434
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,080
or will you leave?

435
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,070
I respect your decision.

436
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,240
I've ordered the food.

437
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,720
Do you want something else?

438
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,320
I won't eat.

439
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,350
What is it?

440
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,560
Thanks.

441
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,640
How sure are you to acquire

442
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,920
Zhu's Medical Instrument?

443
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,960
Mind your own business.

444
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,200
According to your plan,

445
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,310
to increase the stock price,

446
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,590
acquiring Zhu's

447
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,960
is a very necessary step.

448
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,400
Chang He is also contacting Zhu Houyu.

449
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,880
If you fail to acquire it,

450
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,480
you won't rely on Xingchen

451
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,920
to increase the stock price, will you?

452
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,070
Based on the development speed

453
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,510
of Xingchen Technology,

454
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,270
it can't be your backbone.

455
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,480
Anything else?

456
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,270
You don't care about Tongke at all?

457
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,070
Whatever it does,

458
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,550
you shouldn't tell me about it.

459
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,960
Han Ting,

460
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,270
I'm trying to help you.

461
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,590
I had the Investment Department

462
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,480
email you the share transfer agreement.

463
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,960
Reply as soon as you can.

464
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,590
Are you sure you'll push me away now?

465
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,200
If Guanghua leaves Dongyang,

466
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,480
it will join Tongke immediately.

467
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,270
Is that what you want?

468
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,200
Guanghua is yours.

469
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,680
It's your own business.

470
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,160
I always think you're a reasonable guy.

471
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,510
I didn't know you could also be so impulsive.

472
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,480
If you strengthen your rival,

473
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,310
won't you be worried?

474
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,590
If I was really impulsive,

475
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,830
as early as you and Chang He

476
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,790
had secret dealings,

477
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,920
I would have done something.

478
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,110
Chang He is nice to you.

479
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,830
Get along with him.

480
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,880
Don't sell the news anymore.

481
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,430
It's not good for you.

482
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,950
Han Ting.

483
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,110
Has Ji Xing ever seen

484
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,510
how resolute you can be?

485
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Director Xu, see you.

486
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,960
- See you, Director Xu. Thanks.
- Bye.

487
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,800
Bye-bye.

488
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,200
You're so drunk.

489
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,240
I called a designated driver.

490
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,190
Let me send you home.

491
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,000
No. No need.

492
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:04,960
- Be careful.
- I'm OK.

493
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,800
I'll drive you.

494
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,750
What a coincidence, Mr. Han!

495
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,070
Just now, we had lunch

496
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,310
with my colleagues.

497
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,030
Miss Ji wanted to know

498
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,110
about the Pioneer Project.

499
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,840
I have things to do.

500
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,950
Mr. Han,

501
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:20,950
please drive her home.

502
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,190
I should go.

503
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,520
See you.

504
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,920
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

505
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,030
Thank you, Yichen.

506
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,870
Don't worry.

507
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,000
Bye-bye.

508
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,590
You asked Shao Yichen

509
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,480
to help you apply for the Pioneer Project?

510
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,550
He helped me a lot.

511
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,110
Then you still drank this much?

512
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,500
I wanted to drink.

513
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,070
You wanted?

514
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,550
Could you please stop

515
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,750
asking questions?

516
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,960
You were eating with Zeng Di in there.

517
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,920
Did I ask?

518
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,270
Fine. Get in the car.

519
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,680
I'm going back to my own place.

520
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,750
You also have to get in.

521
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:14,950
Come on.

522
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,510
Get in.

523
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,680
I'll take a taxi.

524
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,670
Go away.

525
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,590
Go.

526
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,560
Boss,

527
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,510
how about you...?

528
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,480
Miss Ji, I'm driving you home.

529
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,280
Thanks.

530
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,280
Stop drinking.

531
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,590
I'll drive you home.

532
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,750
I'm not going home.

533
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,960
Even if you drink yourself to death,

534
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,550
will Han Ting care a little bit?

535
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,590
Do you know how long I've loved him?

536
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,670
I...

537
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,400
I went to Germany

538
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,750
to study together with him.

539
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,270
I started a company

540
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,200
in the industry of his interest.

541
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,960
For him, I...

542
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,000
But he never cares.

543
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,160
You're a businesswoman.

544
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,480
You should know

545
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,000
how high the opportunity costs

546
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,030
to follow Han Ting.

547
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,310
Good advice is annoying.

548
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,480
But I'm saying it for your own good.

549
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,790
For my own good?

550
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,790
The information of Zhu's Medical Instrument...

551
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,000
You deliberately let me see it, huh?

552
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,910
Yes.

553
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,030
And Zhang Fengmei's case...

554
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,400
I revealed it to the media.

555
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,960
You call this "for my own good"?

556
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,550
You're making use of me.

557
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,790
So, Han Ting and I

558
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,550
have finally ended up like this.

559
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,550
How you and Han Ting have ended up

560
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,720
has nothing to do with anyone else.

561
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,750
Stop being so obsessive, will you?

562
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,200
Han Ting only cares about Ji Xing.

563
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,110
Let's go.

564
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,430
You're so drunk.

565
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,400
I'll drive you home.

566
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,160
I don't accept this.

567
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,160
Unless I take revenge,

568
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,680
I won't let it go.

569
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,560
OK.

570
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,720
I'll help you.

571
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,510
Mason is the most famous doctor

572
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,160
among Cetiosaurus.

573
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,480
He has great medical skills.

574
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,590
He's best at treating

575
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,440
the most problematic two parts

576
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,550
of Cetiosaurus,

577
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,830
neck and...

578
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,880
(Li Li)
Tomorrow, I want to see Beibei.

579
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,800
May I?

580
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,960
(Xiao Yixiao)
OK.

581
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,180
(It's been cold. Wear more when you go out.)

582
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,020
(Xinggang Wangxin Mansion G37 lies...)

583
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,900
(Cartoony Fairyland)

584
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,760
- Be careful, Beibei.
- Careful.

585
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,000
Dad and Miss Li Li,

586
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,550
you can't get in for fun.

587
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,630
These are for you.

588
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,710
You each take one.

589
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,230
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Beibei.

590
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,320
Go have fun.

591
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,360
Such a good girl.

592
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,480
Be careful.

593
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,440
Beibei likes you.

594
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,000
What about you?

595
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,150
How much do you like me?

596
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,190
I have a strong sense of boundary.

597
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,070
Before, I never had any of my dates

598
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,480
know about my family privacy.

599
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,840
But you're different.

600
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
I can open up

601
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,840
my private life to you,

602
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,760
just like what we're doing now.

603
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,900
I got the ball.

604
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,150
I like Beibei, too.

605
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,120
Just now,

606
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,400
there was even a moment when I thought

607
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,840
a family of three

608
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,190
would also be good.

609
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,510
The transformation of any relationship

610
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,280
has to go through the agony of collaboration.

611
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
I don't want Beibei
to experience this so unexpectedly.

612
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Hope you can give me

613
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,840
some more time.

614
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,120
Beibei.

615
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Here, Xiaomeng.

616
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,870
Have some soup.

617
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,550
Calm your nerves.

618
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
Thanks, Ms. Han.

619
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,110
Linjia told me

620
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,960
you were bullied.

621
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,870
Who did that?

622
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,150
What kind of evil guys

623
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,150
would bully such a lovely girl?

624
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,960
I'm OK, Ms. Han.

625
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,190
Just a little problem.

626
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,960
It can't be.

627
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,110
Look, you have red eyes with weeping,

628
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,190
just like a rabbit.

629
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,390
I...

630
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,760
I invented

631
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,230
this makeup of rich girls.

632
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,960
Don't try to be strong in front of me.

633
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,800
Whatever happens,

634
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,840
you must have meals regularly.

635
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,550
Health matters most.

636
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,360
There's a good saying.

637
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,710
"Never mind anything."

638
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,190
Ms. Han, I'm fine.

639
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,630
All right. You're fine.

640
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,030
Have some more soup, will you?

641
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,550
OK. No problem.

642
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,800
Mom.

643
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,760
This soup tastes really good.

644
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,150
How long

645
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,880
have you stewed it?

646
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,030
How long?

647
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:23,910
Oh, no.

648
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,550
I'll be late.

649
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,280
My best friends invited me to play mahjong.

650
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,150
I'm the fourth player.

651
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:31,630
I can't be late.

652
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,000
I won't eat with you.

653
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,880
Linjia, eat with Miss Xiaomeng.

654
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,320
After that, take a walk with her.

655
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,480
- OK.
- I have to go.

656
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,960
Be careful, Ms. Han.

657
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,880
- Enjoy the meal.
- OK.

658
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,440
- I have to go.
- Bye-bye.

659
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,880
- Bye-bye, Ms. Han.
- Bye-bye.

660
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,360
Here. Have some of this.

661
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,840
Black caviar salad.

662
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:01,950
Taste it.

663
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,800
Black caviar?

664
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,600
Do you mean trolls?

665
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,400
Such a perfect metaphor.

666
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,070
All right. Don't eat it.

667
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,630
Have something else. How about...?

668
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,590
Scallop with vermicelli. Here.

669
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,350
Is it OK?

670
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,720
Fans?
[*Vermicelli in Chinese]

671
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
So, you want me to have more fans, huh?

672
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,110
Don't eat this, either.

673
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,000
That's not what I mean.

674
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,230
Don't say that. I...

675
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,800
Don't be so sensitive, OK?

676
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,710
I want you to eat more.

677
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,630
Just kidding.

678
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,280
Don't take it seriously.

679
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,000
When I saw you

680
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,800
remain overcautious,

681
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,630
I wanted to tease you.

682
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,590
I'm OK, seriously.

683
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,630
I'm rather strong.

684
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,510
Don't underestimate me.

685
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,350
I'm serious.

686
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,190
Speaking of this...

687
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,670
A little bit.

688
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,360
It has made me

689
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,630
this little bit sad.

690
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,510
Really?

691
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,680
Fine.

692
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,880
I'll be relieved, then.

693
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,030
Smart Lemon.

694
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,550
You can still joke under such circumstances.

695
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,280
You're really amazing.

696
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,480
In life,

697
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,150
everyone rises,

698
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,440
falls, and always falls.

699
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,590
Laughing all the time makes life a lot easier.

700
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,470
That's right.

701
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,190
Let's just deal with trouble.

702
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,800
Come on, Smart Lemon.

703
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,000

I haven't made up my mind.

708
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,320
I can go on to sing.

709
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,670
I can also teach others to dance.

710
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,360
You can even dance?

711
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,150
Of course. You don't believe it?

712
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,150
I'm professional, OK?

713
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,040

728
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,510

00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,880

00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,920
Oh, here it is.

00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,960
Son, don't go too far.

732
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,000
Put her down.

733
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,190
Look how tired she is.

734
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,880
Oh, the messages.

735
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,400

(It's been cold. Wear more when you go out.)

739
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,030
Come on. He hasn't texted me

740
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,400
or called me at all.

741
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,510
How could he do so?

742
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,030
Doesn't he know I'm angry?

743
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,960
When you have a girlfriend,

744
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,320
you must not behave like this.

745
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,880
Or she will be sad

746
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,110

00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,710
