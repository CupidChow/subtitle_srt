1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll be lost in the dark.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to the sky, I want to go to the earth.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I have no hesitation in the future.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid I'll have no fear in the future.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I have no courage in the future.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'm going to the sky, I want to go to the earth.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I won't give up.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,100
I will always believe in the miracle

16
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:34,400
Even if I don't know who I am

17
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,400
Sister Xing, what are we going to do next?

18
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,600
Next, we will take care of our work

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,400
and prepare for the patient.

20
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,800
They will send someone to meet up.

21
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,800
As long as you are here, Xing Chen will not be disbanded.

22
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,600
Miss Ji, after the patient is healed, we will not be embarrassed by Xing Chen.

23
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,800
Chang He, I really can't tell that you are a kind of person.

24
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,600
You are going to exchange the shares of Xing Chen for Guang Hua with Han Ting for the enemy?

25
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,700
Mr. Lin, don't be so excited.

26
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,700
Love is love. Business is business.

27
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,200
Dong Yi has already controlled Han Hai.

28
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,900
Even if Tong Ke becomes Xing Chen's little shareholder,

29
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,700
he can quickly compete with Dong Yi in this field.

30
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,600
But if I become Guang Hua, I am sure

31
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,300
that I can convince the enemy to let me take over Guang Hua.

32
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,600
I will really take over Tong Ke and make it a good price.

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,700
So you betray me?

34
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,100
I just made the most meaningful choice for Tong Ke.

35
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,400
You should know that I am guilty.

36
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,100
Mr. Yuan, don't be so angry.

37
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,300
Dong Yi has already been with you.

38
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,100
You are still pushing me, my friend.

39
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,100
Next time, I will turn to Han Ting and kick you out of Dong Yang.

40
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,100
You still want to treat me as a gun?

41
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,100
I always believe that the enemy of the enemy is a friend.

42
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,700
Mr. Yuan, there will definitely be places that I will use to make Chang He.

43
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,300
Okay.

44
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,500
I will see what else you can do.

45
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,700
But I want to remind you that

46
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,100
the thing I hate most is being treated as a trade.

47
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,500
Boss, Mr. Yuan is here.

48
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,100
Han Ting, congratulations.

49
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,900
You completed the order in advance.

50
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,300
I thought that you came here to admit your mistake,

51
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,700
but not to congratulate me.

52
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,500
What do you mean?

53
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,300
You and Chang He have already been together.

54
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,300
You don't have any evidence to say such things.

55
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,100
Dong Yi is still in the secret phase of the stock market.

56
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,500
Chang He started to talk to Zhu Hou Yu.

57
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,700
He can quickly grasp Dong Yi's position.

58
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,300
And he also knows that he is a tyrant.

59
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,700
If there is someone who must have a reason to be a tyrant,

60
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,900
then it is you.

61
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,600
How come you started such a gr....

62
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,900
Tell me.

63
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,500
If I hand over this to the…!

64
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,900
How will it be?

65
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,700
I indeed艖ai심ed your skills and showing up.

66
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,300
I will not compete with the company at all.

67
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:39,460
Gather the competitors

68
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,900
and take advantage of the company's علumination.

69
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,300
is another thing.

70
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,220
I thought you had something on me.

71
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,900
But at least you're in Dongyang's interest.

72
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,380
I didn't expect you to be so ridiculous.

73
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,980
Have you forgotten

74
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,420
you're the identity of the vice president of Dongyang?

75
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,540
You've preyed on me.

76
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,020
It doesn't matter what you want to lance on.

77
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,300
Good.

78
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,900
If I do Bastille anymore,

79
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,340
you'll never object to Optimize being in Dongyang.

80
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,380
Who does that have to do with it?

81
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,740
Don't get me wrong.

82
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,060
Please don't get me wrong.

83
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,100
Everyone ispoints their pride,

84
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,420
so pitiless.

85
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,540
Young Master.

86
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,460
Young Master.

87
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,460
I can't do it.

88
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,460
And

89
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,460
I just need to exchange some benefits

90
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,460
to get the stars back

91
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,460
from your long-term partner

92
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,460
and get them back.

93
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,460
Sister,

94
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,460
I can't hold it.

95
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,460
I can't hold it.

96
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,460
In the future,

97
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,460
you still need to work with me

98
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,460
and walk with me.

99
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,460
You need to continue fighting.

100
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,460
You choose.

101
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,460
As for the share of your winter clothes,

102
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,460
give it to me as soon as possible.

103
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,460
To be honest, I admire you.

104
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,460
In order to win,

105
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,460
even the woman you love can use it.

106
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,460
It's a trap.

107
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,460
People can't do it.

108
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,460
If this matter goes on,

109
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,460
the star will still be with you

110
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,460
like no one else.

111
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,460
Unless it's not for you.

112
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,460
I'm curious.

113
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,460
Do you want it to go

114
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,460
or to stay?

115
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,460
I'm not sure.

116
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,460
I'm not sure.

117
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,460
I'm not sure.

118
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,460
I'm not sure.

119
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,460
I'm not sure.

120
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,460
I'm not sure.

121
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,460
I'm not sure.

122
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,460
I'm not sure.

123
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,460
I'm not sure.

124
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,460
I'm not sure.

125
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,460
I'm not sure.

126
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,460
I'm not sure.

127
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,460
I'm not sure.

128
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,460
I'm not sure.

129
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,460
I'm not sure.

130
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,460
I'm not sure.

131
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,460
I'm not sure.

132
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,460
His Majesty wouldn't leave with me

133
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,460
and take good care of him.

134
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:17,300
Let me write your words tomorrow

135
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,860
Write down our endless heart

136
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,460
Want to be closer

137
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:33,860
I will pass the moon to accompany you to the top

138
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,260
Write down our encountering love

139
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,860
Don't be afraid of the wind

140
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,460
I can see your eyes

141
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,860
Where is the star?

142
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,260
Oh, you didn't even get your household goods

143
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,260
It's New Year's Day tomorrow. You should go home and rest

144
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,260
Don't think about anything. You can't think about anything

145
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,260
Just thinking about one thing is just a New Year's Day

146
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,260
But you've packed so many things. You won't be back in a year, right?

147
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,260
What are you thinking about?

148
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,260
Yes, yes, yes. I've been thinking about the makeup products that you wanted

149
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,260
Did you get a morning call?

150
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,260
Yes, I'm relieved

151
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,260
You left with a bag?

152
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,260
How are you going to celebrate New Year's Day?

153
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,260
I'll be alone. I'll be here alone

154
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,260
We'll have a video shoot this year

155
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,260
You're so mean

156
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,260
Okay, let's go

157
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,260
What are we going to do?

158
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,260
You're already here?

159
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,260
Yes, I'm here

160
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,260
I'm here to celebrate New Year's Day

161
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,260
Mom, why are you here?

162
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,260
I can't come back home

163
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,260
I didn't mean that

164
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,260
Tell me. I'm not good at picking you up

165
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,260
Can I still be here after calling you?

166
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,260
Mom, just say what you want

167
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,260
Don't act like a bad guy

168
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,260
How am I a bad guy?

169
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,260
You said you found a rich boyfriend

170
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,260
How can I say that?

171
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,260
They are all flowers that bloom in the rain

172
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,260
Don't let them trap you

173
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,260
You just don't listen

174
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,260
Look at your senior period

175
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,260
You're so upset

176
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,260
Who are you looking for?

177
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,260
Can you not do that?

178
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,260
You're my daughter

179
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,260
You don't tell me anything

180
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,260
I can't ask others

181
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,260
I look for someone to look at your friends

182
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,260
You can't do that?

183
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,260
I don't want to hear you say that

184
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,260
Can you give me some advice?

185
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,260
Why are you so stubborn?

186
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,260
Why don't you listen to me?

187
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,260
I'll tell you later

188
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,260
Why are you so stubborn?

189
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,260
Han Ting

190
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,260
You're so stubborn in your senior period

191
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,260
You're trying to kill me

192
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,260
You can't do that

193
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,260
I'm just a good person

194
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,260
I heard from Xiaomeng

195
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,260
You're going to celebrate with Ji Xin this year

196
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,260
Don't be so serious

197
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,260
It's normal to make a mess between the ex-girlfriends

198
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,260
Don't worry about you

199
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,260
You just want Ji Xin to go home and have a good time

200
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,260
And then wait for her to come back

201
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,260
You'll be proud of her

202
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,260
R Phu Qi

203
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,260
Facing each other

204
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,260
Do you think Qi will come back?

205
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,260
Of course

206
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,460
He loves you that much

207
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,260
Moreover

208
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,580
She is with you

209
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,620
Don't even consider Han Hai

210
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,260
Even Dong Ye will agree to her experimental activity

211
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,260
He'll understand

212
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,600
after all this time?

213
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,520
Nonsense is not right.

214
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,180
Didn't say that wrong?

215
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,880
What kind of situation do you have right now?

216
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,480
Here.

217
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,380
Are you okay, mom?

218
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,600
Is she home?

219
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,700
There are so many conditions and we don't look out for it.

220
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,660
We must go there tomorrow.

221
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,520
You should go by yourself. I'm not.

222
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,520
This is...

223
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,920
Hello, auntie.

224
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
I'm Li Jin's boyfriend.

225
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,720
I'm here to pay you a visit.

226
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
What are you thinking about?

227
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
I was thinking of giving you some gifts.

228
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,320
Didn't you hear that

229
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,320
I'm not willing to give you a chance to meet?

230
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,920
I was thinking of giving you a chance to meet.

231
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,120
Don't worry.

232
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
It's a long story.

233
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,320
It's not a big deal.

234
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
Xiaosu.

235
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
Why don't you come over and sit down?

236
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,720
I'll let you cook.

237
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
Okay, auntie.

238
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
Let me talk to you.

239
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,120
Don't worry.

240
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,720
Aunt.

241
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,120
Sit down.

242
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
I'll be right back.

243
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,320
When did you two talk?

244
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,920
I've never heard of you.

245
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,320
Aunt.

246
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,120
You've heard of me before.

247
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,920
It's normal.

248
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,920
You can't accept your Shen Yue so quickly.

249
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,920
Aunt, do you know?

250
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,120
I've always been loyal to Li Li.

251
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,520
You made a lot of jokes

252
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,720
just to chase her.

253
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,320
Really?

254
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Tell me about it.

255
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
At that time,

256
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Li Li had a boyfriend.

257
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
But I didn't know

258
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
that she liked a bag.

259
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
I wanted to buy it and send it to her.

260
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,520
But when I bought this bag,

261
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,120
she had already carried it

262
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,520
to her ex-boyfriend's same bag.

263
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,120
I only knew later

264
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,720
that she couldn't buy it online.

265
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,520
But I bought one online.

266
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,520
Am I stupid?

267
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,320
Didn't you spend money on it?

268
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
No.

269
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
I just want Li Li to be happy

270
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,720
when I buy this bag.

271
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
Although she didn't want to

272
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,520
buy the bag that someone else gave her,

273
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,920
as long as she's happy,

274
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
I'm happy.

275
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
You're quite honest.

276
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,320
I think

277
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,720
Li Li has found

278
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,320
a lot of boyfriend.

279
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
Don't think that she bought you a bag.

280
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,320
She's so sincere.

281
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,320
She's so kind

282
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
to that guy.

283
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,320
What's the point?

284
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,120
She can spend time

285
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,920
to make women happy.

286
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,920
Today,

287
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
she bought you a bag.

288
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,120
Tomorrow,

289
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,720
she'll buy you a car.

290
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,720
Mom,

291
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,320
you're not done yet, right?

292
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,520
You're not good at acting.

293
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,520
You found a man

294
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,920
just because you're not reliable.

295
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,720
You don't need to talk to me.

296
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,320
Auntie,

297
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,320
I think you're wrong.

298
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,920
Because Li Li

299
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,720
broke up with that guy very soon.

300
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,320
She chose me

301
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
with a clear mind.

302
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,120
Although I'm just a small business,

303
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,120
I'm sincere to Li Li.

304
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,320
And it's not easy

305
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
for us to get this fate.

306
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,120
Then you say,

307
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,920
we'll go out later.

308
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,920
Who doesn't have to

309
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,120
look after Li Li?

310
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,920
I'll show you, too.

311
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,520
Yes.

312
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,920
It's such a great honor to choose you.

313
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,920
That's a good idea.

314
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:05,920
Li Li

315
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,520
has found the right guy.

316
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:09,920
Auntie,

317
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Li Li can't go home

318
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
this year.

319
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,720
But you came to accompany her.

320
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,120
She has a boyfriend like me.

321
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
She's very stable.

322
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,320
We're a family.

323
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,320
Here.

324
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,120
Auntie,

325
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,920
have a soup.

326
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,720
I wish you a happy and happy

327
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
year.

328
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
Good luck.

329
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
You should try it, too.

330
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,120
The soup is black sesame.

331
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,920
It tastes good.

332
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,720
Okay.

333
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,320
Have a good meal.

334
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
It's so sweet.

335
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,320
Auntie,

336
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,520
do you know

337
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,920
there are many fun things

338
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,720
to pursue Li Li.

339
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,320
A friend said

340
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
I can't pursue Li Li

341
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,120
because I can't do it.

342
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,520
Then I told them

343
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,920
I should change my style.

344
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,920
But the next day,

345
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
I went to the company

346
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,320
and saw it.

347
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,120
I noticed something.

348
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,320
You're so successful

349
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,720
in today's fashion.

350
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Then you left.

351
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,120
I was alone in the garden.

352
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,920
I didn't even hear it.

353
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,520
I was praising and scolding me.

354
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Then the whole company

355
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,120
beat me.

356
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
But I'm so excited.

357
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
There's another time.

358
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,120
I'll put the box in your room.

359
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:15,920
Okay.

360
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,320
Xin Xin.

361
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,720
Let me ask you.

362
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,520
Why didn't Xiao Han come?

363
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,320
He has a problem at home.

364
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
He can't come.

365
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,120
Didn't we agree?

366
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,320
I've prepared the wedding dress for him.

367
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,320
It's okay.

368
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
We'll talk about it later.

369
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,120
What?

370
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
You take a rest first.

371
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,320
I'll call you when we have dinner.

372
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,320
Okay.

373
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
I think the girl's face is not right.

374
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
What's going on?

375
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,720
Xiao Han is not coming.

376
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,120
No.

377
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,320
Why?

378
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,920
How would I know?

379
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,320
Don't mention it when we have dinner.

380
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,720
I know.

381
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,560
To Orchid

382
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,220
Episode 3

383
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,720
Am I right?

384
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,120
What did I say?

385
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,920
You two

386
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,920
have amazing social patterns.

387
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,920
I'm going to split up

388
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,920
the two of you.

389
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Grandpa,

390
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
we haven't finished it.

391
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,920
You don't want to admit it?

392
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Not all the words I wrote

393
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
need to be changed.

394
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
You're so temperamental.

395
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Okay.

396
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
I'll wait and see

397
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,920
if you can get back to your original form.

398
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
Okay.

399
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
I'll wait and see.

400
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
The shrimp is here.

401
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
Okay.

402
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Xin Xin,

403
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
your favorite beef balls

404
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
are made by your dad.

405
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,920
It's enough for you to eat today.

406
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
Yes.

407
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Come on.

408
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
Don't think about losing weight.

409
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
You should eat it.

410
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Do you hear me?

411
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Come on.

412
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Here's a big shrimp.

413
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
A little bit of it.

414
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
Eat more shrimp.

415
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
And this.

416
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,920
This is my dad's own shrimp.

417
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
He loves it.

418
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
You've been raising me

419
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
as a pig for the past year.

420
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
What?

421
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
I'm the one who's the cutest

422
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
in the world.

423
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Right?

424
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
Come on.

425
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
Eat more.

426
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,920
It's still the best beef balls

427
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
for dad.

428
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
Right?

429
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
It's not a potato.

430
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
Dad,

431
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
I'm going to have dinner later.

432
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
I want to go to see the fireworks.

433
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Let me go with you.

434
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
Okay.

435
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Let's go together.

436
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
No need.

437
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
You can watch the spring night.

438
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
Okay?

439
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
I'll go with you.

440
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Okay.

441
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Okay.

442
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
You can watch the spring night.

443
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,920
I just want to stay alone.

444
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
Who?

445
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,920
Okay.

446
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,920
But the outside is cold.

447
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
Wear it when you go out.

448
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,920
Eat it.

449
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,920
Eat it.

450
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
Come on.

451
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
There's soup in the pot.

452
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
I forgot.

453
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Look at you.

454
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
You're so smart.

455
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Look at your mom.

456
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
I ordered it.

457
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
It's so sweet.

458
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
What?

459
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Come on.

460
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
Let's go.

461
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,920
Hurry up.

462
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Come on.

463
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
Come on.

464
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
It's so pretty.

465
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
Come on.

466
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
Hurry up.

467
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Come on.

468
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
Come on.

469
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
It's so pretty.

470
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
Grandma.

471
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
I'm leaving.

472
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
Where are we going?

473
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Go home.

474
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
Don't look at me.

475
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
Xiaoting.

476
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
Don't go away.

477
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
We're having fun together.

478
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,920
Right.

479
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
Look at the fireworks.

480
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,920
They're so pretty.

481
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
They're so warm.

482
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
They're so red.

483
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
Grandma.

484
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
I'm a little tired.

485
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
I'm leaving.

486
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Why are you so anxious?

487
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,920
Xiaoxiao.

488
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,920
It's not right to look at it.

489
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
What's wrong?

490
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
She's going to fight.

491
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
She's going to fight with you?

492
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,920
It's not a big deal.

493
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
But you

494
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
care about your son more than me.

495
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,920
I'm a fool.

496
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
What do you care about?

497
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,920
Hurry up.

498
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
Hurry up.

499
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
Hurry up.

500
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
Grandpa.

501
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
There's a poem.

502
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
Yes.

503
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
Who wrote it?

504
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
You.

505
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
It's a poem.

506
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
So cute.

507
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
It's so cute.

508
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
It's so cute.

509
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
Hello, aunt.

510
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
Happy New Year.

511
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,920
Aunt.

512
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
You're so good at singing.

513
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
You can sing if you want.

514
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,920
So cute.

515
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
Thank you, Xiaomeng.

516
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
Happy New Year.

517
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
And after that,

518
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,920
let's go to the bar to sing together.

519
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
So cute.

520
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,920
Why didn't you send it to me?

521
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
He lives in my house.

522
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,920
He's my boss.

523
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
Look at it.

524
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
I'll go and see if Xiaomeng is good.

525
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
Be careful.

526
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
Okay.

527
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
Don't be afraid.

528
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
Be careful.

529
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
Okay.

530
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
I got it.

531
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Why did you only send me

532
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,920
a new year's wish video?

533
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
Why didn't you send me one?

534
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
It's important.

535
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
You can take the first place.

536
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
Happy New Year.

537
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
I'm putting fireworks here.

538
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
I'll record it for you.

539
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
Look.

540
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
Be careful.

541
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
It's a new year again.

542
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,920
In this family of thousands,

543
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,920
everyone is happy.

544
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,920
Let's sing together.

545
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,920
Happy New Year.

546
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Let's sing together.

547
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,920
Happy New Year.

548
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
Happy New Year.

549
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
It's getting better.

550
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,920
What's the use of playing the fireworks?

551
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,920
Fireworks are the most popular fireworks.

552
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,920
All the wishes

553
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
of playing the fireworks

554
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,920
can come true.

555
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
Ji Qing.

556
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
I wish you a happy new year.

557
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
Thank you, Han Zeng.

558
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
You too.

559
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,920
Don't call me Han Zong in the future.

560
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Call me Han Ting.

561
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,920
Happy New Year.

562
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
Han Zeng.

563
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Han Zeng.

564
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
Open the door.

565
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
I'm a very good guy.

566
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Han Zeng.

567
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,920
When will you change the password?

568
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
Do you agree,

569
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
to come and spend New Year's Day with you?

570
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,920
Whenever he goes to take I'm a guest.

571
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,520
Hello, Zihong.

572
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,960
Zihong,

573
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,280
we need some food made for us.

574
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,480
What's the change of password in your house?

575
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,360
His birthday.

576
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,440
It seems

577
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,640
it's not your day.

578
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,760
But it'll be all right.

579
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,800
I'll stay with you.

580
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,160
As for the New Year,

581
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,280
why no куда but to spend the New Year?

582
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,560
I planned to be free this year

583
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,720
and spend time with you.

584
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,440
But...

585
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,440
Ji Xing left completely.

586
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,320
You're really a good wife.

587
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,680
What a pity that you're so old.

588
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,400
You've taken all the stars.

589
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,560
It's good to let Han Yue see Qin Chang He.

590
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,280
We need to cooperate with him later.

591
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,240
But Guang Hua is so stubborn.

592
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,960
I don't know what to do

593
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,480
in the future.

594
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,760
If you're upset,

595
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,160
just drink your wine.

596
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,800
I'm here to talk to you.

597
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,240
I want to change your mind.

598
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,160
You really don't cooperate.

599
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,680
It's better to drink.

600
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,120
Don't worry.

601
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,760
You're different from me.

602
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,440
I want to see him.

603
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,320
I can't see him.

604
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,360
Aren't you going to have

605
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,080
the Han Star Festival later?

606
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,640
Ji Xing is still working in Han Star.

607
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,360
He's not with you.

608
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,120
There will be a chance to see him later.

609
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,160
Da Huang.

610
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,160
It's time.

611
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Time to eat.

612
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,320
Da Huang.

613
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,240
Da Huang.

614
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,480
Da Huang.

615
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,600
Da Huang.

616
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,040
Da Huang.

617
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,040
What's wrong?

618
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,560
Da Huang is missing.

619
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,320
Your floor is so high.

620
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,760
How can he jump down from the floor?

621
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,720
Is there a door?

622
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,240
Da Huang.

623
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,640
Da Huang.

624
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,760
Da Huang.

625
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,120
Da Huang!

626
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
Da Huang!

627
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,440
Da Huang!

628
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,040
Da Huang!

629
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,000
Da Huang!

630
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,320
Da Huang!

631
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,040
Da Huang!

632
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,960
Da Huang!

633
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,560
Da Huang!

634
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,040
Don't run.

635
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,640
Don't drive my back.

636
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,640
Da Hong, don't let anyone ride.

637
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,920
I'll leave it to him.

638
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,400
I'm coming.

639
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,880
OK.

640
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,640
If there's nothing else,

641
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,920
I'm just going back to work.

642
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,360
A cat can find it,

643
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,600
but a person can come back too.

644
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,040
Good luck next year!

645
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,300
Everywhere one should be approaching,

646
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,200
why is a dirty day up to nine?

647
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,280
Okay.

648
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
Don't run around anymore.

649
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,760
She'll be back.

650
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,240
Before that,

651
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,240
let's wish her a happy new year together.

652
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:01,920
Here.

653
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,540
alone

654
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,820
works

655
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,240
Happy New Year

656
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,520
Mr. Han,

657
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,560
there's still half an hour left

658
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,400
for the shareholders' meeting.

659
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,960
Is it that early?

660
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,320
Mr. Han, it's that early.

661
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,640
Mr. Han.

662
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,640
Mr. Han.

663
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
We didn't know.

664
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
Mr. Han.

665
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,640
Mr. Han.

666
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,640
Mr. Han.

667
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
Mr. Han,

668
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
let's start.

669
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
Mr. Ji hasn't arrived yet.

670
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,640
Wait a minute.

671
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,640
Mr. Ji

672
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
just sent a message that he's not coming.

673
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,640
Okay, let's start.

674
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,640
Today,

675
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,640
our topic is

676
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,640
the appointment of

677
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,640
the shareholders of each department

678
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,640
after Han Haixing Chen has established

679
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,640
the company.

680
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,640
After Han Haixing Chen has been together,

681
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
he has set up a vice president.

682
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,640
I'm the vice president.

683
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
Vice president is

684
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,640
from

685
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,640
Manager Chen Jingyang,

686
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
the CEO of

687
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,640
the Star Technology Co.,

688
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,640
and the CEO of the Star Technology.

689
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
The Star Technology

690
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,640
keeps the self-development rights.

691
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,640
The Star Technology Department

692
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,640
and the Star Technology Department

693
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
are divided

694
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,640
into

695
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,640
Han Xing Technology Department

696
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
and Technology Department.

697
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
The Technology Department

698
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,640
is the director of

699
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,640
Su Zhizhou.

700
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
The other departments are in harmony.

701
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,640
The Star Technology Department

702
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,640
is the director of

703
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,640
the Star Technology Co.,

704
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
and the vice president of

705
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,640
the sales department.

706
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,640
The first step is

707
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,640
to be with Wang Yu.

708
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,640
I can agree to your conditions.

709
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,640
But I hope

710
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
the future Star Technology Department

711
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,640
won't be in the foreign team.

712
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,640
I'll be the

713
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,640
main person

714
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,640
of the internal world.

715
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,640
Okay.

716
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,640
Have a good cooperation.

717
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,640
Have a good cooperation.

718
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
I'll be with you

719
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,640
every birthday

720
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,640
in the future.

721
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,640
I'll be with you

722
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,640
forever.

723
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,640
Be together.

724
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,640
Okay.

725
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,640
Wish Han Hai Xing

726
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,640
a happy marriage.

727
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,640
Wish Han Hai Xing

728
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
a happy marriage.

729
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,640
Mr. Han,

730
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,640
do you need anything else?

731
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,640
That's all for today.

732
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
Okay.

733
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,640
Mr. Han,

734
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,640
I'm sorry.

735
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
I'm sorry.

736
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
I'm sorry.

737
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
I'm sorry.

738
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,640
I'm sorry.

739
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,640
I'm sorry.

740
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
I'm sorry.

741
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,640
I'm sorry.

742
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,640
I'm sorry.

743
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,640
I'm sorry.

744
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,640
I'm sorry.

745
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
I'm sorry.

746
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
I'm sorry.

747
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,640
I'm sorry.

748
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,640
I'm sorry.

749
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
I'm sorry.

750
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,640
I'm sorry.

751
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
I'm sorry.

752
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,640
I'm sorry.

753
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,640
I'm sorry.

754
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
I'm sorry.

755
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,640
I'm sorry.

756
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,640
I'm sorry.

757
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
I'm sorry.

758
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,640
I'm sorry.

759
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,640
I'm sorry.

760
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,640
I'm sorry.

761
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,640
I'm sorry.

762
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,640
Sure.

763
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,640
No problem.

764
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:49,980
Let me call

765
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
Qi.

766
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,640
One second.

767
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:10,640
Count

768
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,140
Both hands

769
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,140
Xiaosheng, what's wrong?

770
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,940
Mr. Lu, Mr. Su.

771
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,260
We...

772
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,140
received the mail from Mr. Ji.

773
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,460
Xing Chen has been creating

774
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,780
for more than a year.

775
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,740
But we've experienced many storms together.

776
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,340
It's like a battle of the year.

777
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,060
With deep love.

778
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,820
We've met Xing Chen with no limit.

779
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,500
Xing Chen has become a star in the night world

780
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,020
since he was born.

781
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,180
Xiaosheng,

782
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,380
thank you for accompanying Xing Chen

783
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,020
through the most difficult times.

784
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,460
Even if Xing Chen has faced short-term financial problems,

785
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,220
you still haven't left.

786
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,300
You've been with us

787
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,140
until the day we've successfully paid for it.

788
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,140
Everyone says that

789
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,540
instant noodles are your standard.

790
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,340
I've organized a long-term meeting

791
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,940
for you at the food court downstairs.

792
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,940
I hope you can eat well

793
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,740
and take care of yourself.

794
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,940
Although instant noodles are delicious,

795
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,140
the taste is also good.

796
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,380
Xia,

797
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,540
thank you for choosing Xing Chen

798
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,140
and for trusting me again

799
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,140
after leaving.

800
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,540
Come back

801
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,140
and accompany us to grow up.

802
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,940
I've put two books on your desk.

803
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,140
It's the most useful reference book

804
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,940
when I studied the medical medicine for three days.

805
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,940
I've also sent some notes and new ideas

806
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,740
to help you.

807
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,740
Yes.

808
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:55,940
Xiaozuo,

809
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,940
Xing Chen has come to your graduation.

810
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,340
Xing Chen and you

811
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,940
are the same age.

812
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,940
Although you have experienced things in the process,

813
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,140
you've already become the top assistant of the technical department.

814
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,540
I heard from Zhizhou that you have a notebook

815
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,340
that has full of details.

816
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,740
Your tablet is my personal support.

817
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,940
I hope that

818
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,940
it can be with you further.

819
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,340
Xiaoyou,

820
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,940
thank you for coming to the beginning of your journey

821
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,340
after the big event.

822
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,940
I think you are not good at coffee.

823
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,340
You must be a coffee lover.

824
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,940
I've prepared for you

825
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,940
your favorite deep red cup coffee.

826
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,540
But coffee can't be too much.

827
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,340
You have to control the amount.

828
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,740
Hi, Xiaozong.

829
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,540
You are a strange girl.

830
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,540
You always surprise people.

831
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,540
Your office is also the most special.

832
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,340
I'll leave the meat on the table to you.

833
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,740
I hope you can take good care of her for me.

834
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,940
I'm sorry.

835
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,540
I'm sorry.

836
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,940
I'm sorry.

837
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,140
I'm sorry.

838
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,540
I'm sorry.

839
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:39,740
I'm sorry.

840
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,940
I'm sorry.

841
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,140
I'm sorry.

842
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,140
I'm sorry.

843
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,140
I'm sorry.

844
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,140
I'm sorry.

845
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,340
I'm sorry.

846
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,340
I'm sorry.

847
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,540
I'm sorry.

848
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,540
I'm sorry.

849
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,540
I'm sorry.

850
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:51,540
I'm sorry.

851
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:52,540
I'm sorry.

852
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,540
I'm sorry.

853
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,540
I'm sorry.

854
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,540
I'm sorry.

855
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,540
I'm sorry.

856
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,540
I'm sorry.

857
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,740
I'm sorry.

858
00:44:58,940 --> 00:44:59,740
I'm sorry.

859
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:00,740
I'm sorry.

860
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,740
I'm sorry.

861
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:38,740
I don't want to be in a relationship.
