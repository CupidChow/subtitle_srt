1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll go to the end of the world.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There won't be a word of doubt.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I want to go to the end of the world.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I won't give up.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,660
I will have faith in time

16
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,840
Even if the bell rings

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,320
I do not know what have changed in the past 3 years.

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,740
Wait for now,

19
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,920
Water rich kids are much closer.

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,320
Suite is so small to me.

21
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,040
to enter the right content.

22
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,960
Don't go.

23
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,280
Don't go.

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,240
Don't go.

25
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,000
Is this what it looks like?

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,040
Once more.

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,840
Once again.

28
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,280
I have shown you a deep image of me,

29
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,120
again.

30
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,600
Please.

31
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,680
I wish to.

32
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,880
I don't want it anymore.

33
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,840
I don't want to be independent anymore.

34
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,840
I don't want to back consequence.

35
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,320
I don't want to see you.

36
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,720
Don't break up, okay?

37
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
You're going to bury me.

38
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,720
You're going to bury me.

39
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
I'm not okay.

40
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
Why don't you leave?

41
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,720
Why don't you leave?

42
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,120
I'm begging you.

43
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,120
Don't leave.

44
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,120
What do you want me to do?

45
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
Don't leave.

46
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,120
Don't leave.

47
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Don't leave.

48
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,120
I just bought a honeycomb.

49
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,120
Can you give me the meal?

50
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,720
You're not going to accept the code.

51
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
It's the same.

52
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Is it convenient to call your friends?

53
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
What?

54
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
I'm not a bad guy.

55
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,720
I just sent the message back.

56
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
Hurry up.

57
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
It's too late.

58
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Okay.

59
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Send me the payment record of the honeycomb.

60
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Go.

61
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,720
Take care of him.

62
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Thank you.

63
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,240
In the meantime, let's live a happy life together.

64
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,920
It's म işteเสquiera awareness.

65
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:04,960
Is that right?

66
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,080
It's just that you don't,

67
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,120
anyone together...

68
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,480
What does it mean?

69
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,200
Why is it so hard to find a person like me now?

70
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,400
It's just...

71
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,480
you...

72
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,200
Because we are both here

73
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,440
Do you remember

74
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,760
what you did last night?

75
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,760
What did I do?

76
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,400
I can't recall

77
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,200
Where have I been?

78
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,240
I remember I was

79
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,500
drinking, drinking

80
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,800
And then

81
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,280
How did I come back?

82
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,720
An Tian sent you back

83
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Han Ting?

84
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
You met him at the bar.

85
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Then,

86
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,720
who changed clothes for me?

87
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
I did.

88
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Okay, okay.

89
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Then,

90
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
what's the big deal?

91
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,720
Don't you know how scary you were last night?

92
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
You made us three so angry.

93
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
You came yesterday.

94
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Not us three.

95
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
It's me, Han Ting,

96
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
and an important person.

97
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
The one who met Mr. Lu

98
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
in front of Qiu Zi's house.

99
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
Oh, right.

100
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
I saw a lot of

101
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
Lu Ling's crisis

102
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,720
when I woke up this morning.

103
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
He said you were drunk.

104
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
He asked me for the address.

105
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
But I didn't get it

106
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
when I slept last night.

107
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
But he asked

108
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Xiaomou's address later.

109
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Forget it.

110
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
It doesn't matter.

111
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Ji Xing,

112
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
do you know

113
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
you've been singing

114
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
all the time

115
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
after you drank too much?

116
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
I couldn't even pull it out.

117
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
I had to carry you back to your room.

118
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
What?

119
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Take care of him.

120
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Thank you.

121
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Come on.

122
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
Let's continue drinking.

123
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
Let's sing a song for everyone.

124
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
Come on.

125
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
Okay, Ji Xing.

126
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
We've drank enough.

127
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Okay.

128
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Let's continue drinking.

129
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,720
Drink it.

130
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Drink it.

131
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Drink it.

132
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Drink it.

133
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
What's wrong with me?

134
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
Okay, okay.

135
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
I won't sing anymore.

136
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Okay, give me the wine.

137
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
I'll drink it.

138
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Okay.

139
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Okay.

140
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Don't make trouble.

141
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
I'll drink it.

142
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Ji Xing, you're my eldest nephew.

143
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
You're my eldest nephew.

144
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
What eldest nephew?

145
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
I don't care who he is.

146
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
Thank you.

147
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
No, no, no.

148
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Ji Xing, Ji Xing.

149
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,720
Come back.

150
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
I won't sing anymore.

151
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
I'll sing with you next time.

152
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
Okay?

153
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
No.

154
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
I'll accompany you

155
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
to continue drinking with you, okay?

156
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Okay, okay.

157
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Stop it.

158
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Come back.

159
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
You're mad at me.

160
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
You've never told me

161
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
a word of hatred

162
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
for so many years.

163
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,720
You're mad at me now.

164
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
I'll sing it.

165
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
Let's sing a happy song.

166
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
Okay, okay.

167
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Okay, okay.

168
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Okay, okay.

169
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
Ji Xing, Ji Xing.

170
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Come down.

171
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Come down.

172
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
Come back.

173
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
Come back.

174
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
Which room?

175
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
Let's continue.

176
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Let's continue.

177
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Let's continue.

178
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Come back.

179
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Come back.

180
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
Come back.

181
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Come back.

182
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Come back.

183
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Come back.

184
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Stop it.

185
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Oh, no.

186
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
He must think I'm a psycho.

187
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
It's okay.

188
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
You've drunk too much.

189
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
It's normal.

190
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
But, Ji Xing,

191
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
why did you suddenly go to the bar

192
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,720
and drink so much?

193
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
Did you quarrel with Shao Yichen?

194
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
He came to the village in the morning.

195
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
He left in a hurry.

196
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
I didn't even have a chance to ask him

197
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,720
what's going on.

198
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,720
I didn't see you quarreling with Shao Yichen.

199
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
Why did he make you so angry?

200
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
We broke up.

201
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
What happened to

202
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
Brother Yichen?

203
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,720
You've been in a good relationship.

204
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
He said we're different from

205
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
the future.

206
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
But we've been in a relationship for four years.

207
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
How could we let it go?

208
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Okay.

209
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
I'll go.

210
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Okay, okay.

211
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Don't ask.

212
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
Ji Xing, you're not awake yet, right?

213
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Go to sleep.

214
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Sleep for a while.

215
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
I think we should sleep for a while.

216
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
You broke up?

217
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
No.

218
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
I called Shao Yichen.

219
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
I...

220
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Don't ask.

221
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Ji Xing, he won't joke about this.

222
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
He said

223
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Shao Yichen must have come

224
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
to a place where there's no return.

225
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
This is the past.

226
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
From now on,

227
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
you all don't mention Shao Yichen

228
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
in front of him.

229
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Don't make him sad.

230
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
I'll go.

231
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
That's how we feel.

232
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
We'll decide together

233
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
before we start.

234
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
But one person

235
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,720
can decide to end it.

236
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,720
We've been friends for four years.

237
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
That's all.

238
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
We can't let it go

239
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
in my life.

240
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
I...

241
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
When will Xing Chen's new product

242
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
be released?

243
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
Do you have a plan?

244
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
I'll speed it up.

245
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
I hope you'll do your best.

246
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Don't worry.

247
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
I'll see

248
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
the specific year of Xing Chen

249
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
before the New Year.

250
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
I'll do it.

251
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Remember to have breakfast.

252
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Otherwise, you won't get a rabbit.

253
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
I'll go.

254
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Wait a minute.

255
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
I'll take the money.

256
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
Excuse me.

257
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
You can go.

258
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Stand here.

259
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Okay, let's go.

260
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
Let's go.

261
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
Let's go.

262
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Xing, don't run.

263
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
The scarf is gone.

264
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
The screen is about to start.

265
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
You forgot your phone.

266
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
You forgot your ticket.

267
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
I'll leave it to you next time.

268
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
Okay, I'll listen to you.

269
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
Let's go.

270
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
Let's go to the store.

271
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
Let's go.

272
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
Let's go watch a movie.

273
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
It's a weekend.

274
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
Don't stay at home.

275
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
You don't have a date today?

276
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
The one who wants to date

277
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
is not free on weekends.

278
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
Xing Xing is not at home.

279
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
He has to work overtime again.

280
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
He said that

281
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,720
the investor is urging him to work.

282
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,720
He has been working for a long time.

283
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
He can't stay here.

284
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
He's going to be a good guy.

285
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
To him,

286
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
the tiredness on work

287
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,720
is not as painful as the pain on feelings.

288
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
He and Shao Yicheng have been talking for so many years.

289
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
They are family.

290
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
It must be very uncomfortable to be alone.

291
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
So he is getting busier now.

292
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
He is not thinking about it.

293
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
It makes sense.

294
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
Xing Xing has been working all over the body.

295
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,720
He must not have the energy to look for Yichen.

296
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
He is now busy.

297
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
The company is not as good as the normal one.

298
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
So,

299
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Mr. Han is Xing Xing's girlfriend.

300
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,720
Mr. Han,

301
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,720
I've done some research these past few weeks.

302
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
I found that

303
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
there are still many problems with the commercial planning.

304
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
I will report to you

305
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
after I finish the repair

306
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
in the annual planning.

307
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Okay.

308
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Boss,

309
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Mr. Qi hasn't come to report to us recently.

310
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
Do I need to check the progress?

311
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
No need.

312
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
Okay.

313
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
Okay.

314
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,720
Are you okay?

315
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Are you here for the meeting?

316
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,720
You know everything, right?

317
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
I know

318
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
how you feel about the four years.

319
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
You must be very reluctant.

320
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
But I know Xing Xing very well.

321
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
He is a stubborn and coward.

322
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
He is a stubborn and coward.

323
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Since he can't go back,

324
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
you must make the decision.

325
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
I understand.

326
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
He is very strong.

327
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
As long as he is determined,

328
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,720
he will do well.

329
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
I will break up with him.

330
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
I believe he will come out.

331
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Brother, you...

332
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
I am fine.

333
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,720
I just...

334
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
I just need some more time.

335
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
But you are so excellent.

336
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
You should think about

337
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
your work.

338
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
You should work harder

339
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
when you are in a relationship.

340
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,720
But you should drink less coffee.

341
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
It will make you lose weight.

342
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
Okay.

343
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
Is it convenient?

344
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
I will go to your office later.

345
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
I have some questions about the materials.

346
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
Please teach me.

347
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
Okay.

348
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Let's go.

349
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
This way.

350
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,720
What's wrong?

351
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
It's okay. The water pipe is broken.

352
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
I will find someone to repair it.

353
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
The new generation of Hanhai

354
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
is pursuing the fusion of the oil and gas products.

355
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
It has been released to the public.

356
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
What is the medical center?

357
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
What are you going to do

358
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,720
with Xing Chen?

359
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Don't talk to me.

360
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Xing Chen is completely

361
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
in sync with Hanhai.

362
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
The faster Hanhai is developing,

363
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
the more pressure Xing Chen has.

364
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
The fish is bigger.

365
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Xing Chen just started.

366
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
I am worried that your sister

367
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
will make excuses for Xing Chen

368
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
and make you suffer.

369
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,720
Without Xing Chen,

370
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,720
will my sister let us go?

371
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
At least she won't be like

372
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
now.

373
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
If I knew it,

374
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
I wouldn't have asked you to vote for Xing Chen.

375
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
Don't worry.

376
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,720
Xing Chen has his own way to go.

377
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
That's enough.

378
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,720
You should comfort yourself.

379
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
I advise you.

380
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
You should invest more in love.

381
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
And invest more in investment.

382
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Let Xing Chen be the one to do it.

383
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
I am still saying that.

384
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
I have no use for it.

385
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
You are so stubborn.

386
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
The evolution of Hanhai

387
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
is not clear.

388
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
You are not clear?

389
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
When Hanhai's products

390
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
are released,

391
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
I will not have to

392
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
talk to Dong Shihui about it.

393
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
The market will force Xing Chen to die.

394
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
I have confidence in my machine.

395
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
You are not eating?

396
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,720
Hanhai's products are released.

397
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
I am willing to not let

398
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Xing Chen find a chance to do it.

399
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
You are in the office?

400
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Meeting.

401
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Boss,

402
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,720
you are so busy

403
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
for the sake of things.

404
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Mr. Yuan is still in the high-ranking meeting.

405
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
And the high-ranking members.

406
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
It's always raining.

407
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
I can't do anything.

408
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
They only care about their own interests.

409
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,720
They only care about the result.

410
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,720
There is nothing wrong.

411
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
But Xing Chen

412
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
is really going to speed up.

413
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
He is going to get the result soon.

414
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Otherwise,

415
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
all the pressure will be given to you.

416
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
You can't always

417
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
be so worried about them.

418
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
Have you ever lost your mind?

419
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Of course.

420
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,720
How long do you want to leave?

421
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
A month or two.

422
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
But even if I lost my mind,

423
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
it won't affect my job.

424
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
A month or two?

425
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Mr. Han,

426
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Xing Chen's annual planning plan is done.

427
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
You can come to your meeting

428
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
when you are free.

429
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
Today,

430
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
it's 6.30 p.m.

431
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Okay, I will come at the right time.

432
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
It seems that you don't need to be so long.

433
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Go back and practice.

434
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
You need to see your ability.

435
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
I am going to practice.

436
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,720
No,

437
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
I will go to work now.

438
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Come in.

439
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
Mr. Han.

440
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
Finally, Mr. Ji.

441
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
I thought you were not Xing Chen anymore.

442
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
I am sorry.

443
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
I drank too much that day.

444
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
I said he was drunk.

445
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
Drunk?

446
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
Obviously after the meeting.

447
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,860
The Treason

448
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,720
Come on.

449
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,720
Come on.

450
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Come on.

451
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,720
It's okay.

452
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
Let's go to work.

453
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,720
Okay.

454
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
Come on.

455
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,120
This is the plan plan for next year.

456
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,440
I'll send you the e-mail of the e-mail.

457
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,640
This is the paper version.

458
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,440
You can print it.

459
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,840
The creator is not only working hard,

460
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,240
but also physical.

461
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,000
I hope you can quickly adjust your state.

462
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,520
Don't be 45 cm in height.

463
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,600
Otherwise,

464
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,200
I'll think about the next one.

465
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,280
Do you want to be printed?

466
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,800
Is there such a requirement?

467
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,400
Why do you have to be 45 cm in height?

468
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,280
You just want to be printed and print,

469
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,280
which means...

470
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,040
just one cloud won't consistent with the next phase.

471
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,680
Yown!

472
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,760
forcing you down!

473
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,560
Yown!

474
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,000
Could wezione a little while more v lamb knee dance?

475
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,200
Maybe next year.

476
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
No need. I have something else to do.

477
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Okay.

478
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Did you come out?

479
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
You're back.

480
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
Let me see.

481
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Really?

482
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
You girl.

483
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
If I didn't call Yichen,

484
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
I wouldn't know you broke up.

485
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Why didn't you tell your dad about it?

486
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,800
I don't want you to worry about it.

487
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
We're the ones who don't say anything.

488
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Look at you.

489
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
You've been in a lot of trouble.

490
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
You didn't tell me about it.

491
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
You quit your job.

492
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
You're in a serious business now.

493
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
You're even more serious.

494
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
We don't know

495
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
if you're doing well.

496
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
You can only worry about your family.

497
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
I'm really worried about you.

498
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,800
Come and see me.

499
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Okay. I'm wrong.

500
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Don't talk to me.

501
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Okay.

502
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Are you hungry?

503
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Yes.

504
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
I brought you a lot of delicious food.

505
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
It's hot.

506
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Wash your hands first.

507
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
I'll eat it right away.

508
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
We'll talk later.

509
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Where's Tu Xiaomeng?

510
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
He said he had an appointment with a friend.

511
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
He's out.

512
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
He's not in the mood.

513
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
OK.

514
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
I'll call you back.

515
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
I'll be back.

516
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
I'm gonna go get some tea.

517
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
I'll be back.

518
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
Bye.

519
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
I'm sorry.

520
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
You can go.

521
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Let's go.

522
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
I'll go.

523
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
I'm sorry.

524
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
I'm sorry.

525
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
I'm sorry.

526
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
I'm sorry.

527
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
It's okay.

528
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
I'm sorry.

529
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
I'm sorry.

530
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
I'm sorry.

531
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
I'm sorry.

532
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
I'm sorry.

533
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,360
No, no.

534
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,880
I'll make soup for you.

535
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,280
Why are you here?

536
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,840
I know you're still awake.

537
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,200
I brought you some salt.

538
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,120
Please.

539
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,160
How is it?

540
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,120
Do you like the style of Zhou Xue?

541
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,680
I knew you wanted to go back to China

542
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,440
to find a house for you.

543
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,080
You've been

544
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,040
in the sofa for several times.

545
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,960
You're always good.

546
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,720
You should take care of yourself.

547
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,200
The sofa is for you to sit there

548
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,800
and relax and rest.

549
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
It's not for you to work overtime.

550
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,480
Come here.

551
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,640
Come on, try it.

552
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,680
Do you like it?

553
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,760
The moon is bright.

554
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,400
Ting Zai Zhou, your favorite.

555
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,840
Her char siu,

556
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,720
char goose,

557
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,920
and other things.

558
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,000
They're all good.

559
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,800
Try it.

560
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,880
It's all your favorite.

561
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,000
I heard the board of directors

562
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,280
has been in trouble lately.

563
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,960
Don't be too stressed.

564
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,600
I talked to Dr. Jiang.

565
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,320
He gave me a lot of inspiration.

566
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,600
He also recommended some excellent talents to me.

567
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,840
I believe that Xiao Bai will have

568
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,560
a breakthrough in the second stage.

569
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,200
When I show you the report,

570
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,440
will you be stressed?

571
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,480
You did a good job.

572
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,840
But Xiao Bai doesn't need to be the director.

573
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,960
You can just move on.

574
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,320
I'll listen to you.

575
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,320
I...

576
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,280
Actually,

577
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,200
I have something to ask you.

578
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,560
Go ahead.

579
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,960
I want to ask Dr. Jiang Huai

580
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,920
to be our consultant in the department of technology.

581
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,440
I'll talk to Dr. Jiang.

582
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,040
Really?

583
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,400
Thank you.

584
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,280
Look at me.

585
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,640
I told you to have a good rest

586
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,680
and eat well.

587
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,320
I said I had to work again.

588
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,080
The fish is so pretty.

589
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,960
Who gave it to you?

590
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,800
Grandma Gu gave it to me.

591
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,760
It's a pity that you can't control it.

592
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,360
How about I choose

593
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,680
some beautiful fish tomorrow?

594
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,520
No need.

595
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
The fresh sauce is good.

596
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,920
It's also good.

597
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,400
The water is the best.

598
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,240
The fish is good.

599
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,400
It's good.

600
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,280
Come and have some soup.

601
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,160
Here, let me measure it on tank first.

602
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,480
You go the rest.

603
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,000
What you say can be easily.

604
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,560
It's a COMM是 for Wednesday

605
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,800
and there must be

606
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,120
a hospital for week-end聚集班.

607
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,560
Don't be afraid.

608
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,120
It will be difficult to get your heart.

609
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,400
but that you're from a capital house.

610
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,400
Move the back請.

611
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,360
Staying Here, I don't upright work.

612
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,040
Where is it?

613
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,280
Where is this picture?

614
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
You are...

615
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,800
I found it.

616
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,200
Okay, okay.

617
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,240
Come back soon.

618
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,120
You are Su, right?

619
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,760
I am Xin Xin's mother.

620
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,440
Xin Xin mentioned you to me.

621
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,240
You investors are so true.

622
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,120
Let's go.

623
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,040
You are working overtime on weekends.

624
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,840
If you young people

625
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,000
are busy,

626
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
no matter what,

627
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,480
I can't finish this job for you.

628
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,400
Give me your hand.

629
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,600
You are not feeling well.

630
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,680
You are not feeling well.

631
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,080
So you must eat and drink more.

632
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,200
Come in, Su.

633
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,600
You ordered the delivery, right?

634
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,280
Young people like to eat delivery.

635
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,160
I tell you,

636
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,400
you can't do this in the future.

637
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,000
If you don't have any benefits for your body,

638
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,040
come on, thank you.

639
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,360
Help me wash the strawberries.

640
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,440
Okay.

641
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,800
Come on.

642
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,640
Hurry up.

643
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,640
What's wrong?

644
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,840
Oh my god.

645
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,000
The water pipe is broken.

646
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,040
Come on, wipe it.

647
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,360
Okay.

648
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,560
I have wet your clothes.

649
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,760
Change your clothes.

650
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,800
Don't catch a cold.

651
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:41,840
It's okay.

652
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,040
It will be dry soon, aunt.

653
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,400
You didn't get wet in the company, right?

654
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,400
I tell you, young people like you,

655
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,000
there is a change in the world.

656
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,240
Why do you have to get wet in the company?

657
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,040
Come on.

658
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,600
This is the new dress I brought for you.

659
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,400
No need, aunt.

660
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,200
No need.

661
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,400
No need.

662
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,000
Listen to me.

663
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,400
If you catch a cold,

664
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,200
your parents will be so sad.

665
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,240
Change it.

666
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,400
I chose the big one.

667
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,200
You can wear it.

668
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,560
Dad.

669
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,000
You young people.

670
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,400
Don't get wet in the company.

671
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
I can't tell you now.

672
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,280
When your wife gets sick,

673
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,640
you will regret it.

674
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,200
Mom.

675
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,400
Mom.

676
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,080
You are back.

677
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,880
You are back.

678
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,440
Come back for dinner.

679
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,080
Hurry up.

680
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,800
Mr. Han.

681
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,600
I'm back.

682
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,800
Fallen river is broken.

683
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,800
I have becauseststood.

684
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,200
Thanks.

685
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,440
Xuxi.

686
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,200
You called Mr. Han that,

687
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,560
is it Xiaosu?

688
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,800
What Xiaosu?

689
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,240
He's the head of my company,ider North and Mr. Han.

690
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,600
Then, I just called Xiaosu,

691
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,200
how come you didn't call別 home?

692
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:01,840
Then, it must be possible

693
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,600
for someone to give you a chance.

694
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,120
What did you say to me when you were in your brain?

695
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,720
Go wash your hands.

696
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,080
Han, let's go.

697
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,680
Let's eat.

698
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,280
Okay.

699
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,080
Come on, let's eat.

700
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,040
Don't be polite.

701
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,280
Just call me Han.

702
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,160
Okay.

703
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,120
Actually, I came here

704
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,040
to give Ji Xing a gift.

705
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:17,880
Thank you.

706
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,600
You eat.

707
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,520
I'll go first.

708
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,800
Han, don't go.

709
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,840
You're just a thief.

710
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,520
Besides,

711
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,400
I guess you're not in trouble

712
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,360
with your heart.

713
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,320
Hurry up.

714
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,240
Han, let's eat here.

715
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,160
Look at all the dishes.

716
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,320
Try my mom's cooking.

717
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,440
You eat so many dishes.

718
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,000
How can we eat them?

719
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,360
Okay.

720
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,520
Come on, sit.

721
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,200
Han.

722
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,600
Thank you, aunt.

723
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,840
Have some more.

724
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,040
You're too thin.

725
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,960
You have to keep it.

726
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:43,760
Okay.

727
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,240
Can you sell it on a Sunday?

728
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:49,920
No, I can't.

729
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,040
But I can pack it.

730
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,200
It's delicious.

731
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,320
Unfortunately, I didn't eat it last time.

732
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,480
Mom, try it.

733
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,800
It's not good to have your mom

734
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,520
cook it on a Sunday.

735
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,680
Han, you're eating

736
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,720
my cooking.

737
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,800
She cooks it well.

738
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,080
I'll eat it myself.

739
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,200
It's delicious.

740
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,000
Han,

741
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,320
are you a local?

742
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,560
You're a big boss.

743
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,520
You're usually busy.

744
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,560
You can have time

745
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,760
to eat with your mom.

746
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,520
Mom,

747
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,840
Han is busy.

748
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,640
Don't ask him.

749
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,520
Let him eat well.

750
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,520
Okay.

751
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,960
My parents are dead.

752
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,320
I'm really sorry.

753
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,280
It's okay.

754
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,320
It's old.

755
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,040
Well,

756
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,640
after dinner,

757
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,040
we can add a WeChat.

758
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,720
Okay.

759
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,800
You have time

760
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,840
to eat when you're here.

761
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,640
You can cook whatever you want.

762
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,600
Han is

763
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,880
a kind of kid who doesn't let others worry.

764
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,200
Unlike you,

765
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,160
my heart is beating fast.

766
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
He's naughty.

767
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,960
And he's very gentle.

768
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,400
I remember when I was a kid,

769
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,520
I saw his writing.

770
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,120
He said that my mom

771
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,040
looks like a hard-working man.

772
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,680
Okay.

773
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,480
Xin Xin,

774
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,160
can you tell your mom

775
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,320
what's better?

776
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,720
What's the good thing about it?

777
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,680
How beautiful it is!

778
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,880
What do you think of it?

779
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,080
Our teacher said

780
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,160
he didn't let me make a scene.

781
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,280
At that time,

782
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,440
he was changing his teeth.

783
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,680
He was alive.

784
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
Don't talk about it.

785
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,400
It's so funny.

786
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,560
I remember

787
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,160
when I was a kid,

788
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,360
I saw him looking for a picture.

789
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,280
Why didn't you know?

790
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:42,800
I didn't know.

791
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,400
I didn't know.

792
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,080
Don't.

793
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,680
Look at him.

794
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,480
You didn't know?

795
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,840
He was so mad.

796
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,560
He was so mad.

797
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,400
What did he think?

798
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
You didn't think of anything.

799
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,600
Who didn't think of anything?

800
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,480
Who didn't think of anything?

801
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,920
He was so mad.

802
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,360
He was so mad.

803
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,400
I think he's like that.

804
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,240
He's like that.

805
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,960
He's so mad.

806
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,560
How many things do you want?

807
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,760
I'll bring them to you.

808
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,640
No need.

809
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,640
We can do it ourselves.

810
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,160
Mom.

811
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,080
Kids.

812
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,040
Thank you.

813
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,600
It's okay.

814
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,240
I'll go open the door.

815
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,120
See you later.

816
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,600
Mom.

817
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,360
I'm sorry.

818
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,840
My mom is used to

819
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,640
packing all the leftovers home.

820
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,640
I'm in trouble.

821
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,640
It's okay.

822
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,520
Come on.

823
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,640
I'll bring them to you.

824
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,120
Let's go.

825
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,560
Mr. Han.

826
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,720
Thank you so much.

827
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,680
I didn't expect you

828
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,080
could even embroider a dragon head.

829
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,320
What's the big deal?

830
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,200
After all, I've been living

831
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,720
in China alone for more than ten years.

832
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,560
Alone?

833
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,400
Didn't your grandpa

834
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,360
accompany you?

835
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,600
I was with you when I first arrived in Germany.

836
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
I didn't come back

837
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,800
because I was busy with the country.

838
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,600
Did you eat a lot of food?

839
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,600
I didn't eat much.

840
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,600
I didn't eat much.

841
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
I didn't eat much.

842
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,600
You're not like this.

843
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,600
Here.

844
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,000
Thank you.

845
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,800
You're welcome.

846
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,600
I'll wash your clothes

847
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,600
as soon as possible.

848
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,600
It's okay.

849
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,200
I won't.

850
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,400
I'm sorry, Mr. Han.

851
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,600
I didn't see you

852
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,800
so stubbornly.

853
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800
Don't blame me.

854
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,800
I won't.

855
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,600
You always wear a bright and bright color.

856
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
A bright and bright color.

857
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,200
You're not like a good painter.

858
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,600
I'll look after you

859
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,000
when I get back.

860
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,000
You should go back and rest.

861
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,400
Okay.

862
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,600
I'm leaving.

863
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,600
Bye.

864
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
I'm leaving.

865
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
I'm leaving.

866
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:27,600
I don't want to see you again.
