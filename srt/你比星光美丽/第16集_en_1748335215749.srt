1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I forget my own story

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to go to the ends of the paradise

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll never hesitate

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll be stronger and stronger

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I have endless courage

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I want to go to the ends of the paradise

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I won't give up

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I will always believe in the miracle

16
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,760
Even if I don't know

17
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,960
who I am

18
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,480
Spicy, spicy, spicy, spicy

19
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,080
The spicy taste of Wei Longbu is just one spicy

20
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,120
Bring you into the true content

21
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,680
It's time for you to come

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,920
The problem is solved

23
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,440
It's good that it's solved

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,200
You helped me

25
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,200
A friend just met President Ma

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,960
He just got a letter

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,560
Didn't I say

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,360
I don't need you to help me solve the problem on work

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,920
I just don't want you to worry

30
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,920
Then it's not a big deal

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,200
I'm busy, hang up

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,040
Send one complaint

33
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,760
That sentence?

34
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,280
Why?

35
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,400
The lapsing of Chairman Chen was sweet

36
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,880
Who is on the phone

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,920
To the one who sent you the package

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,040
接ms everyone

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,040
Yuanccet光 a month

40
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,540
That will bring to a burn

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,600
That's awesome

42
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,400
Go

43
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,520
Don't do this again.

44
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,640
I'm afraid I'll be too dependent on you.

45
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,160
It's nothing bad.

46
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,120
I can solve the problem.

47
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,360
Mr. Ma,

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,800
my grandpa should have taught you

49
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,560
to be a good son.

50
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,920
Mr. Zeng,

51
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,320
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,920
I promised you.

53
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,600
But I can't say hello to other friends.

54
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,360
I can't not give you face.

55
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,520
I can only say hello to you

56
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,880
within a month.

57
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,400
I'm curious to know

58
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,800
which friend will say hello to you.

59
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,040
Mr. Zeng,

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,920
please don't make me feel uncomfortable.

61
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,520
Okay.

62
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,520
But

63
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,560
how many days is it within a month?

64
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,120
Ten days is also a month.

65
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,960
Thirty days is also a month.

66
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,320
I will definitely spend thirty days

67
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,160
to give my body a good life.

68
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,560
I won't be in a hurry even for a day.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,560
Since you said this,

70
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,960
I won't make it difficult for you.

71
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,880
Okay.

72
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,120
By the way,

73
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,440
if someone asks about this,

74
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,280
it's okay.

75
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,160
I understand.

76
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,040
Don't worry.

77
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,200
Don't worry.

78
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,400
It's been a month.

79
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,200
It's the fastest time

80
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,400
that Guan Deng has been able to get.

81
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,600
I understand.

82
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,240
But it's still too long.

83
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,200
We wrote the time limit

84
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,680
in the contract signed by Dong Yi Qian.

85
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,240
Now the material is not in place.

86
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,000
The sample examination can't be passed.

87
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,200
Think of another way.

88
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,880
Otherwise, we will be in danger.

89
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,200
Hello, your coffee.

90
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,280
Thank you.

91
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,200
Mr. Han,

92
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,920
hello.

93
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,360
The raw materials have not been solved yet?

94
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,040
Half of them have been solved.

95
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,480
You don't need to shake them for no reason.

96
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,680
But you still have to wait for a month.

97
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,880
One month?

98
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,080
Not yet.

99
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,320
Do you need my help?

100
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,320
No need.

101
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,400
You can do it.

102
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,600
I... I'm leaving.

103
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,160
Okay.

104
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,600
You are really a double-edged sword.

105
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,360
If you want to eat it,

106
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
you can cook it for him.

107
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,280
He asked me to come to your house for dinner,

108
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,880
but I cooked for you.

109
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
He didn't even go to rest.

110
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,080
Thank you.

111
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,320
Five minutes.

112
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,320
You are still talking about the main thing.

113
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,840
Then let's talk about the main thing.

114
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,040
You have to take care of Xing Chen and Ke Bo.

115
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
I help Ji Xing.

116
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,320
Are you jealous?

117
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,480
Who is behind it?

118
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,640
You should know it clearly.

119
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,480
But there are so many materials and supply stores in Dong Yi.

120
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,920
You can help him at any time.

121
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,440
Why do you choose to be a repairer?

122
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,680
I don't understand.

123
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,880
I believe he can solve it by himself.

124
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,840
It's my fault.

125
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,600
Han Ting, let me tell you.

126
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,200
I didn't do it.

127
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll break up with you, right?

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,120
I'll give you ten minutes.

129
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,000
Twelve minutes?

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Twelve minutes.

131
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,160
Thank you, everyone.

132
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,600
I brought you some food.

133
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,200
Thank you, Mr. Ding.

134
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,280
Come on, bring it here.

135
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,480
Youyou, help me with the food.

136
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,960
I haven't finished the food.

137
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,600
Thank you, Mr. Li.

138
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,760
Mr. Li,

139
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,680
I'll send you a gift.

140
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,760
Okay.

141
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,440
Come on.

142
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,840
Come on, Weiwei.

143
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,320
Give me another one.

144
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Thank you, Mr. Li.

145
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,320
Come in.

146
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,280
Brother Su,

147
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,720
you should eat something you bought.

148
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,560
You should eat first.

149
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,680
Okay.

150
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,080
I finished the work

151
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,400
I said.

152
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,840
You've been doing this

153
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,440
all day.

154
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,080
You're not the only one

155
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,280
who left the office.

156
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,360
Why are you here?

157
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,480
I'm not here either.

158
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,560
I'm here for myself.

159
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay.

160
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,560
I'll finish my work.

161
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,440
You can go back now.

162
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:42,960
Okay.

163
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,000
Thank you, Mr. Li.

164
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,200
Bring me the door.

165
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,120
Okay.

166
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,560
Good已经节奏感ile.

167
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,480
Next time,

168
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,160
I'll bring this to you.

169
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,320
This is my birthdayach.

170
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,720
明志,

171
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,800
when are you all going back?

172
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:32,920
Let's go.

173
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,800
Let's see,

174
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,640
she'll say Orientation ha Performance.

175
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,400
Yes,

176
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,920
I'll be back with her performance.

177
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,000
Let's go.

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,720
What's wrong?

179
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,320
Lili,

180
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,080
you're my lucky star.

181
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,960
You're my lucky star.

182
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,160
I have a way.

183
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,480
What are you saying?

184
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,640
If we buy raw materials,

185
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,400
we'll use the way you buy sweet food.

186
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,800
We'll find the market

187
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,040
in front of us

188
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,960
and talk about

189
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,560
adding 5% of the traffic fee.

190
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,360
But those markets

191
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,080
need raw materials

192
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,200
to promote production.

193
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,800
We won't let you down.

194
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,960
If we add 5%,

195
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,080
we'll add 8%.

196
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,680
If we don't add 10%,

197
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,680
we'll be asked

198
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,320
if we have any other way.

199
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,920
Okay.

200
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll go check it out.

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,760
I'll see if you can find the market

202
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,640
in front of us.

203
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
Come on!

204
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,800
Why are you so happy today?

205
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,920
You're only asking me out for dinner.

206
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,240
Xiaobai is good at making progress.

207
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,240
You've worked hard.

208
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,040
Sit down.

209
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,840
You ordered so much.

210
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,720
You didn't

211
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,840
eat and drink

212
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,480
when you were in Germany.

213
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,160
I was busy with my class.

214
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,280
I didn't have time to sleep.

215
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,400
I didn't have the time to think about it.

216
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,240
I remember that you

217
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,400
just joined the Winter Olympics.

218
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,080
Many people don't like it.

219
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,280
You're under a lot of pressure.

220
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,720
I said I'd stay to help you.

221
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
But you refused.

222
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,120
You had to fight alone.

223
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,600
Indeed.

224
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,000
It's hard to start a business.

225
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,840
If you don't have enough time,

226
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
you'll be forced to do it.

227
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,440
You still can't get the money back.

228
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,120
Just eat now.

229
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,240
I got tired after running the lunch.

230
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,720
There are limits toנה.

231
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,440
Who corners their nerves

232
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,480
because of work?

233
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,920
No, you're not tired.

234
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,880
What do you mean?

235
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,320
I'm not doing anything right.

236
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,800
You're the boss.

237
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,080
Don't put your heart

238
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,040
on the computer.

239
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,120
Let Mr. Ma

240
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,000
delay the launch of the raw materials

241
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,400
to make the new product

242
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,640
more successful in the experiment.

243
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
Does it have anything to do with you?

244
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,000
He can't buy raw materials

245
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,120
and I can't do anything.

246
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,320
You can't do

247
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,720
anything bad to him.

248
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,400
Mr. Ma

249
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,440
is a student of Zeng Yeye.

250
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,080
You've been doing well.

251
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,720
Yes.

252
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,640
What do you think?

253
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Do you know me?

254
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,040
I'll tell you

255
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,640
what happened without investigation.

256
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,120
High School

257
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,360
High School

258
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,720
He refused toAS due to preferment

259
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,600
even without looking at me.

260
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:06,840
Why?

261
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,440
I don't want to be your school's president.

262
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,280
I don't mean to

263
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,200
call you in a knee to kill him.

264
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,200
Xingchen is a company

265
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,520
with a eastern еслиve for investment.

266
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,640
ucалось that

267
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
Xingchen was messed up first.

268
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,800
That pipelines is not yours.

269
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Of course.

270
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,920
I will ask anyone who is behind the low-key action.

271
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
I see.

272
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,920
I will make a deal with GM Ma.

273
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
Maybe there's a misunderstanding.

274
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Have a meal.

275
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,760
Try it.

276
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,880
Try your favorite fish.

277
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,760
Yichen,

278
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,080
we're going to the main restaurant tonight.

279
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,240
You can't refuse.

280
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,640
Why don't we go out and eat?

281
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,320
Don't you believe me?

282
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,600
Don't worry.

283
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,920
You don't have to do anything.

284
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,120
The dishes are ready.

285
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,800
Just give me a hint.

286
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,000
You brought wine?

287
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,720
Yes.

288
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,200
The dishes are good.

289
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
The wine tastes good.

290
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,600
Try it later.

291
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,040
Yichen,

292
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,720
do you like fried meat?

293
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,560
I've chosen a very formal dish.

294
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,040
Yes.

295
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,040
What else do you like to eat?

296
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,200
Anything.

297
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,520
I'll make you some egg rolls.

298
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,360
I made egg rolls with Xixi before.

299
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,080
I also like spicy food.

300
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,320
But I haven't had egg rolls for a long time.

301
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,960
I'm sorry.

302
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,960
I'm not a good cook.

303
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,080
It's okay.

304
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,560
I didn't eat spicy food before.

305
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,000
I'll make the Guillogi to taste with the fresh butter.

306
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,240
Don't get mad.

307
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,800
I'll pack some.

308
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,520
I'll put it in the trunk.

309
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,560
OK.

310
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,320
Show your respect.

311
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,000
Hurry.

312
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,480
Chan Mingguo?

313
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,600
Why are you here?

314
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,920
Didn't I tell you in the last episode that I want to have a pub,

315
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,400
therefore, I wanted to pick some

316
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:46,640
funny and 59-ので

317
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,560
I want to hang out in front of the front.

318
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,560
So, whoever comes to see you

319
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
will say,

320
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,560
this boss is a fool.

321
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,560
So, you're really going to open the restaurant?

322
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,560
I've arrived at the same place as before.

323
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,560
I suggest you to write a plan

324
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,560
as soon as you get the money.

325
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,560
As long as the plan is passed,

326
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,560
there's no problem with the money.

327
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,560
And the environment is really good.

328
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
I plan to

329
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
not need to pretend to be a good person.

330
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
I'll open the restaurant

331
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,560
with a new photo.

332
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,560
Then,

333
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,560
you haven't even paid the bill.

334
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,560
You're here to buy the music?

335
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
Don't worry.

336
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
You're the one who gave me the drawing.

337
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
There's no problem.

338
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
There's no problem.

339
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
So, you're here to stick to it?

340
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Yes.

341
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
The owner of this restaurant is my friend.

342
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,560
I think you haven't given Snow White a lot of time.

343
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,560
You're so quick to be a fan.

344
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
Don't mention it.

345
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,560
She said that she couldn't see the fans on the Internet.

346
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
She's now a fan of Mr. Ben.

347
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Fine.

348
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
You're a fan.

349
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
You're not too blind.

350
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
Have a seat.

351
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,560
Seriously,

352
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
you gave her a good suggestion last time.

353
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,560
You should come and sit down and have a drink.

354
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,560
I'll give you a free drink after you come over.

355
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,560
Okay.

356
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,560
Then, let's have a drink.

357
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,560
Let's go.

358
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Let's go.

359
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
I was the one who cooked for you.

360
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
You cooked for me when you came.

361
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
You're a guest.

362
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,560
I should cook for you.

363
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
But I'm just a chef.

364
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,560
Eat with me.

365
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,560
No way.

366
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,560
It looks delicious.

367
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
Does your wound hurt?

368
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
No. It's a minor injury.

369
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
Qiu Zi.

370
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,560
You helped me a lot in my family.

371
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
You've been comforting me during this time.

372
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
Here.

373
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
Cheers.

374
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Cheers.

375
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
Mr. Yichen.

376
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
You don't have to come in like this.

377
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,560
Mr. Yichen.

378
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
I just want to help you.

379
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
Thank you.

380
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Eat.

381
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Eat while it's hot.

382
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
As long as you need it,

383
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
I'll be here anytime.

384
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,560
I...

385
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,560
I want to be with you forever.

386
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
Qiu Zi.

387
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,560
I'm sorry.

388
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,560
I'm not ready to

389
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,560
enter a new relationship.

390
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
It's okay.

391
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,560
I know.

392
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Don't worry too much.

393
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
Let's eat first.

394
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,560
The dishes are good.

395
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
The question of the ingredients is solved.

396
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,560
We've got the best quality materials.

397
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,560
The carbonated metal and carbonated metal.

398
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,560
And the company's approval of the fusion gas.

399
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,560
We're going to prepare the food experiment.

400
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,560
I'll be there in time.

401
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,560
I'll be back.

402
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,560
Thank you, Mr. Han.

403
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,560
I'll do my best.

404
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
I'm sorry.

405
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
I'm sorry.

406
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
The lesson today.

407
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,560
We'll stop here.

408
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
What's wrong with the students?

409
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
We can talk to them.

410
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,560
We'll go down to class.

411
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Mr. Yichen.

412
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
I'm sorry.

413
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
I'm sorry.

414
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
I'm sorry.

415
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
I'm sorry.

416
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
I'm sorry.

417
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
I'm sorry.

418
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
I'm sorry.

419
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
I'm sorry.

420
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
I'm sorry.

421
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
Mr. Yichen, I'm leaving.

422
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
Mr. Ma Song.

423
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,560
Hello.

424
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
I've seen your interview before.

425
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
You started to research the gold test

426
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
when you were in college.

427
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,560
You got the investment before you graduated.

428
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
You're so good.

429
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
Thank you.

430
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
You are?

431
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,560
I'm a new technology engineer.

432
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,560
I didn't expect to meet you here.

433
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,560
I have something to do.

434
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
I lost my job.

435
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,560
Mr. Xia.

436
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,560
Mr. Ma.

437
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,560
Long time no see.

438
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,560
Professor Xia, the money is gone.

439
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
You have five reasons.

440
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
This is your notes.

441
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
Mr. Han.

442
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
Why are you here?

443
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,560
Professor San.

444
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
Wait for me outside.

445
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,560
Han Ting.

446
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
I thought you were waiting for me in the office.

447
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
Long time no see.

448
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,560
Are you the director of Dongyang Medical Center?

449
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
I am.

450
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Wait.

451
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
This is...

452
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,560
I'm Ma Feng, a technology engineer.

453
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,560
I hope we can work together.

454
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
Sorry.

455
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,560
I have something to talk to Professor San.

456
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
You can talk.

457
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,560
I won't bother you.

458
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
We can work together.

459
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,560
Okay.

460
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,560
Let's talk.

461
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,560
I'll talk to him.

462
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
What are you doing?

463
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,560
Mr. Jin.

464
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,560
Mr. Jin.

465
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
Madam Wu.

466
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,560
Mr. Su.

467
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
Wait.

468
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
Mr. Su.

469
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
Huang Si.

470
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
There are many things to talk about.

471
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Where is Mr. Sun and his wife?

472
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,560
He's in the restaurant.

473
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,560
Don't worry.

474
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
of the past.

475
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Mr. Su.

476
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,400
I'll pay for it.

477
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,080
Okay.

478
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,360
I have to go.

479
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,280
Okay.

480
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:40,680
Take care.

481
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,200
Bye.

482
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,440
I'll pay for it.

483
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,320
Okay.

484
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,440
What are you looking at?

485
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,080
Let's go.

486
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,360
Mr. Han,

487
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,280
you don't need to lie to me, right?

488
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,000
You're so considerate.

489
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,440
It seems that it's useless to just watch the interview.

490
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,840
How many days have you been in class?

491
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,720
I found that these classmates are so good.

492
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,480
They're all the characters I wanted to be.

493
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,720
Of course, the best is Mr. Han.

494
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,720
I'm hungry.

495
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,240
Then I'll treat you to dinner.

496
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:30,880
Okay.

497
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,960
What do you want to eat?

498
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,800
All right.

499
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,560
Let's go.

500
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,760
I just want this.

501
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,240
Aren't you going to have all of these?

502
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,600
In this room,

503
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,320
there only tastes of時실 и earnoru when you attend a restaurant.

504
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,400
Enjoy it.

505
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,720
How was it?

506
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,200
Not bad.

507
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,160
Thank you, Mr. Han.

508
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,300
After all, it was a JasmineReveal.

509
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,520
What do you mean?

510
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,720
My year in brine is a success

511
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,760
for being a star.

512
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,720
You didn't get any Jamie»,

513
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,320
I also got a lesson on the day we won the competition.

514
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,320
But you didn't come.

515
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,120
I went to Germany at that time

516
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,720
and sent you a message.

517
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
You didn't reply me.

518
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,920
You sent me a message.

519
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,920
I accidentally lost my phone that day.

520
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
What did you send?

521
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,120
What else could I send?

522
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,120
I said I couldn't go.

523
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
By the way, do you have time tomorrow?

524
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
I want to report to the office.

525
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,520
So soon?

526
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,920
I want to have 27 yuan.

527
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,120
It's almost the day of the payment.

528
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,720
How is the work progress?

529
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,520
We plan to win the sample of the tracking融合期

530
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,520
this afternoon.

531
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
We will send it to the internal control office tomorrow.

532
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,920
As soon as the test is done,

533
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,320
we will send it to the check-in room.

534
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:56,600
We hope we can get the product and the

535
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,400
sample of the sample.

536
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,200
Is it serious?

537
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,200
As soon as the sample is done,

538
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,800
you can be at the check-in room.

539
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,800
You can check the sample at the check-in room.

540
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,800
How about this?

541
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
You should contact the Northland side now.

542
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,600
I will be right back.

543
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,400
I see.

544
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,600
I have to go now.

545
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,000
I will send you.

546
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,600
How did Xiang Hao handle it?

547
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,600
I will send it to the check-in room.

548
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
I will do it first.

549
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,600
I will go back and see what the situation is.

550
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,600
Don't worry.

551
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
When the Northland side has fixed the machine,

552
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,000
we will print the sample for 40 minutes.

553
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,000
I will not submit the report.

554
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,000
Xing Chen has not yet

555
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,000
a clear understanding of the management system

556
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
and the personnel management system.

557
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Such a thing will definitely

558
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,400
have something to do with the management of Liu Chen Yu.

559
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
You have just learned management.

560
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,800
You should learn how to use it.

561
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,800
I am glad to have this thing

562
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,800
to re-examine Xing Chen's purchase price.

563
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,400
You used to use your dream

564
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,200
and your feelings to make people happy.

565
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,800
You worked in the staff's office.

566
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,600
This kind of work is impossible to follow.

567
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,800
You can't just be self-sufficient.

568
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,400
The same importance of danger and strength.

569
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,600
The competition and elimination are critical.

570
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,600
You have to learn

571
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,200
the skills of these people.

572
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
I understand what you mean.

573
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,000
But I am not good enough

574
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,600
to be a good person.

575
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,000
So,

576
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,000
how are you going to deal with

577
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,400
the staff of the crime?

578
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,400
What if you do it?

579
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,400
I will be responsible.

580
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,600
I will consider whether to fire the criminal.

581
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,400
Fire?

582
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
That's too cruel.

583
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
The management is cruel.

584
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,800
It will be gone if the time is long.

585
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,400
But besides the management system

586
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,800
and the people,

587
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Xiaosu is a talented person.

588
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,000
He came to Xing Chen's office as soon as he graduated.

589
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,600
And the staff of Xing Chen

590
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
is like a friend.

591
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
If he were to fire the other staff,

592
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,800
how would he be able to

593
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,200
get rid of their confidence?

594
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,600
Then,

595
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,200
just share his merits and benefits

596
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,800
with the rest of the staff.

597
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,200
There must be a better solution.

598
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,400
You are really good at playing the role of a hero.

599
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,800
Have you ever thought that

600
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,200
if you can't finish the case,

601
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
the contract will be considered as a contract?

602
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,000
We will definitely finish the case.

603
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
I will make the contract.

604
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Do you need me to be with you?

605
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,600
No need.

606
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
I can't do this.

607
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Don't be the boss anymore.

608
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,200
Boss,

609
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,400
Mr. Ji is very anxious.

610
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,200
Why don't you go and hug him?

611
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,800
No.

612
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,200
Can you, the Northlanders,

613
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,000
come over and rest for us?

614
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,600
We are in a hurry.

615
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
We can't be in a hurry.

616
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,600
Can you help us?

617
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,600
Hello?

618
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,600
Hello?

619
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,200
You are the vice president of the company.

620
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
You need to hold on.

621
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,200
Otherwise, we will be in a mess.

622
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,600
Okay.

623
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Be serious.

624
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,600
The method is more difficult.

625
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
We still have time.

626
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
We will definitely solve it.

627
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,000
Mr. Su,

628
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,600
if the final application is not fixed,

629
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,400
what should we do?

630
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Don't be so stubborn.

631
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,600
We still have to think of a way to solve the problem.

632
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,400
We have to send it to the internal test tomorrow.

633
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,800
If it's not good,

634
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,600
we will be delayed by the whole progress.

635
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,600
But the progress report of Dong Yi

636
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,200
has been written and sent to the sender.

637
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,600
What should we do?

638
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,000
Dong Yi should have known.

639
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,000
I called Dong Yi's technical department

640
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,400
and asked me.

641
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
Dong Yi's technical department

642
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,000
was created by Mr. Yuan.

643
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
I think the news has been spread to the forum.

644
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Xiaozuo,

645
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,000
how can you operate the machine?

646
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,600
If we can't do it as it is,

647
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,200
can you bear the responsibility?

648
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:13,280
Is the North

649
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,680
to write a report?

650
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,680
Boss,

651
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,680
I have prepared the information

652
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,480
for the report of my work this afternoon.

653
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,680
Dong Yi's development is very stable now.

654
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,680
Mr. Yuan won't be investigating it again.

655
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,680
Let's see.

656
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,480
Sit down.

657
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
What's going on?

658
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
The situation is too sudden.

659
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,880
Xiaozuo can't remember

660
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,880
which step the problem was.

661
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,880
Who was there at the factory?

662
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,880
Xiaozuo was the one who did it.

663
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,880
Xiaozuo was the one who did it.

664
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,880
Xiaozuo was the one who did it.

665
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,280
Xiaozuo was the one who did it.

666
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,880
Xiaozuo was the one who did it.

667
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,080
Didn't the rules say that

668
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,080
two people must be at the same factory?

669
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,880
Sister Xing,

670
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,480
the financial supply factory

671
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,080
has a problem with their contract.

672
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,280
It's delayed the time to get the goods.

673
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,280
To pursue the payment,

674
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,080
I took Huang Wenwei

675
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,480
to work overtime and supply the process.

676
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,880
It's really hard to get the goods at once.

677
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,080
I just let Xiaozuo

678
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,880
operate the machine by herself.

679
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,480
Sister Xing,

680
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,280
I have the responsibility for this.

681
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,280
You have the responsibility.

682
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,680
What can we find out now?

683
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,280
The machine was just received.

684
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,080
We can't find anything.

685
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,080
Sister Xing,

686
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,480
are we going to tell Director Han

687
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,880
about the situation now?

688
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,680
We need to postpone the delivery.

689
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,280
After all, it's a special situation.

690
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,680
We can't expect it.

691
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,280
Business is about sincerity.

692
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,680
And we have a clear agreement

693
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,680
with the White Paper and Black Paper.

694
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
Because of its support,

695
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,280
we can't drop the chain.

696
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,280
No matter what,

697
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,680
we must send the tracking device

698
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
to the East China Company tomorrow.

699
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,480
Zhizhou,

700
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,480
you should send everyone to work.

701
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
Let's contact our company.

702
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,680
See if they have the same signal equipment.

703
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
We'll contact them.

704
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,280
Go.

705
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
The first stage of the East China Company

706
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,880
has been completed.

707
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,680
The cooperation between the brother and the department is very good.

708
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,280
The production department continues to

709
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,880
advance the construction of the new product line.

710
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,080
It is effective.

711
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
The sales department and the top-class sales department

712
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,880
have also improved by 8%.

713
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,680
I will continue to adjust the next stage

714
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
of the plan.

715
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,280
With sufficient model and operation.

716
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,280
Han Ting's recent work is indeed very good.

717
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,080
I think it's a good idea.

718
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,280
I think it's a good idea.

719
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,280
I think it's a good idea.

720
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,280
I think it's a good idea.

721
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,680
The implementation is very good.

722
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,480
Mr. and Mrs.

723
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,680
if there are no other problems,

724
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,280
then the meeting today will be over.

725
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,480
Since Mr. Han has been managing the company,

726
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,880
we have seen the work of the company

727
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,280
in his hands.

728
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,080
It is indeed a big smile.

729
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,080
But there is one thing

730
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,280
that I don't understand.

731
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,280
It is clearly a company of the East China Company.

732
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,280
Mr. Han should not treat the company

733
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,680
of the general company and the company of the sub-company.

734
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Mr. Zhou, what do you mean by this?

735
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,680
Actually, there is nothing big.

736
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,680
I heard that Xing Chen Technology

737
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,880
is not good at managing.

738
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,680
It caused a major problem in the printing company.

739
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,680
If I remember correctly,

740
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,480
the report of Xing Chen's promotion last month

741
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,080
mentioned that they have to

742
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,680
pursue the integration of the company

743
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,080
and send the payment to the branch.

744
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,680
Now, if the management problem

745
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,080
causes the target to not be able to be realized,

746
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,680
Mr. Han,

747
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,680
Mr. Han,

748
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,280
how can we deal with it?

749
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,680
Mr. Zhou,

750
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
the creation of the company

751
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,280
can't be avoided by causing a small problem.

752
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,880
Xing Chen has quickly made a cause-to-effect error.

753
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,080
This kind of small thing

754
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,080
is not necessary to discuss in the board meeting.

755
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,480
Mr. Han, this is not a small thing.

756
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,280
This means that the strategy of our East China Company

757
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,680
to invest Xing Chen Technology

758
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,080
exists.

759
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,680
We are doing investment,

760
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,680
not charity.

761
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,880
What we want is success and efficiency.

762
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,280
The agreement between the agreement and Xing Chen

763
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,480
is very clear.

764
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,880
If Xing Chen's pursuit of integration

765
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,280
cannot be reduced by time,

766
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,680
it means that the super-selection

767
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,880
is a violation.

768
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,080
Yes.

769
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,680
We are at least a listed company.

770
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,080
Since we chose the 3D medical printing channel,

771
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,280
we have to make some clear statements.

772
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,880
It's a good thing for Han Hai.

773
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
But we have to

774
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,480
be strict with the management.

775
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,480
If this is spread,

776
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,680
I'm afraid the stock price will be affected.

777
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,880
Don't worry, everyone.

778
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,680
Xing Chen's development progress

779
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,080
will continue to be promoted

780
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,680
according to the agreement.

781
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,680
Mr. Han,

782
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,480
we are not questioning the ability of the model.

783
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,280
But he is a technical talent.

784
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,680
I think

785
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,280
you let a technical talent

786
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,280
manage products and management

787
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,280
and make it difficult for the strong.

788
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,680
Mr. Zhou means

789
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,680
he should help the internal department

790
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,080
to attract a professional manager.

791
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,680
Mr. Yuan, you are a professional.

792
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,880
This is a good idea.

793
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,880
I said that

794
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,280
I will do it.

795
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,880
Xing Chen doesn't need to be afraid of anyone.

796
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,880
We just want to suggest a suggestion.

797
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,280
After all, you are the management of Dong Yi now.

798
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,080
If you are so determined,

799
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,280
we won't say anything else.

800
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,680
Let's just wait and see.

801
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,080
Okay, Missou.

802
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,280
What kind of a business have you decided?

803
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,680
I will head over there.

804
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,680
You can find a new boat

805
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,280
for me and many others.

806
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,680
Everybody be careful.

807
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,480
Don't be jobs farmer.

808
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,160
I need to go right now.

809
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,960
Mr. Hong,

810
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,340
I know that

811
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,800
she went for some kind of trouble,

812
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,680
but

813
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,680
do you want to remind Miss Qi?

814
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,720
No need.

815
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,660
Leave her alone again.

816
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,500
Alright.

817
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,340
Yes, Mr. Hong.

818
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,400
I'm Lili.

819
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,140
I'm not in your favor.

820
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,240
Do you have

821
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,720
free massage tools

822
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,720
that can make us we optional?

823
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,520
Yes.

824
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,880
Hello, Mr. Liu.

825
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,720
I'm Ji Xing.

826
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,760
Hello, Mr. Chen.

827
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,440

Our company is in the

modify the operation system.

830
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,160
What happens if we меньше

831
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,120
send the item tomorrow?

832
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,400
We can shark

833
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,760
if we allows.

834
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,520
Of course!

835
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:20,080
Without endlich

836
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,320
no matter the other HR issues due to the pandemic.

837
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,720
We have no private staff.

838
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:54,440
And you are to go back to

839
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,840
The company can't find the device of the same signal in a short time.

840
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,280
Du Mei.

841
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,200
Mr. Zheng from Nanyou Technology

842
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,520
agreed to our meeting.

843
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,240
Nanyou Technology is in Jingxi.

844
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,280
I have a business with them before.

845
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,000
I'll go.

846
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,560
Okay.

847
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,360
Zhizhou, you and Lili

848
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,040
can operate the machine together.

849
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,520
Okay.

850
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,400
I'll take you and Mr. Zheng

851
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400

852
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,520
Let's go now.

853
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,480
We'll buy the tickets on the way.

854
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,560

Okay.

Okay.

860
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,880
It's late now.

861
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,320
Let's go to work.

862
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,600
Xia, Xia.

863
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,680
Come with me to the lab.

864
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,240
Mr. Ji.

865
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,200
Let's go together.

866
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,600
We have a solution now.

867
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,160
We don't have to wait here.

868
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,280
Go back and have a rest.

869
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,880
We've been through a lot in the past.

870
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,280
It's still a long way.

871
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,960
Mr. Ji.

872
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,880
Can you contact us anytime?

873
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,720
We'll call you anytime.

874
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,360
Okay.

875
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,640
Let's go.

876
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,280
It's still not working.

877
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,960
I'm sorry, Mr. Ji.

878
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,120
It's okay.

879
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,120
Mr. Li and Mr. Su

880
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,160
are not going to the lab.

881
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,920
We're just getting ready to go to the lab.

882
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,480
Go and bring the instruction book of the lab.

883
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,600
I'll be responsible for the software of your machine.

884
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,400
Because there's no judgment now,

885
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,560
we'll do the same thing.

886
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,840
Your diary will only get Association Cooperation 🎶

887
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,040
I'll go and check it out.

888
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,640
Okay, everybody.

889
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,320
I can't go back.

890
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,080
Okay, the assignments...

891
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,360
What do you mean?

892
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,880
I just found out Chaixing was five years younger than you.

893
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,080
He fell in love with Hu Manqiao three days ago.

894
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,320
He usurped you.

895
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,640
Then it will be your what?

896
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,760
Hu Manqiao is at a loss for more than that.

897
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,120
He was like a village cop,

898
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,600
and he never showed any状us.

899
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,560
Most probably that's why he Berlin became the nまあ.

900
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
I'm not afraid of you.

901
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,560
I'm not afraid of you.

902
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,560
I'm not afraid of you.

00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,560
I'm not afraid of you.

904
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,560
I'm not afraid of you.

905
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,560
I'm not afraid of you.

906
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,560
I'm not afraid of you.

907
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,560
I'm not afraid of you.

908
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,560
I'm not afraid of you.

909
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,560
I'm not afraid of you.

910
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,560
I'm not afraid of you.

911
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,560
I'm not afraid of you.

912
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,560
I'm not afraid of you.

913
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,560
I'm not afraid of you.

914
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,560
I'm not afraid of you.

915
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,560
I'm not afraid of you.

916
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,560
I'm not afraid of you.

917
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,560
I'm not afraid of you.

918
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,560
I'm not afraid of you.

919
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,560
I'm not afraid of you.

920
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,560
I'm not afraid of you.

921
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,560
I'm not afraid of you.

922
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,560
I'm not afraid of you.

923
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,560
I'm not afraid of you.

924
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,560
I'm not afraid of you.

925
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,560
I'm not afraid of you.

926
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,560
I'm not afraid of you.

927
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,560
I'm not afraid of you.

928
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,560
I'm not afraid of you.

929
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,560
I'm not afraid of you.

930
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,560
I'm not afraid of you.

931
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,560
I'm not afraid of you.

932
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,560
I'm not afraid of you.

933
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,560
I'm not afraid of you.

934
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,560

I'm not afraid of you.

938
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,560
I'm not afraid of you.

939
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,560
I'm not afraid of you.

940
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,560
I'm not afraid of you.

941
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,560
I'm not afraid of you.

942
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:20,560
Let each other be fresh and happy.

943
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,560
It's all about the number of people.

944
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:32,560
We can stay.

945
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,560
We can give ourselves a chance.

946
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
Leave.

947
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,560
Don't be afraid.

948
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,560
I'm one age apart.

949
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,560
The notebook is over the siIessessessessessessessessessessessessess.

950
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,560
I'm one year apart.

951
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,560
No more than that.

952
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,560
glasses half over

953
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,560
咦

954
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,560
All men are the same age compared to the time

955
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,560
the fantasy in which the man-guards met.

956
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,560
When each person is op I ask you to review the letter

957
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,720
to see if there is what you like more
