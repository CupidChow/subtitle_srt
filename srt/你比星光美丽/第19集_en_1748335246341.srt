1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to pass through the water and you will be lost

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Even if I encounter a miracle, I will be lost in the fog

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the fog and you will be lost in the fog

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I can't see the courage in the crowd

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the fog and you will be lost in the fog

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want to forget the past and forget the original self

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to go to the sky and you will be lost in the fog

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I can't see the courage in the crowd

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the fog and you will be lost in the fog

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I want to go to the sky and you will be lost in the fog

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't give up and I will be lost in the fog

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Even if I'm lost in the fog and you will be lost in the fog

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We'll come back tomorrow and the day after tomorrow plus and so on

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The point is equal to your merciless

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We came here yesterday

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, there you are, your mistake

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What did we do yesterday?

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What did we do yesterday?

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes, we did

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll let Tang Song to deal with you in a moment

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You contact the stray stray God of Wuliu

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We'll have dinner together tomorrow night

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Boss, President Ji asked you to be at the Sita S store in Longshan Road

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Why didn't you say it earlier?

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Because you said the meeting was more important today

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So he didn't let me in

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Boss, President Ji

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Open the interview

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Tang Peizhu, Han Zhong is here

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I have something to do, I've delayed it for ten minutes

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay, okay, I'll wait for you

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hurry up

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Waiter

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Hello

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hello, I ordered ice cream

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay, wait a minute

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I said it's a little bit of sugar

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's a little bit salty

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's a little bit salty

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's a little bit salty

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's a little bit salty

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's a little bit salty

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sorry

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000

Fuyun

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hello

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Do you have a charger?

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes, just a little bit

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Thank you

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm here

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Did you leave?

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Sorry

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The number you dialed is powered off

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Fuyun

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Is there any other branch here?

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No, sir

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Are you looking for someone?

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
There is a star ice cream store on the way to Qianongshan

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's ice cream

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Someone often runs wrong

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
How to go?

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I went wrong

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is the star ice cream store on the way to Qianongshan

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There is a star ice cream store on the way to Qianongshan

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The ice cream store next door

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I've been waiting for you there for a long time

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I also often have a marriage

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Fuyun

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Coming

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Boss

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What's wrong?

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm sorry

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sorry

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm sorry

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Boss

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Boss, where are you going?

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm going to see you off

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Ji Xin

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If you want to see me again

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You can send me a message

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm waiting for you

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let's meet up together

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's go

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay

91
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Let's go

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Okay, okay

93
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You've already been kicked out of three places

94
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Can you still kick out?

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I can't kick out

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm fine

97
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll practice hard when I get back

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll get them all back next time

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't do it again

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're so bad at drinking

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Don't force yourself again

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll call a cab for you

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll send you back later

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Sister Li Li

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I just want to see them hang out with you

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I can't help but go upstairs and fight

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I said

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll protect you

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Su Zhizhou

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Thank you for your help today

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But we're just colleagues

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You don't have to do that

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I know

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Sister Li Li

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Maybe I'm not that good

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But I'm willing to open up to you

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I really

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't have any chance

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I have a boyfriend

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And I'm sure of my feelings

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Don't waste time on me

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You'll give me pressure

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
for this kind of single-sided service

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You'll feel very painful

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I hope we can be together in the future

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll be there for you

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll see you again

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Bye

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Are you the cab for you?

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Master, wait

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Can you still go?

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Master

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
My friend is drunk

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Please be careful

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Aren't you leaving?

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I have something to do

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You have to be careful

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Can I go to your house?

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I understand

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Then

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll bring some food tomorrow

144
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and make some food for you

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay?

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll hang up

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
See you

148
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll be back

149
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
See you

150
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Then

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
when you open up

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
go to the live show

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
When you open up

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
come to me

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Why do you work?

156
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
After you open up

157
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
come to me for a day

158
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
to do live show

159
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes

160
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Brother

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What are you looking at?

162
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Brother

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What are you looking at?

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Look at the girl

165
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What kind of girl do you see?

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Just a glance

167
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You go first

168
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Come on

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
She's really pretty

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Why didn't you notice before?

171
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You're so pretty

172
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Qiu Zi

173
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Why are you here?

174
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Brother Yichen

175
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I know you are

176
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
in the center of the innovation center

177
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
of the Hong Kong Hospital

178
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
in Beizhan

179
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I just had a uncle

180
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
working in the hospital in Hong Kong

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I just

182
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
got some information from him

183
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Maybe it can help you

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Can I go in?

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Please come in

187
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The information is here

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I bought some desserts for you

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
They say

190
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
people should eat sweets

191
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
when they are in the brain

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
They can stimulate

193
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
the多班分米

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and improve memory

195
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Thank you

196
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You're welcome

197
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
when you are with me

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I think you are

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
quite busy with your study

200
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and you are quite busy at home

201
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm sorry

202
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I really

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
don't have time to clean up

204
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll help you

205
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You can sit here

206
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
How can I?

207
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You can sit here

208
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Why?

209
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'll do it

210
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Brother Yichen

211
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Even if you can't be a couple

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
we are good friends

213
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Right?

214
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We are good friends

215
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We should help each other

216
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I have a job here

217
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll treat you to a big meal

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
when you succeed

219
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Okay

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'll trouble you

221
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Read the book

222
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and see

223
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
if the information

224
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
can help you

225
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Okay

226
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Xixi

227
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What are you doing?

228
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm opening the restaurant

229
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He said

230
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
you have a schedule

231
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's 4.30 p.m.

232
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You go upstairs

233
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and I'll take you there

234
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I won't go

235
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I have

236
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
some work to do

237
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
later

238
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Sister Li is pregnant

239
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I can't hide myself

240
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Let's go together

241
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Okay

242
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You go first

243
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'll feed you after I finish

244
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Okay

245
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'll go first

246
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You go first

247
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Okay

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'll go first

249
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You go upstairs first

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
By the way

251
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Please give her a gift

252
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Okay

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You go first

254
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Okay

255
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't know

256
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
what to do

257
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't know

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
what to do

259
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't know

260
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
how long

261
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'll be waiting

262
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
No

263
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The music is good today

264
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll be waiting

265
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What do you want to drink later

266
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Tell me

267
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'll be waiting

268
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'll be waiting

269
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Hey

270
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Xiao Tianding

271
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Here

272
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Big brother

273
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You're finally here

274
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You're here

275
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You brought a gift

276
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
How is it?

277
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Light, music, sound, equipment

278
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
The first four industries

279
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
are all white-skinned

280
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Today

281
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
they are all my friends

282
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
They speak more secretive

283
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and noisy

284
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
If you want to be quiet

285
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I set up a VIP room

286
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
which is the most suitable for you

287
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
High mountain ice

288
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's so fresh today

289
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I have to get a big one

290
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
first

291
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Why don't you play here first

292
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'll find her friend

293
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Xiaobao

294
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Mr. Han is here

295
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Where is Ji Xin?

296
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Ji Xin said she just came back

297
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and she has something to do

298
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
She asked me to bring you

299
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
a business gift

300
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Thank you

301
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And mine

302
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're welcome

303
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'll take you to the VIP room first

304
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Let's go

305
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let's go

306
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Big brother

307
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Let's go together

308
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm done

309
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm coming

310
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
How about this?

311
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What?

312
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Give me a break

313
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Let's go

314
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Let's go

315
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Let's go

316
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Come on

317
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This is the 5 Jins

318
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
that I specially wanted to get for you

319
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Too lame

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
All right

321
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Don't need to prepare for me

322
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Jiubao is doing well

323
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Keep trying

324
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm going

325
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You just came and left

326
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't drink

327
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll give you a ride

328
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
There's still something in the company

329
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Let's go

330
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,920
Hurry up.

331
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,960
We're on the way.

332
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
We're almost there.

333
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,160
Why are you back?

334
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,960
You said that

335
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,160
what kind of dream is this?

336
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,560
A dream.

337
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,600
A dream.

338
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,480
Okay, then sit down.

339
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,080
What?

340
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,240
I'll take you out to see your friend.

341
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,840
Say hello.

342
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,440
Let's go.

343
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:20,800
Let's go.

344
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,440
You're so cute.

345
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,760
Thank you.

346
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,560
Thank you.

347
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,320
Good luck.

348
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:30,640
Good luck.

349
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,160
Good luck.

350
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:31,960
Good.

351
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,280
Not bad, right?

352
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:34,560
Not bad.

353
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,280
The sky in the distance

354
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,840
is warm and beautiful.

355
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,480
I want to meet you.

356
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,000
Qingqing.

357
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Thank you for your gift.

358
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,600
VIP is over there.

359
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,240
You go in first.

360
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,040
I'll come right away.

361
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,280
Okay.

362
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,840
Let's see the big stage.

363
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,320
Thank you.

364
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,200
I'll go there first.

365
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,760
Okay.

366
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,720
Come here.

367
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,680
Coming.

368
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,640
Yin Zeng.

369
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Mr. Han.

370
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,080
Sit down.

371
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,160
You don't drink wine, do you?

372
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,360
I invested in this wine bar.

373
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,480
Let's have a look.

374
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,560
Hello.

375
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,680
Your strawberry is special.

376
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,400
Please enjoy.

377
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,840
Thank you.

378
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,680
It's been so long.

379
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,240
I know he doesn't like strawberries.

380
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,440
I ordered it.

381
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,320
I love strawberries

382
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,280
when I was in college.

383
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,920
Yes.

384
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,600
It's so stressful.

385
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
I want to eat some sweet food.

386
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,080
I want to relieve my stress.

387
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,280
It's a good thing.

388
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,040
Here.

389
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,520
What's up?

390
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,040
There's a tea angef to Germany.

391
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,920
It seems interesting.

392
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,040
Interesting?

393
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What are you going to do?

394
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,200
Study.

395
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,200
Study is the purpose.

396
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,400
What do you mean?

397
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,680
Study is good.

398
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,480
Good.

399
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,640
You should try it yourself.

400
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Mr. Han,

401
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
do you think we have no common language

402
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
except for work?

403
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,600
No.

404
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,000
How about playing a game?

405
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What game?

406
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
We'll pour something in this cup later.

407
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The wheel will blow the air out.

408
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The last one will be lost.

409
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Drink the special drink.

410
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,600
How is it?

411
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,200
Good.

412
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,600
Let's start.

413
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
No alcohol.

414
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Wait for me.

415
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Here's a exciting one.

416
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Soy sauce.

417
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Apple vinegar.

418
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Salt.

419
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Milk.

420
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Galic.

421
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Honey.

422
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Moisturizing.

423
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Moisturizing.

424
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Coffee powder.

425
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Chili sauce.

426
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Milk.

427
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Who wants first?

428
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You first.

429
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'll go first.

430
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'll go first.

431
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'll go first.

432
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Come on.

433
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'll go first.

434
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I lost.

435
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,080
queuing

436
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,840
tastes special

437
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,800
Very special.

438
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,800
Time to eat.

439
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,000
Good cooking.

440
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,800
Have a taste.

441
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,800
What's this?

442
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,800
Shrimp.

443
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,560
It's good.

444
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,160
Have a taste.

445
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:23,960
Qiao Xiaoxiao,

446
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,960
I liked

447
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,640
your呀 Scact變.

448
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,440
Not bad.

449
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,840
I've been thinking about our relationship.

450
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,840
I taught my boyfriend to be calm and calm.

451
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,840
We were happy and we were happy.

452
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,840
We were just happy to go to the free world.

453
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,840
We didn't have any expectations of understanding each other.

454
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
As long as I can make him happy, that's fine.

455
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
But since I met you,

456
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,840
I've done a lot of things that I've done.

457
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,840
I've done a lot of things that I want to know more and more.

458
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,840
I've done a lot of things that I want to know more and more.

459
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840
I've done a lot of things that I want to know more and more.

460
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,840
Now I feel very unfamiliar.

461
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,840
But you're still the same.

462
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
It's different.

463
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840
I've been changing my mind lately.

464
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,840
I'm not like before.

465
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
Li Li,

466
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,840
understanding each other needs time.

467
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,840
I don't want to be a stranger anymore.

468
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,840
Our relationship is destined to end, right?

469
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,840
It won't end.

470
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,840
You're saying this now.

471
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,840
It's just that we can't be apart for a while.

472
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,840
Li Li,

473
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,840
I want to be serious with you.

474
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
Let's be together.

475
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,840
If you care about each other,

476
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
and don't dare to take it out on you,

477
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,840
I'll ask you to be serious with me.

478
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
Please be my little girlfriend.

479
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
From now on,

480
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,840
we'll be a good couple.

481
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
Li Li,

482
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,840
are you willing to be my girlfriend?

483
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
I'm willing.

484
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
I'm willing.

485
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
I'm willing.

486
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
I'm willing.

487
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,840
I'm willing.

488
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,840
I'll take you to see

489
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,840
our director Wei,

490
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
Director Wei.

491
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
I'm looking for you.

492
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,840
Director Wei,

493
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
he's the director of

494
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,840
the clinical trial and operation.

495
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,840
He's the CEO of

496
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,840
the new technology of the research and development team.

497
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
Hello, Director Wei.

498
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
Hello.

499
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,840
This is Director Li of our sales department.

500
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Hello.

501
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,840
Director, the report is ready.

502
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,840
The assistant will be back soon.

503
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,840
The rest is to be discussed with you later.

504
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
Okay.

505
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
I'll be back soon.

506
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
You can talk to her.

507
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
Okay.

508
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
Ji Qing.

509
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,840
You know each other?

510
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
We are...

511
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
We are...

512
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
We are new friends.

513
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
What a coincidence.

514
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,840
This is the assistant doctor of our director Wei,

515
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
Shao Yichen.

516
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
Since we know each other,

517
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,840
it's more convenient to communicate.

518
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840
Yes.

519
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
Well,

520
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
you can talk first.

521
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
I have something to do.

522
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
I'll be back soon.

523
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
You can go back to work.

524
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Sit here.

525
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,840
How are you doing?

526
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,840
I'm fine.

527
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
Xing Chen is not as good as before.

528
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,840
Why are you here?

529
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,840
I just transferred from the People's Hospital.

530
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,840
This is the center of the innovation research of Google.

531
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,840
And Director Wei and my teacher are good friends.

532
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,840
So she recommended me here.

533
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,840
I will also participate in

534
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,840
some innovation project clinical trial.

535
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
But I didn't expect

536
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,840
that the first institution of cooperation

537
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,840
would be you.

538
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,840
What?

539
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
You don't know we are Xing Chen.

540
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
You want to quit?

541
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,840
No. How can I?

542
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,840
Then please be my assistant director.

543
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
No need to be polite.

544
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,840
I'll be your assistant director.

545
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
It's okay.

546
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
Mr. Han.

547
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,440
Xing Chen's first case of

548
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,840
clinical trial operation

549
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,840
is scheduled to start at 9 am tomorrow morning.

550
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
If you have time,

551
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
why don't you come to the

552
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,840
Hong Kong Hospital to have a joint test?

553
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
It's 8 pm now.

554
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,840
You can tell the truth at the right time.

555
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,840
Sorry. I forgot to do it.

556
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
It's okay.

557
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
The second case of investment is already here.

558
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
I'm not afraid.

559
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,840
You can do it.

560
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,840
Sorry.

561
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,840
I knew you would make a reservation

562
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
in advance

563
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
next time.

564
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Please look at the situation.

565
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,840
Look at the situation.

566
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
You are so beautiful.

567
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
You look so handsome.

568
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
You are so beautiful.

569
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
You are so beautiful.

570
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,840
You are so beautiful.

571
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,840
You are so beautiful.

572
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
Look at the situation.

573
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,840
Can you come or not?

574
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,840
Do you want to go or not?

575
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
He Sun is here.

576
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,840
It's too crowded.

577
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
What's wrong?

578
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,840
Is he here?

579
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,840
He is here.

580
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,840
The operation is at the door.

581
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Mr. Han is here.

582
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
He is in the office.

583
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
Let's go.

584
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Hurry up.

585
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
What about the patients in front?

586
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
The situation is back.

587
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
It's better.

588
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Sorry. I'm late.

589
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,840
Jingxing, come and sit.

590
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,840
Sit.

591
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
Let's continue, Dr. Shao.

592
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
Okay.

593
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
The advantages of the Taihe Gold material

594
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,840
are high in terms of the performance.

595
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,840
The stock and small grain structure

596
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
are good for the stock.

597
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
Yes.

598
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
I've seen

599
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
the fusion equipment Mr. Su brought.

600
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
It's very suitable

601
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,840
for our product.

602
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
How about this?

603
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
I'll go and prepare it.

604
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
Okay.

605
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
Don't worry.

606
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
I'll go and prepare it.

607
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
Don't worry.

608
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,840
No problem.

609
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,840
The doctor's team is very determined.

610
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
I only knew later

611
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840
that Professor Wei's assistant is him.

612
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
But Shao Yicheng is very professional.

613
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,840
The evaluation is so high.

614
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
High?

615
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,840
Are you confident?

616
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,840
But I'm still a little nervous.

617
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,840
I feel like I'm in a test.

618
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,840
How long have you been in the hospital?

619
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,840
Half an hour.

620
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,840
In the future,

621
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,840
under the pretext of quality insurance,

622
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,840
the processing of single-duty products

623
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,840
may be short-lived.

624
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Okay.

625
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,840
Yes.

626
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Don't be nervous.

627
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
How is the place?

628
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
The operation is very successful.

629
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,840
I'm very nervous.

630
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,840
The operation is very successful.

631
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,840
Okay.

632
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:07,960
The trace of the

633
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
Thank you, Dr. Wang.

634
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
Thank you.

635
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,840
Thank you so much.

636
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,840
In the future,

637
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,840
you can give him a chance.

638
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,840
But he may not be able to stand up in his life.

639
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,840
Remember,

640
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,840
your company will definitely be very good.

641
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
Good people are good.

642
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,840
As long as the goods are well-cured,

643
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
there is no problem at all.

644
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
Thank you, Director Wei.

645
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,840
Thank you, Dr. Shao.

646
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
You've worked hard.

647
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,840
Shao,

648
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,840
wait a minute.

649
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,840
I'll talk to them about the subsequent business.

650
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
I'll make a point here.

651
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
Okay.

652
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
You can do it.

653
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,840
Okay.

654
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,840
Thank you, Dr. Wang.

655
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,840
I'll change my clothes.

656
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,840
We'll talk in the office later.

657
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,840
I'll answer the phone.

658
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,840
You can talk first.

659
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
Congratulations.

660
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840
This time, the clinical trial is so successful.

661
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,840
Your fusion treatment is not possible.

662
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
Please sit down.

663
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,840
Director Wei said that

664
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,840
the subsequent clinical trial

665
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,840
needs to be done.

666
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
We can continue to cooperate.

667
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Great.

668
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
The fusion treatment was successful.

669
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
It was the first step.

670
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,840
Later,

671
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,840
we need to continue to follow the patient's recovery

672
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,840
and the condition of the treatment.

673
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,840
We can't lose our confidence, right?

674
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,840
Dr. Shao.

675
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
Yes.

676
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,840
Mr. Han is right.

677
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
Okay.

678
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
It's okay. We'll go first.

679
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
Xin.

680
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,840
How about we call the small businessmen

681
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,840
to have a meal together

682
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,840
and celebrate the performance?

683
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
Mr. Han.

684
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Mr. Yiqian.

685
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
If you have time, come with me.

686
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,840
Okay.

687
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,840
Let's have a meal together.

688
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,840
No problem.

689
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,840
It's a good day anyway.

690
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
It's worth celebrating.

691
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,840
Sorry, Mr. Han.

692
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,840
Mr. Han has already pushed

693
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
all the procedures today.

694
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,840
There are still many things to be done later.

695
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,840
I'm sorry. I'll make a reservation in advance.

696
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
It's okay.

697
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
I just think

698
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,840
the celebration is a little early now.

699
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
The patient who said that

700
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,840
he would continue to observe the procedure.

701
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,840
I guess Dr. Shao

702
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
must not have time to eat, right?

703
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Don't worry about that.

704
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,840
I will definitely

705
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
continue to observe

706
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,840
the patient's subsequent situation.

707
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,840
But I still have things to do in the hospital.

708
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
I won't participate

709
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,840
in today's celebration.

710
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
I'm sorry, everyone.

711
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,840
Okay.

712
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
Let's wait for the full performance

713
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,840
next time.

714
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Okay.

715
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
Let's go have a meal.

716
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,840
Okay.

717
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
Let's go.

718
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Let's go.

719
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
Well,

720
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,840
maybe we can

721
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,840
contact you later.

722
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Okay. Don't worry.

723
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
Bye.

724
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
By the way,

725
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,840
there are also a few

726
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,840
secret secret rooms

727
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
in the East Yang.

728
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
I'll give it to you.

729
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,840
But the clinical experiment

730
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
just started.

731
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I think we should focus on

732
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
the operation of the secret rooms first.

733
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
Get in the car.

734
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Xing,

735
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,840
you and Mr. Han are new ladies.

736
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
I can go to the secret rooms.

737
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,840
Okay. I'll send you the location.

738
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
Where's Xing Xing?

739
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
Why are you alone?

740
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
They are new ladies.

741
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
They sent me a address.

742
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,840
Let's go together.

743
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,840
I'll call the car now.

744
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,840
You go by yourself.

745
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,840
I won't go.

746
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
My boyfriend is here.

747
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
I'll go first.

748
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,840
Mr. Ren.

749
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
I didn't expect

750
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
you are so stubborn.

751
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
Mr. Yue, please don't worry.

752
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,840
This gift is my personal wish.

753
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
There won't be any problem.

754
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
I'll send it to you.

755
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
Okay.

756
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
Mr. Ren.

757
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Mr. Ren.

758
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,840
Mr. Ren.

759
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,840
Mr. Ren.

760
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,840
I'm a good person.

761
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840
I won't disturb him.

762
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
Sit down.

763
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,840
Please.

764
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
What's the matter, Mr. Chang?

765
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
I just heard that

766
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,840
Xing Chen Technology's first low-key clinical experiment operation

767
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
is successful.

768
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,840
Mr. Ren, don't you worry?

769
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,840
What's there to worry about?

770
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
Our company is successful

771
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
in the fall.

772
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
I'm happy to be here.

773
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,840
Of course I'm worried about you.

774
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840
Since Han Ting returned to China,

775
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,840
you've done well.

776
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,840
And you've cleared

777
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
the core team

778
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,840
of Mr. Yuan.

779
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,840
If you let him go,

780
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,840
aren't you afraid

781
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,840
Mr. Yuan will be replaced

782
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,840
by Zhao Yi and Han Ting?

783
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,840
Mr. Chang.

784
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,840
Let's talk straight.

785
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,840
I want to join hands with you

786
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
and pull Han Ting

787
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,840
from the top of the East Bank's CEO's position.

788
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,840
I don't think

789
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,840
you've heard

790
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,840
what you said just now.

791
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,840
Why?

792
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,840
Are you

793
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,840
suddenly

794
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
trying to get away from Han Ting

795
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,840
because of your identity?

796
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,840
You've done a great job

797
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
in the East Bank.

798
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,840
I don't believe

799
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
you'll let the 10-year-old

800
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
Dong Yi go.

801
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,840
Tong Ke and Dong Yi

802
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
are competitors for years.

803
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,840
They're close friends.

804
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
You should know that.

805
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
You should know that.

806
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,840
Mr. Yuan is so beautiful.

807
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,840
I'll just say it.

808
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,840
You're not moving now.

809
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,840
It's just that Han Ting

810
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,840
can't play with his military skills.

811
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,840
He's waiting for him to play with himself.

812
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,840
But Mr. Yuan,

813
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,840
I want to ask you one more thing.

814
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,840
Are you sure?

815
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,840
Han Ting is your brother.

816
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,840
You know him better than I do.

817
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
He'll really do a great job

818
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,840
and wait for you to push him to the end.

819
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
I dare to say

820
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,840
that if he dares to do this to you,

821
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,840
he'll definitely be able to complete the bet.

822
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,840
One more thing.

823
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,840
Someone has recently

824
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,840
received Dong Yi's funeral

825
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,840
in the market.

826
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,840
Do you think

827
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,840
who is the owner of this tomb?

828
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,840
Mr. Yuan treats Han Ting as his family.

829
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,840
But Han Ting

830
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,840
is not in charge of this.

831
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
The Han family's business

832
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,840
is not to bother Mr. Chang for a long time, is it?

833
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,840
It's worse for him to upset Han Ting than Han Ting now.

834
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
Do you think

835
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
he really does his job well

836
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,840
and starts to try?

837
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,840
We silly kids

838
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
will never have

839
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,840
a confidant like Han Ting,

840
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,840
which is tight-knocked.

841
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Not even a yielding disease one can buy.

842
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,040
I won't make others suffer.

843
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,440
I can wait.

844
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,480
When will Mr. Yan change his mind?

845
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,600
Come to me for tea at any time.

846
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,560
Good tea.

847
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,680
Call me if you have any questions.

848
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,240
Okay.

849
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,800
Okay.

850
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,480
Okay?

851
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,080
Bro,

852
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,600
I've been watching you for half a day.

853
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,720
You've been drinking all night.

854
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,600
What's the difference?

855
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,600
I didn't guess it wrong.

856
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,000
You're a little sleepy.

857
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Tell me.

858
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,000
It's not you.

859
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Who are you?

860
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,000
I'm just a passer-by.

861
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,400
Let's meet at our age.

862
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,600
Just tell me.

863
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,200
A bottle of whiskey and a drumstick.

864
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,800
Okay.

865
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,000
It's your turn.

866
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,800
Mine.

867
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,600
Tell me.

868
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,800
Anyway, we don't know each other.

869
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,200
It's not embarrassing to tell you.

870
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,800
I like a girl.

871
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,000
Her name is nice.

872
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,400
Her name is Li Li.

873
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,800
I'm talking to you.

874
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,200
Leave.

875
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,800
Don't be afraid.

876
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,800
Have a hard time with each other.

877
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,800
Make a decision.

878
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:21,400
Love is a cross between us.

879
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,800
I don't want to.

880
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,800
I don't want to.

881
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,800
I don't want to.

882
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,800
I don't want to.

883
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,800
I don't want to.

884
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,800
I don't want to.

885
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,800
I don't want to.

886
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,800
I don't want to.

887
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,800
I don't want to.

888
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,800
I don't want to.

889
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,800
I don't want to.

890
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,800
I don't want to.

891
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,800
I don't want to.

892
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,800
I don't want to.

893
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,800
I don't want to.
