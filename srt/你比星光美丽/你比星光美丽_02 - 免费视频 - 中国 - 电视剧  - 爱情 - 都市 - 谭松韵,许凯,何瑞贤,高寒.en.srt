(Laosi Wonton Shop)

00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,200
This is a very chic shop.

25
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,810
So much fancy food in Xingyue

26
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,120
can't be as good as wonton, huh?

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
I just love this.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,720
So, in Germany, you kept talking

29
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,720
about this wonton shop.

30
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,250
Would you like some? Tastes great.

31
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,250
No, thanks. I had a lot at dinner.

32
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,810
Sir, a glass of water, please.

33
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,770
OK.

34
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,250
Mr. Li is always trouble.

35
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,970
He's so close to your cousin.

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,970
Obviously, he invited you tonight

37
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,330
to persuade you because you skipped

38
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,170
the board meeting.

39
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,090
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

40
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,370
Really unnecessary.

41
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,880
When we meet privately,

42
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,530
why do we look like we have an affair?

43
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,330
Thanks for the gorilla.

44
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,250
That's a lamp.

45
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,810
Don't you think it's chic?

46
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,680
If they know

47
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
you're the real boss of Xingyue Club

48
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,490
and I've actually made

49
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,530
the fragmented investments

50
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,970
on your behalf,

51
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,000
will it be exciting?

52
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,160
Thanks for everything. Anyway, our effort

53
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,600
will finally pay off.

54
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,400

Hanhai's first batch of cages

59
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,880
will be put into the market.

60
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,600
We've financed Hanhai for five years.

61
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,720
Finally, we can reap the benefits.

62
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,120
I can't wait to see the look on those people

63
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,050
when they know you are

64
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,440
the real boss of Hanhai Technology.

Ji Xing, the girl Zeng Di

66
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,000
took there tonight.

67
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,930
Did you know her before?

68
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,530
A stranger

69
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,490
wouldn't make Mr. Han

70
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,810
concede and give in.

71
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,280
If you only wanted

72
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,400
to flatter Mr. Zhao,

73
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,650
that would be too much.

74
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,210
College friend.

75
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,930
You have a story, huh?

76
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,400
When he and I were in college,

77
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,530
we at least worked together

78
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,840
to win a national award.

79
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,880
What about now?

80
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,160
He pretended he didn't know me
and even kicked me out.

81
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,490
Back from Germany,

82
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,770
he's now a lofty boss.

83
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,930
Impressive.

84
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,560
Is it a shame to know me?

85
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,650
He kicked you out.

86
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,920
Are you sure he recognized you?

87
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,570
I had no cosmetic surgery.

88
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,920
Have I changed a lot?

89
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,770
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

90
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,720
Glad I left. Or I would be embarrassed.

91
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,530
Come on. You're to blame, too.

92
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,010
You've worked in Guanghua for years.

93
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,970
Why did you never think

94
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,160
of checking the investor?

95
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,770
She's a mere employee.

96
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,040
It's normal that she didn't.

97
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,530
Did you have a good relationship then?

98
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,770
Hello, senior. I'm Ji Xing.

99
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,720
I'm here for duty.

100
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,530
Senior, according to the email,

101
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,800
a medical student

102
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,920
named Han Ting

103
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,760
will work with us.

104
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,800
A medical student also knows about robots?

105
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,440
A little bit.

106
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,530
Nice to meet you. I'm Han Ting.

107
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,920
He and I are

108
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,600
barely fellows at Xinggang University.

109
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,760
Barely?

110
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,730
Why?

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,210
We majored differently.

112
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,890
We had the only intersection

113
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,450
in the winter vacation of sophomore

114
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,010
when we signed up for National College Student

115
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,450
AI Creative Competition.

116
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,840
We won the first place.

117
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,020
(Jialin University, Xinggang University)

118
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,240
Do you have time tonight?

119
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,330
- Let's have dinner.
- OK.

120
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,450
- OK.
- I'll make us a reservation.

121
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,320
Sure.

122
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,730
Han Ting,

123
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,400
shall we have dinner tonight?

124
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,080
OK.

125
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,800
I'll send you the address of the restaurant.

126
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,010
That night, we were supposed

127
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,850
to dine together.

128
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,920
But when I was back home,

129
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,360
something unexpected happened.

130
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,410
Ji Xing,

131
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,450
can you be my girlfriend?

132
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,440
No way.

133
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,410
Han Ting.

134
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:33,810
Grandpa.

135
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,130
The Commercial College in Germany

136
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
finally agreed to give you

137
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,720
an extra admission.

138
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,690
You get an exceptional offer.

139
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,480
You'll enroll in three days.

140
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,920
Get packed quickly.

141
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,160
We'll fly to Beijing tonight.

142
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,240
Grandpa.

143
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,800
Can I go a few days later?

144
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,160
Nothing can be more important

145
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,010
than your overseas education.

146
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,320
Waste no time.

147
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,290
(Ji Xing, I'm going to study in Germany.)

148
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,360
(I'd be leaving too hastily to dine with you.)

149
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,940
(I'll be back every vacation. Keep in touch.)

150
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,890
How did she reply?

151
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,280
She didn't text back

152
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,920
or answer the phone.

153
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,360
He stood us up

154
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,480
and didn't dine with us.

155
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,210
This time, he kicked me out.

156
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,090
Rather unsparing.

157
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,330
Did you pretend you didn't know her

158
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,330
because that was

159
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,650
a very complicated gathering

160
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,770
in case she was involved?

161
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,400
You hated it when Mr. Zhao groped her.

162
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,920
So, you asked Zeng Di to get her away,

163
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,760
right?

164
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,370
Oh, Xing.

165
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,920
Aren't you curious

166
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
about why he left

167
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,010
without telling you?

168
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,970
I'm curious, actually.

169
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,650
But it doesn't matter.

170
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,570
We weren't very close, after all.

171
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,600
Did you not have

172
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,840
any feelings for each other?

173
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,130
What feelings?

174
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,530
Love feelings.

175
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,840
What are you thinking?

176
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
Stop your wild imagination,

177
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,200
Tu Xiaomeng.

178
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:14,890
Then why do you mind

179
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,090
his sending you away?

180
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,650
If someone manipulates you as he wishes,

181
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,650
won't you feel bad?

182
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,090
The point is, Miss Zeng promised me.

183
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,970
If I contribute to the cooperation

184
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,160
with Mr. Zhao,

185
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,010
she'll double my project bonus.

186
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,800
Double!

187
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,840
Now, I can have nothing.

188
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,810
My flat

189
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,840
has lost a toilet.

190
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,760
At least a toilet.

191
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,410
Come on. Stop thinking.

192
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,690
You will make money.

193
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,600
Yeah.

194
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,880
Getting angry with him

195
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,050
isn't worth it.

196
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,000
I was this close to my bonus,

197
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,840
but it's gone.

198
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,450
Even if he kept you there,

199
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,170
you might not take Mr. Zhao,

200
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,050
right?

201
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,050
- Yeah.
- What if I did?

202
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,240
Hey, what is your problem?

203
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,760
- Why do you defend him?
- Enough.

204
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,760
Come on. Cheers.

205
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,520
To...

206
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,810
Let me make more money

207
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,690
to buy the toilet.

208
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,530
To the toilet. Right.

209
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,410
(You adore her, don't you?)

210
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,880
(Laosi)

211
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,120
Watch fewer idol dramas.

212
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,570
That's my only hobby.

213
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,090
Don't always complain about it.

214
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,410
Tell me. Do you adore her?

215
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,840
It was years ago.

216
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,290
She had no feelings for me at that time.

217
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,760
She didn't even text back.

218
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,410
She must have forgotten me.

219
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,570
(Hey, is it possible)

220
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,090
(that she didn't receive your text)

221
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,480
(by coincidence?)

222
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,170
(There aren't so many coincidences.)

223
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,170
(What's gone is gone.)

224
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,210
(She and I are just strangers.)

225
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,880
(You just deny it.)

226
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,820
(Ji Xing)

227
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,090
(A new number, indeed.)

(Twinkle Little Star)

230
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,690
Can't I just have a good sleep?

231
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,360
Such an unlucky day for me.

232
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,620
(I've accepted your friend request.)

233
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:44,740
(I'm Han Ting.)

(Creditor, Done)

235
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,220
(How much to pay for the scratches?)
(Pay for the scratches.)

236
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,500
(How will scratches be assessed?)

237
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,340
(The maintenance costs for car scratches.)

238
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,600
I'm sorry for this morning.

239
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,210
(Ji Xing)
Was your boss late?

240
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,570
(Creditor)
Everything was just fine.

241
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,050
Glad to know it.

242
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,360
How much

243
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,000
(Ji Xing)
shall I pay?

244
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,000
(Creditor)
Not settled yet.

245
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,010
Don't worry.

246
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,210
Boss is nice. He won't extort your money.

247
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,760
He better be.

248
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,320
Thank you.

249
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,760
(Ji Xing)
A great boss like him

250
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,450
will always be rich.

(Dongyang Group)

252
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,120
Xing, you know what?

253
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,810
Our investor Han Ting

254
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,240
works on the top floor.

255
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,690
Maybe we can often meet him.

256
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,880
Even thinking of it excites me.

257
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,840
Do you feel the same way?

258
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,480
Not really.

259
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,450
He's so handsome.

260
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,570
Cool guy with long legs.

261
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,720
Isn't he? So cool.

262
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,000
R&D fellows,

263
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,930
listen to me.

264
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,120
Some good news for you.

265
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,410
Miss Zeng got the cooperation

266
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,480
between Bay and Ren'ai Hospital.

267
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,410
This weekend,

268
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,720
we'll hold a celebration party.

269
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,000
After that,

270
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,570
we'll work with Director Zhu
of the Sales Department

271
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,840
on the project thing.

272
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,570
Guys, I'll count on you

273
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:00,810
for your support.

274
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,650
No problem.

275
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,930
Come to my office.

276
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,980
(Meeting Room 1)

277
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,600
Did you read about the news of Hanhai?

278
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,330
3D medical printing...

279
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,690
Our company

280
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,760
should follow up, perhaps.

281
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,770
Ms. He,

282
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,970
we can't imitate

283
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,570
whatever others make.

284
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,360
Our company has developed for decades

285
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,720
and grown bigger.

286
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,520
Why?

287
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,520
Because we specialize.

288
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,240
Hanhai Technology was founded five years ago.

289
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,880
It has just launched its first product.

290
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,410
Such a poor input-output ratio...

291
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,690
I guess you can understand.

292
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,360
Sorry, I'm late.

293
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,290
The last board meeting was canceled

294
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,330
and I didn't see you in the first place.

295
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,410
I'm very sorry.

296
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,720
It's OK.

297
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,290
All the directors can understand.

298
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,520
You were in Germany for ten years, after all.

299
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,970
When you just came back,
you took over Dongyang Medical.

300
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,240
You need time to get familiar

301
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,720
with the domestic environment.

302
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,930
Today, this board meeting is held

303
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,570
because I want these seniors

304
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,760
to give you some advice.

305
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,170
Mr. Han,

306
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,720
you stayed abroad for a long time

307
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:30,880
with little experience.

308
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,840
You may not know a lot

309
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,330
about China's medical market.

310
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,120
You need your cousin's advice.

311
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,170
Mr. Han, if you insist

312
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,120
on going your own way

313
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,600
and getting Dongyang Medical in trouble,

314
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,170
I don't think

315
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,480
anyone present

316
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,170
will approve.

317
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,760
For me,

318
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,290
as long as he helps me make money,

319
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,970
a lot of money,

320
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,090
I'm OK with anything.

321
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,880
If I can't make money,

322
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,880
I won't be able to help.

323
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,360
I guess you guys think

324
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,520
the same way, huh?

325
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,090
You're right.

326
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,720
Revenue matters most for Dongyang.

327
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,090
Yuan and directors,

328
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,810
I've brought you

329
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,880
a present for our first meeting.

330
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,290
It'll be shown on the screen

331
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,290
in front of you.

332
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,330
When I was in Germany,

333
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,450
by accident,

334
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,810
I invested in Guanghua and invented Bay.

335
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
Since I'm the CEO

336
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,090
of Dongyang Medical,

337
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,210
I've decided to merge Guanghua into it.

338
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,170
Now, you're reading

339
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,240
the Letter of Intent

340
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,090
(Letter of Intent)
between Xinggang Hospital and Bay.

341
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,930
Besides Xinggang Hospital,

342
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,480
some other medical institutions

343
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,240
have shown great interest

344
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,480
in applying Bay

345
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,120
to the existing healthcare system.

346
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,130
What's more,

347
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,330
the investment circle has also

348
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,690
shown enthusiasm for investment.

349
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,720
This merger

350
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,640
will slightly boost the stock price

351
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,000
of Dongyang Medical.

352
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,760
Ji Xing, flowers for you.

353
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:29,770
For me?

354
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,360
Thanks.

355
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,210
From Xing's boyfriend, huh?

356
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,520
- Let me see.
- I don't know.

357
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,520
Ji Xing, last night, you made
a strong impression on me.

358
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,810
Look forward to seeing you again.
Zhao Xingbo.

359
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,690
Is Zhao Xingbo your boyfriend?

360
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,570
Zhao Xingbo?

361
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,810
Mr. Zhu.

362
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,640
Zhao Xingbo is

363
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,490
Mr. Zhao from Ren'ai Hospital.

364
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,760
I thought it was Miss Zeng

365
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,210
who got this cooperation.

366
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,970
It turns out to be you.

367
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,690
Nice trick, young girl.

368
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,690
Indeed, a beauty can always take advantage.

369
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,410
No. You get it wrong.

370
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,610
Last night at the dinner Miss Zeng took me to,

371
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:13,760
I met Mr. Zhao.

372
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,950
He invested in us because

373
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,210
Bay could perform well.

374
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,000
You had dinner with Miss Zeng?

375
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,720
Chen,

376
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,800
your subordinate is good.

377
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,170
Miss Zeng thinks highly of her.

378
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,320
Don't make fun of me.

379
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,280
Come on. Aren't you invited to a dinner?

380
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,120
Off you go.

381
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,280
I won't see you out.

382
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,400
Mr. Zhu.

383
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,170
Learn from Ji Xing.

384
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,410
Work harder. Do you hear?

385
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,760
Yes. Yes, brother-in-law.

386
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,600
Ji Xing.

387
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,250
Bye-bye.

388
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,920
Umm, this...

389
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,400
In the future,

390
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,040
I'll promote the combination

391
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,690
of our existing Doctorcloud

392
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,650
and AI big data GPT

393
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,520
with the diagnosis

394
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,850
of Robot Bay

395
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,370
for personalized and customized

396
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,280
intelligent diagnosis.

397
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,170
I'll also develop more fields

398
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,370
of new techniques

399
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,610
including 3D medical printing.

400
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,370
I don't understand your concept.

401
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,690
But I can easily tell

402
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,210
it needs a huge upfront investment.

403
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,610
Current funds of Dongyang Medical

404
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,320
can hardly support

405
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,080
your development in smart medicine

406
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,690
when affording the production

407
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,520
of standard devices, huh?

408
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,890
That's right. So, I plan

409
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,480
to shut down the production lines
of some standard devices.

410
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,130
Shut down...

411
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Production lines?

412
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,250
Han Ting,

413
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,520
I've managed Dongyang Medical for years.

414
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,650
I certainly know

415
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,410
Grandpa has high expectations for it.

416
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,760
But don't over-stretch our company

417
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,320
just because of too much pressure.

418
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,320
Production lines of standard devices

419
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,170
have been our specialty.

420
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,760
You can't smash it

421
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,480
just because you want to do smart medicine.

422
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,560
We're a listed company.

423
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,930
When we do business,

424
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,800
a single wrong move

425
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,480
will make it very hard for us

426
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,080
to get back to our old course.

427
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,690
What do you think, Mr. Wang?

428
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,170
I think

429
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,690
Mr. Han has a good idea.

430
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,320
Our business

431
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,210
needs to be upgraded.

432
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,170
We should keep pace with the times.

433
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,280
Wang, look nationwide.

434
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,520
Only Hanhai Technology can do

435
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,610
a massive 3D medical printing.

436
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,080
But Hanhai Technology

437
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,280
doesn't need an external investment.

438
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,800
So, Mr. Han,

439
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,690
what is your plan?

440
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,170
Shall we start from scratch?

441
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,760
It took Hanhai five or six years

442
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,210
to have come this far.

443
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,720
Guys, I wonder

444
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,800
if you can wait that long.

445
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,810
Mr. Yang,

446
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,970
five or six years is too long.

447
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,210
Even I can't wait.

448
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,930
What about two years?

449
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,410
Within two years,

450
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,210
I'll double the stock price
of Dongyang Medical.

451
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,610
This is a pledge.

452
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,450
As your cousin, I should remind you.

453
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,280
It's good to have confidence.

454
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,320
But you should do what you really can.

455
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,250
Yuan, don't worry.

456
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,280
If I fail, I'll quit my job.

457
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,920
Good.

458
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,320
Since you're so confident,

459
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,130
I'll fully support you.

460
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,900
(R&D Director's Office)

461
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:12,770
Director Chen.

462
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,690
Oh, Ji Xing.

463
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,410
Come and sit.

464
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,320
What's up?

465
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,480
Last night, Miss Zeng

466
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,610
took me to dinner

467
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,610
- because...
- Ji Xing, do you think

468
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,720
I'll get mad when my subordinate

469
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,280
dines with our boss?

470
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,480
No, no. That's not what I mean.

471
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,800
I just think I should tell you about it.

472
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,860
(Xinggang Science&Technology Award,
First Prize, Certificate of Honor)

473
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,450
Take your seat.

474
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,730
Ji Xing,

475
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,890
you're the best engineer

476
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,450
of the Bay team.

477
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,520
Taking you out for a product introduction

478
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,800
is Miss Zeng's best choice.

479
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,720
Look, I have so many projects to handle.

480
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,480
Miss Zeng knows how busy I am.

481
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,170
It's normal that you go with Miss Zeng

482
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,480
for social intercourse.

483
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,410
Don't worry about that.

484
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:11,730
Oh,

485
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,970
it's almost the end of the year.

486
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,360
Now,

487
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,690
I can just talk to you

488
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,370
about the year-end appraisal.

489
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,410
You've put in a lot of effort

490
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,800
in this project.

491
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,800
You often stay up late for overtime work.

492
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,130
Every time Lin Zhen

493
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,410
gives me a report,

494
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,130
I can tell it's yours

495
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:32,970
from the formats,

496
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,130
nodes, and marks.

497
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,320
In the last three years,

498
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,210
everybody has witnessed

499
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,610
your ability.

500
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,370
OK.

501
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,800
I'll apply to the HR director

502
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,480
for your promotion.

503
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,890
Thank you, Director Chen.

504
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
I'm perfecting the proposal

505
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,410
of Bay Phase II.

506
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,610
I'll show it to you later.

507
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,370
Such a workaholic.

508
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:54,930
Look at Huang Weiwei.

509
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,930
She keeps asking about vacations.

510
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,520
Only you care for work.

511
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,690
Think about it.

512
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,720
Who would I promote,

513
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,520
except you?

514
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,610
I've been working on Bay

515
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,720
for a very long time.

516
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,800
I care a lot about it.

517
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,560
But besides emotions,

518
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,520
there are realistic concerns, too.

519
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:13,970
I want something back

520
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,720
that matches my effort.

521
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,690
Don't worry.

522
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,080
The project bonus of our department

523
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,480
will be handed out soon.

524
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,930
You helped Miss Zeng

525
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,720
get the cooperation with Ren'ai Hospital.

526
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:26,970
You also contributed the most

527
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,480
to the Bay project.

528
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,720
The maximum bonus

529
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,690
will be yours.

530
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,000
Thanks, Director Chen.

531
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,040
All right. You get to work.

532
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,520
At this weekend's celebration party,

533
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,930
have a relaxing night.

534
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,280
- OK.
- Oh,

535
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,320
the conversation between us

536
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,280
must be kept secret.

537
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,840
Got it.

538
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:47,970
Out you go.

539
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,130
What's wrong with Wang?

540
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,930
Why did he defend Han Ting?

541
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,610
I guess Han Ting

542
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,040
has something on him.

543
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,370
He thought

544
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,890
controlling one or two shareholders

545
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,610
could make him take over Dongyang Medical.

546
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,720
He even dared to pledge

547
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,000
he could double the stock price in two years.

548
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,800
Isn't he rushing to fail

549
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,930
in front of us?

550
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,320
Better safe than sorry.

551
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:38,970
Don't let down your guard.

552
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,690
Keep a close eye on him

553
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,480
and see what he is really up to.

554
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,760
We've worked hard for so many years.

555
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,800
We can't let him take advantage.

556
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,560
So cute.

557
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,560
You have perfect fur.

558
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,690
One shouldn't raise a cat
when he can't afford it.

559
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,280
Such a pretty cat

560
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,080
nearly became a stray cat.

561
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,690
What do you mean "nearly"?

562
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,720
It's a stray cat, isn't it?

563
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,530
Who said that?

564
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,970
It has a master now.

565
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,320
Who?

566
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,250
Me.

567
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:37,970
Then call it

568
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,480
and see if it'll come out.

569
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,280
Kitty.

570
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:43,770
Kitty.

571
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,370
Come to me.

572
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,690
Watch this.

573
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,120
Here.

574
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,560
Why do you have some snacks?

575
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,130
It's eating. Give it to me.

576
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,520
Come out here.

577
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,650
So adorable.

578
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,290
So cute.

579
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,760
How about we find a name for it?

580
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,690
Any idea?

581
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,240
Today is Wednesday.

582
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,610
How about we call it Wednesday?

583
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Wednesday.

584
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,290
Oh, no.

585
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
I don't want it to think

586
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,610
it was discarded on Wednesday.

587
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,450
That's right.

588
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,080
Let's call it Dahuang.

589
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,800
A cheap name gives it a long life.

590
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,080
But it's not "hung".

591
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,280
H-U-A-N-G.

592
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,560
Dahuang.

593
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,530
Dahuang.

594
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,720
Come on, Dahuang.

595
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,800
H-U-A-N-G.

596
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,770
Dahuang,

597
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,690
this will be your name.

598
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,850
- Dahuang.
- Dahuang.

599
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,690
Come out.

600
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:47,770
Look.

601
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,970
It knows Dahuang is its name.

602
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,450
Dahuang.

603
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,800
You're quite calm.

604
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,130
After making a pledge,

605
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,040
you're even in the mood

606
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,890
to feed wild cats.

607
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,450
Because I have you.

608
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,520
I think you're flattering me.

609
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,970
But I love to hear that.

610
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,760
About Hanhai,

611
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,450
- we need to keep it...
-Secret.

612
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,450
I get it.

613
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,080
The legal person of Hanhai is an outsider.

614
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,080
No one knows him.

615
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,800
Nothing will be given away.

616
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,000
To you, will two years

617
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,970
be not enough?

618
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,280
Think about Dongyang Medical.

619
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,890
Its business is a mess.

620
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,370
Almost all its executives
are loyal to Han Yuan.

621
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,520
She thinks leaving me such a mess

622
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,690
can bog me down.

623
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,930
When the path is cleared,

624
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,560
Hanhai Technology will restart

625
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,450
the future smart medicine of Dongyang Medical.

626
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,690
I'm already expecting to see

627
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,610
what you're going to do

628
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,760
as the new CEO.

629
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:11,970
Be patient.

630
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:13,770
Let's take it slow.

631
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,970
In Germany, you often fed cats.

632
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,930
Back in China, you still do it.

633
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,480
In college, I often fed a stray cat.

634
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:33,970
Sadly, I had to leave.

635
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,080
I've been regretting that.

636
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,800
I wonder if it had

637
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,720
enough food to eat.

638
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,480
So, I hope

639
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,760
no stray cats would be starving.

640
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,170
The cat...

641
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,480
You fed it with Ji Xing, right?

642
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,080
Oh, you really did.

643
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,170
What's there between us

644
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,010
that I don't know?

645
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,890
Tell me about it.

646
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,160
Boring.

647
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,320
Come on.

648
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,210
After you went abroad,

649
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,520
did Ji Xing still feed that cat?

650
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,410
When the cat is done eating, dump the can.

651
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,130
Hi, Yichen.

652
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,970
Xing, time to have lunch, huh?

653
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,210
I knew you were having lunch.

654
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,450
I'm stealing some time to see you.

655
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,930
When will you finish your work

656
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,210
and return to Xinggang?

657
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,450
Look.

658
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,360
This time,

659
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,970
there are many items on the agenda.

660
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,120
I guess

661
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,690
the meeting will last a while longer.

662
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,800
Oh, Xing.

663
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,560
Is your work going smoothly?

664
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,970
How was the project report?

665
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,520
Very smoothly.

666
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,080
You know what? The bonus is a sure thing.

667
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,480
And my superior said

668
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,080
he would apply for my promotion.

669
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,410
My girl is just awesome.

670
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,410
When you get the bonus,

671
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,130
we can put our money together

672
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,000
to pay the down payment of that flat.

673
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,700
(Mom: Call me when you have time.)

674
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,080
My mother asked me to call her.

675
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,560
I guess she'll urge us to get married again.

676
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,210
OK. You talk to her.

677
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,450
OK. Bye-bye.

678
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,520
This is my collection.

679
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,690
You'll look great in it.

680
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,560
Wear it for the celebration party.

681
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,690
It's so pretty.

682
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,970
But isn't that too much?

683
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,520
How about I wear my own dress?

684
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
No.

685
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,370
You can't.

686
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,650
That's a celebration party.

687
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,080
You worked on this project.

688
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,800
You helped with the cooperation, too.

689
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,560
You're one of the leading roles today.

690
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,610
You have to wear this

691
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,610
and make an entrance.

692
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,160
Sweetheart,

693
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,610
your ability is your strength.

694
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,210
So is your beauty.

695
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
You should generously show them

696
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,280
you're gorgeous and capable.

697
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,320
I can't agree more, Li.

698
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,890
OK. I'll kill their eyes.

699
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,480
Hey, have no more watermelon.

700
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,320
- Go get your makeup.
- Come on.

701
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,480
- Do make an entrance.
- Go.

702
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,970
Kill their eyes.

(Guanghua Technology)

704
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,020
(Welcome to Dr. Bay's celebration party.)

705
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:19,970
- Ji Xing.
- Director Chen.

706
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,920
Off you go.

707
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:21,810
Xing.

708
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,930
You look gorgeous.

709
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,170
To win credit for our department.

710
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,320
Look.

711
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,410
So many people are here.

712
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,480
Miss Zeng has spent big bucks.

713
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,760
I heard many clients came here

714
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,560
because they knew Mr. Han was invited

715
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,130
by Miss Zeng.

716
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,280
I didn't find out until today

717
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,210
that Ji Xing better fits the Sales Department.

718
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,170
In our department, anyway,

719
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,360
she's wasted.

720
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,720
Shut up.

721
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,720
Don't be so mean.

722
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,720
- Mr. Han is here.
- Why?

723
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,560
People are around.

724
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,610
Mr. Han is here.

725
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,210
(Guanghua Technology)
My colleagues

726
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,410
and my business partners,

727
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,690
good evening.

728
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,970
Welcome to our celebration party

729
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,370
of this year.

730
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,800
Tonight, hope you will

731
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,480
have a good time.

732
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,760
Guanghua couldn't have come this far

733
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,210
without the support or help

734
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,610
from everyone present.

735
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,170
Especially my investor,

736
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,450
Mr. Han Ting, CEO of Dongyang Medical.

737
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,890
Next, we'll have Mr. Han

738
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:36,890
give a speech.

739
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,000
As an investor in Guanghua,

740
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,560
I'm glad to see

741
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,930
the success of Bay Phase I.

742
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,610
Six years ago,

743
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,410
when I came up with the idea of Bay,

744
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,410
many people doubted.

745
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,130
It's the trust of Miss Zeng

746
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,280
and the persistence of Guanghua employees

747
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,000
make Bay what it is now.

748
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,760
So, this night isn't about me,

749
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,000
but about Miss Zeng

750
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,120
and all her employees.

751
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,680
You've worked too hard.

752
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,890
Send us a red packet,

753
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:12,730
Mr. Han!

754
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,000
No problem.

755
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,810
Tell Miss Zeng what bonus you want.

756
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,520
- Cool boss.
- Under her leadership,

757
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,290
- All the hard work is worth it.
- Guanghua will

758
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,040
achieve more in the future.

759
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,000
Bay will also play

760
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
a significant role

761
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,370
in the revolution of smart medicine.

762
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,520
Thank you.

763
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,080
Mr. Han's speech

764
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,770
gave me many feelings.

765
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:38,970
Ten years ago,

766
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,120
when he and I were studying

767
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
in Germany,

768
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,410
he told me

769
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,640
he wanted to invent medical robots.

770
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,290
(So, they knew each other
such a long time ago?)

771
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,560
Without his company,

772
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,000
I wouldn't have been brave enough

773
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,730
to start up a business.

774
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,810
Through a bumpy trip,

775
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:57,890
Bay has come this far.

776
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,200
I'm so thankful

777
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,680
that I haven't

778
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,930
disappointed Mr. Han.

779
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,130
Han Ting,

780
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,410
without you, Guanghua wouldn't be like this.

781
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,770
Right here, I want to say,

782
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,210
"Thank you."

783
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,360
And of course...

784
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,480
I didn't know

785
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,520
you and Miss Zeng were so familiar.

786
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,480
The success comes

787
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,680
from your effort.

788
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,480
I believe with the effort

789
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,410
of everybody here...

790
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,250
In my opinion,

791
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,290
you two make a perfect couple.

792
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,160
In the future, I want our partners

793
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,040
to keep supporting us.

794
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,290
At work, I mean.

795
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,520
With Miss Zeng, the lucky helper,

796
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,000
everything in Dongyang Medical

797
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,890
will be smooth for you.

798
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,730
- Right.
- Next, hope you will

799
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,160
enjoy the food and drinks

800
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,480
and have a good night.

801
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,930
In one hour,

802
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,370
we'll have a lottery ceremony

803
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,480
whose prizes are worth more than a million.

804
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,730
Wish you happiness and good luck.

805
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,000
Ji Xing.

806
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,000
I saw you the moment I walked in.

807
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,560
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

808
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,330
Did you get the flowers I bought you?

809
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,770
- Yes.
- Don't go.

810
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,160
- Thanks.
- Here.

811
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,160
- But...
- Don't stand on ceremony.

812
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,160
It's you

813
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
who introduced Bay to me.

814
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,520
For our cooperation

815
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,370
with Guanghua,

816
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,480
you'll do the communication.

817
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,960
But...

818
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,250
Don't kidding, Mr. Zhao.

819
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:28,370
How can a product engineer

820
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,480
do business communication?

821
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,890
If Miss Zeng really has her

822
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:31,770
do the communication,

823
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,480
Guanghua will not last long.

824
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,730
Yeah, Mr. Zhao.

825
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,520
Don't give Ji Xing a hard time.

826
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,810
For follow-up items,

827
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,250
I've put our sales director Zhu Lei

828
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,410
in charge.

829
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,890
Fine, you call the shots, Miss Zeng.

830
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,770
But if anything goes wrong

831
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:51,850
with Bay,

832
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,480
I'll still come to you.

833
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,670
OK.

834
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,440
Be careful, Mr. Zhao.

835
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,770
I'll leave you alone, bosses.

836
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,130
Going away?

837
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:07,730
Be careful.

838
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,210
Hey, Mr. Zhao.

839
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,330
A toast to you.

840
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,200
Hope our future cooperation

841
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,480
will go smoothly.

842
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,290
(Smile)
A toast to you, Miss Zeng.

843
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,040
Wish us a pleasant cooperation.

844
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,330
Just as you expected,

845
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,930
I emailed Dr. Jiang

846
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,560
the information of Doctorcloud.

847
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:26,890
He loves it.

848
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:27,810
At ten tonight,

849
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,080
he'll fly to Switzerland through Xinggang.

850
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,600
He can only stay for two hours.

851
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,410
I'm driving to the airport now.

852
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,730
I'll tell you when he's about
to get off the plane.

853
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,730
See you at the airport later.

854
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,570
OK.

855
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,290
The model looks really vivid.

856
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,160
Why are you out here?

857
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:04,930
Dislike the atmosphere in there?

858
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,160
I'm a technical guy.

859
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,810
I don't need to communicate in there.

860
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,730
Mr. Han, why are you out here?

861
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,890
Dislike the atmosphere in there?

862
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,680
- Actually...
- Han Ting.

863
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,970
- Ji Xing.
- Miss Zeng.

864
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,600
You look gorgeous in this dress.

865
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:27,890
Thanks, Miss Zeng.

866
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,930
Let's get in.

867
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,290
Everybody is waiting for you.

868
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:57,770
Chen.

869
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,970
My brother-in-law, Lin Zhen...

870
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,410
How's he doing lately?

871
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,770
Don't worry.

872
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,890
I decide who can take the credit

873
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,890
of this project.

874
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,320
But anyway,

875
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,890
ask him to work harder.

876
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,890
He can't always take Ji Xing's proposals

877
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,250
and report as his.

878
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,330
Am I right?

879
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,970
You're absolutely right.

880
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,080
I'll instruct him better.

881
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,600
The agents you introduced

882
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,480
all got the lowest price from me.

883
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,560
By the way,

884
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,890
Ji Xing of your department

885
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:41,930
is really impressive.

886
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,450
Over one single meal,

887
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,600
she took Mr. Zhao.

888
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,930
How about you transfer her

889
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,200
to my department?

890
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,450
Don't be silly.

891
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,680
I know you don't want to lose her.

892
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,680
But let me remind you.

893
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,970
Ji Xing looks

894
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:57,890
rather ambitious.

895
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,000
Without telling you,

896
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,120
she went to dinner with Miss Zeng.

897
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,200
Maybe tomorrow,

898
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,160
she'll replace you.

899
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,370
I thought of it way ahead of you.

900
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,680
The other day, then the HR director

901
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,410
talked to me about promotion,

902
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,330
I put in a good word for her.

903
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,560
Well done, Chen.

904
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,680
She's a young girl.

905
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,410
When you coax her a little,

906
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,250
she'll be loyal.

907
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,520
I lied that I would promote her.

908
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,730
She was so happy.

909
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,970
She couldn't wait to do anything

910
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,290
and spare no effort at work.

911
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,290
You're the master of painting a rosy picture.

912
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,330
I just paint a rosy picture.

913
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,080
I don't need to be legally responsible.

914
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,410
Let's work well together.

915
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,250
We will.

916
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,770
Well, tomorrow, I'll arrange another meal.

917
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,850
Dinner.

918
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:54,730
- OK?
- OK.

919
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,200
I'll give you a better meal.

920
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,080
- OK.
- OK.

921
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,930
- So much for this.
- OK. I should go.

922
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,480
Ji Xing.

923
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,520
You look gorgeous.

924
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,410
Too many people have come.

925
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,890
I didn't have time to talk to you.

926
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:08,730
Shall we talk now?

927
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,560
Director Zhu,

928
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,730
I'm going to the lottery.

929
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,640
I should go.

930
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,080
Let's talk.

931
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:15,890
Look at you.

932
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,080
You're pretty and talented.

933
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,810
Why do you do the boring job

934
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,770
in the R&D Department?

935
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,680
Come to my sales department.

936
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,250
I'll guide you to make money.

937
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,370
For the sake

938
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,480
you took Mr. Zhao's case,

939
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,290
you'll get a huge commission.

940
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,040
Come on.

941
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,250
Let's drink and talk.

942
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,330
I want to win the lottery.

943
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,520
I should go.

944
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,290
Wish you get a big prize, then.

945
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,810
- What did you do?
- What did I do?

946
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,120
You touched my fanny.

947
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,560
I touched your fanny?

948
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,770
Don't talk nonsense, OK?

949
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:57,970
When you were passing by,

950
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,120
I accidentally touched your wait.

951
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,330
You even deny it?

952
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,080
This is sexual harassment.

953
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,680
Come on. Don't be ridiculous.

954
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,680
You must be insane!

955
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,570
Stop!

956
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,930
What are you doing?

957
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,890
What's this stuff?

958
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:13,770
You just wait.

959
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:14,690
I'll call the police.

960
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,880
Call the police?

961
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:16,970
Funny.

962
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,290
Everybody.

963
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,450
Everybody, you saw that.

964
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:23,560
This woman wears such a revealing dress.

965
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,040
She actually seduced me!

966
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,040
Call the police.

967
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,040
