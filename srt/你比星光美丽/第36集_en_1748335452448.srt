1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'd like to go to the land above the falling snow.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sure that I'll never meet you.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll care for the future forever.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And I won't give up my fearless courage.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'd like to go to the land above the falling snow.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I won't give up.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,400
I will be more and more careful

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,320
Especially

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,880
Even if I don't know

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,400
Who I am

19
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,600
Every birthday before the king

20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,160
You were with him

21
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,440
I hope this time

22
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,760
You won't lack blood

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Da Huang

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,800
Do you think he will agree

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,320
Look at this

26
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,160
I feel check

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,560
Iintelligible

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,440
Intr Madrid

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:06,600
Proper

30
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,360
It

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,400
Someone who pistよし

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,040
I'm still forced to say

33
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,080
Stand up

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,400
If you can hear me

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,960
I will scream

36
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:20,880
Again

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,080
Get you a life

38
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,160
Episode 13

39
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,520
Qiao Di

40
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,080
Looking at your contacts

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,840
Why don't we consider

42
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,280
about what they're all about?

43
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,480
OGN customer

44
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,080
is pretty good at talking.

45
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,120
Have you ever been to Guanghua?

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,800
Let me think about it.

47
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,000
What else can I think about?

48
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,600
Can't you trust me?

49
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,200
I can't trust you.

50
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,560
After all, Guanghua is my bed.

51
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,400
Guanghua is my life.

52
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,440
If you want to give your life to someone else,

53
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,040
shouldn't you be more cautious?

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,560
You can trust me.

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,640
Not just Guanghua.

56
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,080
I'm not Han Ting.

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,240
I won't use my love to women.

58
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,960
I can prove it with time.

59
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,440
I'm worthy of entrusting myself.

60
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,800
Sorry.

61
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,680
I have a call.

62
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,600
Ask the officer to be upstairs.

63
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,360
Noodles, snacks, and morning soup don't have time.

64
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:19,800
Mr. Zhu,

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,880
I'd like to help you with this.

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,440
But by my side...

67
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
Get to the bottom of this.

68
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,840
Cheng He,

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,840
I didn't perform for daran.

70
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,520
Mr. Zhu,

71
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,160
this is not your line.

72
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,880
We're partners.

73
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,120
Roger, as I have told you,

74
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,400
I'm sorry

75
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,120
for doing this.

76
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:40,880
Think about it.

77
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,560
Who are you for?

78
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,320
I heard that someone

79
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,360
reported it on purpose

80
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,200
and that the drug was being checked.

81
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,000
Except Han Ting,

82
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
who else?

83
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,240
Yuan You Tou,

84
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,360
Zhai Wuzhu.

85
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,920
You must keep your eyes on him.

86
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
What's wrong?

87
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,360
Among the experts in the winter medical application,

88
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,440
some of them suddenly changed their mind.

89
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,440
It's just what we thought.

90
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
We shouldn't have

91
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,440
invited experts back home in such a hurry.

92
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,840
I'm just thinking of a solution.

93
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
We need to communicate with them face to face.

94
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,120
I can contact other students

95
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,680
and researchers

96
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,480
to see if they can get in touch.

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,880
In addition,

98
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,840
I'm willing to personally go there

99
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,680
and persuade the experts to come back.

100
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,360
I'll arrange some friends in Hong Kong to assist you.

101
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,520
You can go there

102
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,840
and continue to invite people

103
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
to challenge you.

104
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,440
It's your duty,

105
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
Accountant Ji,

106
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,080
which needs to be purposely agreed with.

107
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,940
警lol and being laid-back

108
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,020
真的 ideally improve your Keeping Mr. Ji's identity

109
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,580
is by far the best option for building up

110
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,120
an embarrassing area

111
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,640
and a way of Bref You You misunderstand.

112
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,520
Make Hantune sense.

113
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,560
However great the fact

114
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,480
these men even have theirLE labeled

115
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,560
as a frosted-up man.

116
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,080
Empty Hant Repeat

117
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,280
It must be like that during the winter lovers grind there.

118
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,240
Look at the mess up in their heads and deal with anyone else for a while.

119
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,540
It doesn't take a lot of time though.

120
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,940
Remember what was mentioned?

121
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,560
It's about my parents' amendments,

122
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,040
the whole property 然後

123
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,760
Once we met,

124
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,480
she mentioned we'd be ribs

125
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,860
that we'd get together.

126
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,160
If she didn't,

127
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,240
yum Yum Yum Yum

128
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,640
Yum Yum immediate

129
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,700
Yum accordingly

130
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,380
You cleanup your brain so quickly can you have it?

131
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,380
What do you want to do?

132
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,180
Damn it!

133
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:50,620
Don't get me wrong,

134
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,620
I'll go get you.

135
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,420
Means what?

136
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,980
What?

137
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:56,940
No you TM?

138
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,660
Tell me Beck.

139
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,420
I don't buy it.

140
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,340
Okay.

141
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,300
I'm thinking about it.

142
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,380
There's something I'd like to tell you.

143
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,340
It's the first time

144
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,340
that Han Ting came here.

145
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,420
She's been looking at you

146
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,340
and isn't coming in.

147
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,340
I think

148
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,340
she doesn't want to go back to Yu Ming's appointment.

149
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,340
She cares only about you.

150
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,340
I'm sorry.

151
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,340
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,340
You just don't care about her.

153
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,340
I'm going to vent my anger on you.

154
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,340
But I don't think

155
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,340
you have any space for me.

156
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,340
So I'll just be a good person.

157
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,340
After this vent,

158
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,340
I'll blow it to you.

159
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,340
A person's life is short.

160
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,340
Don't give yourself a regret.

161
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,340
We met for a long time.

162
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,340
Since the heart is also burning,

163
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,340
let's end it.

164
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,340
Has anyone said that

165
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,340
you look more like a poet

166
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,340
than a scientist?

167
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,340
You're saying I look sour, right?

168
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,340
I'm sure you do.

169
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,340
Ji Xing,

170
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,260
you're a very beautiful girl.

171
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,260
I sincerely hope you can be happy.

172
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,260
Thank you.

173
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,260
You're the same.

174
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,260
You're good and interesting.

175
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,260
You'll be happy.

176
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,260
But I feel sorry for you.

177
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
You're smart and pretty,

178
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,260
but you still miss such a childish man like me.

179
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,180
I know that.

180
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,180
What a pity.

181
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,180
Mr. Tan, you want to see me?

182
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,180
Yes.

183
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,180
How is it going with the relationship between the couple?

184
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,180
Very good.

185
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,180
She's very professional,

186
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,180
she's very straightforward,

187
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,180
she's strong and independent.

188
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,180
With her establishment,

189
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,180
the communication of the talent system will be advanced very quickly.

190
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,180
Do you have interest in Guanghua recently?

191
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,180
You mean the cooperation between Guanghua and Tong Ke?

192
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,180
Yes.

193
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,180
What do you think?

194
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,180
Before Guanghua,

195
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,180
she was developing Xiaobai under the Dongyi period.

196
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,180
What she relied on was

197
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,180
the data warehouse of the Dongyi wisdom doctor.

198
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,180
As long as Dongyi releases the medical equipment,

199
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,180
she can surpass Xiaobai very soon.

200
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,180
Yes.

201
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,180
But if Guanghua starts to build her own data warehouse now,

202
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,180
after a few years, the data warehouse will be completed,

203
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,180
and she can completely remove

204
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,180
the dependence on Dongyi's old data warehouse.

205
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,180
And now the market is different from before.

206
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,180
This industry is developing rapidly.

207
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,180
The path to go for decades

208
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,180
may be finished in 10 years or 5 years.

209
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,180
These years,

210
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,180
Tong Ke has not compared with Dongyi.

211
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,180
But now they are compared to Dongyi as a software company,

212
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,180
and Guanghua's family.

213
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,180
In the future, it's not impossible to get a good impression.

214
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,180
But I understand that

215
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,180
Dongyi's goal is never Tong Ke.

216
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,180
The technology medical industry is flourishing,

217
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,180
and the market is winning.

218
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,180
The people will gain more advantages.

219
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,180
This is the target of Dongyi's medical future.

220
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,180
Looks like Mr. Ji has returned to Germany.

221
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,180
The career revolution is really different.

222
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,180
I'm very relieved that the data warehouse is for you.

223
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,180
Thank you.

224
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,180
I wish you a good speech tomorrow.

225
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,180
Long time no see.

226
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,180
Long time no see, Mr. Zheng.

227
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,180
I never thought that I would meet you again

228
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,180
and I would be with you.

229
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,180
Guanghua has technology, Tong Ke has money.

230
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,180
We can't be together.

231
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,180
It's not Dongyi's turn to be happy

232
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,180
to hire a technical person.

233
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,180
We will talk later.

234
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,180
Please sit down.

235
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,180
Welcome to the high-end forum of

236
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,180
the AI medical industry in Shenzhen.

237
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,180
Thank you.

238
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,180
Thank you to the entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs

239
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,180
for providing us this precious opportunity.

240
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,180
Next, we will invite

241
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,180
the leading doctor of the industry

242
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,180
who is also the opening guest of our last forum.

243
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,180
Mr. Han Ting, the chairman of the Eastern Medical Society,

244
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,180
brings us a wonderful speech.

245
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,180
Please.

246
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,180
It's me again.

247
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,180
It seems that my last speech was a good idea.

248
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,180
Otherwise, I think I won't have the chance to stand here.

249
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,180
The previous speeches

250
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,180
were all about the industry's trend,

251
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,180
Dongyi's plan,

252
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,180
and all the red-banded topics.

253
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,180
Today,

254
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,180
I want to talk about something different.

255
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,180
Let's talk about

256
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,180
the medical industry.

257
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,180
Two years ago,

258
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,180
Dongyi organized a medical summer event.

259
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,180
He went to a place called Qingtian Fish Village.

260
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,180
The scenery there was very good.

261
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,180
The scenery was pure and pure.

262
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,180
But the medical resources were very poor.

263
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,180
There was only a small village

264
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,180
in the city.

265
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,180
It was only a small clinic

266
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,180
for villagers to see some simple soldiers.

267
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,180
It was very troublesome to see the patients in the city.

268
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,180
So,

269
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,180
when many people face the small clinic

270
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,180
and can't solve the pain,

271
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,180
the first reaction

272
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,180
is to endure it.

273
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,180
I have a friend.

274
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,180
At that time, he also participated in this medical event.

275
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,180
We met a person

276
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,180
who was injured because of his leg injury.

277
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,180
But he had to rely on his old grandmother.

278
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,180
He had to make her go through difficulties

279
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,180
in a suitable way.

280
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,180
For decades,

281
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,180
he was in a grave danger.

282
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,180
This is the origin of my friend's development.

283
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,180
He decided to start his own business

284
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,180
and make a fixed-term medical system.

285
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,180
He told me

286
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,180
that the purpose of developing medical technology

287
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,180
is to make everyone sick.

288
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,180
I think that

289
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,180
it is better to have a better life.

290
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,180
I think

291
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,180
as a medical worker,

292
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,180
the biggest achievement

293
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,180
is to be able to eat and drink

294
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,180
the products

295
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,180
that are not expensive

296
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,180
for the people who watch their own development.

297
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,180
You are so beautiful.

298
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,180
Your legs are really good.

299
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,180
You are better than me.

300
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,180
That is,

301
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,180
my legs are so straight.

302
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,180
They are made for me

303
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,180
when I was in the clinic.

304
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,180
They said that according to my actual condition,

305
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,180
they made it for me.

306
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,180
It is very useful.

307
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,180
Now, my legs are red.

308
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,180
I have come to the clinic.

309
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,180
We are going to go out and play together.

310
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,180
You can go out and have a look.

311
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,180
Let's go out and have a look.

312
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,180
OK.

313
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,180
Half a year ago,

314
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,180
Dongyi and Hanhai New York

315
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,180
joined the remote area

316
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,180
to develop a fixed-term medical system.

317
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,180
It helped this grandma

318
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,180
to change the appropriate medical system.

319
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,180
Her life has changed again.

320
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,180
I participated in many medical activities

321
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,180
and also met many similar patients.

322
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,180
I found that

323
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,180
actually, the people

324
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,180
need medical care very much.

325
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,180
Maybe,

326
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,180
it is just a really useful painkiller.

327
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,180
Maybe,

328
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,180
it is just a

329
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,180
high-quality fixed-term medical system.

330
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,180
In contrast,

331
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,180
sometimes we only think about

332
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,180
developing,

333
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,180
and playing with the concept,

334
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,180
but we don't seriously listen to the people

335
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,180
and know the real needs of the people.

336
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,180
This is actually the same as love.

337
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,180
I always give you what I want.

338
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,180
Tell you what I want to tell you.

339
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,180
I thought it was protecting me,

340
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,180
but eventually,

341
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,180
it became a clear excuse.

342
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,180
What do you want to be ignored?

343
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,180
What kind of love do you need?

344
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,180
Love is mutual.

345
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,180
Medical technology is also mutual.

346
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,180
Technology is for the country.

347
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,180
Disease is for people.

348
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,180
Only by walking into the human heart,

349
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,180
can you make up for the fact

350
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,180
that it is so simple.

351
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,180
I spent a lot of money on it,

352
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,180
then I understood.

353
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,180
I want to announce one thing here.

354
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,180
In the future,

355
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,180
the future of the East will be connected with the new sea.

356
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,180
Every season, it will be paid 20 million yuan.

357
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,180
It will help 30 towns,

358
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,180
and 115 villages.

359
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,180
It will help to stabilize the disease.

360
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,180
It will help more patients who need it.

361
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,180
It will help patients who need it

362
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,180
to follow up on the service.

363
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,180
It will keep them healthy.

364
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,180
In fact, life is just two things.

365
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,180
One is the ideal of being in the middle of the fight.

366
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,180
The other is the companion who is sick.

367
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,180
In this forum,

368
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,180
I want to take one for myself.

369
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,180
I hope that the friend who helped me

370
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,180
to get rid of the confusion

371
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,180
will give me another chance.

372
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,180
i'm sorry to be rough with you.

373
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,180
It's fine, you're not alone in Dقة.

374
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,180
Remember,

375
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,180
what you have done

376
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,180
can cure any crisis.

00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,180

00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,180

Thank you.

381
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:06,780
I believe that

382
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,980
the director of the film, Han Zuo,

383
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,980
has changed a lot.

384
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,180
The development of AI medicine

385
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,580
is also a big part of Han Zuo

386
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,780
and all of you.

387
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,780
He is a very original,

388
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,980
and passionate actor.

389
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,780
The next director of the film,

390
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,780
Mr. He,

391
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,180

392
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,380
Please welcome Mr. Zhang.

394
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,980
What else about Norval Agency Davie?

395
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,580
The film with Mr. Zhang.

396
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:44,980

00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,380
I listened to Han Zuo's usually.

399
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,580
We are stuck together in HI.

400
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,020
to deal with strategic agreement,

401
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,220

402
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,220

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,540
I trust you.

405
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,140
OK, let's go home now .

406
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,780
Speaking of it,

407
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,340
I would like to take a piece from my life for myself.

408
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,580
I can't contact you for the time being.

409
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,540
Han Ting, where are you?

410
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,580
I want to see you now.

411
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,300
Mr. Luo, do you know where Mr. Han is?

412
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,460
Is Mr. Han at the airport

413
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,860

00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,580
I'm sorry.

471
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,580
Don't make it too late.

472
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,580
Just leave me alone.

473
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,580
Go.

474
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,580
Dahuang.

475
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,580
Let me see.

476
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,580
Do you miss me?

477
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,580
You're fatter than last time.

478
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,580
Let me see.

479
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,120
Is Sang Milan alone?

480
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,320
But I don't understand how she feels.

481
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,160
I also do not know.

482
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,680
But she's touching my heart.

483
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,060
My heart, enough.

484
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,320
Of all ourication

485
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,460
children and grandparents

486
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,820
our children always

487
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,900
your parents become

488
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,080
perfect and forgive theival.

489
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,100
You can't forgive your parents

490
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,380
even it's the first time.

491
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,360
We both know the truth.

492
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:47,620
No.

493
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,280
I

494
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,320
I

495
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,160
But hate is between us

496
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,920
I want to test who has crossed the border

497
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,360
If I can get closer to you

498
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:40,640
Can I take back the memories and start over

499
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,160
Time goes by

500
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,240
Let me stay safe for now

501
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,280
Some players become a Adventures

502
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,480
I'm not afraid of you.

503
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
I'm not afraid of you.

504
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,480
I'm not afraid of you.

505
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
I'm not afraid of you.

506
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,480
I'm not afraid of you.

507
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
I'm not afraid of you.

508
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,480
I'm not afraid of you.

509
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,480
I'm not afraid of you.

510
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,480
I'm not afraid of you.

511
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,480
I'm not afraid of you.

512
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
I'm not afraid of you.

513
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
I'm not afraid of you.

514
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,480
I'm not afraid of you.

515
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,480
I'm not afraid of you.

516
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
I'm not afraid of you.

517
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
I'm not afraid of you.

518
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,480
I'm not afraid of you.

519
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,480
I'm not afraid of you.

520
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
I'm not afraid of you.

521
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
I'm not afraid of you.

522
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
I'm not afraid of you.

523
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
I'm not afraid of you.

524
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,480
I'm not afraid of you.

525
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
I'm not afraid of you.

526
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,480
There are innocent people.

527
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,480
Although the cat is warm,

528
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,480
there is a sense of pain.

529
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
It's a habit.

530
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,480
It's also a kind of courage.

531
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,480
We are a couple.

532
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:48,480
We are not afraid of being separated.

533
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:57,480
We always hope to let each other be fresh and soft.

534
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:03,480
Love has become a fleeting exchange.

535
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,480
I don't want to.

536
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
Hurry up.

537
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:30,480
göre

538
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,460

Xin xin

540
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,460
Xin xin

541
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,360
Let's go.

542
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,520
Where're you?

543
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,440
I'm at Hanuo.

544
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,360
çe Bryn Rhod 잠깐만.

545
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,000
There's impressive a playable fish.

546
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,840
I was taken out by radar again.

547
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,360
Where's my memory?

548
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,120
I think about it now.

549
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,720
Remove it.

550
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,080
I'll let you listen to his voice.

551
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,840
What's wrong?

552
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
How are you?

553
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
Listen to me.

554
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,480
You're so selfish.

555
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
You're threatening me.

556
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Han Ting.

557
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
I'm already dead.

558
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
I'm not in a hurry.

559
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
You're here alone.

560
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,480
I'll put you in the cellar

561
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
and you'll be in the cellar.

562
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
If you dare to call the police.

563
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,480
I promise he'll never say anything.

564
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Don't blame me.

565
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
If you want to blame me, blame Han Ting.

566
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
My goal is always her.

567
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,480
Who told you to stay at home?

568
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
I'm not like this person.

569
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
I'm not like this person.

570
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
She killed me.

571
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Ten years.

572
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
I've been in the cellar for ten years.

573
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
I'm all heartbroken.

574
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
I'm not even hurt by her.

575
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,480
The company has thousands of employees.

576
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
There's no chance to survive overnight.

577
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
Did I call her?

578
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
She's using this method to stop me.

579
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,480
I'm not in a hurry.

580
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
She won't let me live.

581
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
Let's play together.

582
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
Let me tell you.

583
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
I don't want to pay.

584
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
I don't want to pay either.

585
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
I want her dead.

586
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
Boss, what's the matter?

587
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,480
The plane was delayed.

588
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
It was in the airport in Hong Kong.

589
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
Sorry.

590
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
Boss, where are you?

591
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,480
You're in the car.

592
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
We're leaving today.

593
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
Boss, are you okay?

594
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Come on.

595
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,480
Boss.

596
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
Get up.

597
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Boss Han, what's wrong?

598
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Boss Han, you're quite a kind person.

599
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
Stop there.

600
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
Boss Han,

601
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,480
Boss Han,

602
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
I'm not a kind person.

603
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
Don't you want to give her money?

604
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
I'll give you the money.

605
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,480
Let her go first.

606
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
Stop it.

607
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Give me the money.

608
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
Or else,

609
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,480
I'll push her in.

610
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,480
Wait.

611
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
The money is in the car.

612
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
You need the money, right?

613
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
Yes.

614
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
Are you kidding me?

615
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Do you have 500 yuan?

616
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
You're kidding me?

617
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
I'll give you 5 million for a night.

618
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,480
The bag is only 200 yuan.

619
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,480
The money is in the car.

620
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,480
Let her go.

621
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,480
I didn't expect that

622
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,480
you're a kind person.

623
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
Fine.

624
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
I'll give you the money

625
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
if you give me the money.

626
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
I promise

627
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
I'll give you the money

628
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,480
if you give me the money.

629
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
You'll give me the money, too.

630
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
If you want to pursue me,

631
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,480
I'll give you the money.

632
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,480
You'll give me the money.

633
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,480
Let's be clear.

634
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,480
Okay.

635
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
Let's go.

636
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
Go.

637
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
Go.

638
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,480
Go.

639
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Go.

640
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
From the results of your body check,

641
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,480
your organs are fine.

642
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,480
How are you feeling after the surgery?

643
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,480
I'm fine.

644
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,480
I'm fine.

645
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
How is she?

646
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Don't worry.

647
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
There's no big problem.

648
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
Her blood pressure

649
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
is caused by the wound on her clothes.

650
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
However,

651
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
her waist is under pressure.

652
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
During this time,

653
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,480
you'll feel a sharp pain.

654
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,480
The most important thing is to take a break.

655
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,480
Especially the injuries and scratches on her body.

656
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
You must take care of your health.

657
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,480
I'll get back to work.

658
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,480
If you need anything,

659
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,480
call me anytime.

660
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,480
Okay.

661
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
Thank you.

662
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Doctor told me to let you have a good rest.

663
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
I'll put the bed down for you.

664
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Okay.

665
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
Xin Xin,

666
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,480
can you forgive me?

667
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,480
There's a time when you stand in front of me

668
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,480
and tell me that you're not familiar with the world.

669
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,480
I've forgiven you long ago.

670
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,480
Those who look like they're far away

671
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,480
but hate you.

672
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
I used to say that

673
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,480
the love between you and me

674
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
is all because of you.

675
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
I know.

676
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,480
Today is an accident.

677
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,480
Don't laugh.

678
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,480
Accident?

679
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
When you fell down,

680
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,480
did you think that

681
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,480
I might jump off with you?

682
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,480
You made me feel insecure.

683
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,480
You were very powerful.

684
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,480
You had your hands and your temper.

685
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,480
But your plan will never tell you.

686
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,480
I heard your other side from others.

687
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
I think

688
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,480
you're very strange.

689
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
You looked at me secretly.

690
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
But I couldn't see you.

691
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,480
I couldn't even see you.

692
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,480
I couldn't see you.

693
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
I used to think that

694
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
you were at the top of the mountain.

695
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,480
I was at the hill.

696
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
I was afraid that I couldn't move my hands.

697
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
So I wanted to go to the top to see you.

698
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
But now I think

699
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
what I don't want to go is not just the top.

700
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
It's by your side

701
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
and behind you.

702
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,480
I'm afraid that I can't get up

703
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,480
and I can't get up.

704
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
If we're together,

705
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,480
I'm afraid that I'll fall in love with you more and more.

706
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
So before that,

707
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,480
I want to know you more.

708
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,480
I want to know what you think

709
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,480
and what you're going to do.

710
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
Even if one day you enter the gray era,

711
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,480
my existence is a part of me.

712
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
It's a part of me.

713
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
I want to know

714
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
why I'm doing this for you.

715
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
No matter what happens in the future,

716
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,480
I'll stand by your side.

717
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
I want to know

718
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
why I'm standing by your side.

719
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,480
So should we start over?

720
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,480
It's not the investor and the founder.

721
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
It's not the top and the bottom.

722
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,480
It's the top.

723
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,480
I'm sorry.

724
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
I'm sorry.

725
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,480
I'm sorry.

726
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,480
Miss Qi.

727
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
It's my honor

728
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
to see you again.

729
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,080
ricy

730
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,480
Still met

731
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,240
waits for a stitch

732
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,260
My lovely

733
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,620
With a blanket,

734
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,920
We should not think our sense and feelings are the opposite.

735
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,260
What art Wizard Zhen Hao's Gouchuang and the

736
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,620
envoys themselves are different from each other.

737
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,740
And the music nation's movement and care came from different groups,

738
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,580
and it także theso long as 23

739
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,420
My suitability of art can also recognize

740
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,400
the contrast between such an environment and

741
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,340
the robustness of your Art.

742
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,540
I think same for me.

743
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,260
Liu Zhen Hao it's who is.

744
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,620
Powder King Fu you keep and

745
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,800
take advantage of this memory,

746
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,320
Don't you let our heroes

747
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,880
I didn't mean to make a fuss.

748
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,880
Don't worry.

749
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,360
Everything is going well now.

750
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,320
That's good.

751
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,720
Last time, you were really

752
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,120
very concerned about the technical innovation

753
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,800
of the 3D medical software.

754
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,520
You shared a lot of

755
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,520
company's contribution.

756
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,480
Everyone is looking at you.

757
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,920
I will not let you down.

758
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,560
Now,

759
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,000
there is a good chance.

760
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,280
The company is going to send a technical high-ranking

761
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,040
to Germany's Eastern Base.

762
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,640
They will take the technical department as the vice-president.

763
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,640
They will work and work for three years.

764
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,400
After three years,

765
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,320
they will be promoted to

766
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,560
the chief engineer of Han Xing.

767
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,360
The technical department

768
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,920
is looking at this opportunity.

769
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,240
But I still think about you.

770
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,000
I don't know if you have any opinions on this.

771
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,520
Mr. Luo,

772
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,480
this is not a small thing.

773
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,640
And it happened suddenly.

774
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,760
I...

775
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,240
You don't have to answer me now.

776
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,200
The time for delivery is three months later.

777
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,960
You can go back and think about it.

778
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,600
But I remind you,

779
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,960
it's hard to get a chance.

780
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,800
I hope you can help me.

781
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,760
Thank you for your company and my company.

782
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,320
I will think about it when I get back.

783
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,480
keinen

784
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,920
AL

785
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,400
Excuse me, where are you going?

786
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,520
I'm fine.

787
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,440
I just have a little more Dot disease.

788
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,000
Is your hand going in serious?

789
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:25,840
No.

790
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,480
Do you have any injuries elsewhere?

791
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,080
Is there nothing?

792
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:30,800
No.

793
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,040
How is Han Ding?

794
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,000
He's sleeping inside.

795
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,520
Zhu Heng Yu, you bastard.

796
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,520
Why did you tell us

797
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,400
about this?

798
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,840
I was scared to death.

799
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,400
If it weren't for us,

800
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,080
when will you tell us?

801
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,320
Don't tell my parents about this.

802
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,080
I'm worried about them.

803
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,640
I know.

804
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,640
You're worried about Han Ding.

805
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:57,760
Listen to me.

806
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,960
We can find out.

807
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
Han ...

808
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,560
Xu Yi.

809
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,280
You can't trust me anymore.

810
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,420
Qin Jun,

811
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,480
Okay.

812
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,600
This is a wedding dress for you.

813
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,600
Take good care of Han Zong.

814
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,600
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

815
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,600
Okay.

816
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,600
It's a little heavy.

817
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,600
I can carry it with me.

818
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,600
No problem.

819
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,600
Okay.

820
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,600
I just put on some skin.

821
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,600
Thank you.

822
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,600
Okay, you guys go to work.

823
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,600
I'll take a good rest.

824
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,600
Okay.

825
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,600
Have a good rest.

826
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,640
Hello, Sister Li Li.

827
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,640
Zhizhou, how is the company?

828
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,640
The company is normal.

829
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,640
My answer is correct.

830
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,640
That's good.

831
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Sister Li Li.

832
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,640
What's wrong?

833
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,640
I'm not feeling well.

834
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,640
I just want to take a break.

835
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,640
I'm sorry.

836
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,640
I'm not feeling well.

837
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,640
I just want to take a break.

838
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,640
I'm sorry.

839
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,640
I'm sorry.

840
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,640
I'm sorry.

841
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,640
What's wrong?

842
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,640
How is Sister Li Li?

843
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,640
She's a little injured.

844
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,640
When Xiaomeng and I went there,

845
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,640
Han Zong was resting.

846
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,640
We didn't bother her.

847
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,640
It's good that she's fine.

848
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,640
Then we'll go to see her tomorrow.

849
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,640
Okay.

850
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,640
See you tomorrow.

851
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,640
See you tomorrow.

852
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,640
I'm sorry.

853
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,640
I'm sorry.

854
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,640
I'm sorry.

855
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,640
I'm sorry.

856
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,640
I'm sorry.

857
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,640
I'm sorry.
