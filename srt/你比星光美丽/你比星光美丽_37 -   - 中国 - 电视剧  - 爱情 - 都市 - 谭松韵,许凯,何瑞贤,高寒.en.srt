Don't you sign it?

27
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,950
I heard Zhu Houyu

28
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,310
kidnapped Ji Xing

29
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,950
to avenge Han Ting.

30
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,590
And he's injured in hospital.

31
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,520
I heard about that, too.

32
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,630
Is it you?

33
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,400
Di.

34
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,710
Business cooperation is impersonal.

35
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,800
Now, you belong to Tongke.

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,590
I want you to distance yourself
from Dongyang Medical.

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,000
Do you feel sick?

39
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,550
Not really.

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,000
What are you doing here?

41
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,470
You're in such big trouble.

42
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,520
I'm here to check on you.

43
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,560
What? Am I unwelcome?

44
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,550
Here.

45
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,560
You guys talk.

46
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,280
What?

47
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,310
Where is the injury? Is it serious?

48
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,240
Not really.

49
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,430
Thanks for caring.

50
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,750
But you don't come here

51
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,520
just to ask how I am, do you?

52
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,150
I never thought

53
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,750
Zhu Houyu could do such a terrible thing.

54
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,590
Just get to the point.

55
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,240
Chang He offered to wholly own Guanghua.

56
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
I accepted that.

57
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,080
It's good. Congratulations.

58
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,800
All thanks to you.

59
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,960
If you hadn't discarded Guanghua casually,

60
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,070
it wouldn't have developed so well

61
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,120
with Tongke's support.

62
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,120
After the wholly-owned acquisition,

63
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,430
the stock price

64
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,600
will certainly rocket.

65
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,830
Under such circumstances,

66
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
do you regret it?

67
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,640
No.

68
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,000
I sold my shares of Guanghua to Tongke.

69
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,160
You said,

70
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,630
we would just be friends

71
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
or enemies.

72
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,750
Next time we meet,

73
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,560
we'll be ultimate rivals.

74
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,560
Have some good rest.

75
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,240
Wish you a speedy recovery.

76
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,790
See you.

77
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,240
You're quite soft-hearted.

78
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,360
After he fell,

79
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,120
you forgave him?

80
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,750
What are you trying to say?

81
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,120
As a woman, I feel sorry for you.

82
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,680
You know how heartless

83
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,720
Han Ting can be.

84
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,190
He cheated and used you.

85
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,000
He'll do that again.

86
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,920
Zeng Di,

87
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,870
you've never known

88
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,920
what a man Han Ting really is.

89
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,920
Nor can you understand

90
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,190
the love between us.

91
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,920
Upon graduation, I joined Guanghua.

92
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,630
Once I admired you a lot.

93
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,720
I hated you, too.

94
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,830
But later I realized

95
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,720
you were quite pathetic.

96
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
With a high starting point,

97
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,040
you're ambitious and capable.

98
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,360
But because you're possessive of Han Ting,

99
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,600
you have been blinded

100
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,310
and lost yourself.

101
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,750
All the tricks you've played on me

102
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,830
witness your inferiority in love.

103
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,920
You're quite confident

104
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,240
in Han Ting's love for you.

105
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,750
Then I'd like to see

106
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,160
how long you can be together.

107
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,560
OK.

108
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,190
Email me the agreement.

109
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,560
I'll sign it today.

110
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,400
Ms. Yuan.

111
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,760
Such a rare visitor.

112
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
You haven't offered to see me for a long time.

113
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,360
Zhu Houyu kidnapped Ji Xing.

114
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,160
Did you instigate him?

115
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,760
What?

116
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,310
Feeling sorry for your cousin?

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,040
So, it's really you.

118
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,870
Your dirty trick

119
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,830
will alert my grandpa.

120
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,560
If he investigates,

121
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,120
neither you nor I can get away.

122
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Don't forget.

123
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,870
Even Han Ting could find out

124
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,240
you and I met privately.

125
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,600
To have developed Dongyang to today's size,

126
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,000
your grandpa

127
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,830
must have played more tricks.

128
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,390
He will understand me.

129
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,430
Besides,

130
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,040
Han Ting did nothing to you after he knew it.

131
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,120
Did he?

132
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,750
Since you're so reckless,

133
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,270
I'm done with you.

134
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,700
(Xinggang Hospital)

135
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,180
(Bed No.2, Room A804, Han Ting)

136
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,750
You look so weak.

137
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,270
I kind of feel sorry for you.

138
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,120
The door is over there.

139
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,960
See yourself out.

140
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,840
Just kidding.

141
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,870
Where's Ji Xing?

142
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,280
No way.

143
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,200
You saved her, but she left?

144
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,030
She's being so heartless!

145
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,240
To save her, you nearly lost your life!

146
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,120
In this case, I got her involved.

147
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,510
It's my fault.

148
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,960
How could you be so stubborn?

149
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,270
If you miss this chance,

150
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,240
what if Ji Xing

151
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,080
doesn't forgive you?

152
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,750
What do I do?

153
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,720
Stop being so reserved anymore.

154
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,630
Listen to me. Go see her now.

155
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,320
There you are, Mr. Xiao.

156
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,910
I'm here to check on Han Ting.

157
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,750
I heard he was badly injured.

158
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,870
These days, please

159
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,910
take good care of him.

160
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,600
You'd better get him some fruit.

161
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,280
I've bought some.

162
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,240
You guys talk.

163
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
I'll go wash the fruit.

164
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,590
OK.

165
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,510
She didn't leave?

166
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,200
I think you stand a chance.

167
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,630
She even bought you some fruit.

168
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Later, behave very well.

169
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,870
Pretend to be weak to attract her attention.

170
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,710
Ji Xing.

171
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,630
Yes, yes. That's it.

172
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,590
Ji Xing.

173
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,840
I feel unwell.

174
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,870
Check on him.

175
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,160
What ails you?

176
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,630
- My waist.
- Let me see.

177
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,630
I'm brainless.

178
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,920
I'm reserved.

179
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,030
I'm too ignorant,

180
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,870
Mr. Han.

181
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,200
Miss Ji, best wishes for you.

182
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,120
I should go.

183
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,670
Oh, one more thing.

184
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,120
I suddenly remember.

185
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,390
Someone didn't cherish his own health.

186
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,550
Hope you'll pay attention to him.

187
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,870
What do you mean?

188
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,240
You still don't know?

189
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,910
When you just broke up,

190
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,510
he drank an entire bottle of wine at my place.

191
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,910
The red spots

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,270
were all over his body.

193
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,030
Without me, you wouldn't see him now.

194
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,870
Lie back.

195
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,680
Is that true?

196
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,280
At that time, I...

197
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,790
You guys talk. I should go.

198
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,630
Bye-bye, Mr. Han.

199
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,630
Bye-bye.

200
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,630
I won't do that again.

201
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,080
Never again.

202
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,870
Does the kidnapper

203
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,200
have an accomplice?

204
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Will he come for revenge?

205
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,750
Oh, wait.

206
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,320
Why would I be scared?

207
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,120
He doesn't even know this place.

208
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,000
I shouldn't have said that.

209
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,870
I really shouldn't.

210
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,040
Stop!

211
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,670
Lu Linjia?

212
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,960
What is wrong with you?

213
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,200
It's the middle of the night.

214
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,840
I... I thought

215
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,440
after such an abduction,

216
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,320
you would be scared at home.

217
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,750
So, I came to guard you.

218
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,120
You made me more scared.

219
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,910
I'm at least ten years old.

220
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,030
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,000
If I told you earlier,

222
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,240
you would not let me come.

223
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,440
And when you were home alone,

224
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,390
you would be sleepless.

225
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,000
When I was guarding here,

226
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,150
you would be relieved.

227
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,590
Come in here.

228
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,630
Don't scare my neighbors in the late night.

229
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,390
Are you done?

230
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,960
In a minute.

231
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,390
Does it have to take so long

232
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,840
to change your pajamas?

233
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,390
Why?

234
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,790
What? Lover's clothing, isn't it?

235
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,200
Yes.

236
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,230
Come over.

237
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,630
But I hope

238
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,630
in our lives,

239
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,720
we'll only wear this once.

240
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,160
OK?

241
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,750
This is the only quilt I have.

242
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,240
Make do with it.

243
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,270
If you really don't like it,

244
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,790
how about you go home?

245
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,600
I can stay alone.

246
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,120
Thank you.

247
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,190
You're welcome.

248
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,160
What if I fall asleep

249
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,830
and touch you?

250
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,720
Then I'll hold you

251
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,510
and stop you from turning.

252
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,110
What if I kick the quilt off the bed

253
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,750
and give you a cold?

254
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,640
Then hold me tight.

255
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,830
I'm warmer than the quilt.

256
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,660
(Xinggang Hospital)

257
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,720
You'll just see a patient.

258
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,110
Why are you so nervous?

259
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,920
I'm not.

260
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,590
I just suddenly feel

261
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,960
I'm here to brief Mr. Han.

262
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,720
How does my trench coat look?

263
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,030
Is it too much?

264
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,350
It's good. Looks official.

265
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,750
- It's OK?
- Yes.

266
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,110
What are you doing here?

267
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,960
Why do you not get in?

268
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,670
We're about to get in.

269
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,000
- Let's go.
- Come on.

270
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,800
After you, Xiaomeng.

271
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,160
Why is he dressed like that?

272
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,000
You just get in.

273
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,220
- After you.
- Mr. Han.

274
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,280
Ting.

275
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,190
How are you?

276
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,030
Mr. Han, how is your health?

277
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,750
We're all worried about you.

278
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,960
You have to take more rest.

279
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,830
I'm much better. Thanks.

280
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,550
Mr. Han, is Xing not here?

281
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,590
She's gone to the doctor.

282
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,000
Mr. Han,

283
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,590
leave the company to us these days.

284
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,400
You and Xing just recuperate without concern.

285
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,750
Recently,

286
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,200
Mr. Luo keeps talking about you.

287
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,350
He praises your strong ability.

288
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Mr. Luo flatters me.

289
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,830
I only did what I was obligated to do.

290
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,880
Mr. Su has been doing a great job.

291
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,240
That's clear to all.

292
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,000
Come on.

293
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,510
Don't talk about work in the hospital.

294
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,830
Let's talk about something happy.

295
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,640
Let me officially introduce her.

296
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,920
This is my girlfriend,

297
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,520
Tu Xiaomeng.

298
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,240
I should introduce you like this.

299
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,720
This is my boyfriend

300
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,030
and he's still on probation.

301
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,790
Don't say that.

302
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,160
Oh, there you are.

303
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,400
- Xing.
- Xing.

304
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,240
What did the doctor say?

305
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,920
He said Han Ting could check out today.

306
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,000
That's great.

307
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,070
Congratulations, Ting.

308
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,240
After you check out,

309
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,200
take good care of yourself.

310
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,070
Who knows

311
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,160
if your brain is damaged?

312
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,830
Thanks for reminding me.

313
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,790
I'm very well.

314
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,110
Who can tell?

315
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,830
Show me the quarterly statements

316
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,880
of your bar, then.

317
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,960
Smart guy. You're the smartest guy.

318
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,720
Come on. Let's not disturb Mr. Han.

319
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,000
Mr. Han, we should go.

320
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,840
You get some rest.

321
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,680
That's right, Xing. Take care of him.

322
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,510
- Bye. Take care of him.
- Let's go.

323
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,670
- OK.
- Goodbye, Mr. Han.

324
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,400
After I check out,

325
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,110
will you stay at my place for a few days?

326
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,270
The doctor said

327
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,440
I could leave the hospital.

328
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,480
But I still feel terrible.

329
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,480
OK.

330
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,920
That's your promise.

331
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,950
Kiss me, then.

332
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,350
It's OK. Keep it.

333
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,510
You have no idea.

334
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,880
I nearly swiped at him

335
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,110
with the span.

336
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,030
If I had really swiped...

337
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,200
With her best friend,
she forgets her boyfriend.

338
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,310
Oh, woman.

339
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,310
Boyfriend on probation,

340
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,200
what are you talking about?

341
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,510
I can hear you.

342
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,240
Come on. Let's get there.

343
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,110
Good for you.

344
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,270
Your relationship developed really fast.

345
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,550
That is just love, isn't it?

346
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,200
It sparkles all the time.

347
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,510
Forget about us.

348
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,310
Just now, I realized

349
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,880
Queen Li Li

350
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,030
was always attracted

351
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,680
by a hound

352
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,920
who used to be a loyal little dog.

353
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,200
What about another metaphor?

354
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,880
Why? This one sounds vivid.

355
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,920
Su Zhizhou has really changed a lot.

356
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,590
Before,

357
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,400
he felt like

358
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,750
a silly rural dog.

359
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
But now,

360
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,550
he's become a hound.

361
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,200
Li is looking at you.

362
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,160
They must be talking about you.

363
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,200
Li cares for you.

364
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,510
How do you know?

365
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,550
Trust me.

366
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,590
Look at me.

367
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,310
I'm already in love.

368
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,920
But you're still stuck.

369
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,640
I think I just heard

370
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,640
somebody was still on probation.

371
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,590
Why?

372
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,070
You aren't a real boyfriend yet.

373
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,550
You have no idea.

374
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,590
Intimacy is like the tango.

375
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,720
One moves forward and the other steps back.

376
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,160
The point is to enjoy the process.

377
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,720
Enjoy the process?

378
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,790
What on earth are you thinking, Li?

379
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,480
I don't know.

380
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
Theoretically,

381
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,110
Su Zhizhou isn't my cup of tea.

382
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,920
If you say so,

383
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,110
can I interpret it like this?

384
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,510
He may possibly change

385
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,510
your requirements for the Mr. Right.

386
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,720
In this case,

387
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,920
you don't feel the same towards him.

388
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,030
What are you now? A love expert?

389
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,070
Of course.

390
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,640
I'll just let it be.

391
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,510
Li looked at you again.

392
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,960
Love is waving at you.

393
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,830
Take the initiative.

394
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,350
- I...
- Xiaomeng.

395
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm starving.

396
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,310
Aren't we supposed to have a hotpot?

397
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,590
That's right. We'll go. Goodbye, Li Li.

398
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,680
Tu Xiaomeng!

399
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,350
Remember what the love expert said.

400
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,590
Are you available later?

401
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,000
Yes.

402
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,030
You talk with my mother a lot, huh?

403
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,440
Your mother and I

404
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,960
have a lot in common to talk about.

405
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,840
You know what?

406
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,240
Every time she texts me,

407
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,480
when we talk about you,

408
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,000
she has a lot to say.

409
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,640
She said, when you were little,

410
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,550
she divorced, brought you up alone,

411
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,920
and she was busy working.

412
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,640
She didn't have time to look after you.

413
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,240
Nor did she have time

414
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,720
to take you out for fun.

415
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
Now, you've grown up.

416
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,790
She thinks you're way too busy.

417
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:31,350
So, you communicate very little.

418
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,550
I haven't even talked this much to my mother.

419
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,920
Don't forget. In your mother's eyes,

420
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,270
I'm your boyfriend.

421
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,920
Actually,

422
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,310
there's something

423
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,640
you can't say

424
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,240
to your closest family.

425
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,110
My mother says a lot to me.

426
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,240
It just doesn't sound nice.

427
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,800
Actually,

428
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,830
I think your mother

429
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,310
is quite contradictory.

430
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,000
Think about it. She urges you to get married

431
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,400
because she wants someone

432
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,960
to take care of you for her.

433
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,310
But she also fears you may meet the wrong guy

434
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,750
just like she did.

435
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,510
So, she's been very picky

436
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,350
about your life.

437
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,760
I know.

438
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,720
You actually care about your mother.

439
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,350
She cares about you, too.

440
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,000
And she definitely cares

441
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,590
as much as you do.

442
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,510
The two of you

443
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,440
just don't express yourselves

444
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,400
to each other.

445
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,720
I've been a salesperson for so many years.

446
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,550
I never thought someone would say

447
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,750
I didn't express myself.

448
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,000
But you're right.

449
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,350
I will communicate more with my mother.

450
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,920
Your mother said something to me.

451
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,270
I think it makes a lot of sense.

452
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,280
She said,

453
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,110
even when one gets frustrated in love,

454
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,270
he should not give up

455
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,590
his pursuit of happiness.

456
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,310
Life is long.

457
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,960
We have plenty of time

458
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,550
to find the one

459
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,720
that we deserve.

460
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,200
A canteen over there is good.

461
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,590
I've wanted to go for a long time.

462
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,590
Shall I take you there?

463
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,430
OK.

464
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,390
(Su Zhizhou)
Mr. Luo,

465
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,160
about the job in Germany,

466
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,270
I've made up my mind.

467
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,960
Boss, be careful.

468
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,110
Don't be nervous.

469
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,510
The doctor said I could check out.

470
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,110
Tang Song is right.

471
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,350
You should be careful.

472
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,030
You have a fracture.

473
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,000
Noted, noted.

474
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,590
Walk more slowly.

475
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,550
I saw them when I came last time.

476
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,240
Such beautiful fish.

477
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,000
Their tails look like butterflies.

478
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,160
They're Butterfly Carp.

479
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,400
Or Lucky Fish.

480
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,160
So, I believed it.

481
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
I believed

482
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,160
they would bring you back to me.

483
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,590
How were you so sure that I would be back?

484
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,310
I was not. But I would wait.

485
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,840
Wait all the time.

486
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,790
Oh, the action figures.

487
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,750
Why is Dahuang as big as me?

488
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,110
Maybe in my heart,

489
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,350
you're as adorable as it.

490
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,240
I didn't know you would

491
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,160
do everything on the wish list alone.

492
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,240
On the lottery tickets,

493
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,550
besides our birthdates,

494
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,200
I also see an eleven and a ten.

495
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
What do they mean?

496
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,240
It's the day we met again.

497
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,510
You even remember that?

498
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,110
The way you popped out

499
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,720
can hardly make me forget.

500
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,030
I think you wanted me a long time ago.

501
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,240
That's right.

502
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,030
When we were in college.

503
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,790
In college?

504
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,030
But we only stayed together for a few months.

505
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,070
When did you...?

506
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,240
Maybe

507
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,350
when you were giving a speech

508
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,400
on the podium.

509
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,280
Maybe

510
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,920
when you and I met Dahuang.

511
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,000
Or maybe

512
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,790
when I met you for the first time

513
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,920
in the lab.

514
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,310
On the dinner night,

515
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,510
I had planned to confess my love to you.

516
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,830
(Ji Xing, I'm going to study in Germany.)

517
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,270
(Keep in touch.)
If I hadn't left for Germany

518
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,350
and you hadn't lost your phone

519
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,190
so coincidentally,

520
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,350
I would have been your puppy love.

521
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,110
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

522
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,240
You just had such poor eyesight

523
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,750
that you didn't notice me earlier.

524
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,350
Don't satirize me.

525
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,350
Xing.

00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,910
What are you making?

569
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,920
This is the salad dressing.

570
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,110
I'll make you a vegetable salad.

571
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Salad dressing?

572
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,280
Teach me.

573
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,870
OK.

574
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,870
Here.

575
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,920
Pour some of this?

576
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,030
Yes.

577
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,870
How much shall I pour?

578
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,630
Not too much.

579
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,190
That's enough.

580
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,510
Enough.

581
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,600
Hold this.

582
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,590
What is this for?

583
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,600
Stir.

584
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,800
Not like that.

585
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,800
Look.

586
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,070
Stir like this. Come on. Hold it.

(Dongyang Group)

599
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,480
Is the proposal about the talent pool done?

600
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,920
The first draft is done.

601
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,000
We'll discuss it at the meeting.

602
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,870
OK.

603
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,360
I'm not going up with you.

604
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,670
Keep yourself rested.

605
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,280
Don't worry.

606
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,670
If you miss me, come up to me.

607
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,550
I should go. Bye-bye.

608
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,720
OK.

609
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,820
(Implementation)
This is the first draft

610
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,680
of our AI talent pool.

611
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,670
Any ideas

612
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,510
or any advice?

613
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,470
Mr. Liu.

614
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,800
Miss Ji,

615
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,840
the proposal is OK with me.

616
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,590
But the AI talent pool

617
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,670
needs a huge investment.

618
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:11,950
The period is long

619
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,320
and it's barely profitable.

620
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm afraid it can hardly be implemented.

621
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,280
Before making this decision,

622
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,440
Mr. Han thought about it.

623
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
The AI talent pool

624
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,960
is a very important part

625
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,000
of the future planning

626
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,320
of Dongyang Medical and Hanhai Xingchen.

627
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,920
Some other countries

628
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,320
have had AI talent resources for long.

629
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,000
Some of them

630
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,550
have even established a perfect pool.

631
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,630
There's no shortage of talents in China.

632
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,550
But there isn't such a platform.

633
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,550
In the AI field,

634
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,800
technology is the threshold.

635
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,320
Talents are rare.

636
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,670
And it's hard to cultivate them in batches.

637
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,030
If we can have

638
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,150
our own AI talent pool,

639
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,030
I believe our technology

640
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,400
will also have a great leap.

641
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,280
Mr. Liu,

642
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,590
we're in urgent need

643
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,590
of practical talents

644
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,550
who solve business problems

645
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,590
in practical operation.

646
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,550
The sharing of the talent pool

647
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,480
can offer us

648
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,670
many practical cases.

649
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,250
In cultivating practical talents,

650
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,360
it will help a lot, too.

651
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,070
I totally understand.

652
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,480
But it's the first attempt, after all.

653
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,840
I fear at this stage,

654
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,590
if we put a lot of manpower
and material resources

655
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,630
in this project,

656
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,070
but it fails halfway,

657
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,880
it'll be a waste for Dongyang Medical

658
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,400
and Hanhai Xingchen.

659
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,630
The sharing of technical talents

660
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,150
and medical resources

661
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,960
is the top priority

662
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,960
of Dongyang's AI medicine.

663
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,110
So, I want you guys

664
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,030
to put aside all your concerns

665
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,160
and do your best.

666
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,160
Miss Ji,

667
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,030
the talent pool will be
under the name of Dongyang Medical.

668
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,590
The majority of the fund

669
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,440
will be taken from it.

670
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,320
Directors most value

671
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,510
about the input-output ratio.

672
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,480
Even if we have a perfect proposal,

673
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,550
I'm afraid the directors will not approve.

674
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,670
Mr. Han will take care

675
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,920
of the approval thing.

676
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,800
Do you have any other questions?

677
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,880
If you don't, let's discuss

678
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,840
how we can improve this draft.

679
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,440
How was the meeting?

680
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,720
It's over.

681
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,150
Everybody has his concerns.

682
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,150
That's perfectly normal.

683
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,630
What about the proposal?

684
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,920
We had a deal.

685
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,760
You only take care of the board meeting.

686
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,590
Don't bother about the proposal.

687
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,640
Count on me.

688
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,960
You just rest

689
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,880
without worry.

690
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,200
Got it.

691
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,880
How about the waist cushion?

692
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,720
Is it comfortable?

693
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,670
Super comfortable.

694
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,070
You can't sit for a long time, anyway.

695
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,320
Stand up and stretch.

696
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,070
I've just learned

697
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,630
a set of moves to relieve the back ache.

698
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,510
Do it with me.

699
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,550
Come on.

700
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,800
Come.

701
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,880
OK. Straighten up like this.

702
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,720
Then...

703
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,800
Breathe in.

704
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,710
Don't laugh. Be serious.

705
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,400
One more time. Breathe in.

706
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,070
OK. Turn left.

707
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,110
Breathe out.

708
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:33,670
One, two, three, four, five.

709
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,000
OK. Back to the front.

710
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,430
Breathe in.

711
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,960
Turn right.

712
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:48,710
One, two, three, four, five.

713
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,870
How do you feel?

714
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,400
Much better.

715
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,440
OK. Let's make another move.

716
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:57,950
Reach your arms out.

717
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,160
Stretch.

718
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,150
What are you doing here?

719
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,030
The night view is gorgeous here.

720
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,000
When I lived alone,

721
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,110
I didn't watch the night view here.

722
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,600
Xing.

723
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,920
We used to be too busy

724
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,110
to keep each other company.

725
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,200
I think

726
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,800
we should spare more time for each other.

727
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:47,950
OK.

728
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,800
What are you looking at?

729
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,760
Don't you think we look

730
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,070
like a family of three?

731
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,230
The father, the mother,

732
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,110
and the naughty kid.

733
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,400
In the age of cats,

734
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,840
Dahuang is even older

735
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,680
than our united ages.

736
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,360
