1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If I'm focused on myself

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll go to know my wanna-ber attending kind.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,980
I'll go to know the Dallas

15
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,020
will begin.

16
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,780
Youth business should be relaxed.

17
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,260
Li Lang, Less is More,

18
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,100
will bring you to the right content.

19
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,380
How about

20
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,340
we rent a big engine?

21
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:08,940
Rent?

22
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,100
Is it reliable?

23
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,500
Go to the market and ask around.

24
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,220
See which companies have free engines.

25
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,220
We rent a car first.

26
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,220
We'll make the cost-effectiveness test first.

27
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,940
If we can make it,

28
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,220
if we can make the food,

29
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,700
the salary will be even better.

30
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,700
Okay.

31
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,380
I'll contact

32
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,940
the companies I've met before.

33
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,540
Okay.

34
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,820
I'll ask them.

35
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,420
I know them.

36
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,380
Okay.

37
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,180
Contact them at any time.

38
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,780
Okay.

39
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,580
Okay.

40
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,380
I understand.

41
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,020
If you have the machine

42
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,180
to control your company,

43
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,180
you must contact me.

44
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,580
Thank you.

45
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,580
That's all.

46
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:53,980
Bye.

47
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:55,980
Bye.

48
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,580
Zhou Zhou.

49
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,180
I've contacted the people who are very polite.

50
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,180
They have a machine to control the engine.

51
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,380
They may be out of the business.

52
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,380
That's great.

53
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,580
They've been going to their company

54
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,180
for an hour to find details.

55
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,980
Have we fixed the contract?

56
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:11,780
Okay.

57
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,580
Have a look.

58
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,380
Sister Xing,

59
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,980
I've ordered food for you.

60
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,180
Thank you.

61
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,980
Hello, Lili.

62
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,980
Hello, Sister Xing.

63
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,180
I have a client who is investing.

64
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,180
I've told them about your situation.

65
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,380
He's quite interested.

66
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,580
I've asked him to have a meal.

67
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,580
Come over quickly.

68
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,780
In a while,

69
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,780
I have an important meeting.

70
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,180
Can you ask the client

71
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,580
if he can change the time?

72
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,580
What are you thinking?

73
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,580
Of course not.

74
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,180
He's out of work tomorrow.

75
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,580
If you really don't want to be in trouble,

76
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,580
you can ask your client

77
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,580
to change the time.

78
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,580
Of course not.

79
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,580
He's out of work tomorrow.

80
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,580
If you really don't want to be in trouble,

81
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,980
you can ask your client.

82
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,780
Okay.

83
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,180
I'll ask Zhizhou to go there.

84
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,580
Call me if you need anything.

85
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,980
Okay, I'll send you the address.

86
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,780
Okay, bye.

87
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:57,780
Zhizhou.

88
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,380
I heard it.

89
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:58,980
I'll go.

90
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,780
Okay, let's split up.

91
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,580
Okay.

92
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,580
I'll go first.

93
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:05,780
Sister Xing,

94
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:06,780
have a meal.

95
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,580
Okay, I'll take you to the road.

96
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,180
Be careful next time.

97
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,580
Okay, be careful.

98
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,180
Okay.

99
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,780
Sister Li,

100
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,380
thank you for introducing us to the investors.

101
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,380
It's a matter of the business.

102
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,380
What's the matter?

103
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,780
Fortunately, you're here today.

104
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,980
How about

105
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,580
I introduce the investors to Xing Chenjian

106
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,580
for the first time?

107
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,780
What's the matter?

108
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,380
Mr. Wu, if he doesn't eat,

109
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,180
he'll be relieved.

110
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,980
Sorry, I'm sorry.

111
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,780
I'm sorry for making you wait.

112
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,580
Mr. Wu,

113
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,180
this is Su Zhizhou.

114
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,180
I'm a student.

115
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,580
Please take care of Mr. Wu.

116
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,580
Mr. Wu,

117
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,980
thank you.

118
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,380
Of course.

119
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,980
I'm the one who's good.

120
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:06,980
Li Li,

121
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,380
buy me a bottle of water.

122
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,380
I love drinking.

123
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,180
Okay.

124
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,180
Mr. Wu,

125
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,180
you can sit down.

126
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,580
Let's eat and chat.

127
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,180
I don't know if...

128
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,180
Of course, you don't eat.

129
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,380
Let's chat.

130
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:24,980
Come on, sit down.

131
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,180
Su, right?

132
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,180
Tell you the truth.

133
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,380
If you don't introduce me,

134
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,980
a business like you

135
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,980
doesn't have a name,

136
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,380
money, or product.

137
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,180
I won't see it.

138
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,780
Mr. Wu, we're like this.

139
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,780
Our model product

140
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,980
has actually been made.

141
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,780
After the operation is done,

142
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,780
our food will be made soon.

143
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,180
This is our business plan.

144
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,580
Look.

145
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,380
I'm sorry.

146
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,980
I'm sorry.

147
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,980
I'm sorry.

148
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,180
This is it.

149
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,380
This is it.

150
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:58,980
Look.

151
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:06,580
Su,

152
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,580
young people

153
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,180
have a good situation.

154
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,780
But the industry

155
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,380
needs to be more practical.

156
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,580
The industry

157
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,980
can't only be considered as a business.

158
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,580
I was also

159
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,780
a step ahead.

160
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,780
You know my situation now.

161
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,380
But you know

162
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,580
that I'm a big company.

163
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,580
I'm thinking about

164
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,180
investing.

165
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,580
Thank you for your suggestion.

166
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,180
Mr. Wu,

167
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,780
look at the investment.

168
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:37,980
Seven million.

169
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,980
Twenty-five percent.

170
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,180
Think about it.

171
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,180
Twenty-five percent.

172
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,180
Mr. Wu, twenty-five percent.

173
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,980
Think about it.

174
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,580
I'll talk to you.

175
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,780
It's over so soon.

176
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,380
We're not eating.

177
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,180
The price of the kid is a little bit high.

178
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,180
Let him think about it again.

179
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,780
I'm sorry, Sister Lili.

180
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,580
Mr. Wu,

181
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,780
I'll take your time.

182
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,380
Mr. Wu,

183
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,180
Mr. Wu's condition

184
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,180
is indeed different from our psychological expectations.

185
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,780
Because we're a first-class company,

186
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,780
so every step we take

187
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,580
needs to be more careful.

188
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,580
I hope you can understand.

189
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,980
Then you can talk to me about your business.

190
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,980
Lili,

191
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,380
later,

192
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,580
I'll take you to a good place.

193
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,980
Sometimes you eat, sometimes you drink,

194
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,180
and you can sing.

195
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,780
You can also take a bath.

196
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:34,980
Drink water.

197
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,580
Mr. Wu,

198
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,380
think about it again.

199
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,580
Their company is quite rich.

200
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,380
Good.

201
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,780
You can listen to me.

202
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,780
Wu Lanxiang.

203
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,580
Why are you here?

204
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,580
You're usually so arrogant

205
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,980
just because you're so rude.

206
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,580
Do you want to face me?

207
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,180
Wife,

208
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,380
it's not what you think.

209
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:06,980
I'm...

210
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,580
Mrs. Wu,

211
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,780
your husband is just my client.

212
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,380
We have nothing else to do with him.

213
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,780
You're so rude.

214
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,180
You're blind as a blind man.

215
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:15,980
Wife,

216
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,780
he's the one who's trying to make a deal.

217
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,580
He's trying to seduce me.

218
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,380
I...

219
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,580
I don't want to be a blind man.

220
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,380
You...

221
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,580
You dare to hit me?

222
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,580
I'm going to tell you in the company

223
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,780
that you're not allowed to leave.

224
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,180
Do you believe me?

225
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:33,780
Shut up.

226
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,780
You don't care about

227
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,580
my family or my country.

228
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,380
And

229
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,780
you just said

230
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,180
you're so rude to me.

231
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:41,980
I'm done.

232
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,780
You want to ruin my life.

233
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,980
You're so rubbish.

234
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:45,980
You...

235
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,580
And you.

236
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,580
You're the kind of rubbish husband

237
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,580
you like.

238
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,380
You just keep it for yourself.

239
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,580
You...

240
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,780
Rascal.

241
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,580
Sister Wei,

242
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,380
are you okay?

243
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,580
You see, I'm like a blind man.

244
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,380
I know you're upset.

245
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,980
Why don't you cry?

246
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,980
I'll be with you.

247
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,180
I promise I won't tell anyone.

248
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,580
Why should I cry?

249
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,980
The marriage is a secret.

250
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,580
You're not blind.

251
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,180
The one who should cry

252
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,780
should be him?

253
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,380
That makes sense.

254
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,180
Okay.

255
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,780
I'm going to relax.

256
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,780
Do you want me to go with you?

257
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,380
No.

258
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,380
Brother,

259
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,180
go back by yourself.

260
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,580
Be safe.

261
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,980
Be safe.

262
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,180
Don't worry about me.

263
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,580
Hello, Sister Xin.

264
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,580
Zhou Zhou,

265
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,780
the condition here is too harsh.

266
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,380
We need to pay the rent for the 80,000-yuan deposit first.

267
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,380
The monthly rent is 70,000 yuan.

268
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,580
We need to pay the daily maintenance fee.

269
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:11,980
Sister Xin,

270
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,180
we're not in a good relationship

271
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,380
with President Wu.

272
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:15,980
It's okay.

273
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,980
Let's think of another way.

274
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:18,580
Okay.

275
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:26,980
Sister Li,

276
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:27,980
be careful.

277
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,180
The night is safer.

278
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,380
The night is safer.

279
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,580
It's a safe place.

280
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,180
Chen.

281
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,380
Yiren, Yiren,

282
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,380
what's up?

283
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,980
I'm in a bad mood.

284
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:03,780
Sorry.

285
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,780
It's just a good mood to play here.

286
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,180
I'll take you to have fun.

287
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,780
You're too old.

288
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:13,980
How about this?

289
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,180
Please drink some wine.

290
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:15,780
I'm sorry.

291
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,780
Who is he?

292
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,580
He's just out for fun.

293
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,780
Don't make me feel bad.

294
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,180
Right.

295
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,580
I know.

296
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,180
Thank you.

297
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,180
Please drink some wine.

298
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,180
Okay.

299
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,980
President Xiao,

300
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,380
why didn't you look for me?

301
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:48,980
I was wrong.

302
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,580
I'm sorry.

303
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,180
Yiren...

304
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:57,980
She has a friend.

305
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,180
She's going to go down.

306
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,580
Yiren,

307
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,380
what's wrong?

308
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,580
I don't want to drink.

309
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,780
She's not disturbing you.

310
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,580
Dance with me.

311
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,180
Bye.

312
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,180
Director Zhang,

313
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,580
do you need me?

314
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,980
Well,

315
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:20,380
the company asked me to be with you

316
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,380
that's why I stopped working at these days.

317
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,580
You are asking me to stay at Ley.

318
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,180
But you're actually sending me away?

319
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,180
No.

320
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,140
I'm a middle-aged woman.

321
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,620
I'm young and light.

322
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,940
I just want you to rest.

323
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,620
Director Zhang,

324
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,780
I'm not here for the first day.

325
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,580
Who doesn't know that I'm the most busy?

326
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,100
You don't have to worry about me.

327
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,980
I'm just looking for you.

328
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,180
I won't do it.

329
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,140
But you've made it clear to me.

330
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,180
You can come here at any time.

331
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,420
Otherwise, I'll be in trouble.

332
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,140
I can't see you.

333
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,660
She's so happy.

334
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,060
She said тво.

335
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,420
But you don't know it.

336
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,860
I've borne the money.

337
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,860
Message the system.

338
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:18,540
It's made.

339
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,000
it means

340
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:25,660
They 2000

341
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,480
Assistance

342
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,420
The

343
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,940
io

344
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,480
I don't like it

345
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,920
A few years later

346
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,220
He did this performance just once

347
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,580
If I don't come

348
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,160
he will have our permission

349
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,700
to attend our show

350
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,540
He looks good

351
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,300
Go right

352
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,080
It's our perfect place

353
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,640
Right

354
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:02,980
Right

355
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:03,800
Yes

356
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,000
That would be good

357
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,800
Ji Xin

358
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,740
Excuse me

359
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,640
Mr. Deng

360
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,540
Ms. Han

361
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,460
How chaos

362
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,320
This city

363
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
This is my boyfriend, Shao Yichen.

364
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
Yichen, this is Mr. Zeng from Guanghua.

365
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
And Mr. Han from Dongyi.

366
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
Hello.

367
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,480
I haven't seen your boyfriend in a long time.

368
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
This is just a past.

369
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
We've been together for four years.

370
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
Good.

371
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
It's about to start.

372
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
Let's go in.

373
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,480
Let's go in.

374
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
Don't look at me like that.

375
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Young people are like playing with toys in the company.

376
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
Xing Chen Technology.

377
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,480
Ji Xing, Shao Yichen.

378
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
What if they break up one day?

379
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
What will happen to the company?

380
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,480
When did you start to care so much about Qian Rengong?

381
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,480
Ji Xing has been sitting here for so long.

382
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,480
It's normal to care about him.

383
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,480
Sorry.

384
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Let's go.

385
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
That way.

386
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
It's in front of us.

387
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,480
We haven't been here for a long time.

388
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
Here.

389
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Right, sit down.

390
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Give me the micro-net.

391
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,480
This way.

392
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
You have progress.

393
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,480
You can hold your breath.

394
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Look at you.

395
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
When you saw your ex-wife,

396
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,480
you were very capable.

397
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
I know the basics.

398
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
But I'm not happy.

399
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Who told her to give me a reward?

400
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Xing Xing.

401
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,480
The Han group who just came with your ex-wife.

402
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,480
Is it the one who wanted to take you to the East?

403
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,480
I feel that he has a good taste in my eyes.

404
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,480
He doesn't look good in anyone's eyes.

405
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
He is good.

406
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,480
He is good.

407
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,480
He is good.

408
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
He is good.

409
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
He is kind to you.

410
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
You can't say that.

411
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
Hello, Zhizhou.

412
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
Hello, Xing.

413
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Are you in the hospital?

414
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
Yes.

415
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,480
What's wrong?

416
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
I'm sorry.

417
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
I didn't want to disturb you and the former senior.

418
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,480
But this is too sudden.

419
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,480
I have a senior who is a salesman in Hanhai.

420
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
He said that they are here to buy a product.

421
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Because of the business adjustment,

422
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
they can rent it.

423
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,480
But we have to pay the deposit first.

424
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
And we have to hurry up.

425
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,480
Because it's very popular to find him.

426
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
Must it be now?

427
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,480
Yes.

428
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,480
He will have time this time.

429
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,480
I'll go find you now.

430
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
I'll send it to you.

431
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,480
Okay.

432
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Bye.

433
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
I'm sorry.

434
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,480
You know that we can't afford to buy a product.

435
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Now we have a chance to rent a product.

436
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,480
If we miss it, we will lose it.

437
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
But it's too temporary.

438
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,480
I have to...

439
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
Go.

440
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
You are so good.

441
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
After you finish watching it,

442
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
you can tell me.

443
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,480
We are going to find you.

444
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
Be careful.

445
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
Okay.

446
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
Come.

447
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
Why are you here?

448
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
I don't know.

449
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
I just came to see you.

450
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
You don't know?

451
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,480
I'm just here to ask you something.

452
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
I know you're here.

453
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
But I can't tell you.

454
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,480
What do you want to tell me?

455
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
I'm here to tell you.

456
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
I'm here to tell you.

457
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,480
I'm here to tell you.

458
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,480
I can't tell you.

459
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
I'm here to tell you.

460
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
I can't tell you.

461
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
I can't tell you.

462
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
What's wrong?

463
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,600
Brother, can you give us a little more?

464
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
500,000 yuan is not enough.

465
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Do you know how expensive this machine is?

466
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
This street must be made of gold.

467
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
But the rent is cheap.

468
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
As long as you don't damage the machine,

469
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,600
then the rent can be returned.

470
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Yes, can you give us a little more?

471
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Xiaosu, I have finished the rent.

472
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Do you know how many people are asking me?

473
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
If we don't get along well,

474
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
I won't talk to you.

475
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Yes, yes.

476
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Look, the phone is ringing again.

477
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
Hello, President Xu.

478
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Yes, yes, yes.

479
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
I know.

480
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,720
Don't worry, I've been thinking of a way.

481
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,720
Is he reliable?

482
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,720
It turns out that the university is a community.

483
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
It's been very proud of me.

484
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
But he is indeed a member of Han'ai.

485
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
When he entered the company, I saw him in the crowd.

486
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,600
The main thing is that this 500,000-dollar team,

487
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
for us now,

488
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
is not a small tree.

489
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,600
And now we only have tens of thousands on our account.

490
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
This...

491
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Xingqin, how about we have another way?

492
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,600
We'll borrow some money and rent the machine first.

493
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,600
I think that if we rent the machine and sell the product,

494
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
we can do it faster.

495
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
You can only do this.

496
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Hello.

497
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
These are 20,000 yuan.

498
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
How can I pay you?

499
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
No problem.

500
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Okay.

501
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Wait a minute.

502
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Hello.

503
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Lily.

504
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
We are trying to rent a 3D machine.

505
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
We don't have enough money.

506
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Can you lend me some money?

507
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Okay.

508
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
How much do you want?

509
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
100,000 yuan, okay?

510
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Okay.

511
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
100,000 yuan, okay?

512
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
No problem.

513
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
I'll call you now.

514
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
I love you.

515
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
I'll pay you back.

516
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Okay, don't finish it.

517
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
I'll invest you.

518
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
The future technology is precious.

519
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Sorry.

520
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
I don't want these.

521
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Okay.

522
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,600
Welcome to the next shopping mall.

523
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
You can be the manager in the future.

524
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Thank you.

525
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
I'm so busy.

526
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
How's the consideration?

527
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
If you don't make a decision,

528
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
I'll agree to others.

529
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
Brother Huang, we just thought about it.

530
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
I think it's okay.

531
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,600
But we have to sign a contract with Han Hai.

532
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
We are not in the right place.

533
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
For our company,

534
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
we can't let the company

535
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
control our company.

536
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
How about this?

537
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
Sign with me.

538
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
It's okay.

539
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
We don't have the money.

540
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
We don't want to do business.

541
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Brother Huang, wait a minute.

542
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Brother Huang, we signed it.

543
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
We signed it.

544
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Let's go.

545
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Brother Huang, that's the best.

546
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Come on.

547
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
The contract is in one and half.

548
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,600
But we can only give half the price now.

549
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
After three days,

550
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
when the winning machine is here,

551
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
we'll give you the rest of the money.

552
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Do you think it's okay?

553
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Okay.

554
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
I'll agree to it

555
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
if I see Xiaosu.

556
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Thank you.

557
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Please.

558
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
Why is there such a big fire?

559
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
He has a boyfriend.

560
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Ji Xing?

561
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
What's wrong with him?

562
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,600
He has a boyfriend.

563
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Is it okay to have a boyfriend?

564
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Or not married?

565
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
I don't know.

566
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
I don't know.

567
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
I don't know.

568
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
I don't know.

569
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
I don't know.

570
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
I don't know.

571
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
I don't know.

572
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
I don't know.

573
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
I don't know.

574
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
I'm not married.

575
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
I'm telling you.

576
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Ji Xing has studied

577
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
about your products.

578
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
If you don't give up,

579
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
if he accepts others' investment,

580
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
you'll have no chance.

581
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
But as long as you invest in him,

582
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
he's your cause.

583
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
What do you mean?

584
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,600
The first month of the retirement.

585
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Su Chu Yi.

586
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
It's sister.

587
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
Historian Hong,

588
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,600
you can't have a girlfriend if I didn't see you today.

589
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Send my daughter to theipple integrating business.

590
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
I'll stay and leave with you.

591
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Sister Ying,

592
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
there's something wrong with the ring.

593
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Ji Xing can't use a three-day 전 natural treatment.

594
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
That's so great.

595
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
You're great.

596
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
I become rich.

597
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
I might get the money.

598
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Or we'll have no money for sure.

599
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,000
The rest of the pressure is gone.

600
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,400
Okay.

601
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,160
Try it.

602
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,000
You can keep an eye on the machine.

603
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,720
I'll think of a way.

604
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,080
Don't worry.

605
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,160
I hope everything goes well.

606
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,200
Everything goes well.

607
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
Okay, I've changed.

608
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,720
Thank you, master.

609
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,320
Mr. Fan.

610
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:22,880
How is it?

611
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Did you lose anything?

612
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,280
It's okay.

613
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,320
I lost a few bags.

614
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,600
And a laptop.

615
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,920
It's good that you're fine.

616
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,240
The police have arrested you.

617
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,280
So I've changed.

618
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,080
If you're not worried,

619
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,360
you can go to the hotel tonight.

620
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,520
Thank you, brother Yichen.

621
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,520
I was just too scared.

622
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,080
I called you

623
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,160
when I was blank.

624
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,360
Now I think it's not appropriate.

625
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,120
I don't know

626
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,000
if I disturbed you and Xinxin.

627
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,000
No.

628
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,680
She's too busy.

629
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,600
I'm fine today.

630
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,400
Xinxin just started her career.

631
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,680
She must be busy.

632
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,760
Did you

633
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,920
regret supporting her?

634
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,280
But Xinxin is quite a good girl.

635
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,320
I can't live a life like her.

636
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,040
I'm satisfied

637
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,480
to have a girl

638
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,760
I like.

639
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,360
Maybe she's right.

640
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,960
But I...

641
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,680
I'm more confused now.

642
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,960
Yichen, have some tea.

643
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,000
Thank you.

644
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,880
Are you going to marry Xinxin?

645
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,400
How did you know?

646
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,040
I...

647
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm going to...

648
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
create a career.

649
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,120
I guessed it.

650
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,200
You've been with Xinxin for four years.

651
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,120
It's time to get married.

652
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,440
I did plan it.

653
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,320
Today is the anniversary of

654
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,640
the four-year relationship between me and her.

655
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,920
I planned to get married with her today.

656
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,680
But...

657
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,240
I...

658
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,320
I really don't know

659
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
if I can give her the life I want.

660
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,080
I don't know.

661
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,680
Yichen,

662
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,840
you're sitting here alone.

663
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,080
You're thinking more and more.

664
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,520
Why don't you go to her

665
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,520
with the ring?

666
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,440
You've been with Xinxin for four years.

667
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,600
I believe

668
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,600
you'll get the answer you want.

669
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,760
Okay.

670
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,480
I'll try again.

671
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,880
I'm going back.

672
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,560
Yichen, I'll send you off.

673
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,520
No, you have a good rest.

674
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,680
Okay.

675
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,960
Xinxin, I'm home.

676
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,480
Xinxin, I'm home.

677
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,080
Xinxin, I'm home.

678
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,520
I came after I finished playing.

679
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,160
I bought some food on the way.

680
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,280
Why didn't you have dinner at this hour?

681
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,400
I want to eat with you.

682
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,560
Such an important day.

683
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,920
We should celebrate it.

684
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,600
I'll wash my hands.

685
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,640
Let's have some tea tonight.

686
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
We can watch TV.

687
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,640
I'll listen to you.

688
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,560
The food is not cold, is it?

689
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,640
You still have the sour and spicy fish.

690
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,600
Close the door.

691
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,000
I don't know what's going on.

692
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,280
Why didn't you open it?

693
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,920
What's wrong? Why are you laughing?

694
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,880
What did you get behind you?

695
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,600
Let me see.

696
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
Let me see.

697
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,200
Xinxin,

698
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,040
let's get married.

699
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,400
Yichen, I...

700
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,000
I really want to...

701
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,040
But...

702
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,480
Now, Xin Chen just got up.

703
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,960
She's not stable.

704
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,080
Can you give me some more time?

705
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,120
If I agree now,

706
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,520
I'll find a way for myself.

707
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,480
I don't respect you or me.

708
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,720
Well,

709
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,600
I'll pack up.

710
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,840
I'll propose to you when I get the money back.

711
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:18,880
Okay?

712
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,040
Okay.

713
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,680
I'll do it.

714
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,720
Wait for me.

715
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,520
I'll change my mind.

716
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,760
Brother Huang.

717
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,120
The number you've dialed is busy.

718
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,920
Brother Huang.

719
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,480
The number you've dialed is busy.

720
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,440
Brother Huang.

721
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,000
Zhizhou.

722
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,760
Senior.

723
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,720
You're here to see Huang?

724
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,640
Yes.

725
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
I've been looking for him

726
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,920
for a while.

727
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,320
I've given him the money.

728
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
I can't reach him.

729
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,880
He's been back for days.

730
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,200
He's been calling for him.

731
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,880
If you call him,

732
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,040
he'll call me.

733
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,440
He can't keep calling for him.

734
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,720
You're the one who's calling for him.

735
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,640
Yes.

736
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,840
What's going on?

737
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,720
I heard from him that

738
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,920
he has some financial issues.

739
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,160
Don't worry.

740
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,240
Sit here.

741
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,680
Okay.

742
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,760
See you.

743
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,560
What?

744
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,920
Sorry, Xin.

745
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,320
It's all my fault.

746
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,240
Did you call the police?

747
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,160
I'll go and check on the situation.

748
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,400
Which police station?

749
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,000
Donglin.

750
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,760
Why's the number?

751
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,960
No need.

752
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,080
But it is vital that I work with Ms. 45 and slope the company.

753
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,960
What can I do.

754
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,840
Are you going買 the money back?

755
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,360
It's good that Rongzi is here.

756
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,400
It's not a problem at all.

757
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,640
When will Rongzi arrive?

758
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,440
I don't know.

759
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,080
What's wrong?

760
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,120
I'm trying to help. It's okay.

761
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,600
What's the problem?

762
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,520
You shouldn't have gone to the park for the night.

763
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,640
You'll be paid soon.

764
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,520
Let's wait for a while.

765
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:25,720
Dad,

766
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,600
can you help me?

767
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,760
Help me.

768
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,360
We...

769
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,800
We almost made it.

770
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,680
You said you would make a lot of money at the beginning.

771
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,720
But I can make money.

772
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,840
I'm not good at it.

773
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,800
Don't beg your mom.

774
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,920
Don't talk to her.

775
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,600
The business of the industry is not as good as you.

776
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,400
The house is free for your friend.

777
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,360
I'm not a bad person.

778
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,160
I'm back.

779
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:47,880
I'm not a bad person.

780
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,560
I even have enough money for that house.

781
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,680
Dad, I...

782
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,320
I'm sorry.

783
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,280
I haven't paid the credit card.

784
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,280
I don't even have a salary.

785
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,400
I think my sincerity is very good.

786
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,240
Please check it for me.

787
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,280
I'll ask for the most.

788
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,640
Okay, okay.

789
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,760
I'll wait for your news.

790
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,600
Mr. Qi, you haven't eaten yet, right?

791
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,040
Thank you.

792
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,840
Where are they?

793
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,560
Mr. Su went out for something.

794
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,760
He went to eat at the small shop.

795
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,760
Did you eat?

796
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,760
I ate.

797
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,440
Mr. Qi,

798
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,360
did he say anything about the exit?

799
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,160
He said he needed a few days to investigate.

800
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,680
What did he say?

801
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,480
He said he needed a few days to investigate.

802
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,720
Xiaoxia, what's the matter?

803
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,160
Mr. Qi,

804
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,080
I heard some news from outside these days.

805
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,760
It's said that our company can't have a loan.

806
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,640
Our investment company

807
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,280
has too many requirements.

808
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,040
Our model product has been made.

809
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,320
I believe it can be used for a loan very soon.

810
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,440
How about?

811
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
If you go there to study hurt,

812
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,560
you'll市 all over the place.

813
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,560
General Tao is pretty close to...)

814
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,640
Village Chief,

815
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,920
how many days have you been staying there?

816
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,240
Not many.

817
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,560
I felt really worried

818
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,280
about the loss when I came close to the city.

819
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,400
Xiao.

820
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,040
Don't be worried.

821
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,120
We need a loan.

822
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,120
I know you've done a lot for the company.

823
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,760
But now the company is in trouble.

824
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,440
I'll try my best to solve it.

825
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,800
Don't worry. I promise you.

826
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,440
As long as the company is on the right track,

827
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,000
your salary and compensation

828
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,480
will be paid to you.

829
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,360
I've made my decision.

830
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,880
I'm sorry.

831
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,560
Okay.

832
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,160
Since you've made your decision,

833
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,360
I won't force you.

834
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,480
I hope you can do everything well.

835
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,160
Thank you.

836
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,720
Mr. Li.

837
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,840
Mr. Li.

838
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,760
Mr. Li.

839
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,640
This is our model product.

840
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,560
I planned to use the sound machine

841
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,000
to get the money out of it.

842
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,000
But then...

843
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,640
Mr. Han.

844
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,760
Didn't you invite us to come to Dongyi?

845
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,320
Do you want to know

846
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,920
if this invitation is still in operation?

847
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,480
Come to me.

848
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Do you know?

849
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,960
Then you should convince her to come to me.

850
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,240
We...

851
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,640
Actually, we...

852
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,840
Xia.

853
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,960
I'm busy.

854
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,520
You...

855
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,160
Xing is pregnant?

856
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,400
How is she?

857
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,280
Don't worry.

858
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,240
She's fine.

859
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,160
She must be under a long-term pressure.

860
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,160
She can't rest well.

861
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,800
She has blood sugar and low fever.

862
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
That's why she's pregnant.

863
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,360
She has a little bit of sleep

864
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,040
and has a little bit of sleep.

865
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,880
She'll be fine after a good sleep.

866
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,000
She'll be in the hospital

867
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,840
and will rest well.

868
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,120
Try not to change your mind.

869
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,360
Okay.

870
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,360
Thank you, doctor.

871
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,440
Mr. Han.

872
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,360
Did you tell her about it?

873
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,000
I did.

874
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,360
Mr. Han.

875
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,000
To be honest,

876
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,400
we've been walking on the wrong path.

877
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,960
We planned to use the sound machine

878
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,160
to get the money out of it.

879
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,840
But the other party ran away.

880
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,560
I...

881
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,400
Our company is not in the business right now.

882
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,200
Can you see

883
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
how Xing and you

884
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,160
participate in a competition?

885
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,040
Give us the investment.

886
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,760
The private education is private education.

887
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,720
Work is work.

888
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,640
If you can't even bear the pressure,

889
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,400
you'll be in vain.

890
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,040
If you really want to do it for her,

891
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,960
then ask her to accept my conditions.

892
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:01,960
What?

893
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,080
Why did Huang...

894
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,800
Another child?

895
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,800
过来,过来, everyone.

896
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,800
Let's go.

897
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,560
It's too much work for me.

898
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,280
But eigenvalues are important.

899
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,480
I'll try to help you with my work.

900
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,080
Don't worry about me.

901
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,440
When you think of her,

902
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,320
I can do all work.

903
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,960
Consider it.

904
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,200
The question she gets to氣 her.

905
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,200
I will definitely solve it.

906
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,720
This matter

907
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,800
is not related to Xing Xing.

908
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,200
Don't worry.

909
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,440
Bye.

910
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,760
Yin Sheng.

911
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,040
Qiu Zi.

912
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,600
Why are you here?

913
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,200
Our materials hospital

914
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,600
has a cooperation with your hospital.

915
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,120
I came to the meeting today.

916
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,160
Did you

917
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,320
encounter something at home?

918
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,680
Sorry.

919
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,680
I didn't mean to listen to you.

920
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:00,840
It's nothing.

921
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:03,760
Yin Sheng.

922
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,120
Take this to the emergency room.

923
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,200
I will send you the message later.

924
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,520
No need, Qiu Zi.

925
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,160
I will solve the money myself.

926
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,080
Don't be so polite with me.

927
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,760
Take it.

928
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,440
Thank you, Qiu Zi.

929
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,240
I will give you the receipt later.

930
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,080
Okay, Yin Sheng.

931
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,480
No matter what trouble you encounter,

932
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,720
I believe

933
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,280
you will definitely solve it.

934
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,040
Qiu Zi.

935
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,160
I really don't know

936
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,920
how to thank you.

937
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,200
We don't have to be so polite.

938
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,480
We are just friends.

939
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,240
Xing Xing is my best friend.

940
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,040
And

941
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,040
you should have proposed to her.

942
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,880
Then we don't have to be so polite.

943
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,240
Thank you.

944
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,560
Daylight of the Great cared epidemics

945
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,040
Daylight of the Conc labour

946
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,000
Li Hao.

947
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,600
Where are you, professor Li?

948
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,400
Over there.

949
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,360
Thank you.

950
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:15,920
It's alright.

951
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,560
Sister Li.

952
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,600
How is it?

953
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,200
The doctor said it's fine. You need to get a bigger pressure.

954
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,600
Have a good rest.

955
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,800
Okay. I'll watch them. You can go back first.

956
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,000
Okay. I'll go back first.

957
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,600
How is it?

958
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,600
How is it, honey?

959
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,800
The doctor said you had too much pressure.

960
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,600
You didn't get a good rest.

961
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,400
You've made yourself dizzy.

962
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,600
You can't do this again next time.

963
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,200
Okay.

964
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,600
I'm sorry. I've already paid you.

965
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,400
What are you talking about?

966
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,400
I just told you not to have any pressure.

967
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,000
Your company is not in the middle of the night.

968
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,200
I'm still waiting for your salary to take me flying.

969
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,000
Don't think too much.

970
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,600
Are you hungry? I'll buy you some food.

971
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,000
You can rest here. I'll be back soon.

972
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
We are a couple

973
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
We don't want to be afraid of being separated

974
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
We are always afraid of each other

975
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Let each other be fresh and peaceful

976
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,000
We pretend to be strangers

977
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
We are a couple

978
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,400
We pretend to be friends

979
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,400
We don't want to be afraid of being separated

980
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:43,000
We are always afraid of being separated

981
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,400
We are always afraid of being separated

982
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,800
We don't want to be separated
