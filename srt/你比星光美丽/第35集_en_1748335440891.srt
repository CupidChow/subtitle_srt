1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going to forget the past,

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to know the future.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost in the dark.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't give up.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll be lost in the dark.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Even if I'm lost in the dark.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Mr. Su, Mr. Li.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're so boring.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You just told us now.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes, you're so boring.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I know.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They must want to give us a surprise.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Right?

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I feel like I'm about to fall out of the moon.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What are you talking about?

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We've come back from the Dinghai Mountain.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We're going to have a mountain of trust in the future.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Didn't you say yesterday

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
that I'm your firm trust in the mountain?

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Enough.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You can't forget anything.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No matter whether he's here or not,

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
you have to prove yourself.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Mr. Li, Mr. Su.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We understand what you mean.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Don't worry.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We'll make Mr. Ji see that

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Xing Chen didn't let him down

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
when he was gone.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Right.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
All right.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Get back to work.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's go.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm fine here.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Mr. Han, what else do you want to say?

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Go to work today.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Everyone, thank you.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Mr. Han.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Well...

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Go ahead.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Choose one.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If I can change this card to yours,

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
you can promise me a request.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
All right.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let's go, Lang Chu.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's go.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
All right.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Let's go.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Boss, Miss Tan Yunning

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
wants to invite you to the lunch.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
She's waiting for you in the Lang Chu restaurant.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Are you going?

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Can you do magic?

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Although it's hard to get this talent,

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I like to do something challenging.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Especially for you.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm looking forward to our cooperation.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm happy to be back to Hanxin

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and welcome you to the wedding.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I also think that I'm in the country

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
with the first policy of coming back to China with you.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I really feel that it's not real.

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
When you're being delayed by work,

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
you know what's real.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's real.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Look,

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm so nervous.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I saw a guest on the building.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He's a famous actor.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't know who he's going to eat.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yes.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I heard from his phone that

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Mr. Han must be a big boss.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Mr. Han?

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Could it be Han Ting?

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Thank you.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
All right. Please wait.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This restaurant is quite special.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Please wait.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Thank you.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Open it.

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What did you do?

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You didn't answer me just now.

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Do you want to watch the movie with me?

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I just entered Hanxin.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I still have a lot of work to do.

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This job is important.

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's a personal life.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's not fun.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's not a motivation to work.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
If you don't hate me,

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
you can have a good time

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
with me

106
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and your work.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Thank you for your reminder.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Thank you for your reminder.

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll pay attention to the old couple.

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But my personal life

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
doesn't want to have other people.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You're so unlovable.

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's because of Han Ting.

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You still like her.

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You can't let her go.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We still have a lot of time to get along.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I can compete with her.

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I think we should be friends.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Okay.

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Let's be friends first.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Sir, you're...

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Excuse me.

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll serve you some food.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Hello, Mr. Han.

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Are you here?

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Miss Tan, I'm sorry.

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Mr. Han has a video meeting.

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's inconvenient to make a reservation.

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Since Mr. Han is busy,

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
we'll make a reservation next time.

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Thank you, Mr. Han.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You're welcome.

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Mr. Han asked me to order a flower basket.

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll send it to the studio later.

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Wish you success in your operation.

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll send it to Da Mai.

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Thank you, Mr. Han.

152
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's good.

153
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's good for your appetite.

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm afraid you won't get used to it.

155
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I've been back to China several times.

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I always get tired of eating.

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You're good at ordering.

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You can bring me food later.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'll be with you.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You're a good friend.

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're a good friend.

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You're not a good friend anymore.

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Mr. Han, thank you.

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll be back when I have time.

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Mr. Ji,

166
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm off work now.

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay.

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No.

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
He didn't ask about the reservation.

170
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,980
The one who must hurry

171
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,740
The one who must solution

172
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,040
Does not sleep

173
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,800
Is notorgone

174
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,600
Did you hide yourself?

175
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,000
I'll take your dad to the New Hong Kong for a few days.

176
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,960
I'll bring you some special dishes.

177
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,920
Okay.

178
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I'll arrange it.

179
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,320
I'll take you to the New Hong Kong.

180
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,040
Okay.

181
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,920
I'll go with your dad.

182
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,800
I won't disturb you.

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,200
Of course, I won't disturb you.

184
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,760
How about this?

185
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,840
After you've booked the ticket,

186
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,880
send me the message to pick you up.

187
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,720
Okay.

188
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,520
Bye.

189
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,400
Okay. Bye.

190
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
Mr. Lei.

191
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,080
Mr. Jing, come see me.

192
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,000
Sit.

193
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:13,680
Mr. Lei, I'd like to

194
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,520
tu da eme day.

195
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,520
Are you the Deputy Director of Depends on me?

196
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,560
I'm so happy to have you here.

197
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,360
By the way,

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,960
you really need to have a good rest.

199
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,160
You need to keep your health and health.

200
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,760
Get ready to go to the hospital.

201
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,040
Are you going to arrange me to go on a business trip?

202
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,960
Where are you going?

203
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,400
The Shenzhen AI Medical Exhibition

204
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,960
will be held in the high-end forum.

205
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,560
The invitation is sent by the head of the department.

206
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,160
My name is on the board.

207
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,360
Take a look.

208
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,760
The Shenzhen AI Medical Exhibition

209
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,760
will be held in the high-end forum.

210
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,760
If you're sure,

211
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,760
you can come back tomorrow morning.

212
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,760
The last meeting was held in the high-end forum.

213
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,760
It's been a year.

214
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,760
I went to the last meeting.

215
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,360
The atmosphere this year is different from last year.

216
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,760
Today is the day of the appointment of the head of the department.

217
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,760
Maybe next year,

218
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,920
you'll be invited by the head of the department.

219
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,520
Then I'll be the head of the department.

220
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,320
Okay,

221
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,720
go back and prepare the bill.

222
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,320
Thank you.

223
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,320
Mr. Ji has a emergency meeting.

224
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,920
So I'll bring the second boss to the company.

225
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,920
Thank you.

226
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,520
Xiao Xue.

227
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,720
These two are the parents of Mr. Ji.

228
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,720
You'll bring them to the office later.

229
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:52,920
Okay.

230
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,320
Thank you.

231
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:54,920
Thank you.

232
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,320
Hello, Mrs. Shu.

233
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,920
Mr. Ji is having a meeting next door.

234
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,920
I'll take the second boss to his office and wait for him.

235
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,920
Miss,

236
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,920
is this the meeting?

237
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:05,920
Yes.

238
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,320
Can we have a look?

239
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,920
No, thanks.

240
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,520
Just a look.

241
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,920
Okay.

242
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,480
Just a look.

243
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,080
It smells good.

244
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,080
Here.

245
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,080
Well, take me to the office.

246
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,280
Follow me.

247
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,080
Come with me.

248
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,280
Okay.

249
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,080
It's so nice.

250
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:56,680
Look.

251
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,480
So many people.

252
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,080
They're all our girls.

253
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,680
Mrs. Shu,

254
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,880
wait a minute.

255
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,680
I'll go out.

256
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,280
Okay.

257
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,080
Thank you.

258
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,680
Thank you.

259
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,680
This is so big.

260
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,680
It's so fat.

261
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,080
It looks like it's not enough to eat.

262
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,480
Mr. Ji,

263
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,280
come and have a look.

264
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,680
The sea is so beautiful.

265
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,480
Yes.

266
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,680
Be careful.

267
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,680
It's all transparent here.

268
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,280
They can see us.

269
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,040
They're all busy with work.

270
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,040
Who has the time to see you?

271
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,040
I didn't expect

272
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,040
my daughter

273
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,440
to be such a great model.

274
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,040
Our daughter

275
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,040
is so good at doing big things.

276
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,040
It depends on whether she wants it or not.

277
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,040
At that time, you always said that she was tired.

278
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,440
It's you.

279
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,440
Of course.

280
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,640
Look.

281
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,000
Our Xin Xin

282
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,400
is so fit now.

283
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,000
But

284
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,800
she's so arrogant.

285
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,400
She's so bad.

286
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,400
She's a stranger

287
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,400
and she's a big hit.

288
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,800
How much water does she have to drink?

289
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,400
It's so hard.

290
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,400
Although she doesn't tell us anything,

291
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,400
I'm her mother.

292
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,800
Can't she see it?

293
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,400
Yes.

294
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,400
Come on.

295
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,400
Don't say that in front of Xin Xin.

296
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,600
You know that

297
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,600
the girl is a strong girl.

298
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,400
I know.

299
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,000
I just hope that our Xin Xin

300
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,200
can be a normal person who is happy.

301
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,400
Someone who is happy and warm-hearted

302
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,400
can accompany her.

303
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,400
You're right.

304
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,800
I just don't know what's going on with Xiaohan.

305
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,960
How is it?

306
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:12,960
Dad.

307
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:13,960
Dad.

308
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,560
Our boss is done with the meeting.

309
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,760
Stop kidding me.

310
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,160
How are you?

311
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,560
Are you tired on the way?

312
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,560
I'm not tired.

313
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,960
You little girls here

314
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,560
respect us.

315
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,960
Such a big office.

316
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,160
It's so weird.

317
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,760
Xin Xin is a business partner.

318
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,160
Your daughter is also a vice president.

319
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,360
She's a little better.

320
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,520
But she's a little busier.

321
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,520
She's a good girl.

322
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,520
That's right.

323
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,520
But you can't be arrogant.

324
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,920
You must be patient.

325
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,120
Keep working hard.

326
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,520
Don't listen to your dad.

327
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,120
Don't think about work.

328
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,120
Work is not all about life.

329
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,720
You must take a good rest, eat well,

330
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,920
and get well.

331
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,120
That's the most important thing.

332
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,120
If you're tired,

333
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,120
you can have a rest.

334
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,120
I know. Don't worry.

335
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,480
What about

336
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,880
Xiaohan?

337
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,880
We haven't seen her for a long time.

338
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,080
That's right.

339
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:15,880
She...

340
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,280
She's busier.

341
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,480
She's busier than I am.

342
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,880
How about this?

343
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,080
Your dad has an old friend.

344
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,880
He's also in Xin Gang.

345
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,280
He knows we're here.

346
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,480
He wants to treat us to dinner.

347
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,280
You're all busy.

348
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,280
Let's meet tonight.

349
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,040
Ji.

350
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,440
Okay. Just tonight.

351
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,040
I won't bother you with your mom.

352
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,440
I won't bother you.

353
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,640
Work is work.

354
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,840
Don't worry.

355
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,240
I won't bother you.

356
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,440
Okay.

357
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,640
Okay.

358
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,040
I'll let the driver drive you home.

359
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,440
No need.

360
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,040
Just drive me to the hotel.

361
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,240
Don't bother me at night.

362
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,240
Just go home by yourself.

363
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,840
This is the chicken wings you like the most.

364
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,240
And this.

365
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,640
You can't work overtime.

366
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,040
You'll have to eat it all.

367
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,600
This is the old God's chicken.

368
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,200
That's right.

369
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,400
You like chicken wings.

370
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,000
You brought a lot.

371
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,200
You can share it with your colleagues.

372
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,000
Call me after you finish your dinner.

373
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:14,800
Okay.

374
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,400
I'm leaving.

375
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,200
Okay.

376
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,000
Take care on the road.

377
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,600
Okay.

378
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,800
Don't worry.

379
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,760
Thank you.

380
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,360
Eat some.

381
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,560
What's wrong?

382
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,360
Is it not good?

383
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,560
No.

384
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,560
I don't have any appetite.

385
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,560
You're going to get better?

386
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,560
Auntie Han is so optimistic and kind.

387
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,560
She must have a few people who have a good life.

388
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,560
But she can't even get down from bed.

389
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,160
Let me tell you a secret.

390
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,560
I heard that

391
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,560
if you have a new life,

392
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,960
you'll find a way to

393
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,760
tell the people who are sad,

394
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,960
sad, and unhappy

395
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,720
to the people who are sad.

396
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,720
That way, she'll relax a lot.

397
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,720
Now,

398
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,820
I can be your

399
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,720
No need.

400
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,320
You should eat it.

401
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,720
Do you know what fruit is in the world?

402
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,720
watermelon.

403
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,720
grapes.

404
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,720
No.

405
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,680
It's strawberries,

406
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,480
樹berries, and strawberries.

407
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,880
Because you don't have any skin?

408
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,880
You can't do it.

409
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,480
Actually,

410
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,480
I didn't mean to joke with you.

411
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,080
I just wanted to tell you

412
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,480
that I came here

413
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,480
when I was reported.

414
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,680
You told me a joke

415
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,840
and comforted me.

416
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,440
How could I be here now?

417
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,440
I can't do it.

418
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,440
Do you remember what you told me?

419
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,440
You said it was hard to get used to.

420
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,640
Xiaomeng.

421
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,440
Thank you.

422
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,440
It's okay.

423
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,440
When I was in trouble,

424
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,440
you always accompanied me.

425
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,440
Now that aunt Han is in trouble,

426
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,440
I will always accompany you.

427
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,040
Besides,

428
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,440
aunt Han is so good to me.

429
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,840
I recognize her as my godmother.

430
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,440
Let's take care of her together, okay?

431
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,440
Okay, eat more.

432
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,440
Come on, take care of yourself.

433
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,840
So you can take care of aunt.

434
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,440
This.

435
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,040
Eat.

436
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,800
Okay.

437
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,200
Uncle, have some tea.

438
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,800
Thank you.

439
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,200
You're welcome.

440
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,400
Aunt, have some tea.

441
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,200
Okay, thank you.

442
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,800
I don't know what you like to eat.

443
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,200
I just ordered something.

444
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,800
Let's have a chat while eating.

445
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,800
Xiaohan, are you busy lately?

446
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,800
I'm fine. I'm not busy.

447
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,200
Uncle, aunt.

448
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,800
What's the matter with you looking for me today?

449
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,200
Well,

450
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,200
how did you come to my house

451
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,800
when you were in the Spring Festival?

452
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,800
I...

453
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,800
I had some problems with Xinxin.

454
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,800
Now you...

455
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,400
Enough.

456
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,800
Don't make me feel guilty.

457
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,800
Xiaohan, what's the situation between you and Xinxin?

458
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,200
We...

459
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,800
broke up.

460
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,200
When did you break up?

461
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,000
A year ago.

462
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,800
I told you.

463
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,000
You two didn't go back together in the Spring Festival.

464
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,760
We thought you just had some conflicts.

465
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,160
So that's when you broke up.

466
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,160
It's my fault.

467
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,760
Xiaohan,

468
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,160
tell me what you broke up with.

469
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,760
I didn't think about Han Hai's matter.

470
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,760
I didn't tell him the truth.

471
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,160
I'm sorry.

472
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,560
Don't say that.

473
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,360
Although we don't understand your problems in business,

474
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,560
if there's a problem with love,

475
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,760
it's not a problem alone, right?

476
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,160
You may think Xinxin doesn't understand you,

477
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,960
but I'm his mother.

478
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,360
I know him very well.

479
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,360
Since Xinxin is willing to go back to Hanxin,

480
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,960
it means he doesn't blame you.

481
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,960
Understand?

482
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,560
Xiaohan,

483
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,360
thank you for explaining this to us.

484
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,360
I can't rest assured with his mother.

485
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,160
So I thought of coming to Xinjiang to visit him.

486
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,560
Uncle,

487
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,960
aunt,

488
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,960
I have feelings for Ji Xing.

489
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,160
Xiaohan,

490
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,560
Xinxin's temper is very weak.

491
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,960
She doesn't like to be weak.

492
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,560
And you've broken up for so long.

493
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,160
Do you think you can still go back?

494
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,160
You will break up with her.

495
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,760
It's proven that you have problems.

496
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,560
Even if you really get back together,

497
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,360
you will still face the same problem.

498
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,120
We don't dare to share your feelings as parents.

499
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,520
But if you really want to get back together with Xinxin,

500
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,520
I hope you can think it through first.

501
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,520
If you encounter any problems again,

502
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,720
who can you let go of?

503
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,720
We don't want Xinxin to be hurt again.

504
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,560
But I was periods ago,

505
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,880
I can't beat you,

506
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,360
I'll lived more into it.

507
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,160
But you have to startimasu ca學

508
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,500
從point directly from each other

509
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,040
Hey,So,You guys took revenge on me

510
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,860
Coming

511
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,440
Old Jie,How did you get here?

512
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,240
Coming

513
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,520
What do you need for the ca學

514
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,440
By the way,Biri

515
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,020
Sorry

516
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,580
All of you can take it

517
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,020
Bai Bai is a biraz more relaxed

518
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,420
I'm sure you have a plan.

519
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,420
Don't let me down.

520
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:03,820
Fine.

521
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,820
I'll see what he can do.

522
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,620
Forget it. I'm happy.

523
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,220
Come on.

524
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,020
Okay?

525
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,620
Okay.

526
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,620
Okay.

527
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,420
Come on.

528
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,620
Have some strawberry.

529
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,420
Are you tired?

530
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,620
Are you tired?

531
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,620
Yes.

532
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,020
Okay.

533
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,420
Let's go to the party.

534
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,220
Okay.

535
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,420
I'm happy.

536
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,020
Let's go.

537
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,820
Let's go.

538
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,820
Is it fun?

539
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,820
Yes.

540
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,820
It's so fun.

541
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,220
I'll take you to the other side.

542
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,020
I'm tired of you.

543
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,220
I'm not tired.

544
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:05,820
Xin Xin.

545
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,020
I have something to do.

546
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,620
I'm going to discuss with your dad.

547
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,220
I still have to ask you.

548
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,020
What is it?

549
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,020
We said we'd meet your dad's old friend.

550
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,020
Actually, we went to see Xiaohan.

551
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:24,820
That's right.

552
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,020
About you and Xiaohan,

553
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,020
I already knew about your mom.

554
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,620
How did he tell you?

555
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,820
He said he was sorry to you.

556
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,420
I didn't tell you before.

557
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,420
I was worried about you.

558
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,220
I understand.

559
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,220
I know both of you.

560
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,420
Actually, Xin Xin.

561
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,420
You have no mom.

562
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,620
You have no relationship.

563
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,020
As long as you're happy.

564
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,020
Xin Xin.

565
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,420
You have to take care of it.

566
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,620
No matter what happens.

567
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,020
I and your mom are the ones who love you the most.

568
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,420
I know.

569
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,620
It's okay.

570
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,820
You're here.

571
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,220
Okay.

572
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:23,820
Come over here.

573
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,020
The driver is here.

574
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,420
Let's go.

575
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,020
Okay.

576
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:26,620
Let's go.

577
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,620
But you don't have to worry.

578
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,820
I know more about Han Ting.

579
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,820
I'll take care of our relationship.

580
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,820
That's great.

581
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,220
Xin Xin.

582
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,820
You're a big daughter.

583
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,220
You're the daughter of the eldest.

584
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,420
I'll get you some food.

585
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,620
Dong Lin.

586
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,420
Are you going out?

587
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,620
I'm going to buy fruits.

588
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,020
No need.

589
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,620
I bought them.

590
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,420
I also brought some flowers.

591
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,020
I think

592
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,620
you can't get out of bed now.

593
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,020
You can see the beautiful things.

594
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,020
You'll feel better.

595
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,220
Thank you.

596
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,220
You're so considerate.

597
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,020
Let's go.

598
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:40,620
Let's go.

599
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,020
Let's go.

600
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,220
Are you feeling better?

601
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,020
Let's go.

602
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,620
Thank you.

603
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,020
Let's go.

604
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,220
Liu.

605
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,020
The last bag of the spicy stir-fried noodles.

606
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,420
Go buy more tomorrow.

607
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,220
I've been eating so much all day.

608
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,420
I'm all over the place

609
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,620
with the spicy stir-fried noodles.

610
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,220
Have you told me

611
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,020
that spicy stir-fried noodles will be fattening?

612
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,420
Forget it.

613
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,220
Fattening is fattening.

614
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,220
I've endured and acknowledged

615
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,620
my son's happiness.

616
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,420
I'm just happy and fat.

617
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,820
But when will I be in a state of shock?

618
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,820
My legs are going to be lying down.

619
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,820
Mom, what are you doing?

620
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,220
Mom.

621
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,220
Auntie Han.

622
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,220
Liu.

623
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,020
I don't want the bag.

624
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,820
I'll come to work tomorrow.

625
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,420
Bring it here.

626
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,420
Tell me, Miss Han.

627
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,020
What's going on?

628
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,220
I really ran away from the earth.

629
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,420
I fainted.

630
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,020
Then?

631
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,220
Then...

632
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,220
Then it's your fault.

633
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,220
You've been chasing Mr. Meng for so long.

634
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,220
You didn't make it.

635
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,220
I'm in a hurry.

636
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,220
I'll try to find a way to get you two together.

637
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,220
Miss Han.

638
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,420
You're too ridiculous.

639
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,020
You can think of a way.

640
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,820
I'm going to be scared to death.

641
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,820
I'll see who you get.

642
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,420
Son, don't be so mean.

643
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,020
Hurry up.

644
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,620
Come on.

645
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,420
Come on.

646
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,420
Sit back.

647
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,420
Auntie.

648
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,820
We're so worried about you these days.

649
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,820
I know you're fine. Don't worry.

650
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,220
Miss Han.

651
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,420
I'm sorry.

652
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,620
I'm really in a hurry.

653
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,020
Don't blame me, right?

654
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,020
No, Auntie Han.

655
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,220
Then...

656
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,220
If you're fine,

657
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,820
I'll go back.

658
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,420
Mr. Meng, don't go.

659
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,020
Stay for a while longer.

660
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,420
I'm leaving.

661
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,420
Mr. Meng.

662
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,020
Come often.

663
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,420
I'm free.

664
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,820
Thank you, Dehua.

665
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,020
What are you doing here?

666
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,620
Go and give it to me.

667
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,820
What a bad luck.

668
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:15,820
Okay.

669
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,420
This is not a white dress.

670
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,020
This is not a white dress.

671
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,220
I'll go now.

672
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,020
Well...

673
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,420
My mom loves to do things.

674
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,220
She's been doing so many things.

675
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,020
Well...

676
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,620
Thank you for your hard work.

677
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,020
It's okay.

678
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,620
Don't worry.

679
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,220
I'm the best when I'm healthy.

680
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:42,820
Well,

681
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,820
smart girl.

682
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,820
You're so poor.

683
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,420
You...

684
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,220
You're not going to...

685
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,420
change your mind.

686
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,220
What?

687
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,620
It's not my style to die.

688
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,420
I'm asking you again.

689
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,620
What do you think of me?

690
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,220
You're not good at changing. I can change.

691
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,420
That's too much.

692
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,020
I've been working all day.

693
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,020
Fine.

694
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,020
I know.

695
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,020
But you have a lot of advantages.

696
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,820
You're a good girl.

697
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,220
You're good at being optimistic.

698
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,420
These qualities are good enough.

699
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,620
They cover your problems.

700
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,820
What do you mean?

701
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,620
You've made me confused.

702
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,620
I get it.

703
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,220
So...

704
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,620
do you like it?

705
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,220
I'll give you a practical wife.

706
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,620
Okay.

707
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:05,620
A practical wife.

708
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,820
A practical wife.

709
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,020
You can use it.

710
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,420
I'll give you a call right now.

711
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:14,820
I...

712
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,220
I...

713
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,020
Da Huang,

714
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,820
tomorrow is your birthday.

715
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,220
What birthday gift do you want?

716
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,620
Do you want to see him?

717
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,620
Da Huang,

718
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,620
you've been with him

719
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,620
every birthday.

720
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,420
I hope you won't be absent this time.

721
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,220
Da Huang,

722
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,820
do you think he'll agree?

723
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,420
Okay.

724
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,620
Let's go.

725
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,420
I'll take you to eat some canned food.

726
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:15,820
Da Huang.

727
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,020
Da Huang.

728
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:43,420
Da Huang.

729
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,620
What's wrong?

730
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,980
Da Huang.

731
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,780
Da Huang.

732
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,980
Long time no see.

733
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,780
I miss you so much.

734
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,180
You prepared so much.

735
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,660
I think you should

736
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,780
want to stay with Da Huang for a while.

737
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,780
So I prepared some food.

738
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,180
Da Huang, did you miss me?

739
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,180
I miss you so much.

740
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,140
I miss you.

741
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,740
We sent you a blessing

742
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,740
in the New Year.

743
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,140
Thank you.

744
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,540
Oh, right.

745
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,940
I brought you a birthday hat

746
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,940
and a little scarf.

747
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,340
Come here. I'll bring it for you.

748
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,540
Da Huang, why don't you come out?

749
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,540
Are you angry with me?

750
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,180
I'll help you.

751
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,340
Come out.

752
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:42,740
Come on.

753
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,140
Do you like it?

754
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,140
I'll bring it for you.

755
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,740
Okay.

756
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,140
Cute.

757
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,740
Happy birthday.

758
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,140
Here.

759
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,340
Thank you.

760
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,540
You made this cake?

761
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,340
He likes it.

762
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,700
I was worried that

763
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,180
I wouldn't take good care of him.

764
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,780
So I read some books about cats

765
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,620
and learned some tricks.

766
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,020
You raised him well.

767
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,020
We met the king together.

768
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,780
I took care of him.

769
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,180
By the way,

770
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,140
it's the king's birthday today.

771
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,020
I've prepared a cake for you.

772
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,100
I have one too.

773
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,340
Here.

774
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,300
Thank you.

775
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,460
Spoon.

776
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,660
Did my parents find you a few days ago?

777
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,180
Yes.

778
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:38,900
I'm sorry.

779
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,980
I was afraid

780
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,300
that they would be upset

781
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,340
and I didn't tell them.

782
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:44,740
It's okay.

783
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,860
I'm sure I can have this chance

784
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,620
to explain to your parents

785
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,020
and apologize.

786
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,940
You don't need to apologize.

787
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,260
But I hurt their daughter's heart.

788
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,220
They don't want you to be hurt.

789
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:04,940
I'm sorry.

790
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,140
I'm sorry too.

791
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,780
That bean curd bun.

792
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,820
It's not broken yet.

793
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,060
Yes.

794
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,260
It was broken once.

795
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,580
I bought it for him.

796
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,580
He doesn't like it.

797
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,540
Because that

798
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,780
was bought by you.

799
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,580
It might have your taste.

800
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,340
Then I fixed it.

801
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,140
I can still use it.

802
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,460
It's pretty good.

803
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,060
I'll take a photo of you and the king.

804
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:52,660
Okay.

805
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,900
Here, take a photo.

806
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,300
Love is a dream,

807
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,980
for to see.

808
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,580
Did you know

809
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,340
the bamboo shoot case

810
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,700
will be held

811
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,740
on this day?

812
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,340
It's a matter of protection.

813
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,260
There's no freedom anyway.

814
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,860
It's said that the criminal should be punished.

815
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,340
Anyway, the key to the jewelry is under the car.

816
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,340
I don't know who's guilty.

817
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,580
It's really cruel.

818
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,860
Who told him to do the illegal thing first?

819
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,340
That's true.

820
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,340
I heard a few partners talk about this before.

821
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,340
They said that if they were the main candidate,

822
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,500
they would have to drag the person behind them to the prison.

823
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,340
It's also because of Mr. Naofu.

824
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:03,820
Naofu.

825
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,100
After you see Mr. Naknall is back in the prison,

826
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,620
take him in.

827
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,540
Sure.

828
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,740
I'll leave.

829
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,740
I see you standing in front of me

830
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:43,740
The world that is familiar to me

831
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,740
Those look like distant

832
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,740
But hate between you and me

833
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:56,740
I want to test who has crossed the border

834
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:02,740
If I can get closer to you

835
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:09,740
Can I remember the beginning and end of time

836
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,740
Time goes by so fast

837
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,740
Let the lonely and unwavering be safe

838
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:24,740
Don't let the understanding become a kind of adventure

839
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:30,740
We are a couple

840
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:36,740
Don't want to be afraid of being separated

841
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:41,740
Love is always afraid

842
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:47,740
Let each other be fresh and warm

843
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:53,740
We are a couple

844
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:59,740
We can stay and let go

845
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:06,740
Let's leave ourselves alone

846
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:12,740
Don't want to be afraid of being separated

847
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,740
Love is always afraid

848
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:21,740
Let each other be fresh and warm

849
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,740
Don't want to be afraid of being separated

850
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,740
Love is always afraid
