You're so scared when I joke.

24
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,070
When someone else

25
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,840
says something dirtier,

26
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,680
can you bear that?

27
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,950
I don't care about pink news.

28
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,840
But it will hurt you.

If you can't bear the consequences,

30
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,470
don't take a shortcut.

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,400
To take a shortcut,

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,800
you have to pay a price.

33
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,840
If you don't care,

34
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,270
go on.

35
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,470
I care.

36
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,360
Ride slowly. Stay safe.

37
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,590
(Stay Always Safe)
I will, Ms. Han.

38
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,430
See you next time.

39
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,360
See you.

40
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,030
Text me when you're home.

41
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,910
OK.

42
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,910
- Bye-bye!
- Stay safe!

43
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,360
Such an adorable girl.

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,240
Hey, Ms. Han.

45
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,030
What are you doing here?

46
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,960
To welcome me?

47
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,870
You freaked me out.

48
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,590
Welcome you? Don't flatter yourself.

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,310
Where have you fooled around again?

50
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,590
Ms. Han,

51
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,840
who would talk like this to her son?

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,960
I can't feel your love at all.

53
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,310
Can you feel it now? Can you?

54
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,520
Every day, you sleep
in the day and play at night.

55
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,590
I don't know what I have,

56
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,800
a son or a bat.

57
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,190
Come in here.

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,560
The soup is getting cold.

59
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,750
I'm a bat. I'm Batman, too.

60
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:04,340
(Wonton and Wine)

61
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,680
Shall I heat it for you?

62
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,310
No. No need.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,840
Come on, man.

64
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,430
It was heated three times.

65
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,430
If you don't want it,
you shouldn't have ordered.

66
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,360
You've been back from Germany for a while.

67
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,070
Still have the jet lag?

68
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,430
For the record,

69
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,950
I won't see anyone again

70
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,630
at this time of day.

71
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,270
Tonight,

72
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,950
when my princess saw me go out so late,

73
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,390
she cried and screamed.

74
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,920
It took me a long time to calm her down.

75
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,390
What exactly happened?

76
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,030
What's bothering you?

77
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,070
Tell me and let me analyze.

78
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,800
(I don't care about pink news.)

79
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,070
But it will hurt you.

80
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,830
If you can't bear the consequences,

81
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,560
don't take a shortcut.

82
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,600
To take a shortcut,

83
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,920
you have to pay a price.

84
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,830
Mr. Lin, nice meeting you.

85
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,430
There's some misunderstanding

86
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,270
I have to explain to you.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,720
Mr. Han is Xingchen's investor.

88
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,310
He and I

89
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,070
are only the boss and the subordinate.

90
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,040
I'm afraid I can't help

91
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,630
with your cooperation with Dongyang Medical.

92
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,920
You've offered us a discount

93
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,630
and we really appreciate it.

94
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,040
But we won't take what we don't deserve.

95
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,750
We appreciate your offer.

96
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,800
Sorry for the trouble.

97
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,660
(Ji Xing)

98
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,310
That's it?

99
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,360
(Wonton Shop)
When she said

100
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,310
she was close to you,

101
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,510
isn't that all you want?

102
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,510
She takes advantage of me.

103
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,750
Who wants this kind of false heartiness?

104
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,750
False heartiness

105
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,000
and sincerity

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,480
are invertible.

107
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,270
Many people end up with true feelings.

108
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,560
People keep changing.

109
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,430
So does this world.

110
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,600
I haven't changed.

111
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,160
And I will not change.

112
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,390
You're worried about Ji Xing.

113
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,360
That's why you're angry, huh?

114
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,000
She never knows how fast rumors spread

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,430
in this circle.

116
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,240
Once it starts,

117
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,120
the rumors

118
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,870
will flood

119
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,750
over all her efforts.

120
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,920
I guessed right, huh?

121
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,480
You're just worried about her.

122
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,760
A man,

123
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,920
once he has someone or something

124
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,150
to care about,

125
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,270
he'll lose his cool.

126
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,270
All right, Mr. Han.

127
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
We're done here, huh?

128
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,070
If you don't mind, I'll go.

129
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,240
You pay the bill yourself.

130
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:18,980
(Laosi Wonton Shop)

131
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,380
(Mr. Lin of Beidi)

132
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,560
Hello, Mr. Lin.

133
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,040
Sorry to disturb you, Miss Ji.

134
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,310
Here's the thing.

135
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,000
Mr. Han was in the canteen at lunch.

136
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,000
His assistant

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,560
contacted me.

138
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,390
According to Assistant Tang,

139
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,120
Mr. Han invested in you

140
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,160
after you took several twists,

141
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,720
not because you were his schoolmate.

142
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,920
We misunderstood you.

143
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,270
My apologies, Miss Ji.

144
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,120
This problem won't

145
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,190
affect our cooperation.

146
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,360
You were being so honest today.

147
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,560
I believe

148
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,000
our future cooperation

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,190
will go very smoothly.

150
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,920
We offered a discount

151
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,750
and please don't reject it.

152
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
Take it as our sincerity

153
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,430
for a long-term cooperation.

154
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,870
What do you say, Miss Ji?

155
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,040
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

156
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,830
Sorry for today.

157
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,270
OK. Keep in contact.

158
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,520
Bye, Miss Ji.

159
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,630
I won't disturb you. Bye.

160

Yesterday,

161
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,600
I did something improperly.

162
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,080
Thank you

163
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,270
for making Assistant Tang call Mr. Lin.

164
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,510
Hi, guys.

165
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,030
Li?

166
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,630
- You...
- What are you doing here?

167
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,960
To start my work here.

168
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,480
You've made up your mind?

169
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,720
I thought about it.
Xingchen gets support from Dongyang.

170
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,030
To get some work experience here

171
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,200
will only benefit me.

172
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,630
Miss Ji, you'll be my boss.

173
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,960
Don't say that.

174
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,200
When I lent you 100,000,

175
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,440
I said it would be my investment.

176
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,840
Li Li, our business partner.

177
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,080
That's right. Partner.

178
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,960
Hi.

179
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,550
Xing, how about you get back to work?

180
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,150
I'll show her around.

181
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,480
OK. This cool girl

182
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,720
will be your responsibility for now.

183
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,630
OK. Come this way, Li.

184
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,200
This will be your seat.

185
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,240
This is a great seat.

186
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,910
Rather lucky.

187
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,150
The best seat in Xingchen.

188
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,670
I've been keeping it for you.

189
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,960
Seriously, Mr. Su?

190
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,910
The whole area was yours, wasn't it?

191
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,870
I usually have a lot of work.

192
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,550
When Li is here,

193
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,910
she can share my workload.

194
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,440
You have no idea. Come on.

195
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,200
Yesterday, I was being insensitive.

196
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,440
But I swear

197
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,510
I never wanted anyone

198
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,720
to misunderstand us.

199
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,120
Whatever you explain,

200
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,030
people can see you through.

201
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,480
This has to be deliberate.

202
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,840
Why are you so nagging today?

203
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,840
Do you not have too much work yet?

204
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,080
And the chair. Where is it?

205
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,440
Hurry. Be more sensible.

206
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,480
Thank you.

207
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,600
I seriously apologize
for what happened yesterday.

208
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
I swear I have no intentions

209
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
toward you.

210
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,200
It's no use explaining.

211
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,120
Everybody knows

212
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,600
what you want.

213
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,920
Shang.

214
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,960
I know. The mouse and the keyboard.

215
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,470
Li.

216
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,120
You guys take care of Li Li.

217
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,350
OK.

218
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,320
Do what you need to do, Xing.

219
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,630
These are all new.

220
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,630
Come on. Give it to me.

221
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,590
Miss Li.

222
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,440
Who are you texting?

223
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,150
You seem to hesitate for a long time.

224
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,550
Han Ting.

225
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,590
For what I did yesterday,

226
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,270
I don't know how to face him.

227
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,750
Han Ting is interesting.

228
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,790
It's true that he invested in you.

229
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,240
But now, he's being emotional.

230
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,030
Li,

231
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,720
which plant do you like?

232
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,360
Put one in front of your computer.

233
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,680
OK.

234
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,960
You decide what to text, sweetheart.

235
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,080
I'm getting back in.

236
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,150
Sorry.

237
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,000
I shouldn't have fooled others

238
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,480
in your name.

239
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,550
I'll learn my lesson

240
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,500
and never do it again.

241
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,420
(Ji Xing)

242
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,100
(Mm.)

243
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,590
Grandpa.

244
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,390
Some tea for you.

245
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,270
When I was recuperating

246
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,200
in Hainan,

247
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,910
news often

248
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,390
got to my ears.

249
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,200
They said you and your cousin

250
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,080
kept fighting all the time.

251
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,320
When you just start your career,

252
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,120
don't go too far.

253
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,150
Leaving a way out for someone

254
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,360
will be leaving a way out for yourself.

255
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,510
I have the genes of fighting.

256
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,320
Just like you, Grandpa.

257
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,600
After you're back from Germany,
you're more eloquent.

258
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,270
I shall say no more

259
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,120
about you and your cousin.

260
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,000
But remember one thing.

261
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,080
Don't hurt the foundation of Dongyang.

262
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,480
Don't worry, Grandpa.

263
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,560
I know what to do.

264
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,790
I heard

265
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,550
you invested in a young lady

266
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,910
named Ji Xing.

267
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,000
She was your schoolmate in college?

268
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,960
Grandpa,

269
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,960
I invested in her

270
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,000
because I thought highly of her.

271
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,150
Stop the gobbledygook.

272
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,910
You like her, don't you?

273
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,350
Yes.

274
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,750
How far have you gone?

275
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,960
She doesn't know I like her

276
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,510
and she isn't my girlfriend yet.

277
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,360
Before you could get her,

278
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,750
you invested twenty million?

279
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,270
This young lady

280
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,080
really has something.

281
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,320
Remember.

282
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,910
An investor

283
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,670
never does money-losing businesses.

284
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,480
Grandpa, I trust her.

285
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,510
My granddaughter-in-law

286
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,320
has to bear some responsibilities

287
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,150
that ordinary girls

288
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,550
can't bear.

289
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,720
The love thing

290
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,790
is easy for ordinary people.

291
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,390
But the one you love

292
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,480
has to be capable enough.

293
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,720
To start up a business

294
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,320
is like a thousand soldiers
crossing a single-log bridge.

295
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,080
How far she can finally go

296
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,720
remains an unknown.

297
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,720
Think about it.

298
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,670
Without the support

299
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,840
from a CEO like you,

300
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,960
how much longer can she hold?

301
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,440
How much confidence do you have

302
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,720
in her sticking to you until the end?

303
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,120
Grandpa,

304
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,750
Ji Xing isn't ordinary.

305
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,960
I just

306
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,480
don't know if she's willing

307
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,670
to bear all this for me.

308
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,670
Anyway,

309
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,150
I won't pay for anyone irrelevant.

310
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,320
I can give Ji Xing

311
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,870
only two years.

312
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,480
If she doesn't succeed,

313
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,320
you'll have to marry

314
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,790
a suitable girl

315
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,870
that I get you.

316
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,320
She will succeed.

317
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,240
Come on.

318
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,730
Don't think Dongyang Medical's investment

319
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,150
will certainly make her win.

320
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,670
Success...

321
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,080
It's never that easy.

322
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,960
Hello. Is that Mr. Lin?

323
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,390
This is Xingchen Technology.

324
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm calling to tell you you've passed

325
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,080
our first round of interview.

326
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,150
The day after tomorrow, what time

327
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,550
can you come for the second round?

328
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,600
Your office

329
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,510
is way too rough.

330
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,480
It's not like a legal company.

331
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,960
Are you a shell company?

332
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,950
No. We're not a shell company.

333
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,030
Hello?

334
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,720
Hello?

335
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,790
What's wrong, Shang?

336
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,000
The material engineer
we interviewed yesterday

337
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,110
rejected us,

338
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,960
saying our office is so poor

339
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,110
that we're not like a legal company.

340
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,760
It's OK.

341
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,960
Recruiting a new employee
is like getting a boyfriend.

342
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,830
After you interview more,

343
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,480
you'll get a suitable one.

344
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,880
Right. Perfect employees are rare.

345
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,270
It's OK. At ten,

346
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,790
we'll see an interviewee, huh?

347
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,920
Oh, it's ten.

348
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,070
Ask her where she is.

349
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,160
Hello, Miss Li.

350
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,830
This is Xingchen Technology.

351
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,480
We have an interview at ten.

352
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,920
Where are you now?

353
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,840
Hello?

354
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,310
Mr. Su,

355
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,680
she thought we would be

356
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,680
in an office building.

357
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,960
But she arrived,

358
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,160
only to see a rooftop house.

359
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,550
Then she changed her mind.

360
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,480
Looks like it's really hard

361
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,270
to recruit new employees.

362
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,720
There's something harder.

363
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,680
We booked a printer.

364
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,070
But we still need a lab.

365
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,160
Meanwhile, we need to hire

366
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,110
some technicians to operate the printer.

367
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,110
Or, we can't even get

368
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,400
to the pilot stage.

369
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,440
Our current office condition

370
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,070
really affects the recruitment.

371
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,030
How about

372
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,110
I rent this house out?

373
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,480
With some extra money,

374
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,720
we can rent another office,

375
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,750
bigger and better.

376
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,590
No. I did the calculations.

377
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,790
The down payment

378
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,920
and final payment for the printer.

379
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,400
We need a lab after the festival.

380
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,350
We also keep some money

381
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,680
for daily operations.

382
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,070
We can't afford a new office.

383
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,510
We must do something to make extra money.

384
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,680
We can get some small jobs.

385
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,750
Writing a little app

386
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,200
for the hospital, for example.

387
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,720
It's money, after all.

388
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,720
Let's think separately

389
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
about what else we can do.

390
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
I'll go out this afternoon.

391
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,000
To see what projects

392
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,310
we can do for the moment.

393
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,720
I'll contact other interviewees.

394
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,860
(Sister)

395
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,870
Speak.

396
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,240
Brother,

397
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,510
when Linjia was back

398
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,480
from his blind date, he said

399
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,110
he'd never seen Ting

400
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,110
stare at a girl

401
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,400
with that kind of look.

402
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,750
Instead of helping him,

403
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,790
you even said

404
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,550
you would give them two years.

405
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,790
I didn't know he would

406
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,830
ask you for support.

407
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,790
Not every girl

408
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,030
can be my grandson's wife.

409
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,880
(Sister)
What are you talking about?

410
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,350
How shall I describe you?

411
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,640
You're like

412
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,310
a Terracotta Warrior

413
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,510
that was just excavated.

414
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,400
Old-fashioned and stubborn.

415
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,720
It's the 21st century.

416
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,750
Why do you
still care about family backgrounds?

417
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,720
Shame on you, Brother.

418
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,680
Look how fast

419
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,000
Han Ting is expanding his territories.

420
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,590
If I didn't restrain him,

421
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,720
he'd be too arrogant.

422
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,800
Besides,

423
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,920
none of us knows

424
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,030
what's the best

425
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,270
this girl can do.

426
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,880
My grandson's wife

427
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,910
will have some

428
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,920
unimportant fame.

429
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,160
More importantly,

430
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,480
she must be able to bear responsibilities.

431
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,880
Before, I thought

432
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,270
Zeng Di was good for him.

433
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,400
But now, he's got another girl.

434
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,750
Anyway, I won't take back

435
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,480
what I said.

436
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,310
Brother, the older you are,
the more stubborn you get.

437
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,640
Anyway, I just kindly remind you.

438
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,750
Don't make it backfire.

439
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,790
Otherwise,

440
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,070
your grandson would not have a wife.

441
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,630
Say no more.

442
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,680
Nothing's settled yet.

443
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,350
OK. I'll hang up.

444
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,280
You...

445
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,310
You hung up when you couldn't talk back.

446
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,240
So stubborn.

447
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,700
(Care for Nothing)

448
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,420
(Dongyang Group)

449
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,260
(Dongyang Medical Co., Ltd.)

450
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,700
(Work report of Xingchen Technology)

451
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,070
Boss, you should sign this.

452
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,880
You've arranged my schedules

453
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,640
really casually.

454
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,510
Which schedule

455
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,030
do you exactly mean?

456
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,030
Xingchen has just started

457
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,030
with a multitude of things.

458
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,350
You only arranged half an hour.

459
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,830
Do you think she can finish?

460
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,640
I get it.

461
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,680
I've indeed arranged

462
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,580
too little time for Miss Ji.

463
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,440
I'll adjust it now.

464
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,510
What about one hour?

465
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,640
Don't you know how eloquent Miss Ji is?

466
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,920
Two hours.

467
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,240
I'm on it.

468
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,590
At half past three,

469
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,590
come to my office

470
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,030
to brief me on an update.

471
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,540
(Han Ting)

472
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,580
(At half past three, come to my office.)

473
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,420
(Li Li)

474
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,790
Hey, Li Li.

475
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:17,910
Xing,

476
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,510
a senior of mine told me

477
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,720
he knew Director Li Quan'an

478
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,680
who took care of purchasing
at Xinggang Hospital.

479
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,000
Today, he's in the hospital.

480
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,000
But I'm in the middle of something.

481
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,920
I can't make it there.

482
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,640
How about you go talk to him

483
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,200
for our future cooperation?

484
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,400
OK. You take care of your business

485
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,510
and I'll go talk to Director Li.

486
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,790
OK. Bye-bye.

487
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,110
Bye-bye.

488
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,520
Su Zhizhou.

489
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,830
- Yes, Xing.
- A great mission for you.

490
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,000
What great mission?

491
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,350
As the partner of Xingchen

492
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,680
and the founding member,

493
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,480
this afternoon, you'll go brief Mr. Han

494
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,270
on behalf of our company.

495
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,750
Don't be kidding. Me?

496
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,640
Xing, please spare me.

497
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,270
Every time I see Mr. Han, I'm scared.

498
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,590
Besides,

499
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,110
you used to brief Mr. Han.

500
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,350
If he asks about you,

501
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,640
what shall I say?

502
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,880
Tell him I'll be seeing Director Li

503
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,440
at Xinggang Hospital.

504
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,030
No, no.

505
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,320
If you say so,

506
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,200
he'll complain about my poor time management.

507
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,510
Tell him I'm sick.

508
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,720
Sick? What ails you?

509
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,440
Anything. Just make it up.

510
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,280
Whatever you like.

511
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,880
Bye-bye. Don't forget to go.

512
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,680
What ails her, then?

513
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,680
What would you like to drink?

514
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,590
I was out the whole afternoon

515
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,240
and I had too much coffee.

516
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,720
Just get to the point.

517
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,830
You're seeing me for Xing, right?

518
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,790
How's she doing lately?

519
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,920
In what way?

520
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,790
Her company

521
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,400
is in its critical period of development.

522
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,200
Committed to work,

523
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,110
she feels a whole lot better.

524
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,400
Please give it to her.

525
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,310
Where did you get the money?

526
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,400
Your father...

527
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,070
His problem is solved.

528
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,510
This is the year-end bonus I just received.

529
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,440
She's been working too hard.

530
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,270
Her company has just been on track.

531
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,790
I hope I can help a little.

532
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,790
Do you think she'll take the money?

533
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,240
You don't need to tell her

534
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
the money is from me.

535
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,200
Shao Yichen,

536
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,640
you're not going to be an unsung hero,
are you?

537
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,160
You know.

538
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,270
If the money is from an unknown guy,

539
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,680
Xing will not take it.

540
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,520
Shao Yichen,

541
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,680
I've been confused about something.

542
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,000
You loved each other so much.

543
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,640
Why did you break up?

544
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,680
Are you in love with someone else?

545
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,310
Even up to now,

546
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,510
I'm still loving her.

547
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,030
But we aren't right for each other.

548
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,070
You planned to buy a flat for marriage.

549
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,030
Then you realized the problem?

550
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,510
I used to think,

551
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,000
"As long as I love her more,

552
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,640
concede to her,

553
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,830
and change myself,

554
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,440
we will make a perfect couple."

555
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,640
But I realized I was wrong.

556
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,680
Xing wants a successful future.

557
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,400
But all I can give her

558
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,720
is the simplest life.

559
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,110
I don't want to be her burden.

560
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,000
Nor do I want to serve as her foil.

561
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,070
I'm not a great man.

562
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,920
I broke up with her for her good

563
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,200
and for my own good, too.

564
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,680
I should go.

565
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
Shao Yichen.

566
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,270
If she needs anything,

567
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,070
please let me know. Thank you.

Get her in.

00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,630
Come in.

Hi, Mr. Han.

573

I'm Su Zhizhou from Xingchen.

Within three months,

I'll see some progress.

587
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,240
Mr. Han,

588
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,240
three months...

589
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,000
But we're short of men.

590
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,840
What?

591
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,030
You want some men from me?

592
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,200
No, no.

593
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,240
Due to our terrible office,

594
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,720
we can hardly employ anyone.

595
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,030
What is the solution?

596
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,790
So, Miss Ji

597
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,270
has been busy with this.

598
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,920
Then she sent you to brief me, huh?

599
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,070
Xing is sick today.

600
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,910
What ails her?

601
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,040
She has a fever.

602
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,240
Even too sick to brief me?

603
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,070
The fever has caused

604
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,270
tonsil inflammation.

605
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,960
Due to the inflammation,

606
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,590
it's hard for her to speak.

607
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,720
In this case,

608
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,270
I'm here to brief you.

609
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,480
Where's she now?

610
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,000
Resting at home.

611
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,350
Or maybe she's seeing a doctor.

612
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,390
She...

613
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,520
Mr. Han,

614
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,720
she went to Xinggang Hospital

615
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,640
for Dr. Li Quan'an of purchasing.

616
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,430
Good.

617
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,440
You're honest.

618
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,240
You go back.

619
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,440

633
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,640
unless you're gravely ill,

634
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,160
I won't brief Mr. Han again!

635
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,680
What happened? Did he scold you?

636
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,030
He didn't need to.

637
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,350
When he kept silent,

638
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,310
he could crush me already.

639
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,830
Has he practiced being formidable?

640
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,590
Take it as an experience.

641
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,440
I'll buy you some food later.

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,830
You still remember that?

658
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,160
Of course.

659
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,830
Sadly, I'm sick.

660
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,200
I don't want to get you sick.

661
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,680

What a coincidence!

666
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,400
I've wanted to talk to you.

667
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,720
I asked your assistant several times,

668
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,110
but your schedules were full.

669
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,110
Are you available now?

670
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,830

00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,950
OK.

672

Come on.

00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,350
Wait here for me.

It supplements sugar

and gives you energy.

683
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,430
Give it to me.

684
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,720
Sweet, huh?

685
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,030
Yes.

686
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,110
Way too sweet.

687
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,120

Shall I invite you to dinner?

695

No, thanks. I have other plans.

696
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,320
OK. Maybe next time.

697
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,430
OK.

698
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,510
So sweet.

699
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,400
Sorry, Mr. Han.

700
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,630
I have things to do

701
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,630
and I won't walk you out.

702
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,230
I'll see you tonight.

703
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,390

708
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,190
I went to the toilet.

709
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,030
Can you still walk?

710
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,640
Yes.

711

I'll pick you up tonight for dinner.

Ms. Han, how about you sing a cappella

714
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,320
and I'll listen?

715
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,190
Sing a cappella?

716
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,230
What... What shall I sing?

717
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,190
Anything. Anything you're good at.

718
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,400
I often sing Liuyang River.

719

Shall I sing that?

720
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,280
OK.

725
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,680
Miss Xiaomeng, as I sang,

726
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,280
I couldn't breathe and I felt dizzy.

727
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,590
Ms. Han, here's the thing.

728
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,800
From what you just sang,

729
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,590
I can tell you have a good tone.

730
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,630
You just need

731
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,150
to adjust the way you make a sound.

732
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,480
The way I make a sound?

733
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,840
Sing with your breath.

734
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,800
Breath?

735
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,630
Right. It means you sing with your abdomen.

736
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
With my abdomen?

737
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,760
Like this.

738
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,360
Relax.

739
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,000
Now up here.

740
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,800
Still up.

741
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,000
OK. One more time.

742
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,640

743

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,840
Are you OK?

746
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,470
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

747
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,880
Miss Xiaomeng.

748
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,030
Have some water.

749
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,190
Thanks, Ms. Han.

750
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,070
You know each other?

751
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,710
Not really. We just met.

752
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,320
What is she doing here?

753
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,670
Be polite.

754
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,400
Let me explain.

755
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,630
I didn't inform you.

756
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,480
Next month, I'll take part

757
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,960
in the singing competition of our district.

758
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,000
This is my new music teacher

759
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,190
who will teach me to sing.

760
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,670
Miss Xiaomeng, let me introduce him.

761
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,480
This is my son, Lu Linjia.

762
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,670
He looks handsome,

763
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,960
but he's kind of nerdy.

764
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,280
It's OK, Ms. Han.

765
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,400
I understand.

766
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,070
I guess

767
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,880
Mr. Lu hasn't seen me
for such a long time

768
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,230
that he's way too happy.

769
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,840
That's why he behaves weirdly, huh?

770
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,440
Hi, Mr. Lu.

771
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,550
What are you doing? She's saying hi.

772
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,230
- How rude!
- Why do I have to say hi?

773
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,510
Shall I even give her a like?

774
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,400
What are you talking about?
This isn't live streaming.

775
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,070
Come on.

776
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,430
Hi there.

777
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,000
You go cut some fruit for us.

778
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,400
We're hungry after the practice.

779
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,030
Ms. Liu is here. Let her do it.

780
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,350
You...

781
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,280
Ms. Han,

782
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,230
where's your kitchen?

783
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,070
I'll go cut the fruit.

784
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,000
Don't bother.

785
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,710
How can I make a guest do that?

786
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,880
No need.

787
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,510
You just go.

788
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,400
Life is so hard for me.

789
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,480
Why is this happening?

790
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,800
My son is so useless.

791
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:48,880
Before he has a wife,

792
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,000
he doesn't care for his mother.

793
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,920
I can't order him about.

794
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,920
It's OK, Ms. Han.

795
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,800
I will go,

796
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,110
Your Majesty.

797
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,230
I'm going now.

798
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,240
Stop.

799
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,070
Two cups of Sterculia-seed, please.

800
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:06,870
OK.

801
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:07,950
Go ahead.

802
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,990
Miss Xiaomeng.

803
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,510
Actually, my son

804
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,840
cares about me.

805
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,920
Only a little, though.

806
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,960
It's so humorous of you, Ms. Han.

807
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,590
Have some water.

808
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,190
Later, you enjoy some fruit.

809
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,000
Then seize the time

810
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,030
to give me more guidance.

811
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,030
I feel so good now.

812
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:24,880
- You do?
- Yes.

813
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,720
Really?

814
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,160
Mom!

815
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,800
Are you making some soup?

816
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,110
There's a burnt smell.

817
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,840
I am?

818
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,000
- I forgot.
- Go check it.

819
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,030
I'm going to check it.

820
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,110
I'll turn off the stove.

821
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,400
What do you mean?

822
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,150
Can't you see

823
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,630
I want to talk to you alone?

824
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,280
If I hadn't, I wouldn't be here.

825
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,600
What for?

826
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,400
Later,

827
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,280
do me a favor.

828
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,630
Ask Tu Xiaomeng to add me

829
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,470
on WeChat.

830
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,630
That's it?

831
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,630
No, no, no.

832
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,280
Don't get it wrong.
It's not that I like her.

833
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,400
I just want to discuss something.

834
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,760
Son, Mom used to be young.

835
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,920
I totally understand.

836
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,920
Just don't get it wrong.

837
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,360
I'll get you what you want.

838
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,440
I really don't like her.

839
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,070
Say no more.

840
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,990
Oh,

841
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,590
my poor memory.

842
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,110
Miss Xiaomeng, goodbye.

843
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,510
Bye-bye, Ms. Han.

844
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,590
Oh, Miss Xiaomeng.

845
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,800
You don't have
my son's WeChat account, huh?

846
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,960
How about you add each other?

847
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,150
When you need something,

848
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,480
you can ask him for help.

849
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,800
No, Ms. Han. No need.

850
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,630
Come on, just add him.

851
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,550
Linjia!

852
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,280
OK.

853
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,630
Come on.

854
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,000
- Then...
- Please scan.

855
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,840
OK.

856
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,510
Done.

857
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,710
Thank you, Ms. Han.

858
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,840
You're welcome. The request is accepted.

859
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,110
Oh, Miss Xiaomeng.

860
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,760
Next time you do live streaming,

861
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,670
please let me know.

862
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,510
I'll watch it

863
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,440
and support you.

864
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,320
- OK.
- I'll help you beat Poison Apple

865
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,160
and that man... Me...

866
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,630
Miss Xiaomeng, am I

867
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,510
doing it right?

868
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,590
Yes, yes.

869
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,510
Come on, Mom.

870
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,030
She's leaving.

871
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,880
Oh, sorry.

872
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,440
- Sorry to keep you long.
- It's OK.

873
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,480
Oh, Ms. Han.

874
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,230
That man's name is Mr. Lu.

875
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,000
Mr. Lu?

876
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,280
Be careful on your way!

877
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,350
I will.

878
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,230
Whatever I promise you,

879
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,800
have I ever failed?

880
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,190
No. Thank you, Your Majesty.
