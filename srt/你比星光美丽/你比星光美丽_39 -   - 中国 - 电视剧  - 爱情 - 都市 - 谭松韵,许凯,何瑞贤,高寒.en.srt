=Episode 39=

23
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,310
When the volunteer

24
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,560
of Xingchen

25
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,510
had a problem,

26
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,120
the public opinion was exactly the same.

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,710
Later, Xingchen turned it all around.

28
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,200
But some people have been slandering me.

29
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,430
When I watched Xing's press conference,

30
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,150
a great idea struck out of nowhere.

31
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,950
I can interview some volunteers

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,680
who used the products of Hanhai Xingchen.

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,310
So, Li helped me contact

34
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,400
their PR Department.

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
They recommended to me

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,480
some volunteers.

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,070
These are

38
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,120
their contacts.

39
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,590
I plan to interview them in live streaming

40
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,500
(Lin Meiling, Song Lili, Zhang Fengmei)
and make some videos.

41
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,840
I'll use practical examples

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,240
to gag those trolls.

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,000
But now,

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,190
I'll preview my live streaming.

45
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,840
Could you please

46
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,520
help me contact them one by one

47
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,470
and make an appointment?

48
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,960
So, you want me to help you.

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,710
Or what?

50
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,710
Lu Linjia.

51
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,520
What are you thinking?

52
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,750
My bad.

53
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,000
You suddenly took off your coat

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,850
and got into your bedroom.

55
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,710
You even said, "It'll be too late at night."

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't.

57
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,520
Let's hurry with the preview.

58
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,590
Get back on the horse that bucked you.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,910
Xiaomeng, you're the best.

60
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,750
I'll contact them. I will.

61
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,630
18808...

62
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,240
Hello, you...

63
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,800
I'll let you work.

64
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,750
Maybe another day.

65
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,030
Dongyang Medical's goal

66
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,030
is to give top priority

67
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,240
to every patient's interests.

68
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,750
When it comes to health,

69
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,030
we can't be too cautious.

70
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,400
When all our products are taken back,

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
I'll have a third-party institution...

72
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,590
Stop watching.

73
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,840
You don't have to watch it.

74
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,910
Getting shy?

75
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,400
Is there a problem with our product?

76
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,590
I'm mighty afraid you will fall

77
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,960
head over heels for me.

78
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,470
Oh, too bad.

79
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm already head over heels for you.

80
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,590
Miss Ji, you're more awesome.

81
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,590
I really admire you.

82
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,520
Likewise.

83
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,520
Who do you think is behind this?

84
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,030
If we harm someone's interests,

85
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,150
he'll be behind this.

86
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,360
Oh.

87
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,470
The publisher of the video

88
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,590
contacted us today.

89
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,120
He said he would apologize and buy us off.

90
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,120
He wanted to attract attention

91
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,120
but didn't expect to bring all that heat.

92
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,150
What do you think?

93
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,120
Who would offend Dongyang Group

94
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,520
just to grab attention?

95
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,150
Someone must be behind him.

96
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,750
It's just hard

97
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,840
to get this guy out.

98
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,710
They must be complicit.

99
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,160
Looks like you've got a solution.

100
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,120
Under such circumstances,

101
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll make him apologize in public.

102
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,000
Public opinion will condemn him.

103
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,920
It's also a positive publicity

104
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,430
for Dongyang Medical.

105
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,040
Miss Ji, sounds like

106
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,920
you've got a perfect solution.

107
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,000
Then I can take a vacation without worry.

108
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,160
You just recuperate.

109
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
I'll handle this problem perfectly.

110
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,000
Here.

111
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,270
Fine, you have it.

112
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,240
You eat it, too.

113
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,160
Sorry to barge in.

114
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,310
- Grandpa.
- Chairman.

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,120
How's your recovery?

116
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,350
Good.

117
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,190
OK. Seize your time

118
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,720
and recover soon.

119
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,200
Ji Xing,

120
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,160
thank you for your hard work.

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,840
It's my job.

122
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,630
I watched the press conference.

123
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,750
You handled the emergency very well.

124
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,750
It's all his fault.

125
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,760
That's right.

126
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,590
Chairman,

127
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,310
Han Ting and I are a couple.

128
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,390
Nothing is all his fault.

129
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,560
Since you care about her,

130
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,510
you should be more careful in behaviors.

131
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,360
Think twice before you do anything.

132
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,760
I will.

133
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,120
Oh.

134
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,310
Last time I wrote down

135
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,630
your names.

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I've had it mounted.

137
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,950
Go fetch it when you have time.

138
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,830
Take it as my present

139
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,950
for the two of you.

140
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
Thanks, Chairman.

141
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,950
Are you so used to calling me Chairman?

142
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,950
Thanks, Grandpa.

143
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,510
All right. I have to go.

144
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,430
Go on with your orange. Go on.

145
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,870
Goodbye, Grandpa.

146
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,030
Goodbye.

147
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,920
See you.

148
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,230
OK.

149
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,080
- What's wrong?
- Eat the orange.

150
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,390
- Come on.
- The orange.

151
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,080
Do you want more?

152
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,400
Grandpa.

153
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,600
Yuan,

154
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,310
whatever you're here for,

155
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,560
you've come, anyway.

156
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,160
It means

157
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,240
you aren't totally muddle-headed.

158
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,390
What did he say to you?

159
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,510
In front of me,

160
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,240
Ting has never complained about you.

161
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,430
But what did you do?

162
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,390
You really think I'm such a dotard

163
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,120
that I don't know what you did?

164
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,870
If Ting

165
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,560
really played a trick on you,

166
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
I'm afraid

167
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,720
you wouldn't make it through.

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,840
Grandpa.

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,840
I'm sorry.

170
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,600
Yuan,

171
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,590
you should

172
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,750
apologize to him.

173
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,190
You're cousins.

174
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,240
Blood is thicker than water.

175
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,380
(Dongyang Group)

176
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,360
Ms. Yuan, Miss Ji from Hanhai Xingchen
is here to see you.

177
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,160
Hi, Ms. Yuan.

178
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,440
Sorry to barge in.

179
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,440
Come in, please.

180
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,840
Aren't you taking care

181
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,910
of Han Ting in the hospital?

182
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,150
What are you doing here?

183
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,360
I'm here to thank you.

184
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,360
Thank me?

185
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,080
The other day, I saw you

186
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,960
visit Han Ting in the hospital.

187
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,790
I know you've been caring for him.

188
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,510
And recently,

189
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,910
no word about Han Ting's injury

190
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,390
has gone out.

191
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,230
I believe

192
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,120
you're helping to keep it quiet.

193
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,360
Don't bother to thank me.

194
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,080
I do all these things

195
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,030
just to stop Grandpa from worrying.

196
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,670
What on earth are you here for?

197
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,240
At tomorrow's board meeting,

198
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,200
we want you

199
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,440
to help us

200
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,200
persuade those directors

201
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,240
to approve the proposal for the AI talent pool.

202
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,200
Am I hearing this right?

203
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,000
Why do you think I'll help you?

204
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,750
If the AI talent pool succeeds,

205
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,510
Dongyang Medical won't be the only profiteer.

206
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,120
Dongyang Technology also needs

207
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,550
excellent AI talents

208
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,390
and resources.

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,120
When the whole group makes a profit,

210
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,000
it's not only the honor of the group

211
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,440
but also the achievement of you,
the vice chairwoman.

212
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,510
When Han Ting was in Germany for ten years,

213
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,790
you were taking care of Dongyang.

214
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,550
Over all these years,

215
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,960
under your leadership,

216
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,720
Dongyang has developed stably

217
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,840
and perfectly.

218
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,360
You must have made a great effort.

219
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,440
Han Ting suddenly came back to China

220
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,120
and served as the CEO of Dongyang Medical.

221
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,040
Whoever is in your shoes

222
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,390
could hardly accept it.

223
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,870
You're more honey-tongued than him.

224
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,150
Han Ting doesn't say anything.

225
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,790
But he knows

226
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,200
what you've done for Dongyang.

227
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,600
Take your seat.

228
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,200
Thanks.

229
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,840
I have to admit.

230
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,120
The prosper of the AI talent pool

231
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,000
is really good.

232
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,840
But the cost is obvious.

233
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,240
It's hard to move forward.

234
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,910
Han Ting and I

235
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,910
are prepared for anything.

236
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,150
With the approval of the directors,

237
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,320
the project will

238
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,390
go very smoothly.

239
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,030
Besides, if this project fails,

240
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,600
it'll prove Han Ting and I aren't good enough.

241
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,600
By then, you deserve to take back

242
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,750
Dongyang Medical.

243
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
Thank you

244
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,320
for thinking about me.

245
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,800
Ms. Yuan,

246
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,000
voting in favor of it

247
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,840
will be all upside for you.

248
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,390
In public or in private,

249
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,000
you should support it

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,030
without concern.

251
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,000
Considering your generosity and thinking,

252
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,120
I believe you'll make a favorable decision.

253
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,780
(Xinggang Hospital)

254
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,790
Patient of Bed No.12

255
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,110
(Keep Quiet)
needs medical observation.

256
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,000
OK, Dr. Shao.

257
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,230
Ji Xing.

258
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,350
Yichen.

259
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,720
Mr. Han is checking out today, huh?

260
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,040
Yes.

261
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,030
Any problem?

262
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,080
Don't be nervous.

263
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,240
He's recovering very well.

264
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:53,990
When he's back home,

265
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,440
he has to rest more in bed.

266
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,120
He can occasionally get out of bed

267
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,750
and do some proper functional exercise

268
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,240
to prevent blood clot

269
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,550
and some complications.

270
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,800
For the incision,

271
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,320
change the dressing every two or three days.

272
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,840
Come to remove those stitches in a week.

273
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,120
In a month,

274
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,960
he'll be able to move around.

275
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,040
Remember.

276
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,510
If he has to go out,

277
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,320
he must take a wheelchair.

278
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,750
Got it. Thank you.

279
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,510
Thanks for all these days.

280
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,510
No thanks necessary.

281
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,960
Seeing you go through a lot with him,

282
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,120
I think he may be perfect for you.

283
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,750
Xing,

284
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,230
congratulations.

285
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,280
Thanks.

286
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,480
Oh, I want to ask you

287
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,000
about something else.

288
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,320
This is crazy.

289
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,910
I asked Shao Yichen.

290
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,790
He said you couldn't move too much.

291
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,670
If you attend tomorrow's board meeting,

292
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,750
you'll have to wear the customized brace.

293
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,200
Even in this case,

294
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,320
you can't stand for more than one hour.

295
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,320
It's thoughtful of you, Miss Ji.

296
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,240
Leave the brace thing to me.

297
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,270
But promise me.

298
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,270
Tomorrow, you must be very careful.

299
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,510
Whatever you say, Miss Ji.

300
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,360
What? Want to kiss me?

301
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,030
You can't do that

302
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,030
before you recover.

303
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,750
Who said I couldn't kiss you?

304
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,440
- Come.
- You come.

305
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,720
- Come.
- Move by yourself.

306
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,560
Come on.

307
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,270
Move. Good. You move smoothly.

308
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,110
Here I am.

309
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,550
What? Do you feel better?

310
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,790
Much better.

311
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,750
Don't worry.

312
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,750
Tang Song, drive more slowly.

313
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,920
OK, Miss Ji.

314
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,390
When we go back to our own company,

315
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,550
we have to move on the sly

316
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,600
as if we were thieves.

317
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,480
This is really

318
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,000
a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

319
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,750
Quite enough.

320
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,150
Don't make it happen again.

321
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,260
(3D Print Room)

322
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,790
I'll go set up the printer.

323
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,790
You take off your coat.

324
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,510
Why do you not move?

325
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,790
I'm a patient.

326
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,960
So?

327
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,630
You have to help me.

328
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,200
Mr. Han, you have to practice more

329
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,270
before you recover soon.

330
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,840
I can't do it. Help me.

331
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,200
Beg me, then.

332
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,360
I beg you, Miss Ji.

333
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,510
If you don't help me,

334
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,480
I won't do the scanning.

335
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,390
Come on.

336
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,270
The scanning should be done.

337
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,390
Come on. I'll help you.

338
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,670
Reach out.

339
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,270
Be careful.

340
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,000
Careful.

341
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,680
Watch out.

342
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,440
Careful.

343
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,910
Don't move.

344
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,750
Be gentle.

345
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,270
What? I'm gentle enough.

346
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,840
Miss Ji.

347
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,870
Fine, fine.

348
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,200
Arms up a little bit.

349
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,360
Why do you act like a kid?

350
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,160
What's wrong?

351
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,910
I'm still worried.

352
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,960
With the fixed brace you made me,

353
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,720
I'll be fine.

354
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,550
Even with it,

355
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,750
you can't sit for a long time.

356
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,830
If the situation is too tense tomorrow

357
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,550
and the meeting takes a long time,

358
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,960
what if you're physically overwhelmed?

359
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,550
Don't think that much.

360
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,830
Now, you should conserve strength

361
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,550
and face the directors

362
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,880
in tip-top shape.

363
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,040
Got it?

364
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,320
Get to sleep.

365
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,440
I've prepared all emergency plans.

366
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,160
I'm no longer nervous.

367
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,960
You should relax, too.

368
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,880
I'll be there for you through this whole thing.

369
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,480
Thank you.

370
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,160
This isn't what I need.

371
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,350
Before you get over this day,

372
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,720
don't bother to thank me.

373
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,160
Well, for today's board meeting,

374
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,790
will you give me a victory kiss?

375
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:35,380
(Dongyang Group)

376
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,190
Everybody,

377
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,790
let me introduce her.

378
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,310
This is Ji Xing,
vice president of Hanhai Xingchen.

379
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,510
She's in charge of the AI talent pool

380
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,590
we're aggressively promoting.

381
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,550
Hi, directors.

382
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,670
Take your seat.

383
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,800
Mr. Zhou,

384
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,000
I'll make my point first.

385
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,550
Now, we want to invest
hundreds of millions every year

386
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,240
just to start a social university.

387
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,110
And after graduation,

388
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,750
the students may not work for us.

389
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,080
Mr. Han,

390
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,790
you're not doing business.

391
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,200
Instead, you're doing charity

392
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,720
with the interests of shareholders.

393
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,960
What you worry about
is what Mr. Han focuses on.

394
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,830
Can the AI talent pool

395
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,000
become the new profit point

396
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,350
for Dongyang?

397
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,510
The answer is yes.

398
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Here's a recent example.

399
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,030
Lately, Hanhai Xingchen

400
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,550
has had a crisis of raw materials.

401
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,590
Luckily, Mr. Qin Li,

402
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,750
consultant of the AI talent pool,

403
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,640
promoted our cooperation
with German Juhuang Material.

404
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,960
He not only got us through the situation,

405
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,480
but also assisted

406
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,550
in getting a stable supply of raw materials.

407
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,160
Now in China, AI

408
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,590
has been developing fast.

409
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,680
But technologies with great potential

410
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,200
are still based in the lab.

411
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,720
Who can accelerate

412
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,960
the technological breakthroughs
and industrial applications

413
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,110
will be the biggest winner

414
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,310
of AI, the big pie.

415
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,240
Directors, I don't think

416
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,240
you want to give up on it, huh?

417
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,160
I agree with Mr. Han

418
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,310
and Miss Ji.

419
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,960
In the world of technology,

420
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,400
our top priority is to seize
the opportunity for development.

421
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,590
Or we'll be uncompetitive.

422
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,040
Ms. He,

423
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,440
you should know

424
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,880
the AI talent pool

425
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,510
is a brand new and costly project.

426
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,640
It requires a huge upfront investment.

427
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,200
The profit period is long, too.

428
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,960
But its actual subsequent profit

429
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,920
remains uncertain.

430
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,920
Miss Ji, like you just said,

431
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,510
many technologies are still based in the lab.

432
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,790
Why are you so sure

433
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,000
that it will be

434
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,310
a grand bargain?

435
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,510
That's right.

436
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,720
We can't only focus on the present.

437
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,400
Mr. Zhou has a point.

438
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,680
Directors.

439
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,920
As long as you approve,

440
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
we will put half-year earnings

441
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,550
of Hanhai Xingchen

442
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,070
into the construction

443
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,000
of the AI talent pool.

444
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,510
When the AI talent pool

445
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,510
is successfully built,

446
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,310
our profit will be doubled.

447
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,790
Hanhai Xingchen has just been established.

448
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,350
How many earnings can there be?

449
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,030
When you really start

450
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,510
to build the AI talent pool

451
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,110
and run out of money,

452
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,920
you will need our subsidy.

453
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,590
Hanhai Xingchen has only
been established for six months.

454
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,310
We've done a calculation.

455
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,400
Our pure profit is sixty million.

456
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,000
If this profit

457
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,110
can satisfy you,

458
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,000
you should trust Miss Ji's ability.

459
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,510
Here is my attitude.

460
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,640
I fully support it.

461
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,550
Thank you, Mr. Han, for your support.

462
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,480
We predict the profit of Hanhai Xingchen

463
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,400
for the second half.

464
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,350
Excluding force majeure,

465
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,750
the profit is estimated to double.

466
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,790
I believe the growth target for the next year

467
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,030
can also be achieved.

468
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,720
So, don't worry.

469
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,680
It'll cover the upfront investment

470
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,960
in the talent pool.

471
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,110
Mr. Han has a long-term vision.

472
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,920
Mr. Zhou and Mr. Yang

473
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,200
don't want to hurt our interests.

474
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,000
That is reasonable.

475
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,720
Right. After all, Hanhai's profit

476
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,790
is a share of the profit of Dongyang Medical.

477
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,800
All in all,

478
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,350
the construction of the AI talent pool

479
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,750
will cost the money of Dongyang Medical.

480
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,550
So, about this year's performance target,

481
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,480
Mr. Han,

482
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,480
will you

483
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,030
make another pledge?

484
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,550
Mr. Yang, my cousin

485
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,550
is ruthless and revengeful.

486
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,110
When I joked like this last time,

487
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,350
I lost all my shares in Dongyang Medical.

488
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,000
You joke again.

489
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,830
What if he kicks you out of the board?

490
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,240
Don't be kidding, Ms. Yuan.

491
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,680
Just now, Mr. Yang

492
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,720
was joking.

493
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,790
Since Mr. Han is so persistent,

494
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,160
I think we'll wait and see the final result.

495
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,310
Now, let's vote.

496
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,110
Put your hand up if you agree.

497
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,440
Thank you for your support.

498
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,920
Dongyang Medical's AI talent pool

499
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,030
will not let you down.

500
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,440
What is your problem?

501
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,640
How could you support Han Ting
at the board meeting?

502
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,720
That was a statement of fact.

503
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,030
What are you talking about?

504
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,920
Dongyang Medical is the core of Dongyang Group.

505
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,830
Dongyang Technology can't
stabilize your position.

506
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,510
If you don't take back Dongyang Medical,

507
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,750
the future resources of the group

508
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,240
will all lean towards Dongyang Medical.

509
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,200
No one will remember

510
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,270
that you defended him.

511
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,920
I've made up my mind.

512
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,110
To develop Dongyang Technology,

513
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,500
I don't have to trample on Dongyang Medical.

514
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,510
Han Ting has an ambitious layout.

515
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,680
Stopping him

516
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,200
will not do good to Dongyang.

517
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,830
If Han Ting

518
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,510
succeeds in his future plans...

519
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,040
Mr. Zhou,

520
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,590
just wait to get your dividends.

521
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,440
- Ms. Yuan.
- Mr. Zhou.

522
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,310
Since you disapprove

523
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,400
of Han Ting's plan,

524
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,720
don't interfere

525
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,920
with Dongyang Medical anymore.

526
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,510
You're old enough to retire, anyway.

527
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,040
You win.

528
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,240
Tang Song, tell the company

529
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,680
Mr. Han will have a two-week business trip.

530
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,200
Let no one know about his condition.

531
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,670
OK, Miss Ji.

532
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,030
I should go.

533
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,830
Call me if you need anything.

534
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,080
It hurts, huh?

535
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,720
Get some rest.

536
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,560
I'll go make lunch.

537
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,280
Stay with me.

538
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,000
Fine.

539
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,390
Li.

540
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,960
The peach blossom tea is cold.

541
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,350
Your stomach isn't good.

542
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,910
Don't drink too much.

543
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,200
There is something...

544
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,670
After I thought about it,

545
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,030
I decided to tell you.

546
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,240
I reapplied for the job in Germany.

547
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,590
Mr. Luo approved.

548
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,200
This is good.

549
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,350
Congratulations.

550
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,830
When you're in Germany,

551
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,160
take good care of yourself

552
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,920
and learn carefully.

553
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,800
Come on.

554
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,240
Mr. Su.

555
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,590
Hi, Miss Li.

556
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,920
Congratulations, Mr. Su.

557
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Have a good trip.

558
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,960
Thank you.

559
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,920
You guys talk. I should go.

560
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,720
Come on, Mr. Su.

561
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,590
When you're in Germany,

562
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,000
we'll miss you.

563
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,750
You're well-informed.

564
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,350
Shang told me about it.

565
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,350
I'll get back to work.

566
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,580
(To Mr. Su: Fight for brightness!
Come on! By Zhong Yini)

567
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,640
(The peach blossom tea is cold.)

568
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,150
(Your stomach isn't good.)

569
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,480
(Don't drink too much.)

570
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,760
Mr. Su.

571
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,240
Congratulations.

572
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
Have a good trip.

573
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,800
Thank you.

574
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,200
(Strategic Cooperation)
You supported us at the board meeting.

575
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,790
I'm here to thank you.

576
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,640
You're quite resolute.

577
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,110
My cousin has good judgment of talents.

578
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,310
Does he know you'll cooperate with us?

579
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,920
He has higher expectations

580
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
for Dongyang Technology.

581
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,000
Dongyang Technology has a mature

582
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,960
AI Internet technology.

583
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,960
Our 3D medical printing

584
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,590
can assist it

585
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
in developing AI medical interconnection.

586
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,550
The two companies

587
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,240
will have a win-win cooperation.

588
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,790
Set up a time for next week.

589
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,920
Have our technical departments

590
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,400
discuss the cooperation details.

591
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,040
OK.

592
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,950
Ms. Yuan,

593
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,040
we'll work well together.

594
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,760
We will.

595
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,000
Ji Xing,

596
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,720
we'll be a family.

597
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,880
Stop calling me Ms. Yuan.

598
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,000
Just call me Yuan.

599
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,830
OK, Yuan.

600
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,840
Come in.

601
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,190
Miss Li,

602
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,350
I have something

603
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,110
to tell you.

604
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,840
What is it?

605
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,510
It's a long story.

606
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,110
If you're available,

607
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,350
can we have dinner after work

608
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,750
and talk about it?

609
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,630
No problem.

610
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,160
I'll get back to work, then.

611
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,510
Why are you working again?

612
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,550
You've just got a little bit better.

613
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,350
Don't be complacent.

614
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,030
Besides this,

615
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,510
what else will you tell me?

616
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,110
I missed you today.

617
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,240
I know. Anything else?

618
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,640
I visited Yuan.

619
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,030
We offered cooperation.

620
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,110
You visited her more than once, huh?

621
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,920
I met her before the board meeting, too.

622
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,510
She cares about your health.

623
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,640
She cares for your opinions, too.

624
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,830
Today, she even asked me

625
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,880
whether it was you

626
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,160
who proposed the cooperation.

627
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,790
What did you say?

628
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,000
"Mr. Han has higher expectations

629
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
for Dongyang Technology."

630
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,110
Miss Ji, now you do better

631
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,550
in lying to people.

632
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,400
Isn't that what you think?

633
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,240
It is.

634
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,750
I just didn't expect you to visit her.

635
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,510
Now, everybody wants

636
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,350
to watch the two of you fight.

637
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,110
They want to know who will

638
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,920
take charge of Dongyang in the future.

639
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,030
But I know this isn't

640
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,160
what you want to see.

641
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,200
Yuan checked on you in the hospital.

642
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,640
I know.

643
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,310
She's my cousin, after all.

644
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,350
Blood is thicker than water.

645
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,590
Miss Li, why do you not eat?

646
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,720
Zhong.

647
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,240
Are you having any problems at work?

648
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,320
Miss Li,

649
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,350
I gave Mr. Su a bouquet today

650
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,550
to give him my blessing

651
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,640
as a friend.

652
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,160
So, this is

653
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,200
what you want to tell me?

654
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,390
Yes.

655
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,110
Zhong,

656
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,000
you don't need to explain this.

657
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,720
Mr. Su and I are just friends.

658
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,390
Miss Li,

659
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,640
the outsider sees most of the game.

660
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,310
Maybe you can't feel this.

661
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,920
But as far as I see,

662
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,790
it's not that you have

663
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,240
no feelings for Mr. Su.

664
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,110
He's going abroad soon.

665
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,000
He and I won't be together.

666
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,320
But you don't want to lose him, do you?

667
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,510
He loves you.

668
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,360
As long as you ask,

669
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,280
he will stay for you.

670
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,440
Miss Li, don't get me wrong.

671
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,840
I don't mean

672
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,070
to interfere with your private life.

673
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,510
I just feel sorry for Mr. Su.

674
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,190
He's a nice guy.

675
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,840
I adored him.

676
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,670
He rejected me

677
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,590
without hesitation.

678
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,800
But...

679
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,920
I still want him to be happy.

680
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,440
In the world of adults,

681
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,000
not every relationship

682
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,960
can end up well.

683
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,400
I once started

684
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,920
a relationship casually.

685
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,630
But I was hurt all over.

686
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,070
For now, I don't want to repeat the mistake.

687
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,190
And Mr. Su has a great future.

688
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,710
After he sees a bigger world,

689
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,280
he will not stick

690
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,400
to this love.

691
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,280
Miss Li,

692
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,840
with all due respect,

693
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,590
you're kind of pessimistic.

694
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,190
What if the passing of time

695
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,000
will not wear down Mr. Su's love?

696
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,590
Instead, it may make him

697
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,880
see his heart more clearly.

698
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,960
So, will you

699
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,400
give him a second chance?

700
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,760
He's different from those guys

701
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,800
you used to meet.

702
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,480
Working abroad for three years

703
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,280
will take his career

704
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,360
to the next level.

705
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,630
I can't selfishly

706
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,000
make him give up his future.

707
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:40,910
So, Miss Li,

708
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,600
you like Mr. Su, right?

709
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,910
Just eat.

710
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,120
OK.

711
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,030
Come on.

712
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,280
Who would trim like this?

713
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,320
You'll make it bald.

714
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,000
Look, its style is ruined.

715
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,120
Leave it alone.

716
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,440
Go ahead.

717
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,460
(Thank you.)

718
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,000
This isn't your style.

719
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,190
So polite.

720
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,150
Take a good rest.

721
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,360
Whose message?

722
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,550
It makes you so happy.

723
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,470
Grandpa.

724
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,360
Ting said "Thank you".

725
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,800
Don't move.

726
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,000
Just don't move.

727
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,000
Just the shave thing.

728
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,280
Don't be nervous.

729
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,350
Let me kiss you.

730
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,440
Don't move. I'm holding a blade.

731
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,590
You kiss me, then.

732
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,070
You don't move.

733
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,110
Fine. Just freeze.

734
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,630
I don't want to leave a cut

735
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,630

00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,590
I'm thirsty.

760
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,550
I suddenly want some milk.

761
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,640
Come back.

762
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,960
Stop it. I beg you.

763
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,000
I really can't stand it.

764
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,840
I really can't.

765
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:13,630
I've been having
pork rib soup for over one month.

766
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,550
My stomach smells just like it.

767
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,000
I've been making different kinds of soup.

768
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,710
Pork rib soup with lotus root,

769
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,030

770
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,280
with kelp,

771
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,150
and with corn.

772
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,030
Actually, I've recovered.

773
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,360
I'm quite vigorous now.

774
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,700
Look.

775
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,030
Be careful.

776
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,510
We can try something else.

777
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,960
We don't need to have soup.

778
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,880
Actually, I'm tired of it, too.

779
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,000

780

Don't waste it.

781
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,070
I've got an idea.

782
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,590
First, we each get a bowl of soup.

783
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,190
Excluding the weight of the bowl,

784
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,440

785
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,760
closer to 100 grams will win.

787

840
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,670
Why have you been drinking coffee

841
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,030
instead of tea?

842
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,550
Because you love coffee.

843
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,630
I did a little research.

844
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,840
You didn't taste any last time you came.

845
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,400
Now, you should taste it, huh?

00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,000
How does it taste?

847
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,630
You don't make coffee

848
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,190

00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,360

854
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,840
