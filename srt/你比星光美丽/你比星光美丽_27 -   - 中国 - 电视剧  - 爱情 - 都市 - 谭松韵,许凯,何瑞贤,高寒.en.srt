=Episode 27=

23
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,680
Come on. He hasn't texted me

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,070
or called me at all.

25
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,200
How could he do so?

26
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,710
Doesn't he know I'm angry?

27
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,710
When you have a girlfriend,

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,000
you must not behave like this.

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,560
Or she will be sad

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,790
and upset.

31
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,400
Got it?

32
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,840
Tu Xiaomeng, you silly girl!

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,920
Did you forget your keys again?

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,840
What are you doing here? I'm busy.

35
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,310
I'm looking stuff up.

36
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,710
So busy? I'll leave, then.

37
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,870
Pretty.

38
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,640
Childish.

39
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,400
Not as childish as you.

40
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,470
What are you doing here?

41
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,120
To pamper my angry girlfriend.

42
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,240
Who's angry?

43
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,870
Come on.

44
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,080
We have miscommunications.

45
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,470
So, when will you stop

46
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,840
refusing to communicate?

47
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,430
Who refuses to communicate?

48
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,680
Yesterday, who went right away

49
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,520
before I explained?

50
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,280
You even left me alone in the rain.

51
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,030
I was just angry.

52
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,800
Being angry hurts our feelings.

53
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,400
If you're dissatisfied,

54
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,800
just tell me.

55
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,680
Anything?

56
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,470
Of course.

57
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,190
I scolded you all night yesterday.

58
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,310
How did I annoy you?

59
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,240
We're in a relationship, aren't we?

60
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,240
You know Zeng Di has feelings for you,

61
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,590
but you still dined with her.

62
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,430
It was just for business.

63
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,360
What business?

64
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,240
To draw the line.

65
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,400
I plan to give her back

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,240
all my shares of Guanghua.

67
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,710
Actually, I didn't mean

68
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,070
to lose my temper.

69
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,950
These days, I held myself

70
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,040
from going to see you.

71
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,750
But the moment I saw you,

72
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,190
you were staying with her.

73
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,870
I was just not comfortable with it.

74
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,510
When you weren't contacting me,

75
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,920
I felt bad, too.

76
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,430
And when I saw you,

77
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,240
you were also with Shao Yichen.

78
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,080
I...

79
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,800
I wanted you to reach out to me.

80
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,430
I was handling Zhang Fengmei's case.

81
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,920
You could have spared some time

82
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,830
and texted me.

83
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,120
But I...

84
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,000
I could have reached out to you.

85
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,310
I shouldn't have always waited.

86
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,390
I was wrong, too.

87
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,670
But...

88
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,830
We're both busy working in the day.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,870
In the night, I don't know

90
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,920
when you get off work, how I can reach you,

91
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,240
or whether you have a dinner.

92
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,270
If...

93
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,190
Give me your phone.

94
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,640
Give me it.

95
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,070
I may not be able
to contact you every few hours.

96
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,040
But anywhere or any time,

97
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
when you want it,

98
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,680
you'll know where I am.

99
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,390
Then you don't need to guess.

100
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,380
(Ji Xing, Han Ting is six meters away.)

101
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,440
Have you calmed down?

102
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,350
Tu Xiaomeng.

103
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,630
She's gone out to give a class.

104
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,310
She won't be back too early.

105
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,870
Why did you bring me here?

106
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,040
To relax.

107
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,000
Look at sea

108
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,430
and think of nothing.

109
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,430
Relax your mind.

110
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,800
There's an old saying.

111
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,600
When one thinks of nothing,

112
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,270
his brain is the most active.

113
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,830
Don't you know?

114
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,040
There's another saying.

115
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,870
Listening to the ocean

116
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,630
will calm you down.

117
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,030
Actually,

118
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,440
since I experienced this,

119
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,720
I've been a little bit confused.

120
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,680
Among my classmates,

121
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,830
some are teachers.

122
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,120
Some are singers.

123
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,710
But I...

124
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,390
I do everything,

125
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,920
but I do nothing very well.

126
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,120
I think it's a waste of youth.

127
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,430
Do you know how long the sea has existed?

128
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,830
For 4.6 billion years!

129
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,510
But how old are we?

130
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,480
I'm 23 and you're 22.

131
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,120
We humans are so little.

132
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,070
Not to mention youth,

133
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,270
even the whole life is trifling

134
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,680
in front of the sea.

135
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,640
Look at me.

136
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,720
I've figured this out.

137
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,480
That's why I never worry

138
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,720
about what you just said.

139
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,320
Let's just do

140
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,470
what we won't regret.

141
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,630
If we keep thinking

142
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,000
about we have lost

143
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,110
and what we can get,

144
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,600
it'll be a real waste of youth.

145
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,680
Very well. It makes sense.

146
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,190
I should look more at the sea.

147
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,830
However strong the waves are,

148
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,920
the sea is always what it is.

149
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,520
Whatever noises there are,

150
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,800
I can still do live streaming!

151
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,360
Come on!

152
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,960
What are you doing?

153
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,790
Guess what I've painted.

154
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,910
Scallion, pepper.

155
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,920
That's a potato.

156
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,280
You want stir-fried food, Lu Linjia?

157
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,790
What are you talking about?

158
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,840
Humph, I'll paint no more.

159
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,510
That's actually heart and lemon.

160
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,630
Lu Linjia!

161
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,840
Are you available later?

162
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,600
Yes. What for?

163
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,240
I have a previous CD.

164
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,360
It's a CD of Dashu,

165
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,320
my favorite singer.

166
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,270
I'll give it to you for your bar.

167
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,560
Are you interested?

168
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,790
Of course.

169
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,270
It's the first thing you'll give me.

170
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,910
Shall we go now?

171
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,230
Let's go.

172
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,230
Here we go.

173
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,280
You know what?

174
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,390
Your best friend's helmet

175
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,440
really suits me.

176
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,630
Of course.

177
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,200
This is the VIP helmet

178
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
I've prepared for Xing.

179
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,240
You ride too slowly. I'll ride.

180
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,670
How fast can you ride?

181
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,630
Get on.

182
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,510
OK.

183
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,110
Sit still.

184
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,630
Here we are.

185
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,230
Let's go.

186
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,480
You were riding so fast.

187
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,720
I didn't know you could ride so well.

188
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,840
I didn't exceed the speed limit.

189
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,790
I would rather walk than ride slowly.

190
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,630
That's boring.

191
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,710
Let's go.

192
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,080
Quite different from your live streaming.

193
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,440
You just don't know me.

194
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,080
Watch my live streaming more.

195
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,320
Don't forget I got you that job.

196
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,080
I paid for at least one wheel.

197
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,030
OK, OK.

198
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,960
(Yushan Bypass No.3)

199
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,840
We've arrived, at last.

200
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,670
Was that really horrible?

201
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,280
Mr. Han.

202
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,390
Ting, you...

203
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,870
Which dress shall I take?

204
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,510
Both.

205
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,030
Xing.

206
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,000
Let me introduce him.

207
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,240
This is Han Ting, my boyfriend.

208
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,390
What are you laughing at?

209
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,240
Ting, when did you become her boyfriend?

210
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,720
So, this is

211
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,200
an official introduction, huh?

212
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Indeed.

213
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,390
Why are you staring at us?

214
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,080
What's going on between you?

215
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,270
Yeah. What's your relationship?

216
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,790
We... We're just friends.

217
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,150
I brought Lu Linjia here

218
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,390
to listen to my previous CD.

219
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,910
Yeah, we shouldn't disturb

220
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,270
the bossy lady and her sweet boyfriend.

221
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,720
Xiaomeng, go get the CD

222
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,560
and we'll go to my home.

223
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,440
In a minute.

224
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,630
My... My mother is at home.

225
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,910
Here I am. Let's go.

226
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,080
Xing, we should go.

227
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,790
My nephew and niece-in-law,

228
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,720
let's have a family dinner another day.

229
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,840
Let's just go.

230
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,840
Bye-bye.

231
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,630
I'll go get changed.

232
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,920
Let's take Dahuang

233
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,960
for a family reunion.

234
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,350
Really?

235
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,550
So, my grandson

236
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,870
really has a girlfriend.

237
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,030
That's true.

238
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,720
The two of us witnessed that

239
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
with four eyes.

240
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,720
This is great.

241
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,910
I no longer need to worry

242
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,390
that Ting will die alone.

243
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,720
Indeed.

244
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,840
Such a rare thing.

245
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,910
Well, Ms. Han.

246
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,150
Xiaomeng and I will go up for the music.

247
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,440
Come on, don't do that.

248
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,710
Tell me more.

249
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,790
How did you get in?

250
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,440
How did you see Ting

251
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,790
and that girl?

252
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,960
Was Ting really dressed

253
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,750
in women's pajama pants?

254
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,440
Mom, you've heard a million times.

255
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,870
If you continue,

256
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,270
you'll be like a paparazzi.

257
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,080
Think more carefully about it.

258
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,910
Confirm if you missed anything.

259
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,040
Fine.

260
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,320
I'll say this one last time.

261
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,550
Xiaomeng and I went upstairs for the CD.

262
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,120
Xiaomeng opened the door.

263
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,670
Then I walked in.

264
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,790
I saw Ting standing there.

265
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,310

Xing,

00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,270
open the door for me.

275
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,350
Be right there.

276
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,670
What's the password?

277
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,080
951103.

278
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,550
My birthdate?

279
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,510
The hostess's birthdate.

280
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,560
What's strange about that?

281
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,440
Want to make me your hostess

282
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,550
with one single trick?

283
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,670
What else do you want?

284
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,200
The authority of the door.

285
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,750
If you mess with me someday,

286
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,150
I'll make you stand outside the door.

287
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,270

You planned

303
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,080
to get Dahuang here, huh?

304
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,230
Yes.

305
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,200
But I want more than Dahuang.

306
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,840
So spicy?

307
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,200
Taste it.

308
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,910
It's not spicy at all.

309
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,550
If you say so...

310
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,480
Oh, don't.

311
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,630
Don't add more chili.

312
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,200
You can't eat spicy food.

313
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,470
You love spicy food.

314
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,000
I should get used to your flavor.

315
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,750
It's OK.

316
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,960
I can eat non-spicy food.

317
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,720
I'll taste what you like.

318
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,630
Don't ruin

319
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,720
your taste buds.

320
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,880
Spiciness is a sense of pain

321
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:06,950
instead of taste.

322
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,160
Someone who is used to spicy food

323
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,920
can hardly take light meals.

324
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,830
Do you know why

325
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,960
spicy food gives people pain

326
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,160
and easily make them addicted?

327
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,150
Why?

328
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,070
Because a tiny pain

329
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,920
can activate the brain region

330
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,550
that controls emotions

331
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,550
so that people will have

332
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,880
a pleasant feeling.

333
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,790
Pain can bring a pleasant feeling?

334
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,110
They aren't mutually exclusive.

335
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,640
Spicy food

336
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,400
is usually cooked with high heat.

337
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,830
Or it won't be well cooked.

338
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,150
Spicy dishes

339
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,200
often remind me of you.

340
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,800
Remind you of me?

341
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,590
Do you mean I'm hot-tempered?

342
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,110
I'm actually good-tempered.

343
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,030
I'm praising you for your tenacity,

344
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,400
accumulated power,

345
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,680
and passion for life.

346
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,640
You're more honey-tongued.

347
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,880
Does it make a difference in the beef?

348
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,830
The moisture and nutrition of beef

349
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,030
can be instantly solidified

350
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,590
when they are heated.

351
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,000
It'll taste more delicate.

352
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,310
People say

353
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,510
cooking reflects one's attitude

354
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,440
towards life.

355
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,110
I don't do things as delicately as you.

356
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,960
Will we often quarrel, then?

357
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,110
People are different.

358
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,200
Disagreements can't be avoided.

359
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,030
Quarreling...

360
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,000
It also increases dopamine.

361
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,000
Once I make this assumption,

362
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,030
maybe I'll always

363
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,440
want to quarrel with you.

364
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,510
Then I'll silence you

365
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,110
with the food.

366
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,670
Mr. Zhu,

367
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,880
I think you're used to taking my company

368
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,200
as your springboard.

369
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,870
Chang,

370
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,680
I just have more consideration

371
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,310
for thousands of my employees.

372
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,110
That's what I like about you,

373
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,310
righteousness.

374
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,510
Thank you, Chang.

375
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,920
Dongyang Medical repeatedly conceded

376
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
on the purchase price.

377
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,110
Looks like they're determined

378
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,240
to acquire your company.

379
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,750
I can still be your springboard

380
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,920
for a higher price.

381
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,440
What do you mean?

382
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,830
Next, without fear,

383
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,160
negotiate with them on a higher price.

384
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,030
Tell them

385
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,400
I've accepted the existing price.

386
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,750
Even if you and I can't cooperate,

387
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,040
I'll make Han Ting

388
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,720
pay a pretty penny.

389
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,350
Chang, if you say this,

390
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,110
- I'll be relieved.
- But...

391
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,790
If Han Ting quits,

392
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,350
I will acquire your company.

393
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,030
And the price

394
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,750
must go down by 5%

395
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,200
than his first offer.

396
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,920
Boss, Zhu Houyu broke the contract again.

397
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,950
I get it.

398
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,480
Let's go.

399
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,200
Never thought one day

400
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,160
Mr. Han would drive me to work personally.

401
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,510
What an honor!

402
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,920
Even a bigger honor than I'm your boyfriend?

403
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,480
Don't be narcissistic.

404
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,720
I'm not motivated, then.

405
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,400
I guess I can't drive Miss Ji to work.

406
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,550
What about now?

407
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,480
As the bosses, we can be

408
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
a bit late for work, huh?

409
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,800
Oh, Han Ting.

410
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:47,900
(Dongyang Group)

411
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,150
Xing.

412
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,000
Come in.

413
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,000
Close the door.

414
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,870
Be seated.

415
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,830
Xing, what's up?

416
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,790
I received an anonymous email.

417
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,200
It's an internal report,

418
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,110
accusing someone of acquiring profit

419
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,030
and slacking at work.

420
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,110
The year-end bonuses will be handed out.

421
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,400
I guess some guys couldn't repress.

422
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,830
Based on our existing bonus system,

423
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,640
an excellent employee will indeed get
at least four or five times

424
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,240
than an ordinary employee.

425
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,870
How about this?

426
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,240
Let's average

427
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,670
the bonuses.

428
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,510
How?

429
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,960
What is an excellent employee?

430
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,200
He does more work

431
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,110
and he works better.

432
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,240
Someone like him deserves more.

433
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,480
Right. I get your point, Xing.

434
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,240
But our company is so small.

435
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,920
The employees run into each other.

436
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,110
What if they have conflicts

437
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,590
for the bonus thing?

438
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,920
Without a clear standard,
there will be more conflicts.

439
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,750
I agree with Xing.

440
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,960
Go ask someone randomly.

441
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,950
Shang Gaofeng.

442
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,640
He gets along very well with Xu Youyou.

443
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,750
His bonus is higher than hers.

444
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,640
Ask him if he agrees

445
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,930
to give some to Xu Youyou?

446
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,040
That's right.

447
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,110
To get a higher bonus,

448
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,880
one has to make excellent achievements

449
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,350
with brain and heart.

450
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,110
We've established the bonus rule

451
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,240
just to encourage our employees

452
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,510
to work hard.

453
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,440
If one keeps taking advantage

454
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,720
and slacking at work,

455
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,350
and he wants a great bonus,

456
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,960
isn't that ridiculous?

457
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,800
Got it.

458
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,160
We'll be fair, then.

459
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,160
These days, I'll pay more attention

460
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,110
to everybody's emotions.

461
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,560
Besides,

462
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,000
I have an idea. Listen.

463
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,790
From the next season on,

464
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,240
we'll give everybody a pay rise.

465
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,310
It will be distributed

466
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,150
according to their work.

467
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,240
We'll discuss it later.

468
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,390
In this way,

469
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,400
those with a high bonus
won't have an objection.

470
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,830
Those with a low bonus

471
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,350
can be pacified, too.

472
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,160
I agree.

473
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,960
Fine with me.

474
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,760
OK.

475
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,950
You go back to work.

476
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,110
OK.

477
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,920
How is it going?

478
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,160
(Huang Weiwei)
Waiting for a chance. I'll do it soon.

479
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,920
The year-end bonus is given!

480
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,520
Hey, Shang.

481
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,310
No more hiding.

482
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,960
You must have a high bonus, huh?

483
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,350
Not really.

484
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,790
Don't be modest.

485
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,400
As a founding member,

486
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,350
you'll get at least this much, huh?

487
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,350
More or less.

488
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,350
Let's keep a low profile. Go.

489
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,550
Invite me to dinner.

490
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,260
(Transaction from Xingchen Technology, 32,876)

491
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,680
3D medical printing

492
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,520
has obvious advantages,

493
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,680
but the other...

494
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,310
Why do I only have about 30,000

495
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,350
of the year-end bonus?

496
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,110
Not to mention we've been colleagues

497
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,110
for so many years...

498
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,640
Since you just moved in here,

499
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,790
I've joined you.

500
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,510
Why do I get less than Shang Gaofeng?

501
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,350
Weiwei, be seated.

502
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,520
Sit.

503
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,030
Our year-end bonuses

504
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,000
are calculated by company rules.

505
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
There are guidelines.

506
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,240
I can't give you more money

507
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,160
just because we're old colleagues.

508
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,440
That'll be unfair

509
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,350
to other colleagues, huh?

510
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,030
Fine.

511
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
I get it.

512
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,000
Whatever you say,

513
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,720
your point is

514
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,590
you won't give me how much I want, huh?

515
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,950
All right.

516
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,030
I'll let go

517
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,000
of the bonus thing.

518
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,190
But...

519
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,070
When will you give me

520
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,160
my shares?

521
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,190
Shares?

522
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,590
Yeah.

523
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,240
I'm a founding member of Xingchen.

524
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,240
I deserve some shares.

525
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,110
Which one of us promised

526
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,550
to give you any shares?

527
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,270
When you interviewed me,

528
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,000
you said we would start the company together.

529
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,550
How come I have no shares?

530
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:23,910
Mr. Su,

531
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,550
you promised that to me.

532
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,960
If we can work together,

533
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,550
we will not let you down.

534
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,640
Every one of us

535
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,920
does the business together.

536
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,070
The bonuses and dividends

537
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,960
will be offered.

538
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
Sorry, Weiwei.

539
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,720
Maybe I used

540
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,590
some wrong phrasing.

541
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,000
At that time, Xingchen just started.

542
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,350
But I was talking about basic benefits.

543
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,550
For example,

544
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,000
year-end bonus and project bonus.

545
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,350
You'll surely have them.

546
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,840
Weiwei,

547
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,160
you have an employment contract.

548
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,160
You're an employee, not a shareholder.

549
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,240
Maybe Zhizhou made you misunderstand.

550
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,750
Misunderstand?

551
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,550
You think you can wipe my shares with it?

552
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,240
I kind of have an investment

553
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,240
in technology.

554
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,160
I'm involved in the manufacturing process

555
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,720
of the intervertebral cage.

556
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,960
Weiwei, look.

557
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,200
We've worked together for so long.

558
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,110
You know Miss Ji

559
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,040
- and me...
- Enough, Mr. Su.

560
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,400
I care for Xingchen

561
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,960
and don't want to break with you.

562
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,070
But in this case,

563
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,510
you have to give me an explanation.

564
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,640
Or I won't let it go!

565
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,790
Well, Weiwei.

566
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,200
We'll think about it

567
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,720
before talking to you again, OK?

568
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,630
OK.

569
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,510
I'll be waiting.

570
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,110
One more thing.

571
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,310
I'll quit.

572
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,310
My resignation

573
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,640
will be submitted soon according to procedures.

574
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,920
Before that,

575
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,880
I hope my shares

576
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,310
can be given.

577
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,160
Xing.

578
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,720
Isn't... Isn't she ridiculous?

579
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,000
Assistant Liu, I did what you said.

580
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,000
They?

581
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,720
They were unwilling,

582
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,310
but they didn't give a blank refusal.

583
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,000
They said they would discuss it.

584
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,350
OK. I get it.

585
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,720
If there's another mission,

586
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,750
I'll let you know.

587
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:50,940
(Dongyang Group)

588
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,110
How did this happen?

589
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,680
I've known Huang Weiwei

590
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,590
for a few years.

591
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,310
I don't think she wants to blackmail me.

592
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,960
She really thinks

593
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,030
she deserves some shares.

594
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,310
But she isn't a shareholder.

595
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,800
Forget about personal thinking.

596
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,550
What is the fact?

597
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,240
She has an employment contract

598
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,080
with Xingchen.

599
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,510
She has no shares.

600
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,000
That's it, then.

601
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,590
Check this for me.

602
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,040
OK.

603
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,200
Tang Song's message.

604
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,110
He said you would meet Zhu Houyu

605
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,920
at Xuanhe Teahouse.

606
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,640
You'll go?

607
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,000
Go with me.

608
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,550
It can be done very soon.

609
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,920
Then I'll have dinner with you.

610
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,160
You take some rest in there

611
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,000
and have something to eat.

612
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,200
I'll handle something.

613
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,350
Sorry, Mr. Han.

614
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,920
I know you're busy.

615
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,790
Sorry to have you come personally.

616
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,880
But it's really too impolite

617
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,510
to talk about this over the phone.

618
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,310
I must apologize in your face.

619
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,750
The acquisition is a big deal.

620
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,440
You can't be too cautious.

621
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,590
But my assistant told me.

622
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,960
Only a signature was needed for the contract.

623
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,720
But you suddenly had a problem.

624
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,960
Mr. Han,

625
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,830
a merchant wants profit.

626
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,720
My company wouldn't have come this far

627
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,720
without my hard work over the last decade.

628
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,240
I should pick a higher offer, huh?

629
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,720
Now, another company offers

630
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,590
a higher price

631
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,160
and I'm really tempted.

632
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,720
We're in the same circle.

633
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,920
I totally understand.

634
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,110
Who would let go of the profit at hand?

635
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,590
This is also why

636
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,590
I didn't have a problem with you

637
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,720
when you agreed on a price

638
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,480
and then raised it several times.

639
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,590
Business, after all,

640
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,720
isn't a one-time thing.

641
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,790
There are negotiations

642
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,240
and communications.

643
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,870
My company

644
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,920
never cares about this little money.

645
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,350
Here.

646
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,310
But everything has a limit.

647
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Mr. Zhu, you keep regretting.

648
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,310
I guess the bidding will not stop.

649
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,440
You take us as a springboard.

650
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,270
Thinking we're a pushover?

651
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,790
What are you talking about?

652
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,000
Dongyang Medical is a big company.

653
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,920
I don't dare to mess with you.

654
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,440
I'm just a nobody.

655
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,960
And I have no dreams.

656
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,920
You're gentle,

657
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,830
principled, and righteous.

658
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,400
But I'm different.

659
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,310
I have to go and explore.

660
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,350
If I care about useless stuff

661
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,790
like righteousness,

662
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,160
I'll earn a lot less.

663
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,790
Go and explore?

664
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,950
Taking my company

665
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,440
as a supermarket?

666
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,640
Don't be kidding, Mr. Han.

667
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,190
How about this?

668
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,920
Give me a little bit more

669
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,960
and we'll have a deal.

670
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,150
Mr. Zhu,

671
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,160
don't you think it sounds familiar?

672
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,640
I'm not you.

673
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,830
This is all I have.

674
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,920
Offer a little bit more.

675
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,590
I wonder if you know

676
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,400
how your company

677
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
will end up

678
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,240
if my company

679
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,160
quits the bidding.

680
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,840
You...

681
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,510
You can afford twenty million, can't you?

682
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,840
I can.

683
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,750
But I don't want to.

684
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,040
Mr. Han,

685
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,030
would you rather let Chang He have it

686
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,720
than negotiate more?

687
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,160
One last chance.

688
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,800
If you agree,

689
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,870
sign the contract.

690
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,680
If you don't,

691
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,400
we'll quit.

692
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,150
I don't like this kind of tea.

693
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,110
In second and third-tier cities, my company

694
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,000
has a good market share.

695
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,030
If I really sell it to Chang He,

696
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,510
hope you won't regret it.

697
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,600
Boss.

698
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,550
You asked me to investigate

699
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,630
Zhu Houyu and Chang He.

700
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,000
I figured out

701
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,550
they privately met several times.

702
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,480
For the acquisition, I think.

703
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,670
Chang He is dissatisfied with Zhu Houyu

704
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,320
when he raises the price for both sides.

705
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,920
If we quit now,

706
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,760
they will cooperate.

707
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,670
Chang He will acquire it at a lower price.

708
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,870
Shall we...?

709
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,430
OK.

710
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,760
I'm on it.

711
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,360
Let's go.

712
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,710
Where are we going?

713
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,000
To have dinner together.

714
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,840
Come on.

715
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,510
Why did you

716
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,190
take me to see Zhu Houyu?

717
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,070
You don't understand?

718
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,630
You did that on purpose?

719
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,000
Business field is like a battlefield.

720
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,230
So is the workplace.

721
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:15,360
But Huang Weiwei and I are different.

722
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,550
We were colleagues, after all.

723
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,800
We have feelings.

724
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,230
A boss and his employees

725
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,110
are essentially a contract thing.

726
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,590
The human heart is the last thing to trust.

727
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,110
Only with balanced interests

728
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,630
can you have a balanced relationship.

729
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,190
Getting along with your employees as friends

730
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,510
will only make them greedier.

731
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,000
Sounds mean.

732
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,240
Come on.

733
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,400
You always want to shelter others.

734
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,800
But not everyone is worth it.

735
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,000
Instead of being grateful, some people

736
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,710
will even snatch your umbrella

737
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,110
and get you in a bigger rain.

738
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,510
This is the reality.

739
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,960
Out of regulations, there are human feelings.

740
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,760
But a kind heart

741
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,320
has to go with tough methods.

742
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,630
Improper kindness

743
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,670
will only erode the authority

744
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,800
you've finally established through regulations.

745
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,320
Do you know when your girlfriend is unhappy,

746
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,680
she doesn't want
to hear stuff like this, Mr. Han?

747
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,400
OK. I'll stop talking.

748
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,150
I'll grill the meat for you.

749
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,800
Here.

750
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,000
Let me assume this for you.

751
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,110
Every time she talks about you,

752
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,150
she'll scold you angrily.

753
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,800
Does it make you feel better?

754
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,360
Didn't you say you would stop talking?

755
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,640
I will.

756
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,320
Why?

757
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,960
For the sake of your bad mood,

758
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,960
I let you drink a little.

759
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,320
Look how much you've drunk.

760
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,190
You don't drink, anyway.

761
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
This is all I'll drink.

762
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,320
It doesn't matter.

763
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,110
Don't drink too much.

764
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,800
Drinking can make me forget everything.

765
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,240
Everything?

766
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,000
You're excluded.

767
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,120
Eat it.

768
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,500
(Dongyang Group)

769
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,540
(Xingchen Technology)

770
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,200
Weiwei,

771
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,360
Miss Ji asked you to go to her office.

772
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,510
OK.

773
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,630
Miss Ji, is it about the shares?

774
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,360
You said you would quit your job.

775
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,960
Have you made up your mind?

776
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,880
If you want to stay

777
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,840
in Xingchen,

778
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,760
I promise you.

779
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,670
From next season on,

780
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,550
you'll have a pay rise.

781
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,960
But you can't have

782
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,800
any shares of Xingchen.

783
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,190
A pay rise isn't a big deal.

784
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,960
The pay is only ten or twenty thousand.

785
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,760
In a startup like Xingchen,

786
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,070
who would work without shares?

787
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,360
You think I'll volunteer my time for dreams?

788
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,070
Even if I do, I won't do it for you guys.

789
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,440
Xingchen pays you.

790
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,440
That's what you're supposed to do.

791
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,590
You didn't invest money or connections.

792
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,840
Nor did you manage anything.

793
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,920
And before you joined us,

794
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,030
Xingchen had received

795
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,230
an investment from Dongyang Medical.

796
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,000
If you want some shares,

797
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,150
will all the other employees

798
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,150
have some shares, too?

799
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,550
I've been working with you

800
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,150
for such a long time.

801
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,400
I didn't expect you to cheat for interest.

802
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,880
I cheat?

803
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,840
On your employment contract,

804
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,480
this term doesn't exist.

805
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
If you have some evidence

806
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,070
to prove you're a shareholder,

807
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,680
I'll accept it.

808
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,710
That's a verbal convention

809
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,760
and what evidence can I have?

810
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,960
You know what?

811
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,550
I'm a founding member of Xingchen.

812
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,800
I invested in technology.

813
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,670
For the stock of Xingchen,

814
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,670
I want at least 3%.

815
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,400
Weiwei,

816
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,360
I can't give you that.

817
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,800
Fine.

818
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,000
Remember what you said.

819
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,670
What's wrong? Your hair isn't dried.

820
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,150
I'm too tired to dry it.

821
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,670
I know you talked to Huang Weiwei today.

822
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,030
Well done.

823
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,710
I think this is

824
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,150
really embarrassing.

825
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,360
I met her four or five years ago.

826
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,800
But this time,

827
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,440
I kind of see a different her

828
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,960
that I've never seen before.

829
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,840
Knowing her for a long time
doesn't mean you know a lot about her.

830
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,480
Human is a complex polyhedron.

831
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,070
When no interests are involved,

832
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,320
most people

833
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,150
only appear to be friendly.

834
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,190
When you see more sides of someone

835
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,150
or even the dark side,

836
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,760
it means you will end up separated.

837
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,760
Han Ting, how many sides do you have?

838
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,070
Millions.

839
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,160
Come on.

840
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,440
This is just a little incident

841
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,480
in your career.

842
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,920
