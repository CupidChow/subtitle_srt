What are you doing here?

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,000
I was in the middle of something.

25
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,590
Now, I'm here for lunch.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,920
Went out for fun?

27
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,510
I didn't.

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,760
I was making preparations in my room.

29
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,150
Don't think

30
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,560
I'm here for a free vacation.

31
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,120
What preparations did you make?

32
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,640
It's a trade secret.

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,640
Secret?

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,320
Mr. Han.

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,470
Mr. Peng? Long time no see.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,150
So, this restaurant

37
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,520
is really famous.

38
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,150
Even Mr. Han is here.

39
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,120
Your Penguin Technology

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,000
has good medical data.

41
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,960
I was about to visit you for some advice.

42
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,030
What a coincidence!

43
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,150
I'm also focusing

44
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,000
on Doctorcloud of Dongyang Medical.

45
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,310
Through this forum,

46
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,750
I'd like to cooperate with you.

47
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,030
Let me introduce her.

48
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
This is Ji Xing,

49
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,680
general manager of Xingchen Technology.

50
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,910
She's just started the company,

51
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,750
specializing in 3D medical printing.

52
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,190
I guess you'll be interested.

53
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,360
I heard about that.

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
It's the company

55
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,120
you invested in, right?

56
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,000
I just didn't know

57
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,590
Miss Ji could be so young.

58
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,430
Hi, Mr. Peng.

59
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,710
I used to work on AI medical robots.

60
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,520
I had much access to database.

61
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,470
I once read

62
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,430
about your assay,

63
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,590
The Application Value

64
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,750
of AI Big Database

65
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,190
on the Precision Medicine.

66
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,590
It particularly illuminated me.

67
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,840
I'm here to learn something.

68
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
Look forward to your speech.

69
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
You flatter me, Miss Ji.

70
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,710
When the forum is over,

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,960
I'll invite Mr. Peng

72
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,120
to Xingchen for some guidance.

73
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,000
That's exaggerated.

74
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,000
Mr. Peng, here.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,960
This is my name card.

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,150
It's an honor meeting you.

77
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,560
Nice meeting you, too.

78
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,400
Thanks.

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,240
Well, Mr. Han and Miss Ji,

80
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,800
see you at the forum.

81
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,150
My friend is there.

82
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,310
- Bye.
- I'll leave you alone.

83
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,150
- See you.
- Go ahead.

84
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,630
So, this is what you were preparing.

85
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,520
Only when I know enough about the guests

86
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,800
can I get the point faster

87
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,520
at the forum.

88
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,840
Looks like Xingchen

89
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
doesn't a PR department.

90
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,120
I'll take it as a compliment.

91
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,080
Sir, your water.

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,680
- Thanks.
- Wait a minute.

93
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,520
Please rush my spaghetti.

94
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,750
OK. A minute, please.

95
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,160
What are you doing, Lu Linjia?

96
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh, there you are.

97
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,160
These are the devices

98
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,920
I've bought at a really high price.

99
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,960
Now,

100
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,070
I'm going to sing With You.

101
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,240

to check the acoustic facilities of your bar.

111

You're giving me a dimensional blow

146
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,310
as a professional singer.

147
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,310
Compared to you,

148
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,360
I feel ashamed.

149
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,800
Don't.

150
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,430
You don't sing very well.

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,560
But you chant well.

152
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,000
You can do rap.

153
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,160
Thanks.

154
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,880
How about this?

155
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,520
You can sing at my bar.

156
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,160
I'll think about it.

157
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,240
(Weird.)

158
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,720
(Before,)

159
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,750
(why did I actually hate her?)

160
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,160
Lu Linjia.

161
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,390
Lu Linjia.

162
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,600
What are you doing?

163
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,920
Nothing. I'm thinking...

164
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,040
There's a plan B.

165
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,000
What do you think?

166
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,040
Well done.

167
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,560
And a straw.

168
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,670
Here it is.

169
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,590
Enjoy it.

170
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,150
You can make cocktail?

171
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,080
Better than my singing, huh?

172
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,270
- Taste it.
- OK.

173
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,440
Tastes good.

174
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,720
Oh, I was about to say this.

175
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,000
The names of the cocktail

176
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,150
are too straightforward

177
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,910
instead of being romantic or poetic.

178
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,600
They are? Do you have an idea?

179
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,120
A bar with good businesses

180
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,600
may not only sell cocktail

181
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
but also fantasy.

182
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,630
Look, "Tequila Sunrise".

183
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,030
If we change it

184
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,550
into "No Overtime Work This Week".

185
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,960
All working guys will want it, right?

186
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,510
"No Overtime..."

187
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,320
Then this.

188
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,270
I can change "Brown Derby"

189
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,910
into "The Fool Drinks It".

190
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,840
And "Life Bloom"

191
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,030
can be "Drink and Become a Kitten".

192
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,750
No. You should make the names evocative

193
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,360
instead of doing magic.

194
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,240
Such weird names.

195
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,030
But I think

196
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,960
we need one kind of cocktail

197
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,320
for secret love confession.

198
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,750
This cocktail

199
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,120
can't be too strong.

200
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,390
It should have a lovely color.

201
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,390
Use fruit wine...

202
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,320
Fruit wine and cherry.

203
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,750
What's the name of it, then?

204
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,000
"One and One Is Minus Two."

205
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,240
Why is it not two?

206
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,350
Because

207
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,800
Minus Two means less work.

208
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,630
It's lovely.

209
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,470
It is?

210
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,800
Write it down.

211
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,360
(Zeng Di)
Mr. Gu told me

212
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,000
he had lunch with you.

213
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,910
I'm near the restaurant.

214
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,750
Shall we have some afternoon tea?

215
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,000
Ji Xing, what a coincidence!

216
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,750
Really coincidental.

217
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,990
Miss Zeng.

218
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,910
I knew you would be here.

219
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,390
When I got off the plane, I came right here.

220
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,120
Talking with Miss Ji?

221
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,800
Yes.

222
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,390
As a new startup company,

223
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,440
Xingchen can take part

224
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,750
in such a high-level forum.

225
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,600
No wonder people say

226
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
having a great investor

227
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,360
is like taking the fast lane.

228
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,960
Xingchen has enough strength.

229
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,320
The invitation is only a matter of time.

230
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,720
I just made it shorter.

231
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,270
At this expo,

232
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,600
Guanghua's booth
is next to that of Dongyang Medical.

233
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,030
It's not far from Xingchen, either.

234
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,030
Come have a look if you have time.

235
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,120
You worked for Guanghua, after all.

236
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
You contributed a lot to it.

237
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,790
When you suddenly resigned,

238
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,030
Director Chen and I

239
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,270
felt quite sorry.

240
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,720
Thanks for inviting me, Miss Zeng.

241
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,320
I'm ashamed to say this,

242
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,390
but when I left Guanghua,

243
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,000
things were rather unpleasant.

244
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,840
Everybody even blamed me

245
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,200
for Zhu Lei's being fired.

246
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,870
I was confused at that time.

247
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,510
But now, I can understand.

248
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,390
In case of trouble, a scapegoat is necessary.

249
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,240
In this way,

250
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,150
I owe you an apology, huh?

251
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,390
At that time, I thought

252
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,440
firing Zhu Lei could vent your anger.

253
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,670
Unexpectedly,

254
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,030
it makes you

255
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,390
misunderstand me more.

256
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,240
This restaurant hasn't changed at all.

257
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,360
The first time you came back from Germany

258
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,120
to attend Shenzhen Summit,

259
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,440
I recommended this restaurant to you.

260
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,240
Back then,

261
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,510
Guanghua was a startup company.

262
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,750
Luckily, you introduced

263
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,600
many connections to me

264
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,840
so that Guanghua took the first step

265
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,240
and established a long operation

266
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,510
with so many good enterprises.

267
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,630
Just like how you contacted Beidi, Ji Xing.

268
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,790
That's what we've both done.

269
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,240
I have work to do.

270
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,150
I should go.

271
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,200
You don't need this little time.

272
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,320
You have to eat, anyway.

273
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,150
Work matters most.

274
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,230
Off you go.

275
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,550
Sir, here's your spaghetti.

276
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,910
I had no idea you still loved

277
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,000
spaghetti of this restaurant.

278
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,240
Just like what we did before.

279
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,230
Waitress.

280
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Yes, sir.

281
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,840
Pack this, please.

282
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,360
OK, sir. Just a minute.

283
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,630
Ji Xing is the boss of Xingchen,

284
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,320
not an employee of Guanghua.

285
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,000
Don't bring up the old story again.

286
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,550
I was just trying

287
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,960
to do some catching up.

288
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,510
Who would know she just didn't let it go?

289
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,000
Do you really not know

290
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,440
why she did that?

291
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,840
Sir, your packed spaghetti.

292
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,720
Thanks. One spaghetti for this lady, too.

293
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,790
OK. A minute, please.

294
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
You've just arrived.

295
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,320
Finish it before you leave.

296
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,840
(Xiaomeng)
Xing, what?

297
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,030
How does the spaghetti taste?

298
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,600
(Ji Xing)
I was too angry to eat anything.

299
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,180
(Li Li)

300
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Xing, what happened?

301
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,390
In the restaurant, I met Zeng Di.

302
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,910
Now, I'm so annoyed to see her.

303
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Everything happens

304
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,630
for a reason.

305
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,360
Is it possibly because

306
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,960
she has a flirty relationship

307
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,910
with Han Ting?

308
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,000
Then you're annoyed to see her.

309
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,000
What does her relationship with Han Ting

310
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,630
have to do with me?

311
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,440
Then what annoys you?

312
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,360
I'm right, aren't I?

313
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,120
Or maybe you're just too hungry.

314
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,440
I'll say no more.

315
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Do what you have to do.

316
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,790
I'll wait until you come.

317
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,040
Bye-bye.

318
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,220
Drinking alone again?

319
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,360
Mr. Chang?

320
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,630
When did you get here?

321
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
A while ago.

322
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,030
The competition is hard for you, I think.

323
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,150
I didn't lose.

324
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,600
Then I should drink with you.

325
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,630
For celebration.

326
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,280
Cheers.

327
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,630
I remember you didn't like

328
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,390
to attend such forums.

329
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,670
I think you know clearly

330
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,030
who I came here for.

331
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,910
Mr. Chang, if you say so,

332
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,080
I'll feel flattered.

333
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,910
Don't feel that way.

334
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,360
I'm willing to keep you company.

335
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,720
It's...

336
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,200
The necklace that was auctioned the other day.

337
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,240
Mr. Chang,

338
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,880
you gave me a necklace and a watch.

339
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,070
You keep pampering me.

340
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,200
I... I don't know

341
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,830
how to pay you back.

342
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,510
A give-and-take

343
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,640
is a pure exchange of benefits.

344
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,750
I pamper you

345
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,720
just to make you happy.

346
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,590
Don't feel stressed.

347
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,000
I pamper you

348
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,830
because I care about you.

349
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,310
Anyone who doesn't pamper you

350
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,590
just doesn't care about you.

351
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,160
It's the same with business cooperation.

352
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,350
To drink for celebration

353
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,510
or to drink alone

354
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,920
depends on your choice.

355
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,040
How about

356
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,160
you return Han Ting's investment?

357
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,350
I'll invest in you.

358
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,590
What Dongyang Medical can't offer,

359
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,680
I can give it to you.

360
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,200
What Dongyang Medical can offer,

361
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,680
I can give you double.

362
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,590
Thanks, Mr. Chang.

363
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,550
But Han Ting invested in me.

364
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,350
Guanghua can't turn its back
on Dongyang Medical.

365
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,110
I believe

366
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,880
you won't like

367
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,440
an ungrateful lady.

368
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,830
I remember how you care about me.

369
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,640
But this present is way too expensive.

370
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
I can't accept it.

371
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,750
I appreciate it, though.

372
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,280
Thank you.

373
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,920
No worries. Take your time.

374
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,240
You're quite vigorous.

375
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,110
You walked this far without eating anything.

376
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,200
Anger gave me quite a lot of energy.

377
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,550
Would you like the spaghetti, then?

378
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,440
Zeng Di is at least the boss

379
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,310
of a company.

380
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,440
Why did you argue with her?

381
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,550
She's a boss, so what?

382
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,790
She knows clearly

383
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,790
why I left Guanghua.

384
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,350
But she had the face to bring it up.

385
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,200
You beat her in speech,

386
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,400
but so what?

387
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,550
This circle is small.

388
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,680
If you offend her

389
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,680
and she secretly tricks you,

390
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,520
what good does it do you?

391
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,400
She would still trick me

392
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,750
even if I tolerated her.

393
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,440
But the conflict wouldn't be intensified.

394
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,310
Dealing with people is like playing chess.

395
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,480
You should at least

396
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,160
think of four or five steps afterwards.

397
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,590
Do you think the raw material problem

398
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,160
was a one-off incident?

399
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,520
Zeng Di?

400
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,550
Look at you.

401
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,790
It's like you have an emotional roller coaster.

402
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,640
You're good at playing cards, aren't you?

403
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,200
When you're not playing,

404
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,750
why can't you control your emotions?

405
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,720
I no longer work for Guanghua.

406
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,640
But she still traps me.

407
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,000
So, what I just said

408
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
didn't convince you at all.

409
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Eat it before it gets cold.

410
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,150
Where are you going?

411
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,520
To work.

412
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,660
(The 4th Shenzhen AI in Medical Expo & Summit)

413
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,240
I'm Zhang Minghui of Wanli Logistics.

414
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,310
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

415
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,640
I know, under your leadership,

416
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,720
Dongyang Medical

417
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,000
has been prospering.

418
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,720
I think you guys work in this field

419
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,200
like a fish in water.

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,180
(Ji Xing)

421
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,470
- Hi, Miss Zeng.
- Hi, Ji Xing.

422
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,200
Where's your seat?

423
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,040
There it is.

424
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,760
Take your seat.

425
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,160
Let's talk later.

426
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,720
- Hi.
- Hello.

427
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,140
Long time no see.

428
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,350
Everybody, welcome to Shenzhen

429
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,920
AI in Medical Expo & Summit.

430
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,270
On behalf of the organizer,

431
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,790
I'd like to warmly welcome you,

432
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,480
(Dongyang Medical)
dear guests.

433
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,240
Since the Industrial Revolution,

434
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,270
every century has witnessed

435
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,510
one or two

436
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,160
significant technological changes.

437
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:21,030
Now, it's the era of AI.

438
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,750
AI medicine is the next big thing.

439
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,920
This AI medical summit

440
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,000
has gathered elites

441
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,080
from domestic medical industry.

442
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,720
Hope everybody can get something

443
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,760
from speeches and discussions.

444
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,510
Now, I announce

445
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,510
this summit officially starts.

446
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,590
First, let's welcome

447
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,070
our guest of opening, Mr. Han Ting,

448
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,550
CEO of Dongyang Medical,

449
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,110
to give his speech.

450
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,280
Please come.

451
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:56,310
(Future Development Trend of Medical Industry)

452
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,440
Every other day,

453
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,680
there are all kinds of conferences

454
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,750
and forums.

455
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,750
It's the same in every circle.

456
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,510
A few people do things

457
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,920
while a lot of people speak.

458
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,000
I've done a lot of things.

459
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,550
I've talked a lot, too.

460
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,790
The prospect of the industry

461
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,070
has been the biggest concern

462
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,400
of the practitioners.

463
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,310
I can't predict the future.

464
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,000
But I want to briefly talk with you

465
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,790
about the future trend

466
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,310
of the medical industry.

467
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,380
(Herb, Modern Medicine, AI Medical)

468
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,590
Throughout the history of medicine,

469
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,590
people first relied on herbs

470
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,880
and religious factors,

471
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,400
known as ancient medicine.

472
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,920
Then they had systematic

473
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,750
modern and contemporary medicine

474
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,790
closely related to technology.

475
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,790
Later, it was the systematic medicine

476
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,590
and wisdom medicine.

477
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,000
The trend of times

478
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,110
has been changing.

479
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,200
The needs of people and the market

480
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,830
have been changing accordingly, too.

481
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,160
The kind of soil decides

482
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,960
what flowers will grow.

483
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,270
The macro environment

484
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,830
is the foundation of industrial development

485
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,790
and the soil for the growth of companies.

486
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,920
It includes a series

487
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,440
of external factors that influence

488
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,380
the industrial development.

489
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,000
We can start from politics,

490
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,960
society, economy, and...

491
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,240
Gold always shines.

492
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,480
You may be a piece of gold.

493
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,440
But don't forget.

494
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,310
In this city,

495
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,110
gold is everywhere.

496
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,720
I believe

497
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,550
the future medical industry

498
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,310
will embrace a growth spurt.

499
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,030
In the face of the rushing waves,

500
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,680
what enterprises should do

501
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,750
isn't set the trend,

502
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,440
but conform to it.

503
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,480
Everybody, I hope all of you

504
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,000
and work hard and encourage each other,

505
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,400
to contribute to our country

506
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,030
and industrial development

507
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,640
with what you should offer.

508
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,240
Thanks.

509
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,270
OK. Thank you, Mr. Han,
for your wonderful speech.

510
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,110
I believe after hearing

511
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,110
Mr. Han's speech,

512
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,640
you have a lot of questions

513
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,790
to consult him.

514
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,400
Next, we have ten minutes for questions.

515
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,000
Dear guests here,

516
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,350
put up your hands to ask a question.

517
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,000
Mr. Han, please come

518
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,200
to the center of the stage.

519
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,310
Looks like many guests

520
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,550
want to ask Mr. Han a question.

521
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,240
Mr. Han, you pick one.

522
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,960
This lady in blue.

523
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:26,950
Hi, Mr. Han.

524
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,310
What is your detailed layout or planning

525
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,720
in AI Medical?

526
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,000
OK, everybody. Due to a time limit,

527
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,160
you have the last question to ask.

528
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,480
The lady in the last row

529
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,160
with short hair.

530
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,320
Thanks.

531
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,880
Mr. Han, you just said

532
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,680
an enterprise should conform to the trend

533
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,200
instead of setting one.

534
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,270
It sounds like

535
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,110
you've denied

536
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,160
the initiative of an enterprise.

537
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,270
Isn't it that

538
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,680
an enterprise setting the trend

539
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,830
can be more competitive?

540
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,670
Right.

541
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,000
That's what you can read

542
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,440
in an inspiration book.

543
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,400
But compared to the times,

544
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,550
the power of an individual is too small.

545
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,350
Instead of saying we'll set the trend,

546
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,270
I would rather say

547
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,640
we find the opportunities of the age

548
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,070
ahead of anyone else

549
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,830
and conform to changing times.

550
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,960
If we go too far ahead,

551
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,590
we also need to make sure

552
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,070
we can hold on to our own era.

553
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,480
Only by doing the right thing at the right time

554
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,070
can we get closer to success.

555
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,000
What Dongyang does

556
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,750
is analyze practical data

557
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,920
and look for demands.

558
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,960
By trying and failing

559
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,880
again and again,

560
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,790
we feel the pulse of the time.

561
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,000
Small and medium-sized enterprises

562
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,480
shouldn't wish
to conquer the world in the first place.

563
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,920
They should learn to open up new routes

564
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,880
by taking advantage
of wind directions and currents.

565
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,680
Start from small businesses

566
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,960
and focus on specialization.

567
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,400
That's the first step.

568
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,590
I wonder

569
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,550
if this is a good answer

570
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,590
to your question.

571
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,790
Thank you, Mr. Han. I get it.

572
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,840
Wait a minute.

573
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,400
Everybody, let me introduce her.

574
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,220
This lady

575
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,590
is Ji Xing, general manager

576
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,790

578

579
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,780

580
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,990
specializing in 3D medical printing.

581
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,350
Class III device has high barriers.

582
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,790
Compared to Class I and II, it's much harder.

583
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,630
Miss Ji,

584
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,160
hope you can lead Xingchen

585
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,750
to fill the void of the times

586
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,550
and press ahead against all odds.

587
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,400
Xingchen will not let you down, Mr. Han.

588
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,400
Our intervertebral cage

589
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,680
has been completed.

590
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,030
We'll start our clinical test.

591
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,750
On this expo, we expect to find

592
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,200
a cooperative institution with the same goal.

593
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,790
We'll launch our product soon

594
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,270
to meet the needs of the times and the market.

(The 4th Shenzhen AI Medical Expo & Summit)

596
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,280
Ms. Yuan.

597
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,030
Wherever your cousin goes,

598
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,240
he can be the spotlight.

599
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,070
Dongyang Medical and my company

600
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,640
are competitors.

601
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,000
But I have to admit.

602
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,790
Han Ting is really charming.

603
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,000
After his speech,

604
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,900
I wonder how many companies

605
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,200
will offer to cooperate with him.

606
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,680
It's really hard

607
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,000
to be his rival.

608
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,480
When the summit is over,

609
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,000
shall we have some tea together?

610
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,800
Mr. Chang,

611
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,410
considering the competition

612
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,830
between our companies,

613
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,680
do you think I'll go?

614
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,640
Business rivals only care for pros and cons.

615
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,550
But concerning interests,

616
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,160
family members fight desperately.

617
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,000
I have a good suggestion.

618
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,350
I believe you'll be interested.

619
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,200
When you have time,

620
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,070
why don't you sit with me and listen?

621
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,270
The soil for the growth of companies.

622
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,400
It includes a series of external factors

623
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,680
that influence the industrial development.

624
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,880
What are you watching, Su?

625
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,350
Mr. Han's speech.

626
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,400
You know what?

627
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,790
Mr. Han's speech

628
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,750
is really awesome.

629
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,070
I've learned a lot.

630
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,400
Su,

631
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,830
how could you be so ignorant?

632
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,240
Love usually sprouts during a journey.

633
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,720
Your business trip with Miss Li

634
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,200
is a great chance.

635
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,270
Why don't you

636
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,590
get some travel trips now?

637
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,960
Try to ask Miss Li out

638
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,000
and show her how thoughtful you can be.

639
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,440
Don't say stuff like that.
Keep your voice down.

640
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,790
Miss Li has a boyfriend.

641
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,750
But I've observed Miss Li for a long time.

642
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,920
I don't think she appears

643
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,350
to have a boyfriend.

644
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,590
Maybe it's just her excuse to reject you.

645
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,160
This is a great chance to be a charming guy.

646
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,200
- Seize the chance.
- What charming guy?

647
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,760
Charming...

648
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,110
We're talking about Mr. Han's speech.

649
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,960
He's a charming guy.

650
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,720
Right?

651
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,680
You guys talk. I have work to finish.

652
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,070
Mr. Han is handsome, indeed.

653
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,200
The coffee tastes more bitter.

654
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,680
Add some sugar, Li.

655
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,550
Your coffee is bitter.

656
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,030
Why would I add some sugar?

657
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,000
Just do it.

658
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,550
I left Mr. Han here.

(Mr. Han, I've learned a lot from forum.
Thanks for your guidance. I will...)

00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,190
No, no, no.

661
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,000

670

00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,000
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.

756
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,070
See you.

757
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,550
Xing, you were awesome.

758
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,840
You answered competently.

759
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,590
Looks like

760
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,000
we have the hope of cooperating

761
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,230
with the Innovation Center.

762
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,230
We don't know until we visit each other.

763
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,630
But anyway, we've achieved something.

764
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,510
Let's go on.

765
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,150
Try to get more cooperative institutions.

766
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,070
OK.

767
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,030
Hello. Come have a look.

768
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:18,870
OK.

769
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,550
Come, please.

770
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,030
Look. Our main product is...

771
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,510
Hi, everybody. This is our product

772
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,480
of interbody fusion cage.

773
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,400
This product

774
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,840
is made of EBM titanium alloy.

775
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,550
So, it's naturally biocompatible

776
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,030
and can make up

777
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,400
for the defects

778
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
of traditional products

779
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,630
with great changes

780
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,760
and improvement.
- Miss Ji.

781
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,550
Take a look over here.

782
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,400
Mr. Chen, you know me?

783
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,840
At yesterday's forum,

784
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,510
you were the last to ask Mr. Han

785
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,630
a question, right?

786
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,030
That was an immature question.

787
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,190
Forgive me, please.

788
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,190
That's not true.

789
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,440
It's a normal question

790
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,550
that can be easily ignored.

791
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,550
When I first started a company,

792
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,480
I wanted to set the trend.

793
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,670
Not until I failed several times

794
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,400
did I learn to conform to the times.

795
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Hanhai is the icon of our industry.

796
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,550
I didn't know you also failed.

797
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,400
(Hanhai Technology)

798
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,960
Everybody has a humble start,

799
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,000
doesn't he?

800
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,360
All the companies in our field

801
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,000
burn the cash of investors.

802
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,360
The research period is long

803
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,590
and benefits come late.

804
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:46,360
Our development is harder
than that in many other industries.

805
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,390
That's right.

806
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,190
Mr. Chen, may I ask you a question?

807
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,710
How much did it take

808
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,960
from staring the cage project

809
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,360
to putting it on market?

810
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,760
Two years and three months.

811
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,480
That was a short time.

812
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
But investors may not wait for so long.

813
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,800
After all, the time we consume

814
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,070
would be the cash they invest.

815
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,680
Miss Ji,

816
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,320
I have an appointment.

817
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,190
I should go.

818
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,360
Take your time here.

819
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,630
OK. I'll let you work.

820
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,000
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

821
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,140
(Hanhai Technology)

822
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:45,990
Miss Ji.

823
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,320
Mr. Han.

824
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,800
What are you looking at?

825
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,630
I just saw Hanhai's products.

826
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,550
This year, three or four implant devices

827
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,590
have been allowed to sell.

828
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,400
They're far ahead of us.

829
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,760
If someday, we have to compete with them...

830
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,550
Considering Xingchen's current scale,

831
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,110
it's too early for you to worry

832
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,270
about the competition with Hanhai.

833
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,000
This circle is actually big.

834
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,400
An enemy today

835
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,230
may be a friend tomorrow.

836
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:16,960
You don't need

837
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,840
to have an imaginary enemy too early.

838
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,670
Instead of being a worrywart,

839
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,550
you'd better steady yourself

840
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,070
and make progress stably.

841
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,760
Mr. Han.

842
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,440
Do you believe one day,

843
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,000
Xingchen will be as great as Hanhai

844
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,800
and even surpass it?

845
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,000
Or do you think I invested in Xingchen

846
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,760
just for charity?

847
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,350
Boss.

848
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,670
Mr. Peng is calling.

849
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,550
Sorry, but I have to take this.

850
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,430
Wait, Assistant Tang.

851
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,280
Is Mr. Han available tonight?

852
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,760
At seven, Mr. Han will have

853
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,360
a very important video meeting.

854
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,190
He won't be available until eight.

855
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,480
What do you want, Miss Ji?

856
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,190
I want to thank him.

857
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,760
I'd like an appointment with him.

858
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,230
I'll meet him at half past eight

859
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,630
in Star Ice on Longshan Road.

860
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,590
I'll be waiting there.

861
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,400
- OK.
- Thanks.

862
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,110
Miss Li, are you available tonight?

863
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,590
I want to invite you to dinner

864
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,800
when the expo is over

865
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,070
and talk about future cooperation.

866
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,390
OK.

867
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,150
We've brought some good wine.

868
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,150
Tonight, let's have a good time.

869
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,190
Whatever you say.

870
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,960
OK. See you tonight.

871
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,150
- See you tonight.
- See you.

872
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,480
Yes. When you're back,

873
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,110
you can learn more about it.

874
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,960
We look forward to your call.

875
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,310
- OK.
- Thanks.

876
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,320
Let me walk you out.

877
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,470
Have some water.

878
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,960
You were talking all the time.

879
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,800
Thanks.

880
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,720
Li,

881
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,400
I'll go to dinner with you tonight.

882
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,550
Mr. Su,

883
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,440
can you drink for me

884
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,030
or can you get an order for me?

885
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,800
Your job is to control the quality

886
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,960
of our products.

887
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,360
Doing business with a client

888
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,760
is my job.

889
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:17,030
I don't know much about negotiation,

890
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,360
but I know techniques.

891
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,030
As the vice general manager,

892
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,320
I should learn more

893
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,960
to make up for my weakness.

894
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,760
OK. But you have to follow
my every instruction.

895
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,760
OK. Take me as your assistant.

896
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,640
What assistant?

897
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,440
Li will have dinner with a client.

898
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,550
I want to go with her.

899
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,150
To learn something.

900
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,840
OK. Take care of Li Li.

901
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,150
Don't let her drink too much.

902
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,190
OK.

903
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,880
