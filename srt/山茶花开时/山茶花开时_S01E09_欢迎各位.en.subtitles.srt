CAMELLIA: THE BEGINNING

2
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:16,201
I WILL WELCOME EVERYONE

3
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,914
You're open, right?

4
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,292
Yes.

5
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,549
My gosh, we only ordered one serving.

6
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,926
That is one serving.

7
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,344
What?

8
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,722
Since you two are my first customers...

9
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,350
I see. I guess
you measured the portion wrong.

10
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,228
No, just because I'm in a good mood.

11
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:26,938
Enjoy.

12
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:29,941
Let's go.

13
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,866
CAMELLIA

14
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,998
Let's go, Pil-gu!

15
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,000
We should measure your height. Come here.

16
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,877
Let's see.

17
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,797
The year 2014...

18
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,217
CAMELLIA, I LOVE ONLY YOU

AUGUST 2019

29
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,301
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT
FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS, DONGBAEK

30
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,267
Why do you always thank people?

31
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,686
You should just write,
"Enjoy your lives, jerks."

32
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,775
Well, I am grateful.

33
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,446
I raised Pil-gu here, and I was able
to send him to the academy.

34
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,867
They always bully you,
and they're out to get you.

35
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,202
What are you grateful for?

36
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,914
The women in this neighborhood
are weird indeed.

37
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,833
Even though they hate me so much,

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,044
they always give me kimchi
when they make it.

39
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,173
They always do it,
as if it's a totally natural thing to do.

40
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,092
They're always like,

41
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,345
"When are you going to take
your kimchi?" They yell at me like that.

42
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,350
This is one strange neighborhood.

43
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,646
To tell you the truth, I think
I quite enjoyed living here.

44
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,816
People may not openly hate me
in other places,

45
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,567
but no one would give me kimchi.

46
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,486
That's a big difference.

47
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,364
Hey, sell some of your cards.

48
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,533
You're always so self-centered.

49
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,909
Whatever.

50
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,120
I'm not even having fun.

51
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,038
I don't want to play anymore.

52
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,544
I'm done, too. All my cards suck.

53
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,089
I have to say, that girl is so annoying.

54
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,134
I don't even want to play cards
because of her.

55
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,304
I told you ladies that we should
invite her to our kitty party group.

56
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,806
Is she moving
because we didn't invite her?

57
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,350
She doesn't have a husband
or anyone to hang out with.

58
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,601
She has no fun.

59
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,812
She held out for a long time.

60
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,524
If I were her,
I wouldn't have lasted a year.

61
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,654
Even if we overcharged her for tofu
and rice cakes and gave her the evil eye,

62
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,240
she always said hello to us.

63
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,367
Why did you give her the evil eye?

64
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,746
-Who gave her the evilest eye?
-Darn it.

65
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,668
Yong-sik was the last draw.

66
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,756
She lost her one and only friend
because of a guy.

67
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,299
No wonder she couldn't last.

68
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,180
It's all my fault.

69
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,100
I swallowed it without knowing

70
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,852
that I'd choke on it.

71
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,981
Why did I open up to her
and get all attached?

72
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,359
-I'll take this one.
-Sure.

73
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,320
Why does she want to leave
this neighborhood?

74
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,989
What do you think?
It's obviously because of Yong-sik.

75
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,701
She's running away
because she can't face Ms. Kwak.

76
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,495
What did that woman do?

77
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,414
Did she pick a fight or something?

78
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,249
Did she go berserk?

79
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,214
Gosh, she can't be that mean
to a single mom.

80
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,342
Besides, she's practically an orphan.

81
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,052
I told you.

82
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,721
Everyone looks down on you
when you don't have a mom.

83
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,224
Why move when she has no money?

84
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,684
She should just target Pil-gu's dad.

85
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,353
That's her gold mine.

86
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,564
Hey, I told you not to be a joke.

87
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,818
You're scaring me.

88
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,116
Everyone's being such a joke.
It really gets on my nerves.

89
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,871
By the way, what did you do
back in the old days?

90
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,917
You tell me first.
Why are you buying matching pajamas?

91
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,254
I told you I'm going to Copenhagen.

92
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,798
Your boss won't take you with her?

93
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:05,967
Dongbaek?

94
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,639
You're not going to wear it anymore?

95
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,225
I told you. It was just a habit.

96
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,686
This, too.

97
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,314
This is mine. Why are you taking this?

98
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,942
Because you're coming with me.

99
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,530
Don't think about going
to some strange place

100
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,282
and just come with me.

101
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,869
I'll pay for your beer
for the rest of your life.

102
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,246
All my old bosses
shut down their businesses

103
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,039
and ran away without even paying me.

104
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:42,253
I was left with nothing, but not a single
one of them was concerned about me.

105
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,675
But hearing her say I should come
with her and that she'd take care of me

106
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,511
made me feel weird.

107
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,890
I'm not sure if it's okay to go with her.

108
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,853
Anyway, Dongbaek has a knack
for making people uncomfortable.

109
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,865
I've started packing,
but I think I'll need more boxes.

110
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,242
Do you happen to have any empty boxes?

111
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,172
Hey.

112
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:27,882
Where are you going?

113
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,092
Here.

114
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,386
GRAIN POWDER

115
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,555
What are all these things in here?

116
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,390
There's nothing in it.

117
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,351
Just take them.

118
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,853
Safflower seeds are good for joints.

119
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,525
Dongbaek.

120
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,737
Pick up some empty boxes at my place, too.

121
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,241
Dongbaek!

122
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,124
Boxes for cabbages
are usually the biggest.

123
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,781
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT
FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS

124
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,950
Gosh, that fool.

125
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,869
Why is she always thanking people?

126
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,456
CAMELLIA

127
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,335
Ms. Kwak.

128
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,052
Why are you running away?
You should just confront things head-on.

129
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,321
Do you think nice people

130
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:17,658
will welcome you with open arms
if you move to a different town?

131
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,579
Everyone struggles and experiences
obstacles wherever they go.

132
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,458
You think so? I thought I was the only one
bombarded with obstacles.

133
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,586
If you keep running away,
it'll be a vicious cycle.

134
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,757
The one who holds out until the end
is the real winner.

135
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,678
You're saying you don't want me to leave,
aren't you?

136
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,805
Gosh, you frustrate me so much.

137
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,434
With your personality, how are you going
to settle down in a new place?

138
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,770
There won't be someone like me.

139
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:52,276
I have to say, I'm glad.
I've lived in Ongsan for six years,

140
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,947
and I'm glad that at least one person
is telling me not to leave.

141
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,035
Everyone's sad that you're leaving.

142
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,248
I was like everyone's punching bag here.

143
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,795
Everyone thought
they could walk all over me,

144
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,798
but you always treated me so respectfully,

145
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,966
and I thank you for that.

146
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,428
Thanks to you,

147
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,723
I enjoyed the six years here.

148
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,810
Gosh, I don't even want to hear it.

149
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,607
For some strange reason,
I always had this hunger.

150
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,320
But whenever you held my hand
while walking with me,

151
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,406
I felt so...

152
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:44,787
That emptiness strangely went away
whenever you did that.

153
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,333
I thought, "This is probably
what it feels like to have a mom."

154
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:53,129
Oh, dear. This is why young men and women
should never be left in a room together.

155
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,382
You two fell for each other so quickly
without any warning.

156
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,175
What was I supposed to do?

157
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,429
And now you're running away
after putting me through all that stress?

158
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,849
I'm burning inside because of you.

159
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,646
I stabbed you
in the back big-time, didn't I?

160
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,275
I'll do my best.

161
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,278
They say, "Out of sight, out of mind."

162
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,156
It won't be easy, but I'll do my best.

163
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,949
I'll forget him.

164
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,119
Then Yong-sik will also...

165
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,331
OK AESTHETIC

166
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,587
I need to catch Joker
in order to keep Dongbaek here.

167
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,425
I need to catch Joker
for Dongbaek to stay here.

168
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,598
I need to catch Joker
in order to stop Dongbaek from leaving.

169
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,768
OK AESTHETIC

170
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,236
ONGSAN POLICE THAT THE RESIDENTS
CAN TRUST AND RELY ON

171
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,571
COMPLAINT

172
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,406
Yeong-sim sent in a complaint.

173
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,326
She got irritable bowel syndrome

on my forehead.

Why...

192
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,554
This place has been empty for ages.

193
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,143

I'm sorry, but why are you offering

211
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,722
to loan me money with no collateral
or anyone to stand surety for me?

212
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:01,520
No, I'm just wondering...

213

You won't ask me for my liver

Okay, thank you.

217
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,996
Did they loan you already?

218
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,914
Why do you thank people all the time?

219
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:25,544
Gosh, rent deposits are always
well over ten million won.

220
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,131
Does that mean most people have
that kind of money?

Am I the only one who can't afford it?

222
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,678
Just ask Pil-gu's dad
for child-rearing expenses.

223
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,472
He makes 1.2 billion won a year.

224
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,059
It obviously runs in the blood.

225
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,062
He's Kang Jong-ryeol's son,
so he's good at baseball.

226
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,815
Don't tell anyone, okay?

I'm so happy I got a job here.

Dongbaek!

230
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:04,750
Well, I wanted to have
some ramyeon for brunch.

231
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,335
-I see, ramyeon.
-Yes.

232
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,587
Just move in together.

233
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,174
-What?
-Did you drink beer again?

234
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,301
Why do you keep talking nonsense all day?

235
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,388
Jong-ryeol! Don't forget that I'm Jessica.

236
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,599
I have to go to Milan no matter what,

237
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,935
so you have two options.

238
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:26,188
Send me there happily,
or pay alimony, and I'll use that to go.

Sang-mi.

240
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,860
-I'm not your mom.
-What?

241
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,363
You told Mother in high school
that you won't study

242
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,281
if she didn't pay for your nose job.

243
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:37,908
My gosh.

244
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,911
I got the surgery because I used to snore.

245
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,913
That was one of the reasons.

246
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:48,252
I'm sure your mom bought you stuff
when you threatened her,

247
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,755
but if you keep pulling the same tactic
on me, saying you'll divorce me...

248
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,554
If you make me
get sick and tired of you...

249
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,682
Then what? You'll divorce me?

250
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,894
Sure, go ahead. Do it.
Let's please get a divorce.

251
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,275
All right, let's do it.

252
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,994
You neither want to be my wife
nor a mother to my child,

253
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,872
so why should I cling onto you?

254
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,257
I love red-banded lobsters.

255
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,014
Well, Dongbaek.

256
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,851
Is there a specific area
you want to move to?

257
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,274
Not really.
I don't even know where I was born.

258
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,944
I don't care about anything else,

259
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,197
but I'd like somewhere with a window.

260
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,784
I guess the one up above

261
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,537
can't see me
because there's no window here.

262
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,915
I'd like some attention, too.

263
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,460
He burdened me with Joker
on top of everything.

264
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,588
He is watching over you.

265
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,050
I'm sure he has plans
to totally focus on you down the road.

266
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,387
No, I don't think so. He probably

267
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,141
forgot all about me when it was my turn.

268
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,648
Dongbaek, the one up there

269
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,151
is certainly not clumsy
when it comes to getting his job done.

270
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:40,781
I'm sure he's received
all the data by now.

271
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:44,243
He knows that it's now your turn
to get lucky.

272
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,538
Just wait and see.
A ton of good things will happen to you.

273
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,124
You really think so?

274
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,335
Yes, a hundred percent.

275
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,378
Let me sum it up.

276
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:59,883
You certainly deserve to be very happy.

277
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,221
You sound so trustworthy.

278
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,431
All right.

279
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,851
But you know what?

280
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,772
I already got pretty lucky.

281
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,651
This is my first time

282
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,989
eating a lobster
that someone peeled for me.

283
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,369
Gosh, you can't say
eating a lobster is being lucky.

284
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,706
I'm not talking about the lobster. Well...

285
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,792
Yong-sik, you were...

286
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:42,342
I can't even take out a loan, but you were
like a bonus that brightened my life.

287
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,474
My gosh.

288
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:56,273
I can see that hanging out with me
has made you quite eloquent.

289
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:04,114
You see, all you have to do

290
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:07,242
is stay on the right track.

291
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,704
You have a wonderful mother,
and you're kindhearted.

292
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,706
Plus, you're a civil servant.

293
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,542
You have one great life ahead of you,

294
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,962
so you should listen to your mom
and enjoy what life has to offer.

295
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,874
The red-banded lobster tells it all.

296
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,794
The ramyeon only cost 3,500 won,

297
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,671
but you put in
so many lobsters.

298
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,715
Why bother acting all tough?

299
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,468
I was trying to get rid of them.

300
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,970
Look at all these lobsters.

301
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,015
It tells me how we feel about each other.

302
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,937
Even if you move to Mara Island,

303
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,731
I'll visit you every day
to eat your stir-fried pork.

304
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:24,653
So stop talking nonsense, please.

305
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,989
You're the one that needs
to stop acting all tough.

306
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,660
Who knows?
Another Dongbaek might move in here.

307
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,245
Goodness.

308
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,082
Even if Lim Soo-jung moves here

309
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,501
and opens a dumpling place,
I won't fall for her.

310
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,259
So you're a fan
of Lim Soo-jung, after all.

311
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,678
You like her as much as dumplings.

312
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,929
I LOVE ONLY YOU

313
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,056
-No, I like you more.
-Whatever.

314
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,267
I'm crazy about you.

315
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,769
Go peel those lobsters for Lim Soo-jung.

316
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,113
Do you have to make it so obvious
that you're tired of me?

317
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,032
What now? Why are you here?

318
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,993
The abalones.

319
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,954
I wouldn't have come here otherwise.

320
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:22,169
Why did you have to make so much fuss
over giving me this?

321
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,629
-You'll open it now?
-I should put it in the fridge.

322
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,592
Hey, it's packed in a Styrofoam cooler.
I'm sure it functions well enough.

323
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,878
Anyway, those are expensive,
so don't sell them off and eat them.

324
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:05,795
Bye.

325
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,048
Those abalones are really expensive.

326
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,092
Yes, they're from Wando Island.

327
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,721
-Right, the famous Wando abalones.
-Yes, Wando.

328
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,224
Yes, Wando. Right.

329
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,976
It's worth 30 million won.

330
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,693
Can't you just take it?

331
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,865
Think about this in my shoes.

332
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:37,494
Even if your child has a great life,
you get concerned.

333
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,747
So it drives me insane
to see him live such a poor life.

334
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,875
Is your pride so important
that his dad means nothing?

335
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,419
Can't you just take it quietly?

336
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,630
I'll take it.

337
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,840
What?

338
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,887
I did your laundry, cleaned,
and fed you while I lived with you.

339
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,598
If I got paid for doing that,

340
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,143
I can probably take this money, right?

341
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,358
Right, you're rich,

342
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,486
and your house in Seoul is pretty big.

343
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,950
I guess it was practically a marriage.

344
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:23,456
And it costs a few hundred million won
to raise a kid,

345
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,459
but...

346
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:38,805
Hey.

347
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,436
My gosh.

348
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,980
Come on, why are you crying?

349
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:52,861
Why is this so humiliating?

350
00:26:55,864 --> 00:27:00,035
I want to slap your face with an envelope
full of money like in dramas.

351
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,246
You have a kid.
Stop talking about slapping people.

352
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:07,125
I want to act strong
and tell you that I don't need this.

353
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,335
But

354
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,962
a mom can't afford to have any pride.

355
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,007
I need to bring up my kid.

356
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,806
Hey, stop crying.
Don't you know that Candy song?

357
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,351
I don't care if I'm lonely or sad...

358
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,396
That brat.

359
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,107
Don't you think Candy is totally absurd?

360
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,693
Why won't she cry if she's lonely and sad?

361
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,570
She must be a psychopath.

362
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,328
Is every day her birthday?
You always bring her flowers.

363
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,249
I mean, come on.

364
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,878
I can bring her
these plants whenever I can.

365
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,755
It doesn't have to be a meaningful day.

366
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,883
It's not great timing
for you to bring flowers inside.

367
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,052
What?

368
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,388
You should let them talk it out.

369
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,516
She'll take what she deserves,
and resolve any unresolved business.

370
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,393
"Them"?

371
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,781
I'll pay you back.

372
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,743
Even if it's daily or quarterly,

373
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,371
I'll pay you back with interest.

374
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,124
You...

375
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,710
Do you seriously...

376
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,837
I couldn't help but get divorced earlier,

377
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,923
and now, I couldn't help
but express my heart.

378
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,593
Leave your bank account number
before you go.

379
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,847
Why do you make me
want to quit everything?

380
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,645
My life continues to flow spontaneously.

381
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,397
If I throw away everything I have,

382
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,775
baseball, TV ads, my titles,
and everything else,

383
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,444
then...

384
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,198
Don't. I won't take you back.

385
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,120
Take me back.

386
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,498
Please take me back.

387
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,611
Dongbaek.

388
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,154
Come here.

389
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,619
-Come here.
-Who do you think you are? Damn it.

390
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,536
Come here.

391
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,917
Where are you going?
I'll leave everything and come to you.

392
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,257
Think of Pil-gu.

393
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,842
Don't you know what's important?

394
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,518
Dongbaek.

395
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,313
Do whatever you want.

396
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,899
You aren't the type

397
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,403
who would let someone
drag your life around.

398
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,865
You always followed your own path.

399
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,868
So

400
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,162
you should

401
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,165
do whatever you want.

402
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,920
That's the Dongbaek I like,

403
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,922
care for,

404
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,050
and respect.

405
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:15,331
I'll figure everything out
as soon as possible. Give me...

406
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,500
a little bit of time--

407
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,544
-Let me...
-Yes?

408
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,379
go.

409
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,173
Or I'll seriously kill you.

410
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:39,355
Who could stop themselves
from loving that person?

411
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,111
CAMELLIA

412
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,037
I just need your number.
Don't be so uptight.

413
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,540
Let me just send you a couple of pictures.

414
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,668
Hey, I'm not in the mood
to talk to someone right now.

415
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,587
You can't always do what you want.

416
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,440
Your face looks so intense

417
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,817
that some might think
you're having an affair.

418
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,281
It looks like I'm just ordering.

419
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,535
Mr. Kang, so this is how you look
when you order stir-fried pork.

420
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,498
Or is it because you feel sour
about giving away abalones

421
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,832
that cost 30 million won?

422
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,011
What do you want?

423
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,305
What do you think? It's obvious.

424
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,976
Send those to Daspatch, then.

425
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,435
Send them everything.

426
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,982
You might be an expert who has been
through everything in your league,

427
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,527
but as you know, I'm not scared of
becoming top searched now.

428
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,988
You're one tough guy.

429
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,448
You should have known
who you're up against.

430
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,410
This could have worked
for some innocent old man,

431
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,162
but I have an agency, a legal team,
and advertisers

432
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,747
who pay me billions of won.

433
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,166
You have a lot of things.

434
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,670
Exactly. You can send them the pictures.

435
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,131
You can do your tough girl thing.

436
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,010
But since you have a lot of things,

437
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,220
you also have a lot to lose.

438
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:42,353
Let's see if your beloved law is faster
or if my mouth is faster.

439
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,023
Let's wait and see.

440
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,528
Don't be such a joke.

441
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,032
We all know how moths like you die
chasing after flames.

442
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,582
I found the moth after 27 hours.

443
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,793
One who has the 100ml eye cream.

444
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:10,339
The woman who went to Yangpyeong
and a motel with my husband.

445
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,096
I wanted to bite my tongue and die
when I thought it was Dongbaek.

446
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:21,350
And now, I just lost all my will to fight.

447
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:24,937
However,

448
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,696
I did have a certain urge.

449
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,878
If I end everything here,

450
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,256
will I be able to wipe the wall clean?

451
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,432
We renovated it before moving in.

452
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,539
You... What is all this, honey?

453
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:26,791
What?

454
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,795
What's wrong with...

455
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,756
I'm sorry. My hand slipped.

456
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,592
I almost got you killed.

457
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,653
What are you looking for?

458
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,530
Where did I put that?

459
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:02,285
Hey, you didn't steal things and stuff

460
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:06,706
while you worked as a housekeeper
for other families, did you?

461
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,877
Do people keep things like that
in a kid's room?

462
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:15,214
You should go.
I have to stop by somewhere today.

463
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,466
Where are you going this time?

464
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,052
Is she in her right mind or what?

465
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,347
You barely ate half of your meal.
Where are you going?

466
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,225
-Come on, have another bite.
-I'm not a kid.

467
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,227
Why can't I eat as much as I want?

468
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,521
What?

469
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,028
Dongbaek!

470
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,030
Dongbaek's son, Pil-gu.

471
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,450
Kang Pil-gu. Gosh, Pil-gu.

472
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,287
Man, Pil-gu.

473
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,456
Pil-gu with flowers

474
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,919
Congratulations on going to school today.

475
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,975
You carry my backpack, Mom.

476
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,395
-Okay.
-I can...

477
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,690
Why is he coming with us?

478
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,443
Why was he standing there?

479
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,655
Just let another guy
tag along on your morning route--

480
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,948
I don't want you to come.

481
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,950
What?

482
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:30,748
Gosh, Pil-gu.
You are one straightforward kid.

483
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,085
You'll become someone great.

484
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:38,047
Pil-gu, it'll be great for me
to be friends with a police officer.

485
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,176
That means
we'll have more people on our side.

486
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,012
And he's a government official.

487
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,014
-Exactly.
-I oppose this.

488
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,143
Why? Why does it have to be him?

489
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,312
Hey,

490
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,898
think about it.

491
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,985
When you have to make teams
by playing rock-scissors-paper,

492
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,654
who do you always choose first?

493
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,406
-Jun-gi.
-Why?

494
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,908
He's not that smart, but he's strong.

495
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,702
So you get how I feel, right?

496
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,041
Whatever. I still don't agree.

497
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,669
Once I turn nine,
I'll almost be a teenager.

498
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,506
And teenagers are the scariest.
Stronger than the police.

499
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,092
Then I can be on your side.

500
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,304
So you need to leave him out.

501
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:30,141
You brought him up
into such a smart little boy.

502
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,018
He's very smart.

503
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:38,274
I know he's my son, but I'm scared
to see him go through puberty.

504
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:49,618
You almost got ran over.
You need to keep your eyes open.

505
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:54,248
But still, how can you
grab my hair like that?

506
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,044
I'm sorry.

507
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,964
But it's not like I can hold your hand.

508
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:03,841
Why not?

509
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:08,220
I will never hold your hand, Dongbaek.

510
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:14,727
My instincts and reason
came to a major compromise on that one.

511
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,065
I even asked about it on the internet,

512
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:22,401
and I analyzed this personally as well.

513
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,321
Seeing someone
before having a relationship

514
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:30,743
is kind of like an internship,
before working as a regular employee.

515
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:36,332
Anyway, if someone you're just seeing

516
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,377
keeps trying to hold your hands first,

517
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,046
it would seem pretty cheap and rude.

518
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:46,217
And if I could add my own little reason,

519
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,679
if I treat my woman with respect,

520
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:54,683
other people won't treat her rudely,
isn't that right?

521
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,602
I'm not your woman.

522
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,355
That'll be my motto from now on.

523
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:05,528
I decided to treat you
with the utmost respect,

524
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,155
so that everyone in this town,

525
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:12,535
the men, the women,
the young and the old would know.

526
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:17,957
That's why I won't touch your hand.
Not even a single toe.

527
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,501
I came to that conclusion.

528
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,255
Why would we ever touch toes?

529
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,173
Goodness.

530
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,551
You're absurd.

531
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,387
I mean,

532
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,557
Dongbaek, if I imagine

533
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:38,727
that your hands are

534
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:43,107
chicken feet or cow's trotters,

535
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:46,152
it prevents me from feeling so desperate
to hold your hand.

536
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,242
Why would you think of my hands
as chicken feet or cow's trotters?

537
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,453
You're really weird.

538
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,917
Dongbaek, that's not what I meant.
It was just a figure of speech.

539
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,634
Let's go.

540
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,095
FAMOUS BASEBALL PLAYER K
HAS A MISTRESS

541
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:17,349
Let's see if your beloved law is faster
or if my mouth is faster.

542
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,642
Let's wait and see.

543
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,061
Hey, who's that K
that's mentioned in the tabloids?

544
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,981
Who knows? Some say
it's Kim Min-gi from the Raiders.

545
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,028
Kim Min-gi?
I knew he'd do something like this.

546
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,040
CAMELLIA

547
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:46,003
My gosh, where did Mom go?

548
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,465
I can't believe I'm relying on her.

549
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,134
How...

550
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,304
Gosh, that hurts. What was that for?

551
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,599
Do you think a thief broke in
or something?

552
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,061
Why did you have to hit me?

553
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,481
Keep your shoulders back.
You did nothing wrong.

554
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,566
Why do you look so intimidated?

555
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,864
You didn't go around
beating people up, did you?

556
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,118
Don't look so daunted. Just don't.

557
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,079
That's why you're a pushover.

558
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,583
Where does she go all the time?

559
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,884
Hello, this is Camellia.

560
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,889
Why are you calling me?

561
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:44,270
-A fire broke out in the school warehouse?
-Yes.

562
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,821
Someone put food here again.

563
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:56,073
There are a lot of cat lovers these days.

564
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,827
But you told me
no one lives in this alley.

565
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,289
Who keeps feeding the cats?

566
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:15,217
I have hands too, you know.
And you've never been this nice before.

567
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,762
I heard you're moving out.
Where are you planning to go?

568
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,056
That's none of your business.

569
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:29,023
It's not easy for me to say this to you.

570
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,568
But let me ask you something.

571
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,195
Why put my son through all this?

572
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:40,159
Why does he have to worry about money
and grow up sleeping at a bar?

573
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,746
Why did a fire break out
at Pil-gu's school of all places?

574
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,962
Do you smell paint thinner?
Seung-yeop smelled it.

575
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,425
-I have rhinitis.
-What? So do I.

576
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,844
-Darn it.
-Darn it.

577
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,679
We're just hopeless.

578
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,056
Damn it.

579
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,058
My gosh, seriously.

580
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,811
But aside from paint thinner,

581
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,230
I also found this here.

582
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:15,819
Gosh, I feel like
I've seen this somewhere.

583
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:21,825
By any chance,
do you think this was arson?

584
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:22,993
Arson?

585
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,748
Then it has to be one of three reasons.

586
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,501
An attempt to gain financial benefit.

587
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,961
An attempt to conceal a crime.

588
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:34,755
And...

589
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,842
-What?
-Resentment.

590
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,096
An attempt to take revenge.

591
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,601
My gosh.

592
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,521
There's no need to glare like that.

593
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,731
None of the three are applicable here.

594
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,902
No, there's one more.

595
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,571
It could've been an antisocial behavior.

596
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:03,033
The three most common traits
of psychopaths are arson,

597
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:06,412
animal abuse, and bed-wetting.

598
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,123
-Hey, Yong-sik.
-Yes?

599
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,170
Not all crime scenes

600
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,549
are like the scenes shown in CSI.

601
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,552
Not everything falls into place.

602
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,179
And good people don't always win.

603
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,308
The monsters in real life
are a lot harder to predict.

604
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,020
Sometimes, terrible things happen
for no specific reason.

605
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,775
It'd be hard for you to accept.

606
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,696
You've done enough.

607
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,323
Stop digging into this.

608
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,418
Tons of people dream of going there.

609
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,421
I found a school
where Pil-gu can play baseball.

610
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,465
And I'll pay for everything.

611
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,429
This is why

612
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,475
you shouldn't drink poison
even if you're dying of thirst.

613
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,478
-What?
-Now that you gave me 30 million won,

614
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,438
do you think you can control our lives?

615
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,069
Dongbaek.

616
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,198
As you know, no secret lasts forever.

617
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,950
Especially for guys like me.

618
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,288
I went to Macao and gambled just once.

619
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,290
And now, everyone calls me Macao Kang.

620
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,919
I met up with an idol star twice.
And now, I'm an idol seducer.

621
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,214
Once people find out that Pil-gu's my son,

622
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,009
he'll be known as my illegitimate son
for the rest of his life.

623
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:48,806
Stop caring so much about your pride,
and start caring about your kid.

624
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:51,225
That way, I'll be able to come up
with a plan--

625
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,518
Don't come up with a plan.

626
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,230
Pil-gu isn't your illegitimate son.
He's just my kid.

627
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,858
If you're so confident,
then why did you bring him up like this?

628
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,195
Why did you leave that day
in the first place?

629
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,326
If I didn't leave, do you think
we would've gotten married?

630
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,204
If you hadn't left,
I wouldn't have gotten that damn nickname.

631
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,623
My son didn't have to live
such a pitiful life.

632
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:17,501
And none of this crazy shit
would've happened.

633
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,965
My gosh, you just remember our breakup

634
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:27,553
as the day before your match
against Japan.

635
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,763
Imagine how flabbergasted
I must've been.

636
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:33,851
No wonder I zoned out and couldn't run
from second to third base.

637
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,061
Do you think I left willingly?

638
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:41,525
You were always implicitly
asking me to break up.

639
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,906
Kang Jong-ryeol hits a home run!

640
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,409
Back then, you only cared about yourself.

641
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,287
And the problem was
that I only cared about you as well.

642
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:54,788
Jong-ryeol!

643
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,793
When you hit a home run,
I was in your studio.

644
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,920
-This is nice.
-Yes.

645
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,381
And when you shot
that laundry machine advertisement

646
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,675
and appeared in Happy Together,

647
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,261
I was still in your studio.

648
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:14,099
You were always moving forward,
but I was always in the same spot.

649
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,353
And when your name became
the most searched word on the web,

650
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,355
I was still in your house.

651
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,982
I'm serious. Believe me.

652
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,818
She keeps saying she likes me,
but it's just a one-way thing.

653
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,820
She's a complete lunatic.

654
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,991
-Why did you go to Han River with her?
-People saw them together...

655
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,284
We weren't on a date.

656
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,453
I wanted to believe you.

657
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,538
We just dropped by and met up.

658
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,790
But even if it was true,
I don't mind it anymore

659
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,209
because that's just how young you were.

660
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:48,508
A hillbilly who only played baseball
got to have everything at the age of 24.

661
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:52,346
So it's natural that you were excited.
I just brushed it off that way.

662
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,602
But that day, it was hard for me
to just brush it off like that.

663
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:01,521
What's this?

664
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,565
Why do you have these?

665
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,776
PREGNANCY TEST KIT

666
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,280
I'm not pregnant.

667
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:13,992
Then take the test.

668
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,229
See? I'm not pregnant.

669
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,819
Did you freak out?

670
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:34,614
-What?
-You look so relieved.

671
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,993
No, that's not it.

672
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,080
I'm really busy
playing baseball right now.

673
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,791
And we should have a baby
when we're ready.

674
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,752
We'll never be ready.

675
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,378
What?

676
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,007
Ahn Jung-hwan got married when he was 26.

677
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,468
And Choo Shin-soo had a kid
when he was 22.

678
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,137
But they're more successful than you.

679
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:01,099
You know we're not in the situation
to have a baby.

680
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,895
Well, I guess so.

681
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,322
Maybe the situation isn't the problem.
Maybe it's just me.

682
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,950
Maybe I'm not

683
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,745
the right person for you.

684
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,042
I didn't leave so I could have Pil-gu.

685
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,843
I just left.

686
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:41,807
The 27-year-old Kang Jong-ryeol
would've said something bad.

687
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,520
And it felt like the baby would
end up hearing everything.

688
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,023
That just felt really wrong.

689
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,363
I went to the hospital,

690
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,323
and the baby was so tiny.

691
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,493
It looks like a gummy bear.

692
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,870
It was so tiny.

693
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,958
It was just so small.

694
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,461
I'll take that.

695
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:18,135
You're not getting the vitamin IV
after the surgery, right?

696
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:24,683
You'll leave right after
you wake up, right?

697
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:25,767
GRATEFUL TO HAVE YOU

698
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,149
Ma'am.

699
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,734
Ma'am?

700
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,111
GYNECOLOGY CLINIC

701
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,362
What's with her?

702
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,951
All right, you're not
taking the vitamin IV, then.

703
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,496
Why would you say it like that?

704
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,417
-Pardon?
-It was so small.

705
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,129
You talk as if this is a fast-food joint.

706
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:00,218
It's like you're telling me
to just have a burger and leave

707
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:03,096
because I can't afford to order a combo.

708
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,724
This is...

709
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,895
just too simple.

710
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,271
Excuse me.

711
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:15,775
It was so small.

712
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,361
You're really rude.

713
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,780
I don't like this hospital.

714
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,118
So I felt like I had no choice
but to protect it.

715
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,870
I'm not going to come back.

716
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:31,082
After all, I was the only person
who could protect this tiny baby.

717
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,296
What would you like?

718
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:46,181
I'll order two servings
of the most expensive menu here.

719
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,600
-Two servings.
-What?

720
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,562
So I just decided to protect him
twice as much.

721
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,498
The only child you have is your daughter.

722
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,252
And I gave birth to my own kid.
It had nothing to do with you.

723
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,379
I already saw him.

724
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,382
So how can I not care?

725
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,593
I can't stop worrying about Pil-gu.

726
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,388
It's driving me crazy.
What am I supposed to do?

727
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,181
Don't worry about him.

728
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:31,184
Don't even try to get into his life.

729
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,105
I'll give you back the 30 million won.

730
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,857
So don't act like you belong in our lives.

731
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,447
You're such a strong woman.

732
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,951
What made you change like this?

733
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,578
Was it that cop?

734
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,419
Once life started
becoming really difficult,

735
00:54:57,502 --> 00:55:00,171
I found myself
becoming totally emotionless.

736
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:05,343
But you still dream of loving someone
even after all of this?

737
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,973
Do you think you and that cop
will get to live happily ever after?

738
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,309
Why? Can't I do that?

739
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,853
I'm telling you not to confuse Pil-gu.

740
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:18,481
Why do you assume that I won't be
able to have a happy and normal life?

741
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:20,650
What?

742
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,737
Is it because you think
I'm just that unlucky?

743
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,573
Do you think I'll never be able
to live a happy life?

744
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,616
Do you think that's my fate?

745
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:31,786
Will you please just do as I say?
The situation isn't...

746
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:39,461
You might just think of me
as someone who's very unfortunate.

747
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,256
But Yong-sik told me that I'm someone

748
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:48,303
who fully deserves to be happy.

749
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,605
Dongbaek started to glow

750
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:04,736
just like how I did
back when Dongbaek was by my side.

751
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:12,827
Then what about Pil-gu?
Don't you care about him at all?

752
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,329
What's best for him is--

753
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:16,414
You want us to run away
just like before?

754
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,585
Things are really serious right now.

755
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:23,046
I'm going crazy thinking you both
might get hurt.

756
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:25,131
Can't you just do me a favor and run away?

757
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,758
You were never like this.

758
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,969
I always lowered myself
for the sake of others.

759
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:33,139
And I always preferred to run away
rather than to fight.

760
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:37,227
Why are you running away?
You should just confront things head-on.

761
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:40,146
Don't look so daunted. Just don't.

762
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,065
That's why you're a pushover.

763
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:46,736
You aren't the type who would let someone
drag your life around.

764
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:49,948
But now,

765
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:54,077
I'd rather be someone difficult
than be someone who's insignificant.

766
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:55,954
Jong-ryeol.

767
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,084
I'm starting to feel
grateful toward you

768
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:04,254
for showing up at just the right timing.

769
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:10,135
It seems like you always help me
come to my senses.

770
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:12,762
What?

771
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:16,015
Thanks to you,
I learned how to avoid the worst.

772
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,518
And I noticed
what a great person Yong-sik is.

773
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,898
But suddenly,
you want me to run away again?

774
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:30,363
Now that I'm in the same situation again,
I finally get it.

775
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,533
There's no exit for someone who runs away.

776
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:40,290
I won't ever run away again.
So you all really need to stop

777
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,333
being a joke.

778
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:07,400
My gosh, let's just have one more drink.

779
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:11,988
Sir!

780
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,657
You need to come to your senses!

781
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,076
I still talk quite politely when I fight.

782
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,620
Do you think I'm a pushover?

783
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,873
You should be careful
about who you mess with.

784
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:23,917
I'm sorry.

785
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,091
But I still try to confront things.

786
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:50,068
I wonder if Dongbaek is the one
who gives food to the cats.

787
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:57,700
Does cat food normally come out
in triangular shapes?

788
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:01,913
Yong-sik!

789
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:07,126
Why are you running around alone
at this late hour?

790
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,129
There are tons of drunk men outside.

791
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,507
You're making me get worried again.

792
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:17,345
Yong-sik, why does this
always happen to me?

793
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:20,014
Why is everyone always so mean to me?

794
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,517
I constantly thought about that.

795
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,562
-And I finally know the answer.
-What? What is it?

796
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:28,273
It's because I was a pushover.

797
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,443
-What?
-When you watch Animal Kingdom,

798
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:36,948
they're the ones that die.
The injured, babies, and scaredy-cats.

799
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:40,451
Scaredy-cats? Yes, right.

800
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:44,414
The lion secretly approaches the herd
hoping to catch at least one gazelle.

801
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:48,418
The herds notice that,
and they all freeze for a moment.

802
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:52,380
And that's when the most frightened one
starts running.

803
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:56,467
The lion instinctively goes after that one
and tears it into pieces.

804
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,220
Tears it into pieces?

805
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,264
Dongbaek keeps...

806
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:05,018
I was just a pushover.
That's why I was told not to be a joke.

807
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:10,356
People keep messing with my kid
because I was being such a pushover.

808
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:15,320
I'm not going to run away.
Why would I do that?

809
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,827
Dongbaek keeps getting stronger.

810
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,790
I will welcome everyone.

811
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,462
Just tell them to bring it on.

812
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,213
And this woman

813
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:38,760
makes me feel so...

814
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:43,348
My gosh, seriously! I adore you so much!

815
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:46,100
Why are you so adorable?

816
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:49,103
My gosh, you are just so...

817
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,198
This is all your fault.

818
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:02,867
What's my fault?

819
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,287
I mean, you kept hitting on me.

820
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,666
And you kept telling me that I'm pretty.

821
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:14,212
It's because you kept flattering me.
Gosh, what am I going to do?

822
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,175
Whatever. You can sue me if you want.

823
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,139
You did it first.

824
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,817
I LOVE ONLY YOU

825
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:41,406
CAMELLIA

826
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,670
This is really annoying.

827
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:08,933
Hello.

828
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:12,937
I'm back in business.
It won't shut down again.

829
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,147
Come on in.

830
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:56,939
A lighter?

831
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,276
Four fires broke out
before Joker murdered people.

832
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,529
I'm just going to live my life
however I want to.

833
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,741
It's not even someone in LA. Yes, Ongsan.

834
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:08,034
What is Ongsan?

835
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,368
What happened to your face?

836
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,621
And his surname might change
to Hwang soon.

837
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:12,580
Hey, fatty.

838
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,165
I don't like you, either.

839
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:16,584
Why do you keep talking to me? Why?

840
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:17,752
Pil-gu.

841
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:20,213
Will you stop meeting Pil-gu?

842
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:22,215
Why did it have to be Ongsan?

843
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:24,842
You waited for me, didn't you?
