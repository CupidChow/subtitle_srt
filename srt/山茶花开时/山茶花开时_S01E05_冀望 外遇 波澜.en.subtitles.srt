1
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,730
I promise

2
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,483
that I will never make you

3
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,194
or Pil-gu cry.

4
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,448
Yong-sik, you really should be careful.

5
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,743
What if I really end up

6
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,954
liking you?

7
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,764
-Well...
-Yes?

8
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,476
I guess you like dumplings.

9
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,770
Yes, Pil-gu likes them too.

10
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,147
And who doesn't like dumplings?

11
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,985
Then how about we go to Gaebu Island
next weekend to eat giant dumplings?

12
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,530
My gosh.

13
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,326
Why would we go all the way there
just to eat dumplings?

14
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,831
Well, it's not just for dumplings.

15
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,332
Then what for?

16
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,544
Goodness. There are
so many dumpling restaurants.

17
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,921
Why do we have to go to an island?

18
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,716
I hope you know that things like missing
the last ferry is too much of a clichÃ©.

19
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,427
You're hilarious. How uncool.

20
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,057
Dongbaek, they built a bridge
to Gaebu Island a decade ago.

21
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,687
Really?

22
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,357
Dongbaek, Gaebu Island

23
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,111
used to be an island
that was hard to get to, like you said.

24
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,739
But things have changed
since the bridge was built.

25
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,367
You can drive there now,
and some people even walk there.

26
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,969
Mom, are you close with him?
Why did he come all the way here with you?

27
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,848
Oh, I live in this neighborhood too.

28
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,559
-Where in this neighborhood?
-Over there.

29
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,936
Over there? Where?

30
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,440
Pil-gu, you should become a crime scene
investigator when you grow up.

31
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,858
Do you like my mom?

32
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,486
What?

33
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,366
If that's the case,
stop coming to our bar.

34
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,702
Why?

35
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,580
Don't you like me?

36
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,123
No, I don't.

37
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,922
Hey, you even asked me
to help your mom out

38
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,131
the other day, remember?

39
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,635
I hate all guys who like my mom.

40
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,138
-What?
-Mr. No Gyu-tae,

41
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,140
Jun-gi's dad,
and the rice cake shop owner.

42
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,560
They all talk casually to my mom,
saying they like her.

43
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,648
But they didn't even do anything
when Jun-gi's mom was pushing her.

44
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,817
That's what you guys mean
by "liking" someone.

45
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,489
Pil-gu, why are you growing up so fast?

46
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,658
He's so quick-witted. Goodness.

47
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,329
Pil-gu.

48
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:11,459
You see, that's not
how I feel about your mom.

49
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,088
-With me, it's different.
-It's all the same.

50
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,424
Mom, you told me

51
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,677
that Dad is tall and smart.

52
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,845
My dad is a renowned scholar.

53
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,306
He earned ten doctoral degrees in China.

54
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,810
Even my dad, who's a wonderful man,
liked my mom,

55
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,313
but he's doing fine all by himself
in China now.

56
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,276
I hate all the guys
who are interested in my mom.

57
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,247
CREDIT CARD STATEMENT

58
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,666
Do you plan to join
the national team or what?

59
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,379
How could you spend
five million won on Pilates?

60
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,882
My mom and I are going to take
the classes together.

61
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,426
Even if it's for two people,

62
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,928
spending five million won on Pilates
is just crazy.

63
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,974
Do you expect me to take group classes
with a bunch of other people?

64
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,934
I have to take private classes.

65
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,688
Because you're Jessica?

66
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,609
Right, Jessica can't take group classes.

67
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,863
Are you drunk?

68
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,823
Mother, you're still awake.

69
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,704
I wasn't going to say this to you,

70
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,956
but even a minister and a plastic surgeon

71
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,917
in Cheongdam-dong wanted Jessica
to be their daughter-in-law.

72
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,669
Yes, I know.

73
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,756
You bring it up every time we pass
Cheongdam Intersection.

74
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,091
Before she met you,
she was just a young naive girl

75
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,259
who did nothing but study.

76
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,846
You shouldn't dare to bring
your credit card statement here,

77
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,097
if you have any shame.

78
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,391
Mother, please hear me out.

79
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,936
There are people who can't go
to Qingdao because

80
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,646
they don't have 480,000 won.

81
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,649
-What? Qingdao?
-He probably had beer.

82
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,818
Just go home and sleep if you're drunk.

83
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,197
Apparently, Kang Jong-ryeol spends
five million won

84
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,657
on his wife's Pilates classes,

85
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,577
while someone

86
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,164
can't go to Qingdao

87
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,125
because he doesn't have 480,000 won.

88
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,169
It's...

89
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,882
It's really...

90
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,885
driving me nuts.

91
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,096
Yes.

92
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,099
After 300 meters, turn left.

93
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,855
Were you an athlete back in school?

94
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,732
Hey.

95
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,777
All I did was study.

96
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,072
I was in the regular college track class.

97
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:50,410
Exactly. I assumed you were a bookworm
back in school because you have

98
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,994
such an impressive vocabulary,

99
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,705
but how could you master wakeboarding
so quickly?

100
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,208
You're really amazing.

101
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,838
I'm just an ordinary man.

102
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,341
I thought you were going to
split the payment for that

103
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,093
into monthly installments,

104
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,846
but you paid the full amount at once.

105
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,432
I thought you were Chairman Jeong Mong-ju.

106
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,059
Hyang-mi.

107
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,896
Jeong Mong-ju is a scholar
from the Goryeo period.

108
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,691
If you run for governor,
I'll definitely vote for you.

109
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,110
You'll vote for me?

110
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,029
Why me?

111
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,198
Well...

112
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,243
-Does that mean you...
-Yes.

113
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,454
I respect you.

114
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,582
Hey.

115
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,918
Think of me as your mentor from now on.

116
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,796
I hope you can be comfortable around me.
Don't be intimidated.

117
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,798
I'm not intimidated by you.

118
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,842
Come on. We're close enough.

119
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,220
We are?

120
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,763
Pil-gu.

121
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,643
I don't know about anyone else,

122
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,147
but I won't do anything you don't like.

123
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,357
Stop coming to our bar.

124
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,985
And don't say hi to me at the arcade.

125
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,740
I remember going nuts trying so hard
to protect my mom when I was your age.

126
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,867
I know how hard

127
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,369
you're trying to protect your mom,

128
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,331
so why would I
deliberately worry and upset you?

129
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,708
Don't lie just to look good.

130
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,712
Why try to protect Ms. Kwak?
She doesn't need protection.

131
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,092
Well, anyway...

132
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,679
What I want to say is,

133
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,891
just get a good night's sleep.

134
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,062
You're at the age where you should be
eating, playing, and sleeping

135
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,105
as much as you want to,

136
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,441
so just sleep well.

137
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:51,197
I'll never ruin the fabulous life
of an eight-year-old boy.

138
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,617
You're out if I don't like you.

139
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,869
Yes, fully understood.

140
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,038
I'll just...

141
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,500
try to look good in my own way.

142
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,962
Bring the dumplings.

143
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,885
-I have to say, Pil-gu is--
-I'll take the dumplings.

144
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:13,928
Sure.

145
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:15,888
-Bye.
-Bye.

146
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,741
Hyang-mi, do you like trout?

147
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,498
Both the mom and the son...

148
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,379
They really bug me.

149
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,595
Both the mom and the son are so adorable.

150
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,769
A WISH, AN AFFAIR, AND TURMOIL

151
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,510
There's nothing here. What was he doing?

152
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,558
Only my closest friends know
about that trout place.

153
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,144
I don't just take anyone
to that restaurant.

154
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,356
In other words,
I'm one of your closest friends now.

155
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,734
Only a select few people
know about that restaurant.

156
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,237
When you have some time,
let's take your friends and--

157
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,489
-Gyu-tae.
-Yes?

158
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,659
Will I become the First Lady of Ongsan
when you get elected?

159
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,245
What?

160
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,331
We're seeing each other, aren't we?

161
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,750
-What?
-Can't you hear me?

162
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,669
This is our first day as a couple.

163
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,047
We're dating as of today,

164
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,841
which means
I'll be the First Lady of Ongsan.

165
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,695
My goodness.
Hyang-mi, you have a great sense of humor.

166
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,031
I wasn't trying to be funny.

167
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,368
Do you take girls to Yangpyeong
when you're not even dating?

168
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,994
All the way to Yangpyeong?

169
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,002
Damn it. What's wrong with this now?

170
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,720
As usual,

171
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,014
the sun rose.

172
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,450
That bastard didn't come home last night.

173
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,871
And I can no longer be
the Hong Ja-yeong I was yesterday.

174
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,083
CREDIT CARD STATEMENT

175
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,673
YANGPYEONG WATER SKIING
YANGPYEONG WATERSPORTS

176
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,688
Well...

177
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,400
Let's hang out from time to time

178
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,653
as friends who respect each other.

179
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,489
And...

180
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,328
About us going water skiing together
today, let's just leave it at that.

181
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,997
So we water-skied together,
but it's not an affair.

182
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,000
We went to Yangpyeong together,
but we're not dating.

183
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,837
Gyu-tae,
crooks can't be elected as governor.

184
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:22,384
Why are you always so aggressive?
This is too sudden.

185
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,303
Shall I call you Ms. Aggressive?

186
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,515
We spent the whole night together.
Why are you saying it's sudden?

187
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,560
That's because the car broke down.
Why are you making it sound weird?

188
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,897
As for water skiing, it's a sport.

189
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,066
It's just a fitness-improving sport.

190
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,860
Then you should've brought your wife.
Why bring me instead?

191
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,028
It's because we're dating.

192
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:47,201
Why are you rushing to conclusions?

193
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,412
As you know, I'm...

194
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,540
What? You're married? What about it?

195
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,166
What do you mean?

196
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,963
Why? Are you worried that people
will bash us for having an affair?

197
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,258
That people will call you an asshole
for cheating on your wife?

198
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:07,304
You know what, though?
This world isn't always such a just place.

199
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,017
Did I step on a landmine?

200
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,819
Even if we had known,
we couldn't have told you,

201
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,737
fully knowing how upset you'd be.

202
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,824
Yong-sik has been practically living
at Camellia

203
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,702
since moving back.

204
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:33,914
Maybe Dongbaek gave him
some peanuts on the house.

205
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:34,874
Yes, totally.

206
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,669
Are you ladies having fun?
Do you find this entertaining?

207
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,882
Gosh, don't get me wrong.
I just meant that

208
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,676
-you shouldn't be lying down like this.
-That's right.

209
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,178
You need to take action

210
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,806
before they do something
that can't be undone.

211
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,894
Tell him that it's going to be
the death of you.

212
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,854
Goodness, that's so petty.

213
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,481
I'd rather beat him up.
Why would I do such a thing?

214
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,900
You can't be like that!

215
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,110
You should demand, "Is it Dongbaek or me?

216
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,779
-You must choose one."
-Yes, you should.

217
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,325
You definitely can't win after they do it.

218
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,703
"Do it"? Just leave already!

219
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:19,793
If we can find evidence like
saliva or fingerprints...

220
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,130
Why don't we see
if we can lift such evidence from...

221
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,344
-In CSI: Miami--
-Are we in Miami?

222
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,640
Why don't you transfer to Miami
if you like that place that much?

223
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:38,145
Why can't you ask them for cooperation?

224
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,357
What do I tell them
when I'm handing this over to them?

225
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,193
Is this for a specific case?
Is this from a crime scene?

226
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:49,031
You see, I found this.

227
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,784
But it's piquing my curiosity.

228
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,620
Does forensics exist
to satisfy your curiosity?

229
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,539
There's nothing in that alley,
not a single restaurant.

230
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,377
But I saw some prick drinking this
and standing there for quite some time.

231
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:06,173
I also saw his footprints
all over the ground...

232
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,467
Stop picking up empty bottles, and just--

233
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,469
No way!
I'm not going to Yeong-sim's place.

234
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,555
KARAOKE ROOM MURDER CASE FILE
JOKER'S FIRST CASE

235

236
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,437
Go through these.
They're case files on Joker.

237
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:22,856
What?

238
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,401
You're sharing these with me now?

239
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,915
Is it good?

240
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,045
Gosh, you scared me.

241
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,965
You didn't go to work?

242
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,510
Are you enjoying
the cod head stew that my mom made?

243
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,264
Yes.

244
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:59,977
Is she a cod head stew master or what?

245
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,438
Even when your mother comes by
three times a week,

246
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,773
I make five side dishes
and soup for her every time.

247
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,609
My mom visits us
less than three times a year,

248
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,446
and you had to go to a funeral
on one of those days?

249
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:16,410
Even so, my mom brought
cod head stew, which you love,

250
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,288
as well as mustard green kimchi.

251
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:23,000
And your friend's wife just happened
to die on that day, right?

252
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,128
You see, liver cancer is scary.

253
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,380
Colon cancer.
You said she died from colon cancer.

254
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,757
Right, colon cancer.

255
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,510
That's why his wife suddenly...

256
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,846
-Well... My friend's...
-Seok-geun.

257
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,015
Yes. That's why
Seok-geun's wife died on the spot.

258
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,853
He's such a blockhead,
and I used to find it charming.

259
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,855
COLLEGE PREP ACADEMY, 2001

260
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,273
-Come here.
-Jeez, seriously.

261
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,068
Gosh, I mean it. It was
those agricultural high school kids.

262
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,613
I was going to pay the class fees,
but those punks took all the money.

263
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,365
-I'm sure it's the other way around.
-How can I take their money?

264
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,117
How can I do such a thing?

265
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,828
They're all gangsters.
How can I take their money?

266
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,539
You just said they were high school kids!

267
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,544
You moron. You can't even dupe anyone
because you're so dumb.

268
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,422
You should've just bought me
the Motorola phone I asked for.

269
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,384
Gosh, you're driving me up the wall.

270
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,677
Everyone is looking at us.

271
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,222
-You little...
-Unlike me, who never reveals anything,

272
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,975
Gyu-tae is so easy to read.
And I found that refreshing.

273
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:27,022
-But the thing is...
-It was nice to see everyone.

274
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,732
Those guys we went to the academy with.

275
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,068
-He can't even hide an affair.
-It's all useless, though.

276
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,529
Her sudden death made me feel
that life is so futile.

277
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:38,117
We should watch shows like
Mysteries of the Human Body often.

278
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,211
You went to the funeral at night.

279
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,755
Why did you put on so much sunscreen?

280
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,510
-What?
-What did you do with your sunglasses on?

281
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,098
-What?
-Did you wear sunglasses to the funeral?

282
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,396
Even the Bible says

283
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,859
stolen water is sweet,
and bread eaten in secret tastes better.

284
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,070
But if you get addicted to that taste,

285
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,659
you may turn into cod head stew yourself
in the fiery pits of hell.

-Dongbaek.
-Yes?

297
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,643
You and Officer Hwang are like
Brangelina of Ongsan.

298
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,186
You're the talk of the town now.

299

I don't even know
how I can face Ms. Kwak now.

300
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,943
Come on. You're interested in him, too.

301
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,362
Hey, what are you talking about?

302
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,407
Why do you keep looking at your watch?

303
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,327
Are you worried
because Yong-sik isn't here yet?

304
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,039
Are you excited about something?

305
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,458
Let me see. How many cigarette butts
did you throw away?

306
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:55,254
Don't you worry.
Who listens to their moms these days?

307
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,714
Couples breaking up
because of their parents

308
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,466
isn't realistic even in soap operas.

309
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,635
Why? I'd break up.

310
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:05,055
Only when it happens to you can you
realize how nasty and disgusting it is.

311
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,060
Pil-gu's dad?
Is that why you two broke up?

312
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,480
Why are you so curious about Pil-gu's dad?

313
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,400
Dongbaek, I say this to you all the time.

314
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,069
I'm the perfect person
to share your secrets with.

315
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,321
I don't think, and my memory sucks.

316
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,323
Just vent it all out on me.

317
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,034
There's nothing to vent about.

318
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,205
I'm just going to think that shit happens.

319
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,294
There's no such thing as a good breakup.

320
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,838
All breakups are nasty.

321
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,673
That was a nasty breakup indeed.

322
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,843
Really? You?

323
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,596
Did I love him too much?

324
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,808
I couldn't really be understanding
and forgiving with him,

325
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,810
unlike how I've always been.

326
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:58,317
I've never felt welcomed anywhere
since I was very little,

327
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,111
so I got used to just accepting it
and being understanding.

328
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,197
Hey, let's play together.

329
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,617
You don't have to pay
for the milk program.

330
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:12,706
My classmates and their parents
didn't like me because I was an orphan.

331
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,082
-Mom!
-Mom!

332
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:18,045
They avoided the gloomy kid that I was
as if I had a contagious disease.

333
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,839
A-reum! I'll give you a ride.

334
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,342
-Come on.
-Hurry!

335
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:28,138
They all pitied me,
saying "You poor thing,"

336
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,516
but no one let me into their cars.

337
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,942
Then I met him when I was 22.

338
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,986
And he became my whole universe.

339
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,073
Come on. Where are you going?

340
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,575
-Let go.
-Let me explain!

341
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,786
I guess you don't love me anymore.

342
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,664
Let's just break up, then.

343
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:58,293
I was consumed by the kind of love that
you can only experience when you're 22.

344
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,669
Why are you being like this?

345
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,716
The game suddenly started going so well.
That's what happened.

346
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,221
Hey, why are you crying?

347
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,389
I'll...

348
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,350
I'll never suggest going
to an internet cafe again.

349
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,561
I promise you

350
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,272
that I'll never play

351
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,900
StarCraft again when I'm with you.

352
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:27,072
So don't say things like that.
I can't live without you.

353
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,491
Hey, do you think I can live without you?

354
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,701
Gosh...

355
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,207
Don't cry.

356
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,501
I couldn't see anything else but him,

357
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,337
so I forgot about the fact
that he, too, had a mother,

358
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,839
just like everyone else did.

359
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,592
2010, DONGBAEK AT THE AGE OF 25

360
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,434
Gosh, I've had enough of thinking.

361
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,895
I have no money to give you.

362
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,941
And I can't even talk elegantly.

363
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,067
I just...

364
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:05,735
hate you so much.

365
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:10,740
I really mean it.
I hate you with every cell in my body.

366
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:15,120
How can I put up with you
when I hate you this much?

367
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,251
Are you smiling or crying?

368
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,879
Why do you have such a sad face?

369
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:29,259
Why did it have to be Jong-ryeol? Why?

370
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,598
To me,

371
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,434
you're like...

372
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,481
What did she say?

373
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,692
Is it because you're an orphan?
Did she swear at you? Did she hit you?

374
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,198
It's really heartbreaking to be hated,
especially by your mom.

375
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,075
Hey, come on.
I can totally win against her.

376
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,246
It's tough to be hated
by the mom of someone you like.

377
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,249
I can't just accept it coolly.

378
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,921
It's not like I don't have a mom
because I didn't want one.

379
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:10,008
Exactly. So tell me what she said.
Will you just tell me?

380
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,720
To me,

381
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,556
you're like...

382
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,892
You know,

383
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,353
like

384
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,648
a lump of germs.

385
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,318
A lump of germs.

386
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,488
I'm like a lump of germs to her.

387
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,412
It's weird

388
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:42,541
how I kept thinking of my mom
when I was with your mom.

389
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,045
If I had a mom,
would she have had my back?

390
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,300
So what? You left him
after his mom told you off?

391
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,803
No.

392
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,640
In the end, the guy has to step up.

393
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,725
The guy must have had an affair.

394
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,144
What a jerk.

395
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,273
You don't have to call him a jerk.

396
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,485
I don't even blame him or anything.

397
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:14,030
I think we can call it even

398
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,658
since he left Pil-gu behind with me.

399
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,827
Can you really call that even?

400
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,912
Do you like Pil-gu that much?

401
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,081
Try having a kid.

402
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,834
CAMELLIA

403
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,172
If your mom or my mom was like you,

404
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,884
then both Dongbaek and Hyang-mi

405
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,054
wouldn't be sitting here
looking for cigarette butts.

406
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,230
Chief Byeon.

407
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,154
What?

408
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,952
Is the conflict between
a mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law

409
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:05,415
quite troublesome?

410
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,668
Don't get worried about running
when you can't even walk.

411
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,421
You don't even have a girlfriend.
Why do you ask?

412
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:16,217
Well, I thought it would be better
to date someone who's close with my mom.

413
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,054
That's idealistic.

414
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,725
If there wasn't any conflict between
a mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law,

415
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,728
men's average life expectancy
would reach 90 years.

416
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,440
They did say they're best friends.

417
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,652
But there is no family
without such a conflict.

418
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,741
If there is such a family, they must live
in a virtual city, a paradise,

419
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:43,453
or maybe somewhere far away

420
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,247
that's like a traditional fairy tale.

421
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,460
Aren't you going to eat?

422
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,340
It's because of her, isn't it?

423
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,343
What? Who?

424
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,427
Who do you think?

425
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,018
You just looked at Helena, didn't you?
I have a great hunch.

426
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,691
Chief Byeon, I like Dongbaek.

427
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,820
-What?
-I fell for her at first sight.

428
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,988
I've been after her ten times a day.

429
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,990
And the entire neighborhood knows.

430
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,327
Does your mom know?

431
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,083
-Mom!
-She does know.

432
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,169
That's why she used her elbow.

433
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,258
ONGSAN DRY CLEANING

434
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,389
I wanted to hide

435
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,225
this feeling that hurts my pride.

436
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,687
Hey, what are you doing?

437
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,480
I'm late. I have to hurry.

438
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,613
But at this point,

439
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,283
I can't continue to act sophisticated.

440
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,874
CUSTOMER NAME: CAMELLIA,
ONGSAN DRY CLEANING

441
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,960
Her daughter-in-law made
a feast for her birthday.

442
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,505
She made all nine delicacies
and the royal hot pot herself.

443
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,090
Isn't that amazing?

444
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,592
-Mother.
-Yes?

445
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,552
I'm not in the mood to make

446
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,512
nine delicacies for your birthday.

447
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,766
-What?
-I'll talk to my husband

448
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:28,892
and find a buffet or--

449
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:32,228
Why do I have to care about how you feel
on my birthday?

450
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,689
Of course.

451
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,609
The mother-in-law's birthday isn't
important at all.

452
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,694
The daughter-in-law's mood
is more important.

453
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,280
Mother, my husband...

454
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,865
Sure, it's my son again.

455
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,367
I'm sure he wanted to just go to
a buffet, not you.

456
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,660
It's not that, it's...

457
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,456
Never mind.

458
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,833
What is it?

459
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,294
Why do you stop
in the middle of a sentence?

460
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,508
Hey, are you making fun of me?

461
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,385
I'll roughly let you know

462
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,971
why I don't feel like
making all those delicacies.

463
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,724
Why would you just tell me that roughly?

464
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,810
Is this some kind of a joke?

465
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,524
He takes after his father.

466
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:23,488
He was about Gyu-tae's age now
when he gave your ring to Ae-sil,

467
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,949
the girl at the pub, right?

468
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,618
What is this nonsense?

469
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,161
Gyu-tae takes after me!

470
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,414
I'm just saying.

471
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,004
-Can you walk the rest from over there?
-Why should I walk?

472
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,424
People in my calligraphy class always
see you drop me off.

473
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,552
I have to be somewhere in a hurry.

474
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,054
Where?

475
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:49,806
The hair salon.

476
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,933
I'm going to the hair salon.

477
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,201
She's a good person.

478
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,664
You know her. You're her best friend.

479
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,003
I mean, she's so nice

480
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,505
and lives a heartrending life.

481
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:27,594
And I feel really bad for her.

482
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,430
What about me?

483
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,390
Don't you feel bad for your mom?

484
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:36,561
It's not a competition to see
who has a worse life.

485
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:40,315
I really didn't want to say this
because it makes me look awful,

486
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:44,652
but is it your mom or Dongbaek?

487
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,114
-What's this nonsense?
-You have to choose one.

488
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,741
Come on, that's so cheap.

489
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:53,453
You're the one who's being cheap,
you darned little jerk.

490
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:57,290
Wait, let's not use bad words.
We can talk this out.

491
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,251
Don't you know that

492
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:04,130
I gave birth to you after your father died
and worked all my life to bring you up?

493
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,216
Do you know how much settlement money
I paid every single season?

494
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,969
And I went to a Buddhist temple
and bowed 3,000 times

495
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:14,390
over and over. I lost all
of my knee cartilages because of that.

496
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,434
If you have a conscience,

497
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:20,104
you of all people can't do this to me.

498
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,192
You said Dongbaek is nice, pretty,

499
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,111
-and that she's your best friend.
-She is nice.

500
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,489
She's a poor thing, and she's pretty.

501
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,951
But at the very least,

502
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,454
she shouldn't have a son, should she?

503
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,416
Am I asking for too much right now?

504
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:46,339
Mom, think of this
as buy one get one free.

505
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,342
You can get a daughter-in-law
and a grandson at once.

506
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,804
Goodness. Why did you have to be
crushing garlic right now?

507
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,308
I'm not going to blame her.

508
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,812
I don't want to go over to Camellia
to say something to her.

509
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,605
I understand that

510
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,525
Dongbaek has no feelings for you,
but you're obsessed with her.

511
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,194
I'm just going to focus on you.

512
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:12,031
So you and I have to come to a decision.

513
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,700
Make your choice!

514
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,120
I mean... Well, I...

515
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,709
I can't choose one as if I'm
choosing what food I like.

516
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,210
BAEKDU MARINATED CRAB

517
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,421
Okay, fine. Half-and-half.

518
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,757
Don't be ridiculous. That's not an option.

519
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,301
I like her so much. What can I do?

520
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,597
I want to see her as soon as I wake up.

521
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,517
I want to run over
to see her right now, too.

522
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:45,064
My feet are the magnetic north pole,
and Camellia is the south pole.

523
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,317
Does that analogy make some sense?

524
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,902
What a load of bullshit.

525
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,863
Do I need to kick some sense into you?

526
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,367
I can't stop my feelings for her
and my feet taking me there.

527
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:01,831
Then you can stop seeing her
for just two months.

528
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,250
If you still feel the same after that,

529
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,253
I will extenuate your actions.

530
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,383
Do you think my love will only last
for a couple of months?

531
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,844
It'll last forever!

532
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,977
Should we get started?

533
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:26,230
No, I want the director.

534
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,192
Ma'am.

535
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,237
You have to make an appointment
two weeks ahead to see her.

536
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,573
Our chief is really good, too.

537
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,409
She worked in the Hongdae area
for three years.

538
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,746
I'm sure you're great.

539
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,332
But I'm going to go meet

540
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,543
the woman my husband's been seeing
after doing my hair.

541
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,837
Goodness.

542
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,007
Director. Director?

543
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,598
Rod number three.

544
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:01,933
No.

545
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,520
Everyone has a limit
that they must defend.

546
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,439
My limit is my pride.

547
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,899
I'll use the best products.

548
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:12,193
I don't want to care
about someone like Dongbaek.

549
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,947
I wanted to ignore her
with all that I have.

550
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:26,207
What brings you here?
I thought you never stop by the building.

551
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:32,296
CAMELLIA

552
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,094
Do you want some young radish?

553
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,972
She smiles well, too.

554
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,223
Do you have no makeup on?

555
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:46,936
Oh, I got a little busy,
so I stopped in the middle.

556
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,729
You think you're pretty, don't you?

557
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,065
-Pardon?
-Well,

558
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,192
I just thought you would think so.

559
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,866
Well, I don't think I'm pretty.

560
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:03,953
But I do think that I'm not too awful
when it comes to my physiognomy.

561
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,872
Goodness, this is embarrassing.

562
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,499
I'm not here to talk about
your physiognomy.

563
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,752
Legally speaking,
I just have to tell you a month before,

564
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,463
but I thought I should tell you
a little more in advance.

565
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,426
-What is it?
-Our contract expires in December.

566
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,928
-Yes.
-I need you to move out.

567
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,433
Pardon? Move out? So suddenly?

568
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,893
"Suddenly"? This isn't sudden.

569
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,854
The Lease Protection Act doesn't apply.
You have three months.

570
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:44,035
Ms. Hong, if this is because
you wish to raise the rent,

571
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,828
we can talk about it--

572
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,997
No, I'm not going to raise the rent.

573
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,209
It's a shop without any windows,
so once you move out,

574
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,461
it'll just be used to
store dried seafood again.

575
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,839
Then I'll probably only get
a quarter of what I get from you.

576
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,092
Then why are you asking me to...

577
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,971
Money isn't the problem here.
Do I have to spell it out?

578
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:11,312
You probably get what I mean,
so let's not talk about this anymore.

579
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,274
Then go ahead and do what you were doing.

580
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,161
Gyu-tae is going to
want to go to Yangpyeong.

581
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,545
Ms. Hong.

582
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:45,554
Ms. Hong, Mr. No didn't say anything,

583
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,973
so I wasn't prepared.

584
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,768
And he didn't say anything
the last time I met him.

585
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,770
-He didn't--
-How dare you?

586
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,482
Are you using my husband
as your shield in front of me?

587
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,362
It's not like that.

588
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,155
Dongbaek.

589
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,658
I want to be sophisticated to the end.

590
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,037
But if you keep provoking me
and I end up losing it,

591
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,707
I'd want to be straightforward with you.

592
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,585
Then it'll make
both of us look very awful.

593
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,339
So you need to be careful.

594
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,722
I don't like your skin,
the way you talk, and your physiognomy,

595
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,099
but that face is the worst.

596
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,185
I hate that face which says,
"I don't know a thing."

597
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:40,151
Do you get what I'm trying to tell you?

598
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,795
Dongbaek!

599
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,883
What's wrong? What is it?

600
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,760
Why do you look like a sad cow again?

601
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:09,013
I stole a bag of red pepper powder
because I heard you're making kimchi.

602
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,349
Why do you look so sad again?

603
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,810
I think I got on my landlord's bad side.

604
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,480
What?

605
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,613
LET'S READ TOGETHER,
SHARING AND REUSING CAMPAIGN

606
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:40,002
Darn it, why are there so many people?

607
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,174
Why isn't she coming to pick him up?

608
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,600
Why did she let someone like her
look after her son?

609
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,061
Darn it.

610
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,612
Do you read?

611
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,073
I was just told to take it.

612
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,076
-Where's Mom?
-We made kimchi today.

613
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,829
Then is Mom there alone?

614
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,206
Did that policeman come today?

615
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,208
Why? You don't like him?

616
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,794
I don't. Do you like him?

617
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,297
I don't know. I'm not really sure
which side I'll take.

618
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:29,093
But that policeman is
the fourth guy I hate.

619
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,554
-The fourth?
-He comes after

620
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,849
Mr. No Gyu-tae, Jun-gi's dad,
and the guy from the rice cake shop.

621
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,143
Then that means you like him best.

622
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,270
Why is my mom 48 kg?

623
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,897
-What?
-Why is my mom so pretty?

624
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,025
She's the prettiest mom in Ongsan.

625
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,486
It really exhausts me.

626
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:51,323
You're starting to make me want a son.

627
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,493
Let's go.

628
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,712
Doesn't she have a car?

629
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,006
I might as well just get her one.

630
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,800
Pil-gu, should we ride a car
since it's hot?

631
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,261
What car? Do you have a car?

632
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,596
We'll just hitchhike.

633
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,810
Kang Jong-ryeol!

634
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,689
Is she seriously nuts?

635
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,616
Yong-sik, what did your mother say?

636
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,910
Is it okay to give this back to her?

637
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,914
Is that my mom's?

638
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,625
Just leave it here.

639
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,753
I'll take it when I leave
and give it back to her.

640
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,507
I guess I shouldn't go.

641
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:54,386
My mom likes you.
You guys are best friends.

642
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,396
Pil-gu and your mother
are both against this.

643
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,525
So stop being so stubborn,

644
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,527
and stop liking me.

645
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,823
I do kind of feel like

646
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,245
I should be more careful about how I act

647
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,665
for about two to three months.

648
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:27,253
I'm not an adolescent kid, you see.
If I totally ignore what my mom says,

649
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:31,924
I don't think it'll do you any good
in the future.

650
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,718
So I'll make a strategic retreat...

651
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,973
You really don't need
to explain everything to me.

652
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,183
What?

653
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:45,563
There's one thing I learned
ever since I was really young.

654
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:50,192
No one likes Dongbaek.
Who in the world would like me?

655
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,946
I like you.

656
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,783
No, it's not like we actually dated.

657
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:02,246
And even I wouldn't be happy
if Pil-gu fell for a woman like me.

658
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:08,002
But I'm really used to this,
so I'm totally fine with it.

659
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,672
I'll just let it go like I always did.

660
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:17,011
You always remind me of a Whac-A-Mole.

661
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,930
You're always smiling,

662
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,767
but you're always hurting as well.

663
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,396
You have no idea
how much it frustrates me.

664
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,192
You should listen to your mother.

665
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:37,406
No one else in this world
cares about you more than she does.

666
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,577
So stop acting like an adolescent
and act like an adult.

667
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:44,747
Don't come here again.

668
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,508
Does the air conditioner work properly?
Is it nice and cool?

669
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,304
Shouldn't you be training?

670
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,139
-What?
-Why do you come every day?

671
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,101
Maybe he has
something more important to do.

672
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,729
Hey, why are you going through my car?

673
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,231
By the way, the landlord
told us to move out.

674
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,776
-Really?
-Don't worry.

675
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,277
Your mom has a lot of connections.

676
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,405
If you have enough money,
just buy the building for her.

677
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,574
-You earn a lot of money.
-What?

678
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,952
Why would I buy her that building?

679
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,247
Should we talk about why?

680
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,504
I'm so glad I'm friends with Dongbaek.

681
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,507
Why did you have to sit
in the passenger seat?

682
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,176
Mr. Kang, I follow Jessica on Instagram.

683
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,638
-So?
-Ask her to follow me, too.

684
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,973
We might meet each other often
from now on.

got a speeding ticket.

OK AESTHETIC MURDER CASE
WITNESS STATEMENT

693
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,601
You told me you love her.

694
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,562
I can't stop love.

695
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,607
You're going to tell me everything now?

696
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:39,611
Don't handle things too impatiently
and end up causing trouble.

697
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,657
This is related to the protection
of the witness you fell in love with,

698
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,119
-so make sure you handle this calmly.
-Why are there so many files?

699
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,163
Start with this one.

700
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,999
There's a video?

701
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,625
It's a video of the victim, Han Geum-ok,

702
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,003
right before she got murdered
on the day of the incident.

703
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:59,423
What? Why is there a video of the victim
in the witness file?

704
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,428
-Dongbaek's in the video.
-What?

705
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:08,348
It's from the morning of the incident,
so start investigating with this.

706
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,268
I'm sure Joker is somewhere in here.

707
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,571
I met her at church.

708
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,032
-I mean...
-Today's reading.

00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,496

Get a certificate in skincare.

715
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,422
Then change the signboard
to "Camellia Aesthetics."

716
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,758
You'll become a person
with a professional career.

Are you sure
you're doing practical training?

720
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,232
Am I being used as a guinea pig?

721
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:01,652
I know it's second-hand,
but it cost me a million won. Don't worry.

722
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:05,113
I feel like you're using me
to test the second-hand machine.

723
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:11,995
Is this okay?

724
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,500
Just a second.

725
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,336
-Hello?
-The door looks weird.

726
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,712
A reservation?

727
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,675
Can you come right away?
We're free at the moment.

728
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,134
Do I just close this?

729
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,720
No, no one's here.

Isn't it hot to wear a mask
during the summer?

738
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,425
Did you call earlier
to make a reservation?

The seven minutes...

741
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,928
Why did she blast up the volume?

742
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,099
I was with him during those seven minutes.

743
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,813
And during those seven minutes...

744
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,286
Geum-ok died.

745
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,079
Is it a customer?

746
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,874
The sound I can't forget...

747
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:52,883
OK AESTHETIC

748
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,525
I think this is done.

749
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,196
That hoarse cough...

750
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,396
-Hey.
-Yes, sir?

751
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,441
No need to go through the customer list.

752
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,610
It obviously looks like

753
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,696
it was his first time here.

754
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,459
Would you have known

755
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,712
that there'd be someone in here?

756
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,884
Even I don't know what this is.
He probably didn't know, either.

757
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,140
Why would he have made a mess
of the entire place

758
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,350
after having murdered
the victim over there?

759
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:30,188
It's because he failed to find Dongbaek.

760
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,694
She should've just stayed still.

761
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,744
Geum-ok, the door...

762
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:47,873
Geum-ok.

763
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,210
What's wrong with this?

764
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,046
Geum-ok, I'm all done.

765
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,673
Geum-ok.

766
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,009
I think it's over now.

767
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,387
Geum-ok.

Geum-ok.

771
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,904
I think you should fix this. It's weird.

772
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:26,244
Geum-ok, the door's really weird.

773
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:34,628
The sound of his cough.

774
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,882
His cough was persistent,
and it seemed uncontrollable.

775
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:42,552
I still can't forget that peculiar cough.

776
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,608
My gosh!

777
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,899
PLEASE STOP BEING A JOKE...

778
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,360
It's obvious that Joker was startled.

779
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:44,823
This woman must've caught him off guard.

780
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,955
She always seemed so misfortunate.

781
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,999
-Do you remember anything?
-How do you feel?

782
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,584
-How did she survive?
-Hey, keep everyone in order!

783
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,340
Isn't she the owner of the bar?

784
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,885
-Dongbaek?
-Yes, that's her.

785
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,221
-You're right.
-What in the world happened?

786
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,523
Detective, I can't take this.

787
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:22,360
I really can't live like this.

788
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,947
A news reporter dropped by earlier,

789
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:29,284
and a fortune teller even offered
to perform an exorcism for me

790
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,618
to get rid of my bad luck.

791
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,455
But you see,

792
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,749
I really...

793
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,669
didn't see anything.

794
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,339
So there's nothing to tell.

795
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,800
I just saw him from behind.

796
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,222
Just leave me out of this.

797
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,433
You can catch him without my help.

798
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:58,063
Dongbaek, then let me ask you
one more thing.

799
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,359
Did the fire sprinkler really turn on

800
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,236
right when he stood in front of you?

801
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,697
He didn't turn it on
to get rid of any evidence?

802
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:10,658
He really ran away
because it turned on all of a sudden?

803
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:12,869
Is that what happened?

804
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:18,875
When the guy was standing in front of me,

805
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:24,130
I heard the fire alarm go off
along with the fire sprinkler.

806
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,675
-And I think someone knocked on the door.
-The door?

807
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:33,014
Yes, but I'm really not sure.
Everything happened all of a sudden.

808
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:38,937
But he was definitely
standing right in front of me.

809
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,691
The fire sprinkler

810
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,318
saved your life.

811
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,529
What?

812
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,490
But why did it go off
at that exact moment?

813
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,869
Is that kind of coincidence even possible?

814

OK AESTHETIC MURDER CASE
WITNESS STATEMENT

816
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:02,001
Dongbaek managed to live
thanks to whatever luck she had back then.

817
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,003
But I'm worried about her.

818
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:09,676
The entire neighborhood knew the witness.
So there's no way Joker didn't find out.

819
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,805
So the great Joker
stopped murdering people

820
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,473
after he met Dongbaek?

821
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:21,354
Who knows if he stopped
or if he's just taking a break?

822
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,200
Anxiety needs to be exterminated.

823
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:38,163
We should find the root,
beat it into a pulp,

824
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,665
and burn it to ashes.

825
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,208
What's wrong with your eyes?

826
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,254
I'm not going to leave something uncertain
like luck to protect Dongbaek.

827
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:47,380
Stop glaring like that.

828
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,549
Chief.

829
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,177
I'm going to catch Joker.

830
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:56,514
I'll catch him and let him know
that he messed with the wrong person.

831
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,649
-Hey!
-My gosh, you startled me.

832
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,277
Why did you jaywalk? You're a cop.

833
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,738
Mom, what brings you here?

834
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,407
I'm here to file a report.

835
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,743
-A report for what?
-A thief broke into our house.

836
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:17,827
What?

837
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,747
Someone stole an entire bag
of red pepper powder.

838
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:24,834
I'm going to take a look
at the security footage

839
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,170
-and catch that son of a--
-Mom.

840
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,089
-I took it.
-What?

841
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,841
I took it and gave it to Dongbaek.

842
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,386
-Mom.
-Hey.

843
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,847
I should file a report.
I won't forgive you.

844
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,140
Mom, listen to me.

845
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,684
You see...

846
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:45,522
Gosh, I'm too embarrassed
to say this to you.

847
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,773
Then don't say it.

848
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:51,277
I can't do what you asked
and stay away from her for two months.

849
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,570
I can't do that!

850
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,740
Gosh, Mom.

851
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,992
Mom, stop... My gosh.

852
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:05,708
Mom, you can beat me all you want,
but I won't change my mind.

853
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,044
You can think of me as an immature kid

854
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,296
and hire some guys to beat me into a pulp,

855
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,007
but that's still not going to stop me
from liking Dongbaek.

856
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,720
Are you saying you're going to choose her

857
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,557
over your own mother
who raised you for 30 years?

858
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:27,313
Mom, I know what you mean.
I know you raised me for 30 years.

859
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,108
But if I don't protect Dongbaek,

860
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,152
I'll regret it for the next 30 years.

861
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:37,240
Why are you glaring like that again?

862
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,993
Mom, I really mean it.

863
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:43,162
I'm really sorry to say this.

864
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:47,125
But you always let me do what I wanted
for the past 30 years.

865
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,545
So let me do what I want again
just this once!

866
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:56,467
What am I going to do with that darn punk?

867
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,553
CAMELLIA

868
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,897
I almost fell for him.

869
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,969
I wonder if she got home safely.

870
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:50,516
My life's been like cotton candy,
unlike how it usually is.

871
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,185
I can't believe you admitted that.

872
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,062
It's all over now.

873
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:57,231
I'm just not that good of a person.

874
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:00,026
I promise that nothing will happen.
You don't need to worry.

875
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,236
-Dongbaek.
-Don't come here again.

876
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:05,448
Gyu-tae!

877
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:08,910
If you want to take me somewhere,
how about a motel?

878
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,245
Should I just kill them all?

879
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,956
-I caught someone last night.
-Who?

880
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,125
-Why aren't you finishing your sentence?
-Let me go.

881
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,877
-I told you not to hold her hand.
-Yong-sik.
