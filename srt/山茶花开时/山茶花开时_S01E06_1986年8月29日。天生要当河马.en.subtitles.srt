1
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,602
The victim is a man with a strong physique
who seems to be in his 30s.

2
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,938
As you can see in this security footage,

3
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,398
he seems to have been attacked
on his way home. The police...

4
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,487
Pil-gu.

5
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,783
Starting today, I don't want you
to eat anything at Ms. Kwak's restaurant.

6
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:02,497
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable at the moment.

7
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,332
Please leave a message after the tone.

8
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,751
Gosh, that scared me.

9
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,381
His phone is off. I can't believe
he didn't come home last night.

10
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,924
My goodness.

11
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,677
Why?

12
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,637
Even Ms. Kwak isn't on our side now?

13
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,350
It's always been just us two.

14
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,983
1986.08.29. BORN TO BE A HIPPO

15
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,861
-Hello, Ms. Kwak.
-Hello.

16
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,779
CAMELLIA

17
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,617
She's probably taking him to school.

18
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,578
What was I thinking?

19
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,954
Hello!

20
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,124
Hi, Pil-gu. Are you going to work?

21
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,294
-No, I'm going to school.
-Right.

22
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,088
-I can say hello, right?
-Yes.

23
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,934
You fucking bitch.

24
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,312
I'll track you down before the month ends.

25
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,939
No one has gotten away
with taking my money.

26
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,482
FROM ASSHOLE

27
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,318
FUCK YOU

28
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,822
I need to save up 100 million won
to flee to Copenhagen.

29
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:29,000
ONGSAN MUDFLAT FESTIVAL

30
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,086
I bought burgers for everyone here,

31
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,297
but I can't even get a photo
with the governor?

32
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,218
Do you think
I got all those burgers for free?

33
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:42,472
What the hell. Who brought him?

34
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,599
Isn't he the Ongsan masu salmon guy?

35
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,601
-I went to so many stores to find them.
-Okay.

36
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,645
-Goodness.
-What will you use the photo for?

37
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,813
I just want to post it
on my social media page.

38
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,483
It's okay. I'll do it.
Let's take a picture together.

39
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,109
My gosh. Thank you, sir.

40
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,362
Thank you so much, sir.

41
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,533
-All right.
-Gyu-tae!

42
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,453
Gyu-tae.

43
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,081
Gyu-tae!

44
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,375
Gyu-tae!

45
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,378
Sir, since you came all the way to Ongsan,

46
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,296
-you must try some masu salmon.
-Gyu-tae!

47
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,633
-Gyu-tae!
-There's a restaurant that only I know of.

48
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,051
-Gosh.
-We should go that way.

49
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,636
-Why are you pushing me?
-Gyu-tae!

50
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,305
Gyu-tae, didn't you hear me?

51
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,349
No, I didn't.

52
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,936
I came to that island for a smoke
and ran over when I saw you.

53
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,646
It's so nice to see you outside.

54
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,607
"Outside"?

55
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,318
Then is she your wife or something?

56
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,988
-My goodness. No, of course not.
-I will be.

57
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,450
-Sorry?
-I will be in the future.

58
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,916
MS. KWAK

59
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,794
I have to give you
the young radishes, too.

60
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:58,464
Also, I ordered a lot of dried persimmons

61
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,174
so that I can split them with you.

62
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,804
We also need to split the facial masks
I ordered from the shopping channel.

63
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,890
How are you going to take all these?

64
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,600
Hey.

65
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,186
Are you not going to see me again?

66
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,276
I want to help you carry these,

67
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,946
but I don't know if you're okay
with me going to your restaurant.

68
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,035
This is ridiculous,

69
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,495
isn't it?

70
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,125
Is he a cop or a drunkard?

71
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,295
Hey!

72
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,255
You punk!

73
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,300
Why are you sleeping here?

74
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,847
-I shouldn't have fallen asleep.
-Did you drink?

75
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,435
No, I didn't.
I caught someone last night...

76
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,438
I mean, I brought someone here.

77
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,731
Who?

78
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,525
Where is this person?

79
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,737
Over there.
I let her sleep in the night-duty room.

80
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,113
Who?

81
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,990
I don't know who she is.

82
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,742
You let someone you don't even know

83
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,120
-sleep in that room?
-No, I mean...

84
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,957
I feel like I know her, but...

85
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,962
You moron. You can't get drunk
and bring some stranger here.

86
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,048
That's called abduction!

87
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,550
Jeez, I didn't abduct her!

88
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,114
Do you know her?

89
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,324
Who...

90
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,953
She seems familiar.

91
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,830
See? I told you.

92
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,623
Well...

93
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,865
I have to say, she looks very familiar
for some odd reason.

94
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,950
Maybe she lives in the area.

95
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,869
Ma'am.

96
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,288
Where do you live?

97
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,498
Chief.

98
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,295
She hasn't said a word since yesterday.

99
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,174
Does she have a cell phone?
Did you find one in her purse?

100
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,638
It doesn't work,
and there's nothing on the phone.

101
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,515
Oh, on her wrist...

102
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,271
Don't people with dementia wear this?

103
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,107
-Yes, that's right.
-Have you tried calling this number?

104
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,234
Yes. I called all night, but no answer.

105
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,862
It is an Ongsan phone number, but it's...

106
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,823
When did my phone die?
Can you charge it for me?

107
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,369
Anyway, I tried scanning her fingerprints,
but the scanner couldn't read anything.

108
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,872
What?

109
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,542
Her fingerprints have been worn off
completely. They're unreadable.

110
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:22,793
My goodness.

111
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,634
But why is this here?

112
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,262
What?

113
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,057
CAMELLIA

114
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,187
It's ridiculous for me to bring it up.

115
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,482
But at the same time,
I feel like I should say something.

116
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,903
If you're uncomfortable,
we don't have to talk about it.

117
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,533
I know what you want to tell me.

118
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,952
And I understand everything.

119
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:01,207
People can be so cruel, don't you think?

120
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,961
I promise that nothing will happen.
You don't need to worry.

121
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,297
Dongbaek.

122
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,050
I'm just not that good of a person.

123
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,137
I have no interest
in turning my life around.

124
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,390
I already have my hands tied with Pil-gu.

125
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,184
I never said
you shouldn't turn your life around.

126
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,146
You should. Find a man who's
a much better catch than Yong-sik is.

127
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,982
Why can't you just...

128
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,116
Right.

129
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,368
I know it's not easy.

130
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,538
I can't believe I'm doing this to you

131
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,374
when I fully know what it's like

132
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,501
to be in your situation.

133
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,556
I wished I'd had a mother like you.

134
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,110
Excuse me for a second.

135
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,864
Hello?

136
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,866
Hello, Chief.

137
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,535
Who?

138
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,708
I heard a name I had forgotten
for 27 years.

139
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,840
27 YEARS AGO

140
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,394
I wish she had abandoned me
when I was younger.

141
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,190
Being abandoned at the age of seven
was much more terrible.

142
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,360
When anyone asks your name,
just say that you're Dongbaek.

143
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,904
Say you're seven,
and your name is Dongbaek.

144
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,491
From my mom's name, face, voice, and smell

145
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,078
to everything she said to me
the moment she was abandoning me,

146
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,663
I was old enough to remember it all.

147
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,790
If anyone asks you
what your mom's name is,

148
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,209
just say that you don't know. Okay?

149
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,461
Do it for me as a favor.

150
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,589
"A favor"? Seriously?

151
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,800
That favor was too cruel

152
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,510
for a seven-year-old to handle.

153
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,729
And I'm going to continue
to do exactly what she told me to do.

154
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,820
I don't recognize the name at all.

155
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,618
And I want to abandon Mom also,
at least once in my life.

156
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,455
I don't know that woman.

157
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,214
Mom's smiling.

158
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,966
It baffles me.

159
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,054
I thought she looked familiar.

160
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,765
Her smile looks just like Dongbaek's.

161
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,359
My gosh.

162
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,840
JO JEONG-SUK

163
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,521
I don't know what year she was born
because I was too young.

164
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,817
But this name, Jeong-suk...

165
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,903
Yes, this is her name.

166
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,698
Everyone called her Jeong-suk.

167
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,159
Gosh, I can't stand Jeong-suk.

168
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,578
That bitch, Jeong-suk, didn't pay me back.

169
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:11,957
Well, I'll try to find her guardian first.

170
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,627
Maybe someone sent her here,

171
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,713
or maybe she came here on her own
when she was able to--

172
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,674
She couldn't have come here voluntarily
if she has a conscience.

173
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,637
Dongbaek, why don't we step out and...

174
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,847
Stop drinking this.

175
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,601
Even now, just seeing it
makes me want to barf.

176
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,195
Why would you smoke here?

177
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,822
This is a blue belt zone.

178
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,033
Smoking isn't allowed anywhere nowadays.
Where can I smoke?

179
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,368
Smoke at home.

180
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,954
Stop wandering around town
and just smoke at home.

181
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,206
-You see...
-What?

182
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,042
You've got to watch out
because I'm a single woman

183
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,378
-who doesn't even have a home.
-What are you talking about?

184
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,297
If you want to take me somewhere,

185
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,841
how about a motel?

186
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,437
I leave the bar at eight o'clock
and wander around all day.

187
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,231
Then I go back when it's open again

188
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,692
to start my shift,
and it's really exhausting.

189
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,031
How could you spend
your entire rent deposit?

190
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,325
You're practically homeless now.

191
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,705
Can't you pay for a whole week?

192
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,833
Sleeping on the couch at the bar
is killing my back.

193
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,422
Am I your sugar daddy or what?

194
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,799
-Cut the nonsense.
-The governor.

195
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,636
You said he's here for two more days.

196
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,016
I don't care about my back.
I just want you to feel at ease.

197
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,771
She'll stay for two days.

198
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,233
MOTEL CHUNGDAE

199
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,573
Do you want to come in for some noodles?

200
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,867
No way. Those noodles might kill me.

201
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,760
I guess you've been doing well.

202
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,721
You look good even though you've aged.

203
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,306
You've put on some weight, too.

204
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,938
How could you gain weight?

205
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:43,525
You abandoned your child and lived
27 years without knowing how she's doing.

206
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,818
I really don't get it.

207
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,739
Had you looked like you struggled a lot,

208
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,492
I could've cut you some slack.

209
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,288
Gosh.

210
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,625
You just have to make me feel
so pathetic, don't you?

211
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,381
SHRIMP BURGER

212
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,304
Mom.

213
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,139
You see,

214
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,394
I struggled a lot thanks to you.

215
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,189
I was bullied in school
for being an orphan.

216
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,275
I'm all grown up now,
but everyone dislikes me

217
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,611
because I grew up without parents.

218
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,033
Thanks to you, I've lived
as a cursed bitch my whole life,

219
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,161
but I tried to understand you.

220
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,956
I thought you had to do it
for some reason.

221
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,297
But you know what? Last summer,

222
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,843
I lost my grip on Pil-gu's hand
at this terminal for just ten minutes.

223
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,388
It was during the heatwave,
but I found myself shivering like crazy.

224
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,351
Now that I'm a mom myself,

225
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,148
I really...

226
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,818
I really can't forgive you.

227
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,790
You're heartless, Mom.

228
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,626
So just go, wherever that may be.

229
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,505
I don't want to hear from you
even when you're dying.

230
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,599
Sweetheart.

231
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,812
You look so pretty now.

232
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,901
You look like a lady
who is dearly loved by her man.

233
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,653
Your face is all rosy.

234
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,455
She came back alone.

235
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,084
Alone?

236
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,461
Did she go somewhere?

237
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,172
I don't know. She's been working nonstop
without saying a word.

238
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,765
Hold on.
Don't you smell something burning?

239
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,063
Dongbaek!

240
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,108
Gosh, Dongbaek.

241
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,861
Goodness. You had the stove on.
Why are you all spaced out?

242
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,822
Didn't you smell it burning?

243
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,283
Let me see. Did you get a burn?

244
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,701
Let me see.

245
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,745
My gosh.

246
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,540
What am I going to do if you die?
I won't be able to live.

247
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,708
The living all go on with their lives.

248
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,172
I got my revenge.

249
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,424
What?

250
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,969
I abandoned my mom today.

251
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:04,393
ONGSAN TO SEOUL
EXPRESS BUS

252
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:22,119
-Come here. This way.
-Where?

253
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,121
See? I wasn't lying.

254
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,500
She wouldn't talk at all.

255
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,670
Let's just call the police.

256
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,841
Are you done with these?

257
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,718
Shall I clean them up for you?

258
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,428
Ma'am.

259
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,556
The last bus already left.

260
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,475
You'll get arrested if you sleep here.

261
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,478
My goodness. Say something, please.

262
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,315
Ma'am, are you mute?

263
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,817
-Say something, please.
-Mom, can't you talk?

264
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,905
Why aren't you answering?

265
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,178
Everyone here loves to gossip about me.

266
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,849
Now, they have something else
to gossip about.

267
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,607
CRIME OF PASSION, NO PROGRESS
ON INVESTIGATION WITHOUT A BODY

268
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,385
Why did you run out in such a hurry?

269
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,304
I'm not in a hurry.
I just finished my shower.

270
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,558
Gyu-tae!

271
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,061
Gosh, Gyu-tae!

272
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,524
This is just a group chat.

273
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,944
They want to organize
a neighborhood meeting.

274
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,570
-I didn't ask.
-What?

275
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,659
Right, you didn't.

276
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,035
FROM HYANG-MI

277
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,544
It's our first photo together.

278
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,213
What's wrong?

279
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,134
Another friend's wife died?

280
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,357
Should I just kill them all?

281
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,363
Gosh, it's not like
I can actually kill her.

282
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,782
Jeez.

283
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,803
Damn it.

284
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,352
What is this about?

285
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,147
Gyu-tae, do you know what my dream is?

286
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,815
I never asked you about your dream.

287
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,152
-My dream is moving to Copenhagen.
-What the hell are you talking about?

288
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,072
Hey, stop talking nonsense and--

289
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,824
I want to move to Copenhagen,
where no one knows me,

290
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,826
and start afresh.

291
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,621
Go live there.
No one's going to stop you, so just leave.

292
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,414
-But I don't have 100 million won.
-What?

293
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,583
I need 100 million won to move there.

294
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,299
Why are you saying this to me?

295
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,135
Are you blackmailing me now?

296
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,763
No, I never asked you
to give me 100 million won. I know

297
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,265
I wouldn't be able to get
that kind of money from you.

298
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,975
You can't say a word
in front of your wife.

299
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,270
-I can.
-Well, I've noticed

300
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,981
that you like to make donations
and take photos afterwards.

301
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,316
So why not think

302
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,277
you took this photo
before making a donation?

303
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,533
Gyu-tae, I don't have parents,
and I'm homeless.

304
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,909
I need help.

305
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,536
CLOSED TEMPORARILY

306
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,996
She didn't close the bar
even when Joker was acting up.

307
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,665
CAMELLIA

308
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,584
-Have you tried calling her?
-She's not picking up.

309
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,920
She hasn't even stepped out.

310
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,133
Dongbaek, you have to eat well.

311
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,635
You should beat Hye-ran
and start school next year.

312
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,387
Who is Hye-ran?

313
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,557
Our landlord's daughter who always hit me.

314
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,937
Mom's acting like she's stuck
in the time when I was seven,

315
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,814
but it's all a lie.

316
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,526
Mom, what's with you?

317
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,738
You've never done these things for me.

318
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,325
Have you ever put a side dish on my spoon?

319
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,829
Why are you putting on such an act?

320
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,957
Are you doing
what you never got to do or what?

321
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,460
Look.

322
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,753
Please let the two of us eat in peace.

323
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,098
I'm serious. My dad saw it, too.

324
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,268
The shutters were closed,
but the lights were on.

325
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,813
Was it Hyang-mi, then?
Why didn't you try going in?

326
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,482
It's scary.

327
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,942
We can deal with a thief,
but what if it was a ghost?

328
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,861
But your dad was with you.

329
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,529
I guess dads are useless.

330
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:53,158
Hey, but if my dad tried his hardest,
he could win against my mom.

331
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,785
He's so strong
that he can put me on his shoulders.

332
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,204
And I'm 42 kg.

333
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,372
I don't even want to ride
on someone's shoulders.

334
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,917
Pil-gu!

335
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,220
Hey, Pil-gu!

336
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,514
Did you eat breakfast?
Did you eat with your mom?

337
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,973
What did you eat?

338
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,687
What's wrong? Did I surprise you?

339
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,232
Pil-gu, I guess you've never
done that before.

340
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,401
Did I lose brownie points again?

341
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:30,904
It was fun.

342
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,657
Can you do that for me, too?

343
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,369
-You?
-Go ask your dad.

344
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,871
Me. Do that for me again.

345
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,541
Again?

346
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,191
It took me just a week

347
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,902
to find out
what she had been doing all along.

348
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,454
Excuse me.

349
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,708
Ma'am, I'm going to go home now.

350
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,252
Why do you keep calling me "ma'am"?

351
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,761
Excuse me, ma'am.

352
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,472
What?

353
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,850
What do you want?

354
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,102
Go home, okay?

355
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,775
Excuse me.

356
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,611
Excuse me, ma'am.

357
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,697
What now?

358
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:11,212
Should I clean the bathroom
with chlorine bleach tomorrow?

359
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:18,303
Did you work for other families
after abandoning your own kid?

360
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,516
-It's 23,000 won.
-It didn't matter if she had

361
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,935
a great life or a bad life.
It was still irritating.

362
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:31,024
BE PROSPEROUS! KANG JONG-RYEOL

363
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,030
Why do you want this building?

364
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,993
You never know.
The backyard might be an oilfield.

365
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,873
The building isn't for sale,

366
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,417
but it's offered for a lease.

367
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,044
-Camellia?
-Dongbaek is moving out?

368
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,547
Moving out? She's getting kicked out.

369
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,342
She has nowhere to go
with that deposit money.

370
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,553
That's why she has been
closed for five days.

371
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,389
Have you been counting the days?

372
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,641
-Goodness.
-Can you call her?

373
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,352
-The landlord?
-No, the tenant.

374
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,937
The tenant? Why?

375
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,441
I need to know
if the tenant is alive or dead

376
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,653
to go take a look around the place.

377
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,365
Yes, the landlord
did put it out for a lease.

378
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,449
Well...

379
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,077
I'll give you a call again.

380
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:25,745
Okay.

381
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,890
I knew it. I'm getting unlucky
because that day is coming up.

382
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,027
Do you have a golden toad or something?

383
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,386
Take it. I'll give it to you.

384
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,894
You can buy a house with that.

385
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,732
I wasn't touched.
It suddenly brought me back to reality.

386
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,072
Mom, this is all you have
for your daughter at your age?

387
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,200
This one slipped out.

388
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,952
Or you can buy a car.

389
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,291
Mom, you know what?

390
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,002
I'm never going to end up like you.

391
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,592
Ms. Kwak, you need to make sure
you keep your eyes on Yong-sik.

392
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,969
Yong-sik might end up

393
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,555
taking care of his mother-in-law
at this rate.

394
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:12,060
Goodness, Dongbaek's life is
filled with misfortune.

395
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,854
She grew up as an orphan,
had a kid without the father,

396
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,650
and now she has to look after
her mom who has dementia.

397
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,695
No matter what life throws at her,
it can't win against her.

398
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,156
She's one hard-working girl.

399
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,493
Even if you lock her up in a room
without any opening,

400
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,412
she'll find a way to find the light.

401
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,429
You won't get paid more
because you're family.

402
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,224
You'll also get 8,500 won per hour.

403
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,020
PSYCHOPATHS IN EVERYDAY LIFE

404
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,648
THREE MOST COMMON TRAITS OF PSYCHOPATHS

405
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:02,694
You've been watching
those profilers on TV, haven't you?

406
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,362
Goodness.

407
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,448
Those are people who got their doctorates.

408
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,243
Even if you study those books
with pink highlighters,

409
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,828
you can't be like them.

410
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,248
It doesn't matter
if they got their doctorates.

411
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,375
I'm more desperate to catch Joker.

412
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,961
Where there's a will, there's a way.

413
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,213
My will is enough to get me a doctorate.

414
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,300
What kind of absurd reasoning is that?

415
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,845
Go visit Camellia. It's open.

416
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,930
What?

417
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,900
You have such a tough life.

418
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,446
My life's been like cotton candy recently,
unlike how it usually is.

419
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,824
But when my mom showed up,

420
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,076
I snapped back into reality.

421
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,495
This is what my life is really like.

422
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,165
I'm going to do my best
to sell stir-fried pork.

423
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,001
Yong-sik did move your heart a little,
didn't he?

424
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,545
If a guy likes me that much
and my heart doesn't move,

425
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,963
I would be a psychopath.

426
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,174
I can't believe you admitted that.

427
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,802
It's all over now.

428
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,890
-I'm not going to hang out with him.
-Why did you suddenly get so determined?

429
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,226
I don't want to let Yong-sik be a part
of my horrifying life.

430
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,021
An orphan, a single mother,

431
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,733
and now a mom with dementia.
How can I do that to him?

432
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,278
I'm just going to let him off.

433
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,950
He's a bit too cute
to let him get involved in all this.

434
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:34,911
Isn't he?

435
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,583
Come on!

436
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,920
Seriously! I mean, seriously! Come on!

437
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,507
What's with him?

438
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:52,261
I thought I was going to die
because I missed you so much!

439
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,805
I missed you so much!

440
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,225
Dongbaek!

441
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,478
Let's go out for a smoke.

442
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:07,443
Wait, Mom. Why are you following her?

443
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,196
ADULT DIAPERS

444
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,864
I just got this and that.

445
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:16,911
Oh, I got these just in case.

446
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:22,041
I can't believe you found out already.

447
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,294
You know about my kid's dad
and my mom with dementia.

448
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,422
Why do I always get caught?

449
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,677
I don't care about this at all.

450
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,054
Of course, you do.

451
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,306
You probably thought,
"Gosh, that was close!"

452
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,100
You probably thought,

453
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,687
"I'm so glad I didn't get caught
in this minefield."

454
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,191
If you're going to talk nonsense,
go peel some garlic instead.

455
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,740
Well, I'm annoyed with you anyway.

456
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,535
I didn't do anything. Why are you annoyed?

457
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,246
Because it's embarrassing.

458
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:03,499
Don't you think it's uncomfortable to know
that someone knows my worst?

459
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:07,045
Even I have some pride.

460
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,633
I've been looking into

461
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,220
resident registrations and
medical records of women around her age.

462
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,306
Yong-sik, do you think
what I say is a joke?

463
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,143
-I'm saying that I hate you.
-Even if you do, I can't help it.

464
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,230
If you're sitting in a minefield,

465
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,818
that's all the more reason
not to leave you alone.

466
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,368
POLICE

467
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:52,632
If I ever date someone again,

468
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,425
I just...

469
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,844
I want to start fresh.

470
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,557
I want to be with someone
who doesn't know anything about my past.

471
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:05,103
I want to pretend I received lots of love
and didn't go through any hardship.

472
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:08,272
I want to act all innocent and naive
in a relationship.

473
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:14,070
So I can't be with you.
You're the last person I'd meet.

474
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,279
The last.

475
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,617
Do you really have to say it like that?

476
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,455
I'll always be a pitiful woman
in your eyes.

477
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:30,336
Your heart will break
even if I sigh a little.

478
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,172
And I'll feel uncomfortable
whenever we see

479
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,716
Kang Jong-ryeol on TV, wouldn't I?

480
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,885
That means

481
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:43,724
I can't just forget about everything
and be happy with you.

482
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:50,982
Goodness, it seems like

483
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,026
you were ready for this today.

484
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,907
Well, I'll just leave today.

485
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,451
So

486
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,371
don't ever come back.

487
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,377
Dongbaek.

488
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,506
I'm a timid guy, too.

489
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,968
You know, my heart isn't

490
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,429
made of stone.

491
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,098
So you can

492
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,350
stop turning me down today.

493
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,478
Goodbye.

494
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,947
The curse of the 29th
sent Yong-sik away, too.

495
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,671
Mom, tomorrow is the 29th.

496
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,550
It's my birthday.
Aren't you going to make seaweed soup?

497
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,309
My birthday was
somewhere in winter, wasn't it?

498
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,478
It suddenly became summer.

499
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,358
You abandoned me at an orphanage,
and that day became my birthday.

500
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,194
Isn't that horrifying?

501
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,658
She wouldn't tell us
her mom's name or where she lived.

502
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,077
Is her name really Dongbaek?

503
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,620
No idea.

504
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,957
She just said she's Dongbaek
without telling me her last name.

505
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,960
We don't even know her birthday.

506
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,836
How are we going to get her registered?

507
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,047
But she said she's seven, right?

508
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,465
Then we can just say

509
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,969
the day she came here is her birthday.

510
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,720
Okay.

511
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,725
Everyone loves their birthdays,

512
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,853
but it became the worst day for me.

513
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,480
So Mom,

514
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:59,527
whenever you're in your right mind,
think over and over again

515
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,737
about what you did to me.

516
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:07,326
I get really angry
thinking that you may forget that

517
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,620
and be at peace.

518
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,794
My baby.

519
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:21,465
I'll make sure I do one thing,

520
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,051
at least one thing for you before I go.

521
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:29,765
Sure.

522
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,477
Do whatever you can for me.
I need to get something from you.

523
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,449
Think about it. This is a cheaper way out.

524
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,327
If she sees these pictures
and asks you for a divorce,

525
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,787
you would have to pay
much more than 100 million won.

526
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,081
She's a divorce lawyer, isn't she?

527
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,793
I got into this game
after seeing what's at stake.

528
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,589
And I'm not getting greedy, either.
I want to sell those and get it over with.

529
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,007
You should be thanking me.

530
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,302
I got caught by the worst.

531
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,471
-No.
-What?

532
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,014
You weren't caught by the worst.

533
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,266
You brought this upon yourself.

534
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:17,313
Girls like me are like
the emperor's new clothes.

535
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,024
Good men can't see me.

536
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,904
So why did you get sidetracked?

537
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,034
Why did you leave silk at home
to pick up hemp cloth?

538
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,872
Did I say that out loud?

539
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,999
-What?
-Nothing.

540
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,759
PSYCHIATRIST YUN HONG-GEUN

541
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,261
I barely had two hours of sleep.

542
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,016
I'll give you a prescription
for three days.

543
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:57,603
But tranquilizers can
make you more violent

544
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,773
and impulsive at times,
although it's not very common.

545
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,442
Shouldn't I just get rid of the reason?

546
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,986
If you feel a little odd,

547
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,780
you should stop taking it.

548
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,908
And you must never drink
while you take your medicine.

549
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,785
If you don't like the sound of cicadas,

550
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:16,414
I should just pull out the tree,
shouldn't I?

551
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,833
Are cicadas keeping you
from falling asleep?

552
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,543
I really think

553
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,964
I should do away
with the root of the problem.

554
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,098
NATURAL WILD SEAWEED

555
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,977
Oh, hello, ma'am.

556
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,605
It's Dongbaek's birthday.

557
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,066
What? Today is Dongbaek's birthday?

558
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,820
It's her fake birthday.
Her real birthday is sometime in winter.

559
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:50,739
I see.

560
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,076
You should take her back home.

561
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:58,038
Today's just her birthday on paper.

562
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,918
Ma'am, are you feeling better today?

563
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,129
She keeps going back and forth.

564
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,008
The day she got abandoned
became her birthday.

565
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,971
The orphanage director
seemed like a kind woman.

566
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,556
But she was a bitch.

567
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,692
Well...

568
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,488
Once I become the governor

569
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,573
and this alley gets chosen
as a tourist spot,

570
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:37,077
it'll be better to have the entire alley
filled with marinated crab restaurants.

571
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,663
And I also feel a bit uneasy

572
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,334
when it comes to this place.

573
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,295
Your wife already told me.

574
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,298
What? My wife?

575
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:53,636
She told me to move out
before the lease ends.

576
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,014
You met my wife?

577
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:03,395
But I kind of expected you to have

578
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,231
a different opinion.

579
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,150
What?

580
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:12,112
You expected something from me?

581
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,616
You're a regular here,
so I just thought there might be hope.

582
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,327
You should've felt that way earlier.

583
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,539
-What?
-If you were a bit nicer to me,

584
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,040
none of this would've happened.

585
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,626
You and my wife always look down on me.

586
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,254
And that made me waste energy
on ridiculous things.

587
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:29,922
Seriously.

588
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,801
Let me have a bottle of soju.

589
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,345
You're going to drink alone?

590
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,847
I won't ask for any peanuts.
I don't eat them anymore.

591
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,943
Why are you guys so mean to me?

592
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,821
It's like you guys are always
picking on me.

593
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,324
My wife acts like she's Sejong the Great.

594
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,411
You never let me have any peanuts.

595
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,455
And now, someone's even asking me
for 100 million won.

596
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,000
That's all she ever says to me.

597
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:10,129
So it's no surprise
that I have to take tranquilizers.

598
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,968
Mr. No, you seem really drunk.
You should stop drinking.

599
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,221
Hey, are you listening to me?

600
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,726
Gosh, you should get going now.

601
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,979
Hey, will you just listen to me?

602
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:30,107
Why don't you guys ever listen to me?

603
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,776
Please let go of my hand.

604
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,612
Do you get what I mean?

605
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:38,907
I'm asking why you made the situation
come this far.

606
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,952
I wouldn't have become like this
if you only gave me some peanuts!

607
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,205
Then you wouldn't have had to move out.

608
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:51,253
Do you think I feel happy
about kicking you out?

609
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,421
You see...

610
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,385
It hurts me to see you like this.

611
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,139
I think of you as an old friend.

612
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:06,685
So how sad do you think I'd feel
to see you go through this?

613
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,401
Mr. No, if you keep
holding my hand like this,

614
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:18,280
I'll just have to put up a sign
in front of the bar.

615
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:20,783
What sign?

616
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,494
"No Gyu-tae Zone."

617
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,331
-What?
-This will become a "No Gyu-tae Zone."

618
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:31,126
Does that mean you're only
going to accept me?

619
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,380
No, that's not what I mean.

620
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:39,343
You know the "No Kids Zone"?
It's kind of like that.

621
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:43,055
Just like "No Kids" and "No Smoking",
I'll put up a "No Gyu-tae" sign.

622
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:00,239
You know that American president
who got ostracized

623
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,699
for hitting on his secretary?

624
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,702
Your dream is to become a governor.

625
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,705
But tranquilizers can
make you more violent

626
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,916
and impulsive at times.

627
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,504
Hey, are you threatening me right now?

628
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:22,428
It also hurts me to see you like this
because I also think of you as a friend.

629
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:27,099
Hey, who do you think you are
to pity me like that?

630
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,351
Friends don't hold each other's hands.

631
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:33,188
And you must never drink
while you take your medicine.

632
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:37,276
Hey, listen to me. Hey!

633
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:42,072
You think you'll seem all elegant
if you act like this, don't you?

634
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,283
Don't act like you're weak.

635
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,578
But do you know what you're like

636
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,497
every time you act like this?

637
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:54,835
You're just an annoying little brat.

638
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,504
An annoying brat.

639
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,966
If I'm an annoying brat,
you're an annoying...

640
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,178
-What?
-You're...

641
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,305
My gosh.

642
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,142
What? What am I?

643
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,104
You're drunk. Just go home.

644
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,482
Why aren't you finishing your sentence?

645
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,192
Let me go.

646
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,528
What am I? What were you going to say?

647
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,821
An annoying jerk!

648
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,577
Yong-sik, what are you doing there?

649
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,581
You're an annoying jerk.

650
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,459
An annoying jerk!

651
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,676
You're a jerk! An annoying jerk!

652
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,853
Hey! Wait!

653
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,231
My gosh, stop it!

654
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,942
Get off of me!

655
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,780
Hey, that hurts!

656
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,199
My gosh, stop!

657
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,827
That's enough! How old are you?

658
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,330
Hey, what's your problem?

659
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,584
My gosh, seriously. How old are you?

660
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:21,171
I'm not going to let you go.
I won't forgive you for this.

661
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,389
You little...

662
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,851
I told you not to hold her hand!
Didn't I make myself clear?

663
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:39,106
If I catch you doing that again,
I'll just break your wrist!

664
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:41,817
Hey.

665
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,404
My implant fell out.

666
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,747
My implant fell out. My implant!

667
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,627
Did a constable just make
the future governor's implant fall out?

668
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,754
I'm not going to forgive you for this.

669
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:06,341
And me? Do you think I'll forgive you?

670
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,719
I... I'll...

671
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,597
-I'll...
-You'll do what? What?

672
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,348
I'll...

673
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,393
I'll...

674
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,397
I'll never vote for you!

675
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,865
CAMELLIA

676
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:33,660
Why aren't you cuffing him?
You're arresting him, aren't you?

677
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,079
You should cuff him. What if he runs away?

678
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,207
I'll hold you by your arm.

679
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:41,543
Let go of me.

680
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:43,670
Hey!

681
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:45,964
Get in the back seat.

682
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,760
POLICE

683
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,099
Let me get this straight.

684
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,560
Did a single man and a married man fight
because of Dongbaek?

685
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:02,356
It's like she's ruining Ongsan
with her beauty.

686
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,569
-Go on.
-Go.

687
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,365
My goodness.

688
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,078
What happened?

689
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,042
Aren't you going to go?

690
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,003
Gyu-tae really seems determined
to get Yong-sik fired.

691
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,214
What am I going to say?

692
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,842
Should I tell them
that Mr. No held my hand

693
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:34,096
and that they got into a fight
because Yong-sik took my side?

694
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:38,934
Mr. No's wife is a lawyer.
Yong-sik needs someone on his side.

695
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,729
I'm not going to go.
I'm sick of dealing with rumors.

696
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,818
A police constable

697
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:51,029
abused the future governor of Ongsan!

698
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,698
That's what happened!

699
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,825
-Why?
-Why do you think?

700
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:58,161
It's because he's a lunatic!

701
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,871
My gosh, seriously.

702
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:04,793
Will you please say something?

703
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,587
You need to say something
in order to settle

704
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,548
or say it was an act of self-defense.

705
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,049
What happened?

706
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:15,470
Did Mr. No mess with Dongbaek?

707
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:18,557
Did he sexually harass her or something?

708
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,310
Have you ever lived your life
as a single mother

709
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,438
who runs a restaurant
that also sells liquor?

710
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:28,191
If you did, you would know how awful it is

711
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,901
to have everyone talk about you.

712
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,698
No, nothing like that happened.

713
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,159
Don't get Dongbaek involved in this.

714
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:40,871
Hey, you'll end up going to jail
while trying to protect Dongbaek.

715
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,080
Do you get it?

716
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,249
Okay, don't touch me.

717
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:47,753
He looks like he's on drugs or something.

718
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:48,962
Do you know who I am?

719
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,006
Hey, don't touch me! How dare you?

720
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:53,925
Do you guys work in the same team?
Do you even know who I am?

721
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:59,014
I provided free meals
with the governor of Ongsan,

722
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,558
and I even ate masu salmon with him!

723
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,976
-Gosh, seriously.
-Sit down.

724
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,687
-My gosh, you people.
-Will you please sit down?

725
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,022
Okay, fine.

726
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,691
You're here.

727
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,318
My gosh.

728
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,745
The rookie at the precinct told me

729
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:24,122
that Yong-sik is refusing to say anything.

730
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,834
The man of justice might end up
getting sued for assault.

731
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:31,922
He's still a cop.
I'm sure he won't end up going to jail.

732
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,590
The chief will take care of him.

733
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,469
Don't cops receive a heavier punishment
if they commit assault?

734
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,346
He's in deep shit.

735
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:45,185
He suddenly started beating me up
when I didn't even do anything.

736
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,521
I was totally defenseless,

737
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:51,316
-and my implant fell out because of him.
-Be quiet.

738
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:54,528
Do I have to be quiet
just because you tell me to?

739
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,321
Are you on drugs or something?

740
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,532
He's not crazy.

741
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,618
Why would he hit you
when you didn't even do anything?

742
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:05,163
Hey, why aren't you saying anything?

743
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,957
Will you please talk?

744
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,419
I seriously didn't do anything.

745
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,756
You're not the type
who beats up innocent people.

746
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,927
I'm sure you fought with him
because he did something wrong.

747
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:23,390
What in the world did he do at Camellia?

748
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:29,146
I just beat him up because I wanted to.

749
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,690
See? Did you hear that?

750
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:35,193
-He's a total psychopath.
-Gosh, please sit down.

751
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,362
Just lock him up.

752
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:40,031
-Lock this punk up.
-My gosh, Mom!

753
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,327
Let's get ready for business.

754
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,834
She won't be able to work
if she goes in there.

755
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,053
He's a cop,
so I'm sure he won't go to jail.

756
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,723
They'll definitely cut him some slack.

757
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,397
DONGBAEK ROAD

758
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,815
What's this?

759
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,999
FOLLOW THE ARROW

760
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,463
WALK A LITTLE MORE

761
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,655
This is the road to you.

762
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,703
Dongbaek Road.

763
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,626
Keep following the arrow, Dongbaek.

764
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,390
Just one step closer.

765
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,397
Ta-da.

766
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:15,937
If you don't know your birthday,
every day can be your birthday.

767
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:21,234
I'll make every single day
worth celebrating.

768
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,112
You've already been doing great

769
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,365
for the past 34 years of your life.

770
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:31,453
My gosh, why is he doing this to me?

771
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,542
Why is he doing this for someone like me?

772
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,394
There were camellias everywhere

773
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,730
on the day Dongbaek was born.

774
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,700
This is all because of you, Mom.

775
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,828
Why did you abandon me?

776
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:17,582
You made me feel worthless
ever since I was seven.

777
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,502
That's why I fall for this kind of stuff.

778
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,592
I always walk with my head down.

779
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:33,098
But he keeps making me keep my head up.

780
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,976
The flowers will bloom soon.

781
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,523
He makes me feel like I'm worth something.

782
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:50,198
He always tells me
I'm important and precious.

783
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:51,282
And he makes me

784
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,036
feel like it's true.

785
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,173
That makes me so angry!

786
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,013
It makes me want to stop
holding my temper!

787
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:40,081
LEDGER

788
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,127
-Are you going?
-Close the bar for today.

789
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,216
CAMELLIA

790
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,269
Don't worry.

791
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,146
She was born to be a hippo.

792
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,609
And when the hippopotamus gets pissed,
it'll take over Ongsan.

793
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,904
People are idiots for looking down
on a hippopotamus.

794
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,698
Hippos don't even roar.

795
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,533
They don't even bite.

796
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,411
All they need to do
is ram into their enemy.

797
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,223
Dongbaek.

798
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,267
Dongbaek, I'm glad you're here.

799
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,728
You saw everything that happened--

800
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:44,812
No.

801
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,899
-I'm not here as a witness.
-What?

802
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,902
I'm not here to testify as a damn witness.

803
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,738
I'm here to press charges.

804
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,991
What? Press charges against whom?

805
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,545
December 13th, 2016.

806
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,756
Mr. No came to check
the leak in the ceiling.

807
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,508
But instead of fixing it,

808
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:18,721
he just left after he tapped
the back of my left shoulder twice.

809
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:24,060
February 24th, 2017.

810
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:26,854
Mr. No came to collect
the maintenance fee.

811
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:29,065
But he just pretended to do that

812
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:32,277
and touched the back of my hand twice.

813
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:34,237
That wasn't even necessary.

814
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,240
You fucking jerk.

815
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,326
May 15th, 2018.

816
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,829
While Mr. No was eating tofu
with stir-fried kimchi,

817
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,290
he told me the tofu looked
as white as my skin

818
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,500
two and a half times.

819
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,044
Two and a half times?

820
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:54,507
He was drunk and puked just as he was
about to say it for the third time.

821
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,511
This counts as verbal violence,
doesn't it?

822
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,263
Well, yes.

823
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:05,476
And last time,
he just left without paying 8,000 won.

824
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,229
-I had my reasons for that.
-Is that a record

825
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:11,065
of all the embarrassing things
the neighbors did at Camellia?

826
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,944
There's going to be a bloodbath.

827
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,951
Sexual harassment, verbal violence,
and refusing to pay for what he ate.

828
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:26,414
I'd like to press charges against Mr. No
for all of those things.

829
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:30,168
What did you just say? Are you serious?

830
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,253
Are you doing this because I asked you

831
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:33,713
-to move out?
-I instantly knew

832
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,007
that she never had an affair
with my husband.

833
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,760
Don't put Yong-sik in jail.
Mr. No should get arrested instead.

834
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,637
They're going to end up liking each other.

835
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:45,558
Dongbaek, let me see every single name

836
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:49,187
that's written in that ledger.

837
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,611
Why are you just standing there
in the corner?

838
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,738
You did nothing wrong!

839
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:09,749
Dongbaek.

840
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,128
Did you just protect me?

841
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:20,593
My gosh, seriously.

842
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:25,723
Why do you bother me so much?

843
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,247
Are you crying?

844
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:07,765
I TOLD YOU FIVE YEARS AGO
NOT TO BE A JOKE...

845
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:11,352
We found out who it is.

846
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,404
It's who I think it is, right?

847
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:28,369
No.

848
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:30,997
She can't be dead.

849
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,067
This is all just political maneuvering.

850
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:03,112
This won't be able to harm my future.

851
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,363
Hey!

852
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,449
Dongbaek will deal with No Gyu-tae.

853
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:07,784
I should focus on Joker.

854
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,285
-Joker?
-When it comes to him...

855
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,120
Someone did get rich
because of the murder.

856
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,205
What's in Ongsan?

857
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,791
You'd better not do anything
to hurt my pride.

858
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,126
I shouldn't be going.

859
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:20,129
Your bad taste in men
is what ruined your life.

860
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:22,507
Why do you think
you have control over my life?

861
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:23,841
Dongbaek!

862
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:27,136
-I guess you're dating.
-Are we...

863
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,304
Let's see how things go.
