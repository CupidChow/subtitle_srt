1
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,030
I don't care what problems
my sister caused in Korea.

2
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,199
I don't care if she's dead or not.

3
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,661
Just don't call me, all right?

4
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,166
I have some news regarding Ms. Choi Go-un.

5
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:24,918
How...

6
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,506
do you know that name?
It used to be my sister's.

7
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,927
Two ID cards were found
among her belongings.

8
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,808
I'm afraid she passed away.

9
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,143
She was murdered.

10
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,394
CHOI HYANG-MI

11
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,606
All her life,
Hyang-mi kept Go-un close to her heart.

12
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,649
CHOI GO-UN

13
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,120
We have money for socks, you know.

14
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,580
Why does she keep on sending them?

15
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,792
Go-un!

16
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,337
I told you to wear some socks.

17
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,132
You'll be coughing if you catch a cold.

18
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,175
Go-un.

19
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,724
She wasn't even able to go to heaven,
the one place that knows the name.

20
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,604
Please check the victim's belongings.

21
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,567
No family members. There's just a friend.

22
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,744
1,000 WON
5,000 WON

23
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,540
She left the world
thoughtlessly and alone.

24
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:57,260
CHOI GO-UN
CHOI HYANG-MI

25
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,189
Hyang-mi!

26
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,488
Hyang-mi...

27
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,132
Let go!

28
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,383
Move!

29
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,094
Why would you ask her
to check the belongings?

30
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,306
Dongbaek!

31
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,184
Dongbaek...

32
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,394
Come here.

33
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,397
My gosh!

34
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,319
You don't have to look at those, Dongbaek.

35
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,697
-It's all right.
-My gosh!

36
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,084
Here.

37
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,044
Are you sure?

38
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,756
She hasn't seen that face before.
She's sure of it.

39
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,343
Can't you see she's still devastated?

40
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,810
We all thought the same thing.

41
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,697
You said you were going to begin
a new life, so why did you die?

42
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,324
Hyang-mi...

43
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,956
Do you think
you're the only cops in this town?

44
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,959
Why are you overstepping boundaries?

45
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,378
We all thought

46
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,048
that not a neighbor
nor any person for that matter

47
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,259
should die like that.

48
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,348
Was Hyang-mi really killed
because of Dongbaek?

49
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:12,478
Is the Joker truly after Dongbaek then?

50
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,359
I think it'll feel weird
if Dongbaek really dies though.

51
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:22,196
People used to say
that the Joker only started killing

52
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,573
after Dongbaek came here.

53
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,117
Things have changed since then.

54
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,454
Living in the same neighborhood
for six years makes us family.

55
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,999
You know what?

56
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,628
I don't think we should let
Dongbaek die like this.

57
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,923
The bad guy's madness

58
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,678
wakes the most ordinary heroes
within ourselves.

59
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:52,727
A cheeky little shithead thinks so lowly
of Ongsan that he's messing with us.

60
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,314
However, this is Ongsan.

61
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,524
We dominate
Korea's marinated crab industry.

62
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,571
How about we pull out
this good-for-nothing weed?

63
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,241
Seung-hui,

64
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,329
you dominated
Ongsan Girls' Commercial High.

65
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:12,997
What was your weapon?

66
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,416
My feet.

67
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,297
The ordinary heroes of Ongsan
began twitching.

68
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,300
We'll follow Seung-hui's lead
and move discreetly.

69
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,635
-Sure.
-Got it.

70
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,804
THE ONGSAN AVENGERS

71
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,722
In an unexpected way.

72
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:37,814
Why are officers of a substation
requesting blood analysis off-the-books

73
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,610
and dispatching divers
after falsely reporting a suicide case?

74
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,446
Why are small-town officers

75
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,241
after the Joker?

76
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,789
No wonder you're so quiet. What excuses
can you possibly make in this situation?

77
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,751
That's not it, sir.
I'm just refusing to answer.

78
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,169
What?

79
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,923
Yong-sik wasn't intimidated
by a superior with four stars.

80
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,259
I'm showing my will

81
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,303
to continue the investigation
by not answering.

82
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,474
That led me not to be intimidated as well.

83
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,935
I see we have a bulldog in our department.

84
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,480
Why not address the press
in my place as well?

85
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,442
But sir.

86
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,819
What? What is it?

87
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,448
Who located the camera?

88
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,242
Who found the academy director?

89
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:35,872
Who predicted that
the victim was in Ongsan?

90
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,126
What your people
couldn't solve in six years,

91
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,464
my officer solved in a few months
all by himself.

92
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,801
That's why Yong-sik is better off
investigating this case

93
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,179
instead of the RIU.

94
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:54,974
Is that so?

95
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,936
If you have anything more to say,
do so in your written apology.

96
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,022
Got it?

97
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,403
Unbelievable.

98
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,573
She stole whatever she got her hands on,

99
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,534
but she kept nothing for herself.

100
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,954
Everything she does have
is cheap and shabby.

101
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,670
Why did she have to insist
on making the delivery that night?

102
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,096
Dongbaek,

103
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,391
Hyang-mi's death

104
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,312
is the killer's fault, not yours.

105
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,859
By blaming yourself, you're only letting
the killer be guilt-free.

106
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,073
Now's not the time to be blaming yourself.

107
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,826
We must catch this guy.
You know that, right?

108
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,915
Of course.

109
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,003
I'm not sure of anything else,

110
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,714
but I still do remember
the sound of him coughing.

111
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,971
If only I can hear it once more.
I'll definitely recognize him.

112
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:21,561
From what I gathered, him coughing
could be a tic.

113
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:27,858
It could be an involuntary action
that happens when he's excited.

114
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,615
It's the grasshopper lady.

115
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,369
What are you doing here?

116
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,998
Dongbaek, have you been
sorting out your recyclables?

117
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,959
-Yes.
-Okay.

118
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,628
I'll be the supervisor starting today

119
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,172
and will check
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

120
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,175
-Make sure you do it right.
-This is out of the blue.

121
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,471
The women of Ongsan
are silently making their moves.

122
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,435
Tofu goes bad in just a day.

123
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,895
-Sorry?
-Giving them to you

124
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,480
is better than throwing them out.

125
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,736
Keep your doors and windows locked
even during the day, okay?

126
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,910
They say that
throwing out perfectly good food

127
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,455
will win you a ticket to hell.

128
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,042
So that's why you're giving them to me.

129
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,294
By the way, when do you close the bar?

130
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,392
What are you all doing here?

131
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,102
Are you out for a smoke?

132
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,104
Mind your own business.

133
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,774
We're exercising to lose weight.

134
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:55,446
Unbelievable.
Don't wander around in groups after dark.

135
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,697
People will complain.

136
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:01,327
Dongbaek, just make sure that

137
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,914
you're always by Yong-sik's side. Got it?

138
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,628
In its own way, this seemingly
indifferent neighborhood watch...

139
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,047
Guys, stop it. Break it up already!

140
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,340
Gosh.

141
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,842
You look like a gang
that goes around picking fights.

142
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,553
...were surely
putting in their time and effort

143
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,556
to protect Dongbaek.

144
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,558
Stop tapping your back on that.

145
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,811
Can't you see that shaking?

146
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,107
-Is she alive?
-Yes, she was at the market.

147
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,110
She lives another day.
Keep checking on her day and night.

148
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,121
It's not like
we're taking Dongbaek's side.

149
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,832
We just thought we'd keep her alive first.

150
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,003
Chan-suk, about this month's
committee meeting...

151
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,132
Right.

152
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,386
For the time being,
the committee meeting will be held here.

153
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:04,724
For the first time since its opening,
Camellia is packed with only women.

154
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,475
You know how much we eat.

155
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,769
At every meeting,

156
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,982
we eat so many snacks
and drink so much coffee,

157
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,151
why do we meet
only at the rice cake shop?

158
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,862
Now, we're going to
drink your place's coffee, all right?

159
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,785
That's how she is all the time.

160
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:29,081
She kept sniffling
while she was eating tteokbokki yesterday.

161
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,376
Why would you cry while eating tteokbokki?

162
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,754
It won't bring Hyang-mi back.

163
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,798
You must get on with your life,
so stop weeping.

164
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:45,055
Are you all here to protect me then?

165
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,560
We're busy people, you know.

166
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,438
Cut the crap and protect your own self.

167
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:56,233
You should put on some weight first.
You're so puny, what can you do?

168
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,111
Look at how she tucks her sweater
in her pants.

169
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,864
How does she even think of doing that?

170
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,658
The Joker's coming for you
because you're so skinny.

171
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,410
You don't eat much, do you?

172
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,371
You're so annoyingly skinny.

173
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,540
Fattening her up
should be our first objective.

174
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,126
You're her designated trainer.

175
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,086
-Sure, I'll do it.
-Good.

176
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,297
You know,

177
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,092
I'm going to live here
until I'm 100 years old.

178
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,761
How annoying.

179
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,474
Not again.

180
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,810
Hey, stop crying.

181
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,437
I tend to cry when others do.

182
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,065
-Stop it.
-Stop crying.

183
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,983
Don't cry.

184
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,699
What are we to Ongsan again?

185
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,743
-The heart of Ongsan.
-The heart of Ongsan.

186
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,790
She came to us,
saying she knows who Joker is.

187
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:53,707
Really?

188
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,585
-Yes, she saw him once five years ago.
-Once?

189
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,171
Are you sure this isn't it?

190
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,298
No, it isn't.

191
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,634
Hey.

192
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,345
We can't just believe anyone.

193
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,889
We're too busy to entertain
false claims like this.

194
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,767
Just look into Heung-sik
at the hardware store.

195
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,646
Why do you keep saying it's Heung-sik?
Do you have evidence?

196
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,023
I saw his eyes

197
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,651
and I even remember his smell.

198
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,820
Right, you have a good sense of smell.

199
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,006
What do you want?

200
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,758
Did you follow me to kill me?

201
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,199
My gaze,

202
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,912
how I smell,

203
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,582
and my sneaky chuckle.

204
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,835
I hate that about me too.

205
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,546
I...

206
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,634
I'm not doing this because I want to.

207
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:33,974
Please.

208
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,687
Don't do anything.

209
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,982
I'll vouch for it all,

210
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,069
so just this once...

211
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,363
Please.

212
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,627
911 EMERGENCY SERVICE

213
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,878
Ma'am.

214
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,048
If you skip your dialysis,

215
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,926
you could just die on the streets.

216
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,056
What are you doing?

217
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,899
Do you have any proof?

218
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,198
I hear she has dementia.

219
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,162
Did this Heung-sik
do anything to get on your bad side?

220
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,500
How are you less competent
than officers at a substation?

221
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,210
What if I did this?

222
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,671
Does this look like the man in the mask?

223
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,429
See? They all look alike in masks.

224
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,181
Guys, we got it!

225
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,394
Skin tissue was found
underneath the victim's fingernails.

226
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,479
-We have the killer's DNA.
-Really?

227
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,940
Finally, we can go home!

228
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,859
The Joker left behind physical evidence?

229
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:08,944
Wait!

230
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,698
Test it against Heung-sik's DNA first.
You can do that, right?

231
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,911
Detective, please.
This is driving me crazy.

232
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,715
All right. From now on,
the base camp for the Joker case

233
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,800
is here, Ongsan Police Station.

234
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,346
HWANG YONG-SIK

235
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:41,351
I am certain that no one
is more interested in this case than I am.

236
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,105
I'm already with you.

237
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,900
Chief.

238
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,822
Can you really catch him?

239
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,577
Ms. Jo.

240
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,539
I have no place to stay,
so I'll be sleeping in the lounge.

241
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,374
Ms. Jo,

242
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,795
what do you mean
you have no place to stay?

243
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,256
Unbelievable.
Come on, let me take you home.

244
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,425
If you tell Dongbaek I'm here,

245
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,511
I'll run away again.

246
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:20,599
Ms. Jo, please. My gosh.

247
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,518
You're not even well.

248
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,311
Dongbaek's worried sick--

249
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,105
Mind your own business.

250
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:30,943
That idiot will only say
she'll give me her kidney.

251
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,446
It's not like I'd easily accept it.

252
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,242
We'll take care of our issues ourselves,

253
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,203
so stick to catching Joker.

254
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,790
Because of him, I can't leave this town

255
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,041
nor go somewhere to die.

256
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,794
Go and get her some coffee.

257
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,548
-I enjoy your coffee more.
-Of course.

258
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,137
You can refuse if you want.
That's your choice.

259
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:02,099
What if word gets out that
you refused a lie detector test?

260
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,602
Who knows what the people
will think about you?

261
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,856
Isn't it your goal
to become governor one day?

262
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,234
I'll do it.

263
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:16,155
Of course. There's no reason to refuse it
if you didn't kill Ms. Choi.

264
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,991
On one condition.

265
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,911
Even the strong-willed can't
stay calm during a lie detector test.

266
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,539
It is not for someone as feeble as you.

267
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,669
It's a fact that you met
Choi Hyang-mi that day,

268
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,337
but you blacked out.

269
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,216
Why did you agree to a lie detector test
when this will only hurt your case?

270
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,385
-Ja-yeong.
-What?

271
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,638
If I'm guilty, then I'll be punished.

272
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,265
Just...

273
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,434
trust me this once.

274
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,353
Trust you? How can I possibly do that?

275
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,480
I know you'll just act like a fool.

276
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,357
That's what you liked about me.

277
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,735
Are you kidding me?

278
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,446
You liked me because
I made you feel motherly.

279
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:03,118
You're here too because you can't
turn away from a helpless person.

280
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,914
How can I not care
when you could go to prison?

281
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,333
I'm sorry for making you a mother.

282
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,381
I'm sure you wanted to be just a woman,

283
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,426
but I made you a mother,

284
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,220
and I'm sorry.

285
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,890
However,

286
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,936
just like you scolded me with love,

287
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,356
I caused trouble for you out of love too.

288
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,567
I wanted you...

289
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,612
to see me as a man.

290
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,491
It's why I became more childish.

291
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,328
I'm sorry.

292
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,207
I'm sorry, Ja-yeong.

293
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,920
What is this?

294
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:57,881
Don't tell me...

295
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,677
you actually killed someone.

296
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:07,432
So, you see,
I need to finish the composite sketch.

297
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,394
That'll take a couple of hours though.

298
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:15,482
I can't schedule it at another time
because the police are asking...

299
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,736
Are you asking me to babysit Pil-gu?

300
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,157
I'm sure you're busy though.

301
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:25,867
You know,

302
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:31,415
being this polite like you do
makes you harder to be friends with.

303
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,378
The whole neighborhood knows
how close Pil-gu and Jun-gi are.

304
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:41,842
So how is it that you've never
asked me to watch Pil-gu before?

305
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:45,137
Why on earth is that so hard to ask?

306
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,600
Then was it okay for me to ask you?

307
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,981
Of course!
That way, I can ask you to watch Jun-gi

308
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,233
while I go out with friends.

309
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,778
Why do you always
keep your distance from people?

310
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,031
You better keep this in mind.

311
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,993
People can only grow closer
when they put each other out

312
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,455
and ask for favors from time to time.

313
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,668
Could you make sure
he eats dinner too then?

314
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:21,298
We'll not only feed him but also wipe
his ass as well if we have to.

315
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,802
Thank you for doing this then.

316
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,806
INVESTIGATION ROOM

317
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,475
Gyu-tae.

318
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,894
I'll be here.

319
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:37,356
I'll wait out here, so leave the room
if things take a weird turn.

320
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,734
Your attorney has your back.

321
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,154
Get in then!

322
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,002
My sugar level is going down.

323
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,880
What's taking him so long?

324
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,470
Could you come in?

325
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:10,847
Me?

326
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,726
Mr. No made a special request.

327
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,939
Just let me decide
the last three questions.

328
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,732
Sure, go ahead.

329
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,527
We normally agree on the questions
beforehand anyway.

330
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,445
Also, invite my lawyer in

331
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,240
when you ask me.

332
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,283
What?

333
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,202
Allow it or I'll keep refusing.

334
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,208
I will now ask the three questions
you wanted me to ask.

335
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,879
Were you and Choi Hyang-mi
having an affair?

336
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,091
No.

337
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,262
He's telling the truth.

338
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,680
He's unbelievable.

339
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:55,308
Have you been inside the motel room
Choi Hyang-mi was staying at?

340
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:56,685
No.

341
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,603
No way.

342
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,647
I swear on my parents' lives.

343
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,318
Why swear anything on your parents' lives?

344
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,946
-Gosh.
-Either say yes or no, please.

345
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,614
Lastly,

346
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,409
do you love your wife?

347
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,455
Yes.

348
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,629
I love her

349
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,884
and I admire her.

350
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,598
I only have eyes for you.

351
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,482
He does love her.

352
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,359
Tell him to get going.

353
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,292
LEFT HAND? COUGHING? A TIC? A HABIT?

354
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,336
ONGSAN INTERSECTION
ONGSAN MASU SALMON TOWN

355
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,837
Okay, let's put these together.

356
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,382
We found blood on Mr. No's steering wheel.

357
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,676
And the blood is Hyang-mi's.

358
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:16,556
But we shouldn't only go after him.

359
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:21,603
Choi tried to call Kang Jong-ryeol
a total of 14 times,

360
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,105
and he never picked up.

361
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,900
Don't you sense something suspicious?

362
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:28,860
On top of that,

363
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,865
a total of 30 million won was
deposited into this bank account

364
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,284
after Hyang-mi went missing.

365
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,953
Did Jong-ryeol send her that?

366
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,372
Then we can just get his DNA, can't we?

367
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,792
The sender's name is Park Sang-mi,
Kang Jong-ryeol's wife.

368
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:48,129
It could be money, an affair, or a grudge,
but there's a motive.

369
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,590
Then is Joker one of them?

370
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,217
-We don't know that.
-Why not?

371
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,427
We don't know if Joker killed Choi,

372
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,472
or if someone pretended to be Joker
to get their personal revenge.

373
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,057
So we'll start from ground zero--

374
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,982
If you're going to discuss ground zero,
don't call me out here.

375
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,571
MOST SEARCHED TERMS:
ONGSAN'S JOKER, ONGSAN

376
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,657
You're about to become Joker.

377
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,493
So why did you send her money?

378
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,080
Your name is now on her bankbook.
What if the police barge in here?

379
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,249
Then what should I have done?

380
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,544
She said she'll expose everything,

381
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,921
so I had to give her 30 million.

382
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,424
I gave it to her as compensation
to keep my pride.

383
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,260
I couldn't let her...

384
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,180
sue me for hit-and-run,

385
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,099
so I thought this out and--

386
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,560
Why did you think about this? Why?

387
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,105
Sang-mi.

388
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:50,025
Pull yourself together and look at me.

389
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,362
You didn't kill her.
You can't hit a person.

390
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,282
You're my daughter. I would know that.

391
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:01,828
I'll take care of everything,
so stop thinking about it, okay?

392
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,288
Mom.

393
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,625
But why don't I ever think?

394
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,543
What?

395
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,379
You always do everything for me.

396
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,507
That's why I became an idiot.

397
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,136
Are you

398
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,473
blaming me?

399
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,819
My mother came.

400
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,113
Why did she come?

401
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,660
I told my family.

402
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,037
Jang-ryeol...

403
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,623
I mean, Jong-ryeol. Tell them what?

404
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,167
You need to think before you speak.

405
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,294
You can't take back your words.

406
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,756
I heard

407
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,760
you went to Ongsan.

408
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:04,015
You really shouldn't bring that up first.

409
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,400
We will...

410
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,362
get divorced.

411
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,198
I'm so sorry.

412
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,700
Wait, do you think

413
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,661
you can say whatever you want?

414
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,372
I mean, what are you talking about?

415
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,376
We've been dragging our marriage out
when it was over a long time ago.

416
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,296
-It's belated, but we should--
-You!

417
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,174
You jerk. Go and rot in hell.

418
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,884
-Mom, stop.
-You piece of garbage.

419
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,971
If you... If you destroy my baby's life,

420
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,725
I'll shatter you and your life too!

421
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,184
I will...

422
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:52,772
I will file a petition to the Blue House.

423
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,400
Hey, are you going to Ongsan again?

424
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,196
Sang-mi, why are you
suddenly acting differently?

425
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,951
Sang-mi, you were never a mom to her.

426
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,829
I'll do my best to bring Ji-seon up.

427
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,585
Why? Did she say
she wants to live with you?

428
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,128
No.

429
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,798
I need to bring the kid with me.

430
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,719
I don't want

431
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,432
to leave him there for another day.

432
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,525
Bring him home. Your son.

433
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,113
I'll tell people
we're adopting your nephew.

434
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,866
What are you trying to do?

435
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,413
I'm going to move all of my stuff
to our newlywed house.

436
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,665
And we'll live together forever.

437
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,670
You're Ji-seon's mom,

438
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,381
so I won't act childish to you.

439
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,552
You can go to Milan,
and I'll do anything you want.

440
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,346
So you don't need to bluff like this.

441
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:09,557
I'm not going to Milan.
Why would I do that for you?

442
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,059
Sang-mi.

443
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,020
We may not be able to say goodbye,
but let's not go that low.

444
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,690
I will... bring up Rebecca
once we get divorced.

445
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,736
Are you trying to make a deal
using the kid?

446
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,905
You're the one who's at fault,

447
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,492
-and Rebecca is mine.
-Sang-mi.

448
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,452
Jong-ryeol.

449
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,247
I'm Jessica.

450
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,875
Rebecca is mine,

451
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,419
and the name
Mrs. Kang Jong-ryeol is mine too.

452
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:42,590
Bring

453
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,051
the kid.

454
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,642
Then who are you going to side with?

455
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,103
I hate them both.

456
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,896
You even hate Mr. Hwang?

457
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,940
-Yes.
-Why?

458
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:04,863
Hey, let's say you are
sitting with Hong Jae-min on the bus.

459
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,240
Then I have to sit with Yang Jeong-wu.

460
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,158
But Jeong-wu always picks his nose.

461
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,954
Even if I want to keep sitting with you,

462
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,374
how could I do that
if you get a new best pal?

463
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,293
Do you get it?

464
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,297
It's unfair for me.

465
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,676
No one has a bigger headache than
I do among eight-year-olds in my class.

466
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:39,480
ONGSAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
BASEBALL TEAM TRAINING

467
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,859
Goodness, great work.

468
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,152
-Mom.
-Hey.

469
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:48,114
-Mom.
-Hey, Jun-gi.

470
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,449
-Gosh, my son.
-Mom!

471
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,658
How did you do?

472
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,579
Pil-gu, come here. Come here.

473
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,040
Your mom is a little busy right now.

474
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,542
Come eat at my place.
She'll come and pick you up.

475
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,253
-Why is she busy?
-Which one is your bag?

476
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,797
I have to be her priority.
Why is she busy?

477
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,342
JUN-GI'S MARINATED CRAB

478
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,596
Hey, how is she?

479
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,556
Did she open the bar?

480
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,309
Did she eat?

481
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,437
Goodness, she won't starve.

482
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,481
Come on, she's not a stranger.

483
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,191
She is.

484
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:28,446
Especially you and her.
You're either her family or enemy.

485
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,282
Why are you concerned about her?

486
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,034
Just leave her alone.

487
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,787
Let her do whatever she wants.
Don't be so stressed out.

488
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,581
You two are being so mean.

489
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,918
If you spent six years
with her as your neighbor,

490
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,587
she's more of your family
than relatives you don't meet.

491
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,882
How can you say
we should let her do whatever?

492
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,718
What are you going to do?

493
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,972
Either shun her or embrace her.
Choose your side.

494
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,724
If you love her and hate her,
what are you going to do?

495
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,562
You already liked her, and now
she's in this love-hate relationship.

496
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,272
She can't help it anymore.

497
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,945
Fine, you can be a saint
when it comes to other people's business.

498
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:14,117
Wait and see when Geum-mi
and Jang-jong get married.

499
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:17,370
Would you want them to marry someone
who already has a kid?

500
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,709
Even Buddha would find it hard to do.

501
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,129
Why do you expect me
to pretend like I'm great?

502
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,922
Am I asking for too much?

503
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:32,468
The least she can do is
be without an eight-year-old son.

504
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,430
The least she can do is
be without a burden.

505
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,641
Ms. Kwak, stop it.
Hey. Pil-gu. Hey!

506
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,476
Wait, goodness.

507
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,563
Pil-gu!

508
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,566
Pil-gu, come on.

509
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:50,194
Think about it. You aren't
the only eight-year-old around here.

510
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,988
I really wasn't talking about you.

511
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:55,199
I was talking about
another eight-year-old in another family.

512
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,410
Am I my mom's burden?

513
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,497
Am I a burden?

514
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,467
Mom!

515
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:21,225
Mom! Hey, Mom! I'm home!

516
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,896
Mom, open the door already!

517
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,900
Come on, Mom! Open the door!

518
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,069
Hurry up!

519
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:31,986
Yes.

520
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,074
We almost... We almost found her.

521
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,244
Has she been going to the hospital?

522
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:41,537
Yes.

523
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:45,249
I kept seeing her hospital records.

524
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:46,959
Then

525
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,298
can you hurry up and get her
when she goes to the hospital?

526
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,760
Hey, Dongbaek.

527
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:01,307
You should come and visit our station

528
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,352
and surprise us from time to time.

529
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,189
I looked up on the internet

530
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,692
and heard that dialysis is really painful.

531
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,154
She was bloated because she was ill.

532
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:20,910
But I was harsh on her and blamed her
for putting on weight after abandoning me.

533
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,497
Dongbaek.

534
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,792
If you have to give her...

535
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,920
your kidney,

536
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,299
will you really do that?

537
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,977
No one can say anything even if I refuse.

538
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,566
JUN-GI'S MOM

539
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,276
Pil-gu.

540
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,987
Pil-gu.

541
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,490
My gosh. Do you know how scared I was?

542
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,952
Pil-gu, why are you
sitting here like this?

543
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,790
Why did you change the passcode?

544
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,836
It's because...

545
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,171
Why does he know it?

546
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,882
Hey, Pil-gu. It's--

547
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,383
Are you going to marry him?

548
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,136
What?

549
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,682
It's weirder to live with you, me, and him

550
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,810
than to live with just you and me.

551
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,688
It's more annoying, a bigger headache,
and embarrassing!

552
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,649
Come here. You!

553
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,235
You shouldn't... You can't talk like that.

554
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,112
Dongbaek.

555
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,698
You can't say
whatever you want to an adult.

556
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,368
You'll break my heart if you do that.

557
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,954
You aren't as heartbroken as I was.

558
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,374
When you didn't come to pick me up

559
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,294
and changed the passcode to our door,

560
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,505
it felt like the earth was destroyed.

561
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,471
Once I go to prison,

562
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,891
you can keep the pear field in Nonsan.

563
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,063
The only thing I can give you is

564
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,566
our house or those fields.

565
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:20,196
Why should you be imprisoned?
You didn't kill Hyang-mi.

566
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,615
You really believe me.

567
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,159
It's not that I believe you.

568
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,328
I believe myself.

569
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,540
I think I saw her that day.

570
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,542
What?

571
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:37,338
You said you saw her on the road
that leads to the fishing hole.

572
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,674
I saw her at the fishing hole.

573
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,218
So that means

574
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,012
she didn't die on the road.

575
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:49,684
Hey, why should you tell them
that you saw her?

576
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,436
-You should tell the detectives.
-Do you trust them?

577
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:57,316
They're busy covering their asses.
That's why they're trying to bring you in.

578
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,613
So should your ex-wife tell them
that she saw Hyang-mi on the day she died?

579
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,701
But still, how can you trust
that hillbilly?

580
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:10,037
He doesn't know what he's doing.

581
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:14,292
I think the hillbilly who has no idea
is better than cunning detectives.

582
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,586
That's why I married you.

583
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,632
Although you stabbed me in the back.

584
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,552
Darn it.

585
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,352
Goodness, Ms. Hong.

586
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:38,441
"Yong-sik over Regional Investigation."
They all say that in the Police Agency.

587
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,777
Don't make me regret being on your side.

588
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,364
What?

589
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,119
On the night of the 24th,

590
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,413
I saw Choi Hyang-mi.

591
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,923
CAMELLIA STIR-FRIED PORK

592
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,640
I couldn't take my eyes off her.

593
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,936
Why is she delivering?

594
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:17,980
I was too hungry.

595
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,608
If it was Dongbaek,
I was going to order a dumpling soup.

596
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,995
I still have such a huge appetite
right before my divorce.

597
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:37,249
I'm definitely never going to lose weight.

598
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,687
What was that?

599
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,357
Why is that truck taking the scooter?

600
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,235
And the lights are off too.

601
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,576
She's gone. Hyang-mi.

602
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:17,957
Then I heard she went missing,
so I thought it was weird too.

603
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,085
If that truck took the scooter...

604
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:25,047
That means Hyang-mi
wasn't in the state to ride it.

605
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,926
Did you see the driver?

606
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,595
Or maybe the license plate?

607
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,933
It was pretty dark, and oddly,
the truck didn't turn on the headlights.

608
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,813
If the lights were turned off,
that's the culprit.

609
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:44,483
Okay, it'll be game over
once we find that truck.

610
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,195
Why did I see that truck?

611
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:50,823
What?

612
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,910
The truck that stole Dongbaek's scooter.

613
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,122
I saw it on that day.

614
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,417
In front of Camellia. Right now.

615
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,419
A cab at this hour?

616
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:07,214
Take the boy and head home. I'd rather
not see him sleep out here again.

617
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,425
CAB

618
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,488
That bike is ours.

619
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,698
CAMELLIA

620
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:39,830
I can't believe
Hyang-mi even sold our scooter.

621
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,457
Should I go after the truck?

622
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,669
No, take me to the hospital first.

623
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,129
Okay.

624
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,596
She turned off her phone.

625
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,599
Is she cutting me off
over just 30 million won or what?

626
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,600
She won't come.

627
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,395
-What?
-Don't wait for someone who won't come.

628
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,439
I thought she sold the scooter
and ran away.

629
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,484
That's why I figured
she was never going to come back.

630
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,613
Do you happen to remember
the license number

631
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,698
of the cab you rode that day?

632
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:21,205
Are you kidding me?
Who memorizes the cab license number?

633
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,706
My stomach was hurting.

634
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,333
She's right.

635
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,629
The dashcam in the cab
would've caught the truck.

636
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,340
Should we look into the cabs in Ongsan?

637
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,884
My uncle is a cab driver.

638
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,433
Go and talk to Jong-ryeol.

639
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,687
I saw him by the road.

640
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,272
What?

641
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,988
I just hit the jackpot.

642
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,909
Where is she? Where?

643
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,042
Shit! Damn it!

644
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,884
There's absolutely no one here!
What did she hit with her car?

645
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,887
Park Sang-mi, that damn brat!

646
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,806
His car was parked by the road,

647
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,976
and he was yelling like a lunatic.

648
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:34,236
Yong-sik can start off
by checking Jong-ryeol's dashcam.

649
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,323
And honey, I want you to get ready
to sue the country.

650
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,575
I'll sue the country
for tainting my innocence--

651
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,118
Here's my conclusion.

652
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:47,166
The suspects who saw Hyang-mi that night

653
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,876
aren't actually suspects.

654
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,462
SUSPECTS, WITNESSES

655
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,631
I think they're witnesses.

656
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,677
SUSPECTS, WITNESSES

657
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,180
GYU-TAE, JESSICA, JONG-RYEOL,
JA-YEONG, MS. JO

658
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,895
I just picked five lucky cards.

659
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,065
And once I organize these cards,

660
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:15,235
I know for a fact
that Joker will get caught.

661
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,949
That workbook is useless.

662
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,994
You side with us, and you'll get promoted.

663
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,664
WORKBOOK FOR POLICE EXAM

664
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:41,345
YOU SHOULD'VE COME
SHE DIED BECAUSE OF YOU

665
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,139
EVERYONE WHO'S CLOSE WITH YOU WILL DIE

666
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:51,397
The least she can do is
be without an eight-year-old son.

667
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:55,109
The least she can do is
be without a burden.

668
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:59,613
Pil-gu, you shouldn't wander around
all by yourself from now on.

669
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,410
You have to do as I say, okay?

670
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,452
Where's Grandma?

671
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,372
Your grandma? She'll be back.

672
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,623
What about Hyang-mi?

673
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,588
Did they leave to make you feel at ease?

674
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,135
What?

675
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,556
Did you find it comfortable
when I was away in China?

676
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:34,273
Stop talking nonsense, and eat your food.

677
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:38,152
We won't be living together
once I grow old

678
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:39,945
and get married, right?

679
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,698
Is that just how things work?

680
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,661
Why? Are you worried
that I might ask you to live with me?

681
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,498
They don't usually live together.

682
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,418
Most of my friends
don't live with their grandmas.

683
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,963
I know when I'm not welcome.

684
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,549
I won't ask you to live with me
after you get married.

685
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:12,686
Are you being like this
because I hit you that one time?

686
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:17,399
At least you feel at ease
since you were the one that got a beating.

687
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,776
I can't even sleep at night.

688
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,987
Do you think kids always sleep well?

689
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,868
Listen to the clock ticking.

690
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:30,746
Now, let's go back to the past.

691
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,123
Slowly...

692
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,877
Unfortunately, not all cards
turned out to be lucky.

693
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,713
-Tick, tock.
-Just cut him some slack.

694
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,132
He just wants to be of help

695
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:46,011
as one of the five lucky cards.

696
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,971
People who get bad grades
are the ones

697
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,015
who wish for luck the day before the exam.

698
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,683
-My gosh.
-What do you see?

699
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,353
Hyang-mi...

700
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:01,109
flashed me with a heart
using her fingers over her head.

701
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,321
I'm so angry.

702
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,492
Who knows?
We might get something from this.

703
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,412
The driver that hit her

704
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,374
comes out of the car.

705
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,627
It's a woman.

706
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,630
A woman?

707
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,716
My gosh, it was probably just Jessica.

708
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,636
Now, slowly tell me

709
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,556
the number on the license plate.

710
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,393
Four.

711
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,023
Eight.

712
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,733
A four and an eight?

713
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,153
Four, eight...

714
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,989
Four, eight...

715
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,579
-Eight.
-Eight?

716
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,623
Four, eight...

717
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,459
My gosh, seriously.

718
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,171
That number sounds oddly familiar.

719
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,966
Four, eight, eight...

720
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,595
What? Is it four, eight, eight, five?

721
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:12,639
You got those numbers from
the movie Chaser!

722
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:17,603
Jong-ryeol's license number
on the CCTV footage was 4904.

723
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,898
But why did you say "4885"?
You've got to be kidding me.

724
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,526
Hey! Making mistakes is
part of the investigation!

725
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:28,614
Just be honest and say you don't know!
Why would you make things up?

726
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,616
I don't like his attitude to begin with!

727
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:35,329
I just kept convincing myself
that I was hypnotized!

728
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,080
My gosh, darn you!

729
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,249
Seriously!

730
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:44,254
And there's a lucky card
that I don't really feel comfortable with.

731
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:48,550
ONGSAN SUBSTATION

732
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,307
Well, thank you

733
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,601
for your cooperation.

734
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,686
Can you really catch Joker with that?

735
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:05,734
Mr. Kang, have you ever caught
a bank robber with a lunch box?

736
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,402
That wasn't my question.

737
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,572
Have you ever tied up a murderer
with duct tape?

738
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:11,531
I didn't asked you.

739
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:17,496
Joker could only act up
because he hasn't met me yet.

740
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,582
Yong-sik, you can tell me that
after you actually catch him.

741
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:26,004
Well, there's no need for us
to have a long conversation.

742
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,132
But just to let you know,

743
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,094
Dongbaek is--

744
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,804
I didn't ask you that either.

745
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:39,142
I don't need you to tell me about her.
I can just go see her myself.

746
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,480
Do you think we're close?
I'm close to Dongbaek.

747
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,651
What kind of logic is that?

748
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,987
Okay, fine. Go ahead.

749
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,406
Try everything you can.

750
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:56,535
But regardless of what you do,
our relationship will always stay strong.

751
00:49:56,618 --> 00:50:00,455
Okay, whatever.
You can say that after you get married.

752
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:04,501
Go ahead and overcome all the variables.
Then you can say that to my face.

753
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:08,130
My gosh, you keep
bringing up those darn variables.

754
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,674
Does that make you feel relieved
or something?

755
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,761
I don't calculate things.
I just live my life the way I want to.

756
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,848
So most variables
don't even get in my way.

757
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,685
Anyway,

758
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:24,813
thanks for this.

759
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,984
Come on. Let me borrow it just this once.

760
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,485
I won't take it from you.

761
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,030
I'm just asking if I can borrow it.

762
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:36,241
You're practically trying to take it
by mentioning your older brother.

763
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,160
I'm free to talk about him if I want.

764
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,578
Stop being so selfish.

765
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,706
Hey, my brother's in sixth grade.

766
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,583
He's almost a black belt.

767
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:49,463
You guys never had
a headache before, have you?

768
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,842
I once had a runny nose.

769
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,306
Here. Just take it.

770
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,850
How did Pil-gu suddenly become so rich?

771
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,935
He's already got three game consoles.

772
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:07,022
I don't care if he's rich.
I'm still stronger than him.

773
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,900
My brother's in sixth grade.
He's almost a black belt.

774
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,277
Nice.

775
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,197
-Hey, watch out.
-Then what about me?

776
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:18,408
Pardon?

777
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,285
How old do I look?

778
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,998
You might have an older brother
who's in sixth grade.

779
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,251
But Pil-gu has a grandmother
who's 57 years old.

780
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,215
You can borrow it just for today.

781
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,676
Have fun using it today,
and give it back to him tomorrow.

782
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,011
Got it?

783
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:40,555
Remember this.

784
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,768
Pil-gu has a grandmother
who's 57 years old.

785
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,147
I'm always there for him,
and I always keep my eyes on him.

786
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,234
Hey, wait!

787
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:57,447
-My gosh. Hey, I want that back.
-What?

788
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,950
He had a headache
and wasn't thinking straight.

789
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,786
Ma'am, wait!

790
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,414
He just took it from me.

791
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:08,834
Who is she?

792
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,128
Pil-gu's 57-year-old grandma.

793
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,976
ONGSAN RICE SHOP
FOR RENT

794
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,991
-What?
-Are you okay?

795
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,535
You must've been frightened.

796
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,163
Were you worried I might be dead?

797
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:50,041
I can't believe a scaredy-cat like you
ended up encountering a murderer.

798
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,501
You must've been so startled.

799
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,508
I won't ask you to live with me.

800
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,386
Just make sure you don't die.

801
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,972
Just make sure you stay alive.

802
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,057
Stay alive and well.

803
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,186
Dongbaek.

804
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,522
When I saw you again in eight years,

805
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,400
I was more bothered by your wrist guard

806
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:19,070
than that germanium bracelet
you were wearing.

807
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:25,076
It drives me nuts that you had to work
and raise Pil-gu by yourself.

808
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,204
But on top of that,

809
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,581
why did you have to...

810
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,459
Why did I have to encounter a murderer?

811
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,086
Why do you have to keep living this way?

812
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,839
Your life is like
some kind of a challenge.

813
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,759
What's your point?

814
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,765
Let me ask you one last time.

815
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,017
Let's go to Seoul.

816
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,731
I know money isn't everything in life.

817
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,317
But money does make your life

818
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:00,487
a lot more comfortable.

819
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,532
Stop living such a dangerous
and shabby life.

820
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:08,912
Why can't you just live a comfortable,
stable, and well-off life?

821
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,039
Can't you let me do that for you?

822
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,418
Jong-ryeol, back when we were together,

823
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,754
I never once had to worry about rent.

824
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,590
But I felt uncomfortable.

825
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,426
I didn't feel comfortable at all.

826
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,055
I was always nervous,

827
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:30,433
intimidated, and walking on eggshells.

828
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,852
That's how I felt.

829
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:36,189
But these days, I feel comfortable.

830
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:39,734
I've never felt so proud of myself.

831
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,738
So will you please cut me some slack?

832
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,617
Can't you just leave us alone?

833
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,332
Then I'm sorry to say this,

834
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,753
but you give me no choice
but to be the bad guy.

835
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,131
What?

836
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,134
Let me take Pil-gu with me.

837
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:10,807
I can't stand a single day
thinking that my son is being raised

838
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:15,270
at a bar that's visited by a murderer.

839
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:22,777
I was going to leave

840
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:27,907
after I saw how well you were doing
from afar.

841
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,744
Why aren't you coming home?

842
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:34,664
Why? Did you miss me?

843
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,417
Mom's waiting for you.

844
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,087
Really?

845
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,006
She likes you.

846
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,217
Did she say that?

847
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,180
I can tell.

848
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,683
I guess she never actually said it.

849
00:55:56,478 --> 00:56:00,523
I know she's angry at you all the time,
but she never means it.

850
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,817
When she's really angry,

851
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,697
her eyebrows, nostrils, and voice
look and sound completely different.

852
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:12,077
After you left,

853
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,413
she keeps sighing while eating.

854
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,125
And every time the deliveryman
knocks on the door,

855
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,044
she gets up and looks outside.

856
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,465
You seem to know everything about her.

857
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,760
I know her better than anyone.

858
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:32,722
You and Mr. Hwang are no match for me.

859
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:42,774
So hurry up and come back home.

860
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,902
Once my mom starts crying,
she'll never stop.

861
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,446
Why would she cry?

862
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,828
I'm going to live with my dad.

863
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:57,497
What?

864
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,127
Why? Is it because of me?

865
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,213
Is it because I called you a burden?

866
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,176
These are all for you.

867
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:12,929
Why are you giving me this?

868
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,598
Do you want me to grow taller?

869
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,438
My mom is

870
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,190
a nice person.

871
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,154
My mom's nice.

872
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,824
She's really nice.

873
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:48,131
Both you and your mother are
giving me such a hard time.

874
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,924
You really are.

875
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,229
I want you to deal with your mom.

876
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,107
Make sure she isn't mean to my mom.

877
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,735
Make sure she doesn't bully her.

878
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,697
I don't need your game console.

879
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,033
What's the point of playing it
without you?

880
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,290
You should visit Seoul.

881
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:25,251
When? On what date?

882
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,505
CAMERA 1, RECORDING

883
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,464
Wait.

884
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,510
The night of the 24th at 23:58.

885
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,971
-The license number is 60...
-And 33?

886
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:40,099
-Yes, it's definitely 6033.
-It's 6033.

887
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:41,768
What?

888
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,729
It says here that it's a stolen vehicle.

889
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,482
What?

890
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,067
But

891
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:52,111
the owner who reported it missing

892
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,908
was Park Heung-sik.

893
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,371
Bingo. I got you.

894
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,711
Even if it was a false report,
we need to consider the circumstances.

895
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:11,506
Okay.

896
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,259
They've detected DNA from the corpse.

897
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:17,929
We might have to check the DNA
of every single person in the country.

898
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:21,724
So we'd really appreciate
your cooperation.

899
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,227
Do you agree on a DNA test?

900
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:26,646
But

901
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,440
am I also allowed to refuse?

902
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,903
Yes, exactly.

903
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:37,740
Why is he glaring again?

904
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:41,619
Yes, okay. Please help me out.

905
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,329
Okay, bye.

906
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,918
Hey, who was that?

907
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,087
Hey.

908
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:54,591
Where are you going with that gun?

909
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,301
I'm off to Heung-sik's place.

910
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:02,265
Will you please think of a strategy first?

911
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:05,226
What are you even going to say to him?

912
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:08,479
Are you going to shoot him
because the truck turned out to be his?

913
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,608
My strategy is always to be
quick to attack.

914
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,235
And everyone in Ongsan is on my side.

915
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,487
My gosh, how can you be so confident?

916
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:18,698
Hey.

917
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:20,950
Isn't that Pil-gu?

918
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:28,625
How could you think of taking him from me?
You have no right to do this.

919
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,795
Do you think being a rich dad is all that?

920
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:35,840
Do you think this is the 80s or something?

921
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:39,510
I have no legal right to do that,
and I also have a conscience.

922
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,513
I won't take him away from you.
Just let me help him.

923
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,140
My gosh.

924
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,310
A murderer comes to your bar.

925
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,812
Can't you just trust me with him?

926
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,106
What matters is that he stays safe.

927
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:57,153
YOU SHOULD'VE COME
SHE DIED BECAUSE OF YOU

928
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,946
EVERYONE WHO'S CLOSE WITH YOU
WILL DIE

929
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:04,410
Who do you think cares about Pil-gu
as much as you do?

930
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,663
It's me.

931
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,590
Hey, Pil-gu. You're home.

932
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:21,177
You should go now. Don't ever come back.

933
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,222
How was school?

934
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,723
-Mom.
-Yes?

935
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,934
Go and wash your hands.

936
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,478
I made curry for you, Pil-gu.

937
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,105
I don't want curry.

938
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,692
I want to live with Dad from now on.

939
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,325
What?

940
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:46,703
I've made up my mind.

941
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,755
Hey, Pil-gu.

942
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,218
Why are you leaving?
Aren't you here to see me?

943
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:05,847
What do you like about my mom?

944
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:10,810
What? What kind of question is that?

945
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,521
Why do you like someone who's so greedy?

946
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,733
What are you talking about?
She's not greedy.

947
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,526
She has a son.

948
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,487
And she even has a mom now.

949
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,240
But now, she wants a husband.

950
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,285
Meanwhile, she's all I have.

951
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:36,878
I think I was happier
when I was seven years old.

952
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:41,591
Is it because

953
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,635
that was before I came to Ongsan?

954
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:34,727
Why does he stuff sawdust
in people's mouths?

955
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,438
I found something even weirder this time.

956
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,234
Will you be okay?

957
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,737
I should get to live with Dad as well.

958
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,281
Do you always want me to grow up
without a dad?

959
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:50,868
Just because I don't have a husband
doesn't mean you can't have a dad.

960
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:56,123
One was wrong,
but the other one was right.

961
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,292
I'll check where he is and get going.

962
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,546
