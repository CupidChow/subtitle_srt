WHEN THE CAMELLIA BLOOMS

00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,868
Mom…

5
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,055
Mom…

6
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:48,399
An emergency transplant is not possible,
so we're keeping her on dialysis.

7
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,903
Since it's a hereditary disorder,

8
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,114
the donor's DNA must be tested too.

9
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,744
Would her chances go up
if she moved to a bigger hospital?

10
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,834
She can't be moved in her state.
She might crash on the way.

11
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,631
We'll test the DNA
of both the donor and recipient.

12
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,800
Other treatments will be carried out too.

13

DETECTIVE KIM

14
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,054
At this point though,
a miracle is what she needs.

15
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,931
Miracles don't exist.

16
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,810
Things like that don't happen
in my pathetic life.

17
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:31,943
DO MIRACLES HAPPEN?

18
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:37,073
Who gets to live and die
depends on what fate decides.

19
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,121
I'm not in the mood for games, you know.

20
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,249
Hey, look up!

21
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,838
-Jeez.
-Now's not the time to play video games!

22
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,638
I bet it's your first time getting smacked
by someone other than your family.

23
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,392
It's my first time smacking someone
other than my family as well.

24
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,484
Besides, I wouldn't have hit you
if you were a complete stranger.

KANG'S PRESS CONFERENCE
ABOUT JESSICA'S MARRIAGE HISTORY

26
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,834
She is my wife
and the mother of a little girl.

27
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,879
I ask you all not to hurt

28
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,800
an innocent family
by spreading rumors that have no ground.

29
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,598
Why did your wife lie
and say that it was her first marriage?

30
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,851
You didn't know that she had been married
before, right?

31
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,104
Why do they say it
as if it's a criminal history?

32
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,525
Hey. Did she commit a crime or something?

33
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,406
They probably just lived together.

34
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:07,121
Did my wife
rob a bank with him or assault someone?

35
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,624
What an idiot.

36
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,167
She's not running for president,

37
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,171
so why does she need to report
her marital status to the public?

38
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,091
I, her husband, knew about it.

39
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,009
She didn't lie to me, so we're good.

40
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,348
I don't think it's something
you should be bullying her about.

45
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,777
I'm done asking you.

46
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,280
Instead, I'll give you a warning.

47
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,702
Don't let your nasty comments
bite you in the ass one day.

48
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,205
Stop crossing lines, all right?

49
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,292
If you hurt my family again,

50
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,169
I'll sue you all for defamation.

51
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,424
Kang Jong-ryeol has finally grown up.

52
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,303
"Jessica survives the plunge."

53
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,347
"Now the arrows point at Kang Jong-ryeol."

54
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,558
Sang-mi, read this.

My gosh.

57
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,944
He must be insane.

58
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,989
It seems like you're better than me.

59
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,491
You have better taste in men.

60
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,333
Pil-gu will be staying at Jun-gi's.

61
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,085
Meanwhile, you should put up a sign--

62
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,755
DETECTIVE KIM

63
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,093
You should go. It seems like you're busy.

64
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,140
Shit. Why does he keep calling me?

65
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,561
You've already done more than enough.

66
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,106
I'll only accept this much.

67
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,527
This isn't the time for that.

68
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,654
Just lean on me for at least this moment.

69
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:07,075
I just don't want it to become a habit.

70
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,162
Maybe it's because you baby me so much,

71
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,540
but I've forgotten
how to take care of myself.

72
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,378
So get going already.

73
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,214
It's how you can help me move on.

74
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,427
Why do you keep calling?

75
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,639
What now?
Am I that essential to the investigation?

76
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,726
What?

77
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,062
Why?

78
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,188
I don't know.

79
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,899
He keeps asking
for his son to bring his glasses.

80
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,527
You come and talk to him.

81
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,780
He was talking one minute,
but then he just clammed up.

82
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,120
So your shoe size is…

83
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,454
Yes, it's 260mm.

84
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,582
Those are from the work boots I sold.

85
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,753
Why did you shove sawdust
down the victims' throats?

86
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,880
To shut them up.

87
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,676
I sealed their lips tight
so that they'd shut up.

88
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,679
Then why did you put in the other thing?

89
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,477
You know, that yellow thing
we found in the victim's throat.

90
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,200
Why aren't you saying anything anymore?

91
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,329
Why won't you allow me any visitors?

92
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,791
Get my son to bring me my glasses.

93
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,209
My glasses.

94
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,171
-Glasses!
-He only keeps mentioning his glasses

95
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,839
and nothing more.

96
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,052
We'll…

97
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,638
let him have them.

98
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,559
I asked for Heung-sik, not you.

99
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,769
Why?

100
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,857
Do you have an order for him or something?

101
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,780
Mr. Kim, Mr. Park, hop in.

102
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,365
-Hello.
-Good morning.

103
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:12,909
Heung-sik.

105
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,955
I understand your situation,

106
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,042
but it's making everyone uncomfortable.

107
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,672
I understand.

108
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,051
Who'd want to work with a killer's son?

109
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,402
I'll just starve to death.

INTERSECTION RICE CAKE

111
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,619
Of course I was going to pay.

112
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,790
I was thinking about
getting it to you in person.

113
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,999
Right.

114
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,460
Heung-sik,

115
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,421
did you really not know?

116
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,966
You were living with him.

117
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:15,179
He either didn't have a clue
or had a hunch.

118
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,138
Who knows?

119
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,767
I have no way of knowing if she only
sold booze or also sold something else.

120
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,104
Heung-sik.

121
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,567
How about we live ethically?

122
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:31,237
Dongbaek, let's live ethically.

ONGSAN HARDWARE

124
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,998
Hello.

125
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,625
-Dongbaek.
-Dongbaek, it's you.

126
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,129
Hello. Can I take Heung-sik with me?

127
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,048
I have a payment to make too.

128
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,598
It's mealtime,
so at least have something to eat.

129
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,310
You're a regular, so consider this
as a token of my gratitude.

130
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,148
Did you just save me

131
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,317
from the other ladies?

132
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,656
You and I are both suffering
because of our parents, right?

133
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,118
Still,

134
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,746
what others think

135
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,167
isn't much
if you just shut out what they say.

136
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,378
Are you giving me advice?

137
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:35,176
Well, I just feel like
I'm looking at myself.

138
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,765
I'm grateful

139
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,809
for what you've done for me

140
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,562
and I'm sorry.

141
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,650
Could I ask something

142
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,569
that I've always been
curious about though?

143
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,741
Hyang-mi was cremated.

144
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,452
It's funny how

145
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,955
-it makes her seem more at peace.
-Go.

146
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,249
Just leave.

147
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,755
I'm exhausted as it is,
so to hell with this visit.

148
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,590
I heard that

149
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,177
she was completely mangled.

150
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,180
Her body…

151
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,683
in the water…

152
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,730
The superglue stuck down her throat
took three days to scrape away.

153
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:35,444
You know, that yellow thing
we found in the victim's throat.

154
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,570
Also,

155
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,240
plankton was found

156
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,535
in Hyang-mi's liver.

157
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,205
Do you know what that means?

158
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,667
When you dumped her in the water,

159
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,753
she was still alive.

160
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,466
So what?

161
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,301
What?

162
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,847
Why are you yapping about that anyway?

163
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,604
You not only drowned her

164
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,107
but shoved sawdust and glue
down her throat.

165
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,900
What did she do to deserve that?

166
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,027
Her screaming was getting on my nerves,

167
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,280
so I shoved them down her throat
to shut her up.

168
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,451
She died because
she made the delivery run.

169
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,619
Why…

170
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,329
Why did she…

171
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,624
Why…

172
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,302
I wonder what you're curious about.

173
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,932
Why did you

174
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,144
always give me freebies?

175
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,480
Well…

176
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,316
Heung-sik, why don't you eat
before you go?

177
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,319
-Heung-sik, you should eat before you go.
-You should.

178
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,280
The peanuts are on the house
for my regulars.

179
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,619
Here.

180
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,955
Gosh, your shoes…

181
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,041
July 9th, on the day of his first crime,

182
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,377
-he used a fire extinguisher.
-It's like you got flour all over them.

183
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,924
Investigators think
that he did this to destroy the evidence.

184
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,261
DONGBAEK

185
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:29,517
YOU ALSO NEED TO STOP BEING A JOKE
JULY 9TH, 2013

186
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,151
Did I?

187
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,696
Why isn't this working?

188
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,208
Ingredients will be delivered soon.

189
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,585
Once the eggs arrive,

190
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,630
I'll whip you up some steamed eggs.

191
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,798
Take your time.

192
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:06,428
Me had no idea that you'd remember
what I gave you

193
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,681
on the house.

194
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,185
"I…"

195
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,229
Sorry?

196
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,234
It's "I had no idea"
instead of "Me had no idea."

197
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,660
Why would you make me steamed eggs too?

198
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,247
Are you…

199
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,836
pitying me?

200
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,174
You're the one who everyone pities,

201
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,305
but am I beneath you now?

202
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,145
Open the pouch.

203
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,574
What's this?

204
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,761
It seems like

205
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,722
Heung-sik has something to say to you.

206
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,100
What was found in Hyang-mi's body

207
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,102
isn't superglue.

208
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,396
Also,

209
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,399
she didn't drown.

210
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,361
She was already dead.

211
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,657
So why…

212
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,660
did you get all riled up?

213
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,164
You…

214
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,876
aren't someone who's capable of killing.

215
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,284
Heung-sik wanted you to know

216
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,330
what Hyang-mi swallowed before she died.

217
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,093
So Dongbaek,

218
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,430
will that delivery truck be here soon?

219
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,119
It's that cough.

220
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,581
It's that weird cough.

221
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,548
Delivery?

222
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,050
Oh, well…

223
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,384
Will you deliver

224
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,887
this time?

225
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,915
CAMELLIA, DELIVERY SERVICE

226
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:07,044
THE WITCH… IF SHE DROWNS, SHE'S
A HUMAN, IF SHE LIVES, SHE'S NOT

227
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,425
Why do you keep reading my journal?

228
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,385
I MUST WAIT
UNTIL SHE FALLS INTO THE TRAP

229
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,522
I never asked for your help.

230
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,359
Why did you bring the truck?

231
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:47,167
Didn't you report the truck as missing
to use it at a time like this?

232
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,188
See that?

233
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,983
I told you
we should have pulled out her nails.

234
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,987
Don't you feel anything?

235
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,409
Didn't you like this girl?

236
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,329
It's not that easy
for someone to like another.

237
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,250
It's not that easy
for someone to like another.

238
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,544
She was like a cat to me.

239
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,339
You can just think of me
as a stray cat too.

240
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,010
Heung-sik.

241
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,808
Will you stop after I die?

242
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,105
You always put on my shoes
whenever you kill someone.

243
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,037
Did you throw yourself
down the construction site

244
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,125
because I pretend to be you
when I kill?

245
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,296
Around four o'clock today,
a man fell down a building

246
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,590
trying to install the outdoor AC unit

247
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,717
for a shopping mall near the terminal.

248
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,762
Were you trying to die?

249
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,182
Dad.

250
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,480
Even so, why did you pretend
like you can't walk?

251
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,316
You even fooled me for five years.

252
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,029
That time when you killed

253
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,074
a cat for the first time as a kid.

254
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,452
If we go back to that time,

255
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,830
will things change?

256
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,462
I guess you wouldn't know

257
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,260
if I was raised like this

258
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,055
or born like this.

259
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,236
I never

260
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,656
looked after my kid

261
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,451
while trying to make a living.

262
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,164
He never had a friend.

263
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:35,836
He continued bringing cats
only to kill them.

264
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,257
That's why I kept letting them go.

265
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,886
I tried lying to him by saying
I threw them out the window.

266
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:50,434
I tried slapping that little boy's face.
I did everything I could imagine,

267
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:53,937
but…

268
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,649
his sense of hearing was too sensitive

269
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,486
and his heart was as hard as a stone.

270
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,709
Yong-sik.

271
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,590
If he's a monster,

272
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,719
aren't I the one

273
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,057
who raised him?

274
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,562
Then why did you go
to the parking lot yourself?

275
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,357
That's when things got weird.

276
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,401
It seemed like
you were just warning Dongbaek.

277
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,905
If she left, this wouldn't have happened.

278
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,617
She kept getting on Heung-sik's nerves.

279
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,256
Why are you making that face?

280
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,511
That makes me feel weird.

281
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,145
Well…

282
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,148
I'll bring you some water--

283
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,916
Hey, man.

284
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:38,834
What is it?

285
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,752
Chief Byeon.

286
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,046
-May I shoot my gun today?
-What?

287
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,008
What's with his crazy eyes again?

288
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,260
-Goodness.
-What's wrong?

289
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,054
I knew it was weird to begin with.

290
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,390
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU EVERY DAY

291
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,808
EVER SINCE THAT DAY

292
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,311
How could Mr. Park
keep his eyes on Dongbaek every day?

293
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,026
This feels wrong.

294
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,029
Is Heung-sik really moving?

295
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,491
You unconsciously put

296
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,369
important things in the side
you are more used to.

297
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,872
That means he can use his left hand too.

298
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,667
What are you saying?

299
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,793
No, wait.

300
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,213
The problem isn't that
the car can go into that alley.

301
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,093
I thought I would be able
to protect Dongbaek.

302
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:45,901
CAMELLIA

303
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,239
Darn it, this is so annoying.

304
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,034
Keep the change.

305
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,804
What?

306
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,640
I already paid you.

307
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,441
What would he know?

308
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,997
I don't get why I always
end up with jerks.

309
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,792
Heung-sik of the hardware store? No way.

310
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,814
-He didn't do anything wrong.
-He's a poor kid too.

311
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,442
Stabbed just once.

312
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,027
Just once in the jugular vein.

313
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,156
Attacked unexpectedly.

314
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,504
YONG-SIK

315
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,392
Dongbaek is at her bar.

316
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,770
Don't eat anything.
I'm bringing some boiled pork over.

317
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,440
I'm coming too, so stay right there.

318
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,360
I made some steamed white rice cake.
I'll bring some, so eat it, okay?

319
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,500
Dongbaek.

320
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,421
Let me give you some advice too.

321
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,717
Don't pity people that easily.

322
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,720
Not everyone can do that.

323
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,539
Goodness.

324
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,125
Did Dongbaek just…

325
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,669
Goodness.

326
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,214
She just hit him with a beer glass.

327
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,720
You killed Hyang-mi, didn't you?

328
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,265
Hey. This is Hyang-mi's beer glass.

329
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,352
I'll kill you if you keep joking around.

330
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,437
Darn you. You little…

331
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,272
What?

332
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,328
I thought I would be able
to protect Dongbaek.

333
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,124
"Don't be a joke?" You stop being a joke.

334
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,042
Hey, are you Joker? Are you?

335
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,422
You can't even do anything
when there's a crowd, you wuss.

336
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:39,467
-Darn you.
-Dongbaek will protect herself.

337
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,052
"Joker"?

338
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,972
What a complete joke.

339
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,560
You jerk!

340
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:57,318
The problem with that alley isn't
that the car can go in there.

341
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,780
You have to protect Joker!

342
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,493
There are police officers here!

343
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,662
Let's deal with this by the law!

344
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,583
We have to catch him alive.
He has to be alive!

345
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,043
-Stop it!
-Everyone, calm down!

346
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,278
A legend begins

347
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:46,075
when a great woman catches a tiger
with her bare hands or something.

348
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,497
Someone like him can't do any real damage.

349
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,708
What's really scary isn't

350
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,835
someone like Joker.

351
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,048
It's when you can't protect someone.

352
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,927
Did you come here to end up like this?

353
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,014
Now I'm stuck
in a love-hate relationship.

354
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,518
What am I going to do now?

355
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,270
That's the end of visiting hours.

356
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,689
Guardians, please leave the room.

357
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,944
Excuse me.

358
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,573
It seems like the bruise on her hand

359
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,076
would hurt a lot. Can you…

360
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,747
You don't have to abide
by the visiting hours anymore.

361
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:37,502
You can tell your family to come.
They can see her whenever they want to.

362
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,504
Why?

363
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,006
Why is that the case with her?

364
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:47,720
If there is anyone she might want to see,
ask them to come today.

365
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,933
Chief, it's Gwi-ryeon again.

366
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,982
But there is no one.

367
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,445
She doesn't have anyone to call.

368
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,033
How can I send her away
in such loneliness?

369
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,453
Mom…

370
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:30,680
I don't have a grandma
or a grandpa, and…

371
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,808
I never had a friend
to visit at the hospital.

372
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,645
It's my first time coming
to the Intensive Care Unit,

373
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,106
and my mom is lying here like this.

374
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,697
What am I going to do? What can I do?

375
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,285
Do I just give up on everything
and watch her lying here?

376
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,088
Let her go in peace.
In peace.

377
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,925
She said she's leaving

378
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,178
with a warm heart, thanks to you.

379
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,765
Ms. Kwak.

380
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,352
Can you…

381
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,272
cut my daughter some slack?

382
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,858
It's true

383
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,986
that Dongbaek had

384
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,156
a tough time in her life.

385
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,326
But she didn't do anything
to deserve that.

386
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,744
It's all my fault.

387
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,706
Once she gets rid of me,

388
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,959
she'll have a peaceful life
without any burdens.

389
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:45,088
Stop bringing this up.
This is already killing me.

390
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,926
I'll tell you something
that'll make you feel more uncomfortable.

391
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,098
I'm actually about to die soon.
So I came back here

392
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,476
because I missed my daughter.

393
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:04,065
And once I got here,
I really liked Yong-sik,

394
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,901
but I also knew
I could really trust you, Ms. Kwak.

395
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,031
Can you please

396
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,283
take Dongbaek in?

397
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,496
She never got anything for free

398
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,581
in her whole life.

399
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,376
So could you please be her free mom?

400
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,922
You know how she is.

401
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,842
If you take her in with pity
and adore her,

402
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,220
she'll never forget how gracious you were.

403
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:39,183
She'll probably make sure
that you never get lonely.

404
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,772
I came to embrace her,

405
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,110
but I got to leave this world
with the warmest heart.

406
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,218
Things must be very easy for you two.

407
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,638
You suddenly say that you two are in love,

408
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,309
then you two are looking grim
because you broke up already.

409
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:23,728
Why?

410
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,147
Is it because of Pil-gu?

411
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,525
Dongbaek.

412
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,196
If the mother looks depressed,

413
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:38,242
how can her son grow up without sadness?

414
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:42,997
You have to be happy
for your kid to be happy.

415
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,875
He has no idea now
because he's only a kid,

416
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,170
but if you put together your own life

417
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,091
and sacrifice everything for his sake,

418
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,468
it'll damage his life greatly as well.

419
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,140
You need to live your life.

420
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,809
Your own life.

421
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:07,063
Forget about Pil-gu or Deok-sun.

422
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:15,113
Why are you giving up already
even before you try to be mean?

423
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,034
If you two decide to break up,
that's your business.

424
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,788
But if you will end up

425
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,666
coming to me,

426
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,711
I will embrace you very fondly.

427
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,506
Very fondly.

428
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:46,394
Yong-sik must be so warm-hearted
because he took after you, Ms. Kwak.

429
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:52,191
Of course, Deok-sun's son is
bound to take after Deok-sun.

430
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,902
Of course, you're meant to fall for him.

431
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,714
Aren't you going to the ward?

432
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,053
No way.

433
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,392
I just came with my mom.
I can't be there with them.

434
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:33,107
Why? Am I getting on your nerves
because I came here?

435
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,278
That's not what's important.

436
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,530
My mom is crying.

437
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,492
That means it's game over.
Why are you spacing out here?

438
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,455
Whenever I hear
that she's crying somewhere,

439
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,457
I run over even
if I'm almost winning the game.

440
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,126
That's family.

441
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,926
I wouldn't say this to you
if you were another guy.

442
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,265
Pil-gu, let's go.

443
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,399
Bye.

444
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,786
Am I nothing but someone who eats?

445
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:30,122
My grandma is sick in bed.
How can I eat now?

446
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:33,834
The best thing an eight-year-old can do
for his grandma is eating well.

447
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,629
What's for dinner?

448
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,341
Grilled beef ribs, made with Korean beef.

449
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,928
Because I'm not someone else's kid?

450
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:48,766
Pil-gu, who's the most
powerful person in Ongsan?

451
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:50,810
You.

452
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,355
Now that you became my kid,

453
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:58,401
Grandma will protect you forever.

454
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,669
Are you going to get up
whenever someone comes out?

455
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,046
You should just stay in there.

456
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:24,468
Goodness.
If you want to go in, let me know.

457
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,846
Why do you keep calling me?

458
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,098
Would you understand
if I told you the numbers?

459
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,064
I can't go in and see her

460
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,568
because she might leave me
once she sees my face.

461
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,379
Hey.

462
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:43,839
May I

463
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,260
just come and sit next to you?

464
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,305
Well…

465
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,058
I mean,

466
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,478
it's tough for me to just watch you.

467
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,443
May I

468
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,322
just come and sit by your side?

469
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,780
SALVATION ARMY
CHARITY POT

470
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,366
Goodness, no one donates
to the Salvation Army anymore.

471
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,577
Why are people doing this already?

472
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:03,085
I don't want to do this anymore.
I give up.

473
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:08,257
I'm done pretending
like I'm nice and strong.

474
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,304
All I did was live diligently.

475
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,516
Why is the world so cruel only to me?

476
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:23,063
When I was the best kid at the orphanage,

477
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,483
all I got from Santa was pencils.

478
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,903
People would fight over
whose parents are richer or poorer.

479
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,405
but I didn't even have parents.

480
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:36,285
Darn it. Even Mario gets something
after he gathers coins in that game.

481
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,954
But why don't I get anything?

482
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,791
I'm sick and tired of
people saying, "You can do it!"

483
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,836
I always end up getting nothing anyway.

484
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,422
Everything gets taken away from me.
A miracle?

485
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,425
A miracle, my foot.

486
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,854
I don't even want to beg for a miracle.

487
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,606
I'm not going to do it.

488
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,399
Don't do it. Don't.

489
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,817
Don't.

490
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,946
This is why
people take the wrong turn in life.

491
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,658
Even a dog gets a treat when they sit.

492
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,244
But why did they

493
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,288
only give you pencils?

494
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,124
What am I going to do about my mom?

495
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,335
ICU, code green. Code green.

496
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,469
It's an emergency,
so have them on standby right now.

497
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,512
Right now!

498
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,686
Ae-ryeon, why? What's going on? Why?

499
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:47,481
No idea. We ran all the tests,
and we aren't completely sure.

500
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,441
-We aren't very sure.
-What?

501
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,197
Hurry up and get in! Hurry!

502
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,575
There was no way
she could get an operation,

503
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,118
but if we aren't sure anymore…

504
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,579
It means we can give it a try.

505
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,955
They'll give it a try.

506
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:06,667
But her condition may worsen soon,
so it's all about the travel time.

507
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,127
Get in. Go. Go inside.

508
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,214
She's getting in now. Right now.

509
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,883
Gwi-ryeon, will you stop calling me?

510
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,093
Okay, fine.

511
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,555
It's because
you didn't call me fast enough.

512
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:20,472
Okay…

513
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,515
Hello? My gosh.

514
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,934
Gwi-ryeon, did she get on?

515
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,186
-Yes.
-My gosh.

516
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,147
-She apparently has a chance.
-Really?

517
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,774
-Okay, that's great.
-Nice.

518
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:39,658
Who gets to live and die
depends on what fate decides.

519
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,038
But…

520
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:48,626
we could still do what we can
before fate makes up its mind.

521
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,339
-Hey, Gwi-ryeon.
-Yes?

522
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,674
Doesn't your little sister
work at the hospital?

523
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,637
-Oh, right.
-She's right.

524
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,389
-I'll call Ae-ryeon.
-Okay.

525
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,100
You guys should
call your acquaintances as well.

526
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,143
Let's do what we can.

527
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,811
-Okay, good idea.
-Okay.

528
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,647
The second youngest sister of…

529
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,815
Everyone in Korea knows one another

530
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,276
through an acquaintance.

531
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,736
Why is her phone turned off?

532
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,866
This place is all clear.

533
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,409
SIMULTANEOUS SIGNAL

534
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,206
Go ahead and call the police.

535
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:36,256
Most things are achieved
with the help of your acquaintances.

536
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,680
The people of Ongsan
have started to interfere.

537
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,891
Will you drive faster?

538
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,352
I'll take responsibility.

539
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:53,107
Meanwhile, Gyu-tae managed
to find an ambulance

540
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,651
equipped with the best medical devices
in the country.

541
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,239
Dongbaek will be arriving soon!

542
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,574
Okay, I got it.

543
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,411
Let's go to the county office.
There's always a traffic jam.

544
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:10,374
We didn't get stopped
by a single traffic light.

545
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,343
And everyone's sincerity was
strong enough to part the Red Sea.

546
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,735
Hello, it's me, Hong Ja-yeong.

547
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,536
HOSPITAL

548
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,748
And the famous nephrologist
who even appears on TV sometimes

549
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,834
was able to get divorced twice
with the help of Ja-yeong.

550
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:59,298
Pil-gu, don't forget to bring
your assignment book.

551
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,257
Okay.

552
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:06,513
A high school student got stuck
underneath a car…

553
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,056
I didn't know you prayed.

554
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,017
Your grandma's sick.

555
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,811
All the men and women
surrounded the vehicle,

556
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,147
and they all tried their best
to lift the car.

557
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,982
It was to rescue the student.

558
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:21,028
This miracle happened
in Jeonju, Jeollabuk-do.

559
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,113
Miracles don't exist.

560
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:26,283
It's just the little heroes inside us
working together.

561
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,410
SALVATION ARMY
CHARITY POT

562
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,373
The donations that quietly pile up.

563
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:39,505
PARCEL DELIVERY

564
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,384
SORRY THERE ARE NO ELEVATORS HERE

565
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,679
The small acts of kindness
done by kind people.

566
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,977
-Miss, have this.
-Yes? Thank you.

567
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,106
Please make sure everything goes well.

568
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,818
I fed Pil-gu and sent him to school.

569
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,653
I also checked his assignment book.

570
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,863
I cleaned up
the refrigerator in Camellia.

571
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,366
I threw away the onions
because they'd gone bad.

572
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,034
Take good care of yourself.

573
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:12,579
The co-op gathered some money for you.
Send me your bank account number.

574
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,459
It's just the result
of all the good deeds you've done.

575
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,379
You just think it's a miracle.

576
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,890
Before you die, you have a dream.

577
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:37,104
And in that dream,
you go back to the moment

578
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,356
you've always regretted the most.

579
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,985
And in that last dream…

580
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,113
I made a different choice.

581
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,699
Dongbaek!

582
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,455
I must've been crazy.

583
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,957
I was out of my mind.

584
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,501
How could I think of leaving you here?

585
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:05,382
I'm so sorry.

586
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,885
I'm sorry, Dongbaek.

587
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,720
I'm so sorry.

588
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,930
It's okay, Mom.

589
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,182
I thought I just let that off my chest.

590
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,687
I thought I'd be in heaven when I woke up.

591
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,610
Her vitals are stable, and she's alert.

592
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,918
Darn it, this is so annoying.

593
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,963
I told you that
you can't do that here. Didn't I?

594
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,381
But I woke up to chaos.

595
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:50,761
A patient's bed is only for one person.
Two people can't sleep up here. You can't.

596
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:53,555
But Yong-sik said his back hurts
too much, so I let him.

597
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,516
Forget your Yong-sik.
I don't care who that is.

598
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,145
Hey, what are you two doing?

599
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,024
-Mom!
-Mother!

600
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:05,734
You're up.

601
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,111
Can you call Dr. Hong?

602
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:12,115
My gosh, Mom.
Why did you sleep for so long?

603
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,992
You got me really scared.

604
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,456
Goodness. Who…

605
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:22,417
Who told you to do this? Who?

606
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:25,587
How am I supposed to live
now that you did that to yourself?

607
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,006
Goodness.

608
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,302
Mom.

609
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,555
Your daughter isn't all that unlucky.

610
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:42,145
Mom, there was only 50 percent chance
that it can be inherited.

611
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,773
Of course, I can
totally win against 50 percent.

612
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:50,070
I already ran a gene test
with the best doctor

613
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:53,031
in the most famous hospital in Seoul,

614
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:56,994
and it's all fine with me, Mom.
There's no problem in giving one to you.

615
00:49:57,077 --> 00:50:00,455
Goodness, if I had known,
I would've put the money in the bank.

616
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,250
They're only giving me
the principal for canceling the plan?

617
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,335
Those jerks.

618
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,548
Is that why you're angry?

619
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,050
Call that guy. The peanuts guy.

620
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,678
That guy has been busy lately.

621
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,348
Right foot, left foot, right, left.

622
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,433
Good job, Ja-yeong.

623
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,143
My goodness.

624
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,937
Come here. Ja-yeong, come on. Okay.

625
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,731
-Okay, great.
-Okay.

626
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,610
Were you always this heavy?

627
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:31,903
My gosh.

628
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:34,865
We're home.

629
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:36,992
Hey.

630
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,703
-Get lost.
-Okay, fine.

631
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:43,331
If you sleep alone when you're drunk,
you could die.

632
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,125
You could seriously die.

633
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,918
Even a healthy, young man

634
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,838
doesn't stand a chance
when it comes to vomiting and diarrhea.

635
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:51,798
Do you get what I mean? Come on.

636
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,133
Come on. My gosh.

637
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,894
You can come inside if you have the guts.

638
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:22,037
MAY 2010

639
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:27,167
My mom told me
to go on a blind date with a lawyer,

640
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,711
and I was wondering why you would do that.

641
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,255
Of course, I will do something big

642
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,424
in the distant future,

643
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,969
but for now,

644
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,847
our journeys have been quite different,

645
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,182
-so…
-Don't you know me?

646
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:44,267
What?

647
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,394
I've known you since high school.

648
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,022
Did you go
to Ongsan High School?

649
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,148
I'm older than you.

650
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,025
Oh, you are?

651
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,819
We went to the same academy.

652
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,362
I see.

653
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,280
Right.

654
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,118
Right, the preparatory academy?

655
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,702
You wouldn't know me.

656
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,540
I only studied,
and you did everything except studying.

657
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,711
I can't believe
I'm an acquaintance with a lawyer.

658
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,714
If we went to the same academy,
we're basically alumni.

659
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,926
Life is all about having good connection.

660
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,889
If you have me as an acquaintance,

661
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,100
it'll be easy to open up
a business in Ongsan.

662
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:27,477
Do you go on blind dates
to make acquaintances?

663
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,813
-What?
-I came out because it was you.

664
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,526
-What?
-Are you leaving in your car?

665
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,653
Hop into mine.

666
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:37,612
Get in.

667
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,949
Get in.

668
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,200
What?

669
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,785
Let's go and get some noodles.

670
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:45,620
Oh, okay.

671
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:49,583
I just played soccer,
so let me shower first--

672
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,209
Just get in.

673
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,086
I'm not dating you for your looks.

674
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:55,922
What?

675
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,552
-A bottle of soju, please.
-Okay.

676
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,388
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

677
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,932
Should I drive on our way back?

678
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,190
Get a toothbrush.

679
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,775
-What?
-Let's spend the night here.

680
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:21,698
Don't you want to?

681
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:32,667
Gyu-tae.

682
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,211
Yes?

683
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,545
Let's do it in March.

684
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,632
-What?
-Our wedding.

685
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:42,802
Ja-yeong.

686
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,013
Don't you want to?

687
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,265
I want to.

688
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,436
Give me your hand.

689
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,363
Ja-yeong.

690
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,408
Why do you want to marry me
when your friends are

691
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,369
all judges and prosecutors?

692
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,704
I feel comfortable

693
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,373
when I'm with you.

694
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:15,252
You don't make me read between the lines.

695
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,380
"Read between the lines"?

696
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,841
-Yes, exactly.
-"Read between the lines."

697
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,596
You make me feel comfortable,
and I like you.

698
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,349
Starting from a certain moment,
your curly hair

699
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,559
started to remind me of Orlando Bloom.

700
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,520
I must be crazy.

701
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:36,940
Then…

702
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,442
I'll drop the honorifics.

703
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,782
Go ahead if you have the guts.

704
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:52,497
You started it.

705
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,333
Are you crazy?

706
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:04,843
Gyu-tae has no guts.

707
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:07,971
No Gyu-tae…

708
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,784
Ja-yeong.

709
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:31,786
What?

710
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:35,332
-Ja-yeong.
-What's your problem?

711
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,375
Ja-yeong!

712
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,602
Gyu-tae!

713
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,355
My gosh, will you be careful?

714
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,273
My goodness.

715
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:04,819
FEEL FREE TO DRY YOUR CHILIS
IN FRONT OF THE POLICE STATION

716
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,327
A hotel? Are you kidding me?

717
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,662
People prefer small weddings these days.

718
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,081
My gosh.

719
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:20,168
Dongbaek's been living a simple life
for over 30 years now.

720
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,837
-She deserves a big wedding.
-My goodness.

721
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:27,300
I've already reserved a suite
at the Ongsan Tourist Hotel.

722
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,551
What about the bouquet?

723
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,096
I'm going to have

724
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,807
the biggest wedding in Ongsan.

725
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,309
Who's going to get the bouquet?

726
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,561
The bouquet?

727
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:42,065
I guess we'll give the bouquet to Helena.

728
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,360
Why would you give it to Helena?

729
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:47,987
Give it to Yeong-sim.

730
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,244
What?
Why would I give it to her?

731
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,663
Give the bouquet to Yeong-sim.

732
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,000
Just do as I say.

733
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,881
My goodness.

734
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,426
My gosh.

735
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:14,097
I thought your job was to help her dog.
I didn't know you were mingling with her.

736
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,267
I know how to love as well.

737
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,353
I'm a single man too, you know.

738
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,897
Hey, where are you going?

739
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,942
-Are you embarrassed?
-My gosh, that punk.

740
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:31,739
My gosh, that was such a huge twist.
I did not expect that.

741
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,366
The fish stew murderer got caught.

742
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,118
-What?
-Look.

743
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:38,496
THE MURDERER TRIED TO KILL EVERYONE
BECAUSE THEY IGNORED HIM

744
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,956
My gosh.

745
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:43,626
Some kill because people get on their
nerves, they were looked down upon…

746
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,712
They've all gone nuts.

747
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,130
-Exactly.
-Darn them.

748
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,175
Mr. Hwang, are you busy?

749
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,969
Well, the thing is,

750
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,387
he wants to see you again.

751
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,222
My gosh.

752
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:57,724
Again?

753
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,603
Why? What?
Why do you want to see me again?

754
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,688
Do you still have stuff to blab about?

755
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:05,190
I didn't kill

756
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:07,859
six people.

757
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,362
-What?
-The Chinese delivery guy.

758
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,574
I didn't kill him.

759
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,869
But someone made it look like I did it.

760
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,498
I guess that's why Dad thought I did it.

761
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:23,750
Hey.

762
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,710
Stop talking nonsense.

763
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,839
-If you killed five, you definitely can--
-Of course, I could.

764
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,300
I definitely could've done that and more.

765
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:34,844
And like me,

766
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,722
if someone killed a person,

767
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,599
they can end up killing ten.

768
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:51,528
Why are you telling me this nonsense?

769
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,115
I always hated

770
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:00,620
how you thought the world
is such a beautiful and innocent place

771
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,705
since when we were kids.

772
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,501
So I thought I should tell you.

773
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,003
Joker

774
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:11,422
is everywhere.

775
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,300
Anyone can become one.

776
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,427
And they'll keep coming.

777
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:31,234
I heard people stopped
searching for Joker already.

778
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,238
Someone killed ten people at once
by adding pesticide to seafood stew.

779
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,782
That's how things are.

780
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,215
Hey, Heung-sik.

781
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:58,886
I guess you want to leave

782
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,681
a little bit…

783
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,183
a little bit of a leery feeling

784
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,686
at the very end of your case.

785
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,191
But I'll give you an answer.

786
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,242
Do you think there are more of you or us?

787
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:26,331
Bad guys are only 1 in a 100,

788
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,916
but good people will
continue to swarm in.

789
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:33,546
Even in movies, in the last scene,

790
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:37,425
the police will make sure they always

791
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:39,052
come in as a group.

792
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,595
We come in as a group.

793
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,348
No matter how much you joke around,

794
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:47,185
you will always get beaten in numbers.

795
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:49,562
That's the law of numbers,

796
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,773
and you will always be the outcast.

797
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,567
We're the mainstream.

798
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:58,404
We're right behind Dongbaek.
What can he do anyway?

799
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,656
He can't beat us.

800
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:03,743
Of course, you can never win
against a huge group.

801
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,828
-Goodness.
-You're right.

802
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,373
We are people

803
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:12,752
who formed a group and even beat
a district magistrate to death.

804
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:17,340
-That's how it is.
-I can't believe I live with a thug.

805
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:23,638
-Come and eat. Eat before you work.
-Okay.

806
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,395
Mom, are you serious?

807
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,313
Is this really our place?

808
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,483
Mr. No, are you sure
I no longer have to pay you the rent?

809
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:37,360
Of course, you don't.

810
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:40,321
I told you that
I'll do at least one thing for you.

811
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,866
My mom ended up
seeing her dream come true.

812
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:45,868
And Dongbaek…

813
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:50,039
Excuse me, sir,
are you throwing this box away?

814
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,457
Oh, yes.

815
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,292
…saw her dream come true too.

816
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,921
Why do you want to know what my dream is?

817
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:58,798
The lost and found?

818
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,384
Why do you want to go there?

819
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:05,012
Everyone says that when they're there.

820
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,141
Whenever they find something,
they always say that.

821
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,143
What? Say what?

822
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,395
"Thank you."

823
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:14,939
They always say thanks.

824
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,779
When you aren't home,
I can take your delivery.

825
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:24,615
Dongbaek started

826
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:28,661
providing a friendly service
to overuse her power.

827
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,873
Hey, I'm taking my delivery. Thanks!

828
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:33,082
Sure!

829
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,717
I kept it here in secret
since two days ago.

830
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,051
Gosh, thank you so much.

831
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,637
I'll get another one delivered here
in secret.

832
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,014
Thanks!

833
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:50,683
Dongbaek.

834
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,727
Yong-sik.

835
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,273
How many times did people thank you today?

836
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,150
Seven times.

837
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,240
What?

838
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,076
Are you giving him
your inheritance already?

839
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,120
I'll say this once, so listen up.

840
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,124
There's five million won in here.

841
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,294
-Five million?
-Five million won?

842
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:19,754
Darn it, what is he saying?

843
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:20,713
Dongbaek,

844
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:22,465
just take it.

845
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:24,091
You can just take it.

846
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:28,095
I thought you made a couple billion,
but I guess you're pretty cheap.

847
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,560
There will always be
five million won in here.

848
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:39,065
If you use 50,000 won,
you'll see five million, not 4.95 million.

849
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,150
If you use a million, it'll be five.

850
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:44,028
Even if you use up,
it'll be filled up immediately.

851
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,113
Well.

852
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:50,368
It's like a magic pot
where you can five million won forever.

853
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:52,578
I'll support Pil-gu

854
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,873
with this magic pot
until he goes to MLB.

855
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,421
-Hey, Mom.
-Mother.

856
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:03,923
However,

857
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:05,967
you two can't use

858
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,719
any of that money
to pay for anything for your wedding.

859
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:10,888
This isn't Hollywood,
and I'm not that cool.

860
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:13,057
That's only to be used for Pil-gu.

861
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:17,436
So do not dare to use this card
to pay for anything

862
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,772
for your wedding.

863
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:34,287
Hey, Ja-yeong.

864
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,122
The thing is,

865
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:39,709
I cooked way too much ox knee soup.

866
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,919
And I thought maybe you might want some.

867
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,338
You cooked ox knee soup?

868
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:49,010
Mother, to be honest…

869
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:53,472
Yes, what it is? Go ahead and tell me.

870
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,600
You can be honest with me now.

871
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,519
I don't like ox knee soup.

872
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,605
That's Gyu-tae's favorite food.

873
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:04,984
Mother, I think it's time
that you know what I like.

874
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:09,655
I like beef bone soup. Beef bone soup.

875
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,366
Goodness.

876
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,202
-My gosh.
-Hey, Dumpling Hwang!

877
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,372
You need to keep your conscience, okay?

878
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:22,668
Make sure you use good Korean meat,

879
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,630
and don't pick your nose
while you make dumplings.

880
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,465
It's because

881
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,801
those dumplings are for someone important.

882
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,262
Who? Like the third-generation only son
of No clan?

883
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,353
Why would I pick my nose
while making dumplings?

884
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:44,857
And wait,
why do you keep talking casually with me?

885
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:47,902
-When did you graduate college?
-Goodness.

886
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:49,195
You went to college?

887
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:52,323
-I'm still older than you!
-I talk casually to all my friends.

888
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:56,577
Should I stop?

889
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,914
Darn it. Whatever.

890
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:02,083
Should I stop talking casually?

891
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:03,501
No.

892
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,049
I'll give you another serving
on the house.

893
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:12,885
It's for the three of you.

894
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,014
One of the teams
went back to their beginning.

895
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:22,561
Meanwhile, some people are trying hard
to become grown-ups.

896
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,522
Go ahead and take your photos.

897
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:27,024
No.

898
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:29,318
I quit social media.

899
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:32,363
Then,

900
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:34,573
I'll just go ahead and start eating.

901
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:38,411
Are you serious?

902
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:42,498
Why would you eat from the middle?
You could've started from the side.

903
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:46,377
That's why I told you to take a photo.

904
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,212
I never told you to quit social media.

905
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:50,297
You should just do it in moderation.

906
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,799
How can I do it in moderation?

907
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:54,218
Social media was like my respirator.

908
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:58,347
Everyone on social media praises me,
and tells me I'm pretty.

909
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,765
They all envy me.

910
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:05,604
People still write comments
saying you should cheer up.

911
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,481
That's not what I want to hear.

912
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:08,983
I want people to envy me.

913
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:14,447
People are generous when it comes
to consoling you, aren't they?

914
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,615
Everyone's trying to console me.

915
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:19,160
When I uploaded a photo
for weighing 49 kg,

916
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:21,078
I got less than 100 likes.

917
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:24,248
But now, everyone's telling me
to cheer up.

918
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:28,335
People have trouble
showing their jealousy,

919
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:31,380
but they're quick to console people.

920
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,758
Whenever my batting average goes down,

921
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:37,386
people suddenly become really nice
and tell me to cheer up.

922
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:44,852
So what?

923
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:48,230
Were you lonely as well?

924
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:53,652
If I also felt that way,

925
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:55,988
our family would've been a mess.

926
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:58,657
It's easy to pity

927
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,451
but hard to envy.

928
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:04,789
We know envy and jealousy are
on the same team.

929
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:10,795
But I was that desperate
to be a celebrity,

930
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:15,132
even in that little world.

931
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:16,675
My gosh.

932
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,095
One second.

933
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:23,140
Here. Take it. Take the picture.

934
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:24,975
I'll take it for you.

935
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:30,314
Come on, stop crying.

936
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:31,982
I'll do that for you

937
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,111
from time to time in words.

938
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,570
Do what?

939
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:40,282
I can tell you that I like you,
and that you're so pretty.

940
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,332
Will you stop making that noise?

941
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:52,128
Your daughter's suffering,
but you seem to have an amazing appetite.

942
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:55,589
Hey, I bought this rice and meat.

943
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:57,091
I bought this with my money.

944
01:08:57,883 --> 01:08:59,510
Who are you to tell me what to do?

945
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:05,099
So what

946
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:08,227
if I just slapped you?

947
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,271
Come here. Gosh, my legs.

948
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:12,898
It'll probably damage my business

949
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,151
if I go on a honeymoon for five days.

950
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,861
Just go. Go.

951
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:21,282
After I was told that I'd die,
the world looked so beautiful.

952
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:25,619
Get out there while your joints are fine
and while you don't have to sleep early.

953
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:27,580
I'll end up sleeping on the streets.

954
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:29,874
Even if you prepare for your life,

955
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:32,293
you can't even stop a bird
from pooping on your car.

956
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:37,256
But the rule is that you get
a happy ending after much suffering.

957
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:42,761
Cinderella and Kong-jwi are both idiots.

958
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:46,140
How can they live like that
to have a better life later?

959
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:48,392
A happy ending, my foot.

960
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:51,645
If you save your food to eat it later,
it'll only taste awful.

961
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:54,106
It tastes the best to eat it all
while you're hungry.

962
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,609
So you have to be diligent

963
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:59,653
and be happy when you can
instead of saving it up for later.

964
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:00,905
I see.

965
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,949
I see. That's your problem.

966
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:04,909
What?

967
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:07,828
I mean, you don't have to
try so hard to be happy.

968
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:12,082
You don't chase after your happiness.

969
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,959
You savor it.

970
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:18,380
Put your feet on the ground
where you're standing

971
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:21,091
and take a look around.

972
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:22,968
Look.

973
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:27,306
-There are flowers everywhere.
-All right, smarty-pants.

974
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:31,310
My life was like an apple tree
planted in the sand.

975
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:34,980
The waves kept coming without ceasing.

976
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,106
I can see the sprouts.

977
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,983
But I didn't have any soil

978
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:41,737
or other trees to reach out and depend on.

979
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:44,698
All right!

980
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:47,117
But now people began to sprout around me.

981
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:50,204
All I did was mingle my roots with them.

982
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:52,581
And how solid my roots have become.

983
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,500
It's best to drink when it's light out.

984
01:10:56,126 --> 01:11:00,798
I could finally see the sea breeze,
the sand…

985
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,010
PIL-GU LOVES DONGBAEK

986
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:09,807
…and the dazzling sky
that had always been around me.

987
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,141
Dongbaek!

988
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:16,522
-Gosh.
-Are you okay?

989
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:21,193
Dongbaek, I was shocked
as I was running up to you.

990
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:22,152
Why?

991
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:25,990
Are you a human or a flashlight?

992
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,075
How can your face beam like that?

993
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:30,744
-My gosh.
-Do you like me that much?

994
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,497
You drive me crazy.

995
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:36,875
Goodness.

996
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:44,466
Can a person become a miracle for another?

997
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,261
Yong-sik. You know,

998
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,306
do you think

999
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,766
it's a miracle

1000
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:54,685
that I met you?

1001
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:59,398
Do you believe something
that only sounds like a lottery?

1002
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,278
No.

1003
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,781
I believe myself.

1004
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,201
Me too.

1005
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:13,829
I believe you too.

1006
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:23,881
Wait, look. What is that?

1007
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:27,634
Dongbaek.

1008
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:31,013
Why don't we close Camellia for the day?

1009
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:33,474
-What do you think?
-No, I can't do that.

1010
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:39,063
Hey, Mom. I'm a little busy right now.

1011
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:40,647
You need to stop calling me.

1012
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:43,025
Okay, I'll be right there.

1013
01:12:44,276 --> 01:12:45,527
If you miss me,

1014
01:12:46,653 --> 01:12:47,738
turn on the TV.

1015
01:12:48,655 --> 01:12:51,033
Mom, I love you.

1016
01:13:14,264 --> 01:13:15,182
Thank you.

1017
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:19,144
I'd like to thank all of you
for coming here today.

1018
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:22,064
I'd also like to thank my parents

1019
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:24,733
who are currently watching me on TV.

1020
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:27,486
This is the second chapter
of my baseball career.

1021
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:28,612
I'll do my best

1022
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:31,448
and make sure I show good results.

1023
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:32,825
Thank you.

1024
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:47,005
Goodness. You're crying again?

1025
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:56,181
Honey.

1026
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:58,600
Now that I think about it,

1027
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:02,396
everything about my life was

1028
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:04,606
nothing but a miracle.

1029
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:32,843
CAN A PERSON BECOME A MIRACLE
FOR ANOTHER?

1030
01:14:57,576 --> 01:15:00,537
WHEN THE CAMELLIA BLOOMS

1031
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:04,500
CHEERS TO ALL OF YOU, WHO ARE

1032
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,835
THE STRONGEST,

1033
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:10,130
THE TOUGHEST,

1034
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:14,968
THE MOST SPLENDID,

1035
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:18,180
AND THE MOST PRAISEWORTHY
IN THE WORLD

1036
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:24,436
AND WHO ARE MAKING
YOUR OWN MIRACLES EVERY DAY

1037
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:29,066
BY OVERCOMING MANY OBSTACLES IN LIFE

1038
