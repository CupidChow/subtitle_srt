1
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,646
Come on. How could this serve as evidence?

2
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,941
I tapped the back of her shoulder in 2016?

3
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,778
Bringing it up now
is just totally ridiculous.

4
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,863
-But you probably did--
-You did it, though.

5
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:18,578
Even if I really did tap her
on the back of her shoulder,

6
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,581
what about the statute of limitations?
It happened in 2016.

7
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,501
There can't be
a three-year statute of limitations on it.

8
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,546
The thing is, that shoulder incident

9
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,549
isn't the only case
described in this ledger.

10
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,136
My eyes are so dry.

11
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,515
What? Did you actually cry?

12
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,309
-Jeez, why would I cry?
-This is ridiculous.

13
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,312
-Goodness.
-All right. I'll tell you what I think.

14
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,359
All the incidents are described
in great detail in this ledger.

15
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:54,280
And what you did is utterly disgusting.

16
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,034
I'd say this can serve
as irrefutable evidence.

17
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,036
That is my legal conclusion.

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,955
Did you go to law school?

19
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,792
Honey, say something.
These clueless people think

20
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,294
they can say
whatever they want and call it the law.

21
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:25,061
So? Do you really plan to press charges
against my husband?

22
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,151
Yes, that is my plan.

23
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,403
But he's your landlord.

24
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,573
He has a lot of money,
and he's well-connected.

25
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,329
Still, I want to do it.

26
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,623
You know I'm a lawyer, right?

27
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,543
It won't be an easy fight.

28
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:52,547
My wife went to Seoul National University
Law School.

29
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,842
Her old classmates are now lawyers
at top-notch law firms.

30
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,344
I'm that competent.

31
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,433
So...

32
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,323
call me if you need legal advice.

33
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,074
HONG JA-YEONG LAW OFFICE

34
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,662
You don't need to pay me.

35
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,886
Hong Ja-yeong!

36
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,360
Why do you guys keep following me?

37
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,529
Can't you just say something?

38
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,614
Say what?

39
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,200
Let's split up and go our own ways.

40
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,744
Gosh, seriously. This is so unlike you.

41
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,538
You're not even smacking me.
Just slap me on the back!

42
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,915
You're scaring me.

43
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,293
I have a headache. I should head in.

44
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,589
Dongbaek.
Why are you following her inside?

45
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,967
Don't come inside.

46
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,385
Dongbaek.

47
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,972
My mom can hit you.

48
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,266
Stop talking nonsense. Just get going.

49
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,520
BAEKDU GRANDMA MARINATED CRAB

50
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,440
Gosh, this is bad.

51
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,236
I must've been out of my mind.

52
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,863
What was I thinking?

53
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,158
Gosh, I'm so mean.

54
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,495
I'm such a traitor. What a sneaky bitch.

55
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,290
You don't have the guts to be a bitch.

56
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,547
I tried so hard to act

57
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,466
all haughty and tough.

58
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,012
But the thing is, Ms. Kwak...

59
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,890
I guess...

60
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,731
I missed having someone around.

61
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,656
I guess I missed having someone
who cares and worries about me.

62
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,577
I realized that one person
who worries about me

63
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,123
can change my whole world.

64
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,127
What should I do?

65
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,213
And what would you do?

66
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,593
BAEKDU GRANDMA MARINATED CRAB

67
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,480
Parents can never win
against their children,

68
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,565
so what can I do?

69
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,570
I'd beat him up if he were 15.

70
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,574
He's acting like he's 15
when he's over 30 now.

71
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,409
How could I stop him?

72
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,415
I can only rely on time.

73
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,001
If it's just a shower, it will stop.

74
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:20,838
Right.

75
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,178
Do you think I'm heartless
for saying things like this?

76
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,847
No.

77
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:36,229
You're so calm and collected,
which is making me feel even worse.

78
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:42,026
A fire that burns quickly
also fizzles out quickly.

79
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,780
And men are a lot more fickle-minded
than women are.

80
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,493
So don't just fall for anyone
when they say

81
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,328
they'll give you their everything.

82
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,081
You should take time
and really observe him.

83
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,086
If you still want to be with him
even after watching him

84
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,964
for a long time...

85
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,559
We can talk about it again
when that happens.

86
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,903
If...

87
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,034
I'm sure I want to be with him
even after watching him,

88
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,122
will you approve of me?

89
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,838
Dongbaek.

90
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,091
I'm sure you can understand
because you're raising Pil-gu.

91
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,428
My heart broke even when
he put his feet in mud

92
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,430
because he is my dear son.

93
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,308
Knowing how hard it is
to raise someone else's child,

94
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,351
how could I tell him to choose that path?

95
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:05,860
Right.

96
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:16,954
Dongbaek.

97
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,999
Gosh, I told you to just go.

98
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,542
Dongbaek.

99
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,964
Well, do you want to go
have some dumplings with me?

100
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,302
As they say, you can't do anything
if you don't eat.

101
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,515
Your heart and intestines
are only a handspan apart,

102
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,018
so you need to fill up your stomach
when you're upset.

103
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:43,272
That fills you up
emotionally as well, and...

104
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,404
Okay, let's go.
Let's go for some dumplings.

105
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,240
-What?
-Let's go.

106
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,699
We're going? Really?

107
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,884
I have to admit that
I do care a bit about you.

108
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,763
Even earlier, I went all crazy
because I was worried

109
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,640
that you might end up in jail.

110
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,769
I've been crazy about you
for a long time now.

111
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,730
Even at the police station,

112
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,402
I could only see you.
I couldn't even see Ms. Kwak.

113
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,611
Like a disloyal bitch.

114
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,905
I really shouldn't be like this.

115
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,158
Am I bewitched by something?

116
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,413
Dongbaek, I've been bewitched by you
for a long time.

117
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:47,211
But when I see Ms. Kwak,
I feel so guilty and bad.

118
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:54,218
And now that I'm sitting here with you
to have dumplings,

119
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,345
I feel...

120
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,891
You feel happy, right?

121
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:07,023
You actually feel good inside, don't you?

122
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:16,115
Well, then perhaps we should...

123
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,327
I'm not going to date you.

124
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,454
What?

125
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,126
Now that it's all out in the open,

126
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:33,716
let me tell you exactly what's going on
so that you don't overreact.

127
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,386
I do care about you,

128
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,431
but it's not like I'm so crazy about you
that I'll ignore

129
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,309
what Ms. Kwak, Pil-gu,
and everyone else thinks.

130
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,062
And I don't want things
to get that messy anyway.

131
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,398
Why is that "messy"?

132
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,150
Love is like fire.

133
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,902
No, I don't want that.

134
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,529
Well...

135
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,408
As you know,
I've been in that kind of love.

136
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,745
And I lost.

137
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,127
I'm not young,

138
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,213
and I'm not alone.

139
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,590
I have to earn money too.

140
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,804
I can't shove everything aside
and get all lovey-dovey.

141
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:24,058
Find someone else if you want
some kind of passionate relationship.

142
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,601
I'm not doing it.

143
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,856
You're pushing me away again.

144
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,862
Let's drop it. Why don't we just eat

145
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,864
these dumplings?

146
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,377
Yong-sik.

147
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,215
Steam is all you need to cook dumplings,
you know.

148
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,301
You don't have to boil them to cook them.

149
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,095
Right.

150
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,810
Forget fire.

151
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,270
Why don't we

152
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,315
just take it slow and be warm together?

153
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,992
You can love like fire,
but it's all over when you break up.

154
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,287
I've had to say goodbye to my mom

155
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,665
as well as to that guy.

156
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,253
If I have to go through that again...
Gosh, I can't do it.

157
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,422
Then I'll really be knocked out.

158
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,349
So, you're saying...

159
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,145
I mean, you want us

160
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:56,984
to do something together, right?

161
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,652
Yes.

162
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,071
Let's just...

163
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,868
Well...

164
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,914
Let's see how things go.

165
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,885
I want to be warm

166
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,221
for a long time.

167
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,617
I'll take back what I said if you cry.

168
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:49,870
Okay.

169
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,999
Thanks.

170
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,879
KAESONG DUMPLINGS

171
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,758
So your priority is being Pil-gu's mom

172
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,802
and the owner of Camellia.

173
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,888
And after that, you're...

174
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,059
So you should also prioritize
being a good son to Ms. Kwak

175
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,979
and a good police officer
for the community of Ongsan.

176
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,774
After you do all that,
we can hang out and see how things go.

177
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,861
And please go and check
on Yeong-sim's dog.

178
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,114
Then take the leap
and promise me something

179
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,616
now that you've made up your mind
to try this with me.

180
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,869
What do you mean?

181
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,538
Well, whether
we're actually dating or not...

182
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,584
Right, we should do what needs to be done.

183
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,420
Do what? My goodness.

184
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,131
Gosh, do I look that easy to you?

185
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,842
Are you a teenager or what?

186
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:45,843
What?

187
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,512
I guess you're very interested
in that field these days.

188
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,182
Then what are you talking about?
What kind of promise?

189
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,438
Just know

190
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:03,360
that I'll always be within a 400-meter
radius from you from now on.

191
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,616
On days that you feel down or upset,

192
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,118
don't be sad all alone.

193
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:15,247
All you need to do
is run to me right away.

194
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,918
Just promise me

195
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,211
that one thing.

196
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,716
Let's make it official.

197
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,308
Let's pinky swear.

198
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,740
I promise.

199
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,333
-And about Mr. No...
-Yes.

200
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,961
THE ONGSAN FAIRY

201
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,212
The thing is...

202
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,262
Why don't you just pull out a tooth
with a cavity or something?

203
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,015
I was born with super healthy teeth,
so it's fine.

204
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,936
If you want to keep your job, you need
to make it look like it was mutual.

205
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,774
Is it good? Are you enjoying your noodles?

206
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,818
You're here to eat this, aren't you?

207
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,570
I've been told to do nothing.

208
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:30,948
By whom?

209
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,743
Dongbaek. She said she'll take care of it.

210
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,704
Dongbaek? What's she going to do?

211
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,790
She'll press charges too
and call it even?

212
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,085
I don't know.
She just said she'll take care of it.

213
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,550
I believe her for some odd reason.

214
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,428
Yesterday, I noticed

215
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,472
that she's changed a little.

216
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,811
Does Ongsan have that effect on people?

217
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,191
I feel like all the women here

218
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,445
are learning something on their own.

219
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,823
CAMELLIA
FOR LEASE, AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY

220
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,076
One, two, three, four.

221
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,078
Four exclamation marks.

222
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,751
Hello, this is Camellia.

223
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,462
Pardon me?

224
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,338
Oh, hello.

225
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,341
I scanned and saved everything in it.

226
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,177
I e-mailed you the file.

227
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,220
But why are you doing this?

228
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,930
LAWYER HONG JA-YEONG

229
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,016
You can't rely on these pieces of paper.

230
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,560
If someone runs away with it,
you'll have nothing.

231
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,900
So you're really helping me
press charges against your husband?

232
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,154
To be honest, I just wrote stuff
like writing a diary.

233
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,697
I just needed to vent.

234
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,867
Record things properly
whatever that is for.

235
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,329
Make sure everyone knows
that you have that thing.

236
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,789
Sorry?

237
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,416
Don't rumors follow everywhere you go?

238
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,960
I'm sure they've always worked
to your disadvantage.

239
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,754
It's time you benefited from them.

240
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,216
I'm not really following.

241
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:16,929
Just think that you're carrying a sword.

242
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:22,518
If anyone provokes you, just bite
that person instead of squirming.

243
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,772
I heard she has a ledger
about people's faults.

244
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,441
I heard that power is shifting now.

245
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,235
"Restaurant C's guest log.

246
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,696
August 14, 2019. Farewell party
for Mr. Park in the secretary's office.

247
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,824
Mixed shots of hard liquor and beer--"

248
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,660
Wait. Anything about
the state I was in that day?

249
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,828
You were dead drunk.

250
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,039
"Dead drunk"? Damn it.

251
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,375
What were you guys doing?

252
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,960
-We were mixing the drinks.
-What?

253
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,338
Did I hire you guys to mix drinks for me?

254
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,340
We only did it
because you told us to, sir.

255
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,678
What else? Did I talk nonsense

256
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,763
or do anything stupid?

257
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,182
No, sir.

258
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,893
But you left your autograph
on the wall there.

259
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,355
I've signed my autograph
hundreds of times,

260
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,232
so I couldn't have made any mistakes.

261
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,901
The thing is, you wrote
something else.

262
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,069
What did I write?

263
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,156
Depending on how it's interpreted,
it could be seen as a little...

264
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,741
-What?
-A little...

265
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,871
It could be seen as dirty talk
in my opinion.

266
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,456
What exactly did I write?

267
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,835
Million-dollar legs!

268
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,211
DONGBAEK
MILLION-DOLLAR LEGS

269
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,089
With your signature underneath.

270
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,257
What do you think?

271
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,094
Should I report this to the party first?

272
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,478
Is he going to settle with her?

273
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,355
Gyu-tae, go and beg her.

274
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,442
It's not like you went to jail
while fighting for democracy.

275
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,362
Who'd want to vote for you
if you went to jail

276
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,072
for touching a bar lady's hands?

277
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,826
His political career will be over.

278
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,952
This is all...

279
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,873
political maneuvering.

280
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:13,962
This is considered defamation of
a public figure and political maneuver.

281
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,298
Even Clinton won the reelection.

282
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,967
This won't be able to harm my future.

283
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,469
Are you Bill Clinton?

284
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,096
Ongsan people are not
as forgiving as those in the US.

285
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,514
I will go my way.

286
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,768
The horse can't go forward
if you turn around every time a dog barks.

287
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,146
What? What are you saying?

288
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,773
He can't even talk now.

289
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,734
I'm totally fine.

290
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,904
I'll stay composed
and keep my horse moving forward--

291
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,197
-Okay, go!
-What?

292
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,199
Carry on. We have to work.

293
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,285
Stop wasting your time here
and go ride your horse, you fool.

294
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,370
I should--

295
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,248
Why are you standing
on my dried radish greens?

296
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,626
You started talking to me first.

297
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:56,129
We were chatting among ourselves.
You're going the wrong way. It's this way.

298
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,799
-Giddy up!
-Hey, your zipper is down.

299
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,600
Shit.

300
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,565
Are you looking for the ledger?
She took it with her.

301
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,777
Gosh.

302
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,030
Is that a handbag or something?
Why does she have to carry it around?

303
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,449
Were you going to steal it?

304
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,244
You know that's stealing, right?

305
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,955
At least you can't say such things to me.

306
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,417
Give me the money for my plane ticket
by this Friday.

307
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,463
Gosh. Do I need to do an exorcism
or something?

308
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,258
I get it that you're going through
a hard time,

309
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:44,553
-but you aren't the only one, you know.
-Hey, you.

310
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,099
Are you picking a fight with me?
Is that it?

311
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,021
Hey, why did you have to hit my head?

312
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,565
Get out of the way. I have dementia.

313
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,693
By the way,
why are you doing all this for me?

314
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,366
No special reason.

315
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,494
I can't help but observe you.

316
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,541
You pique people's interest, you know.

317
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,711
But why would you help me?

318
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,382
By the way,

319
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,427
what eye cream...

320
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,681
No, never mind.

321
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,976
HONG JA-YEONG LAW OFFICE

322
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,774
Is she really going to side with Dongbaek
or what?

323
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,525
Hang on.

324
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:45,072
Shall I just blame everything
on this medication?

325
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,167
Hey! Wait.

326
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,503
Why are you coming out of there?

327
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:05,300
Why did you meet with my wife?
Are you two ganging up on me or what?

328
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,386
I saw her for a consultation.

329
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,723
Is that your treasure? Let me see.

330
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,892
-My gosh.
-Why are you holding it in your arms?

331
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,104
It's mine, so mind your own business.

332
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,566
Hey!

333
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,656
Have some shaved ice.

334
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,873
You don't quite understand
the situation right now.

335
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,584
I'm going to press charges
against Yong-sik as well.

336
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,546
I can prove what he did
because my dental implant fell out.

337
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,966
I have proof, too.

338
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,427
You're one gutsy woman.

339
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,637
How...

340
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,181
You can't do this
to your landlord.

341
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:55,892
I can.

342
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,395
What?

343
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,523
"If you're rude, I'll be rude."

344
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,484
That's my life's motto from now on.

345
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,868
As they say, "You avoid poop because
it's scary, not dirty."

346
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,413
Shit. I said it the other way around.

347
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,169
If you're scared, just apologize.

348
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,672
Forget it. I'll let this one slide
as I am a public figure,

349
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,091
so let's both drop the charges.

350
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,384
Apologize.

351
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,553
Can't you grasp the situation?

352
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,889
The fact is that
Yong-sik punched me first.

353
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,226
And my molar has fallen out
because of that.

354
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,563
-Just apologize.
-No, I won't. I refuse.

355
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,828
I have a scanned copy of this

356
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,332
in a flash drive, and another copy of it
in my email.

357
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,211
Are you all going to college or something?

358
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,296
How come everyone is so smart?

359
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,089
See you in court.

360
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,700
-Stop talking down to me.
-I'm just speaking English.

361
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,166
I'm truly sorry.

362
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,793
I'm very sorry.

363
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:46,586
Happy now?

364
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,258
Don't ever mess with me again.

365
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,554
What's with you? Are you high?

366
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,057
The trigger has been pulled,
and the old Dongbaek is dead.

367
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,810
So from now on,
if you even mention peanuts, I will

368
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,062
shoot.

369
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,070
Did you get a prescription
from the neurosurgeon at the intersection?

370
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,200
I'm going to shoot you without hesitating.

371
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,372
I'm so not used to this.

372
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,542
It's not easy for me
to become so tough overnight.

373
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,213
Hello.

374
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,759
That must be the ledger.

375
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,679
I can't believe that girl.

376
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,180
I can't believe her.

377
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,190
I can't believe she wrote that
behind everyone's back.

378
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,651
-That absolutely...
-Serves them right.

379
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,574
It serves those ungrateful men right
to be afraid of her ledger.

380
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,827
Dongbaek can be pretty sly.

381
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,038
It's a compliment.

382
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,457
It's great.

383
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,336
RESIDENTS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION

384
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,964
You call this cooperation?

385
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,844
So are you telling us

386
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,972
to investigate every single person

387
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,558
within the jurisdiction
who wears 260mm size shoes?

388
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,560
Didn't you see Unanswered Questions?

389
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,812
The footprint
found on the scene was 260mm.

390
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:31,858
In that case, we'll have to start
with kids who are around 15,

391
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,070
and we'll have to check everyone
who's alive above that age.

392
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,491
And we don't have enough manpower to...

393
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,368
Good luck.

394
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,663
-What?
-I'm bidding you good luck.

395
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,345
Goodness, your shoes are size 260mm, too.

396
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,430
Suspect number one.

397
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,810
I mean, does he think this is the 80s?

398
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,770
We need a scientific investigation.

399
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:12,440
Even if we do that, you won't be
a part of it. Scientific guys will do it.

400
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,567
I can't approve
of an investigation like this.

401
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,695
Did anyone ask for your approval?

402
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:20,657
This kind of sloppy investigation is
unthinkable in Miami.

403
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,033
Then go there.

404
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,453
Stop giving us headaches
and transfer to the Miami office.

405
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,080
What? What now?

406
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,874
Do I have to go door-to-door
measuring people's feet?

407
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,626
You should

408
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,838
turn in an application
to the Miami precinct.

409
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,882
If you want to do that,
I'll write you a recommendation letter.

410
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,595
You can measure people's feet.

411
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,556
I'll do my own investigation.

412
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,683
Smart people
couldn't catch him for six years.

413
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:47,851
What can you do?

414
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,937
I have a quality they don't have.

415
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,397
What do you have?

416
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,358
Who in the world do you think you are?

417
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,487
Me? I'm a native.

418
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,615
What?

419
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,785
I'm a native of Ongsan.

420
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,292
If you've attended middle
and high school here,

421
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,502
you're pretty much
a family member here.

422
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:18,256
Everyone is a brother, a sister,
an aunt, or an uncle of someone you know.

423
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,717
The system is kind of like
a group of mafia bosses.

424
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:25,555
Hey, do you think my eyebrows look uneven?

425
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:26,806
-Yes.
-Hey.

426
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,850
My husband is definitely cheating on me.

427
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,394
-You really can't arrest him for that?
-Ladies here

428
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,314
-tell me just about anything.
-Forget it!

429
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,150
What you're doing could be seen as...

430
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,818
And in this town...

431
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,529
Even if you put me behind bars,
I won't say a word.

432
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,656
People are aggressively mean to outsiders.

433
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,496
Why are they asking us about Joker
when they failed to catch him?

434
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,706
-Goodness.
-What do you think they're doing?

435
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,752
They're just causing mayhem in the
neighborhood and dropping our land value.

436
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,337
-Say that again.
-That's it.

437
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,546
Don't say anything.

438
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,258
We'll all say that we don't know a thing.

439
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,844
-Let's all do that.
-We'll all do that.

440
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,638
What do you mean, you'll all do that?

441
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,681
It's not like you know something.

442
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,016
-What?
-What?

443
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,645
Of course, we do. We know everything.

444
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,396
-We do.
-We know everything.

445
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,483
What do you know? You always say that.

446
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:19,943
Hey.

447
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,947
You haven't sat around here
365 days a year.

448
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,617
We even know stuff like
whose earthen pot got chipped.

449
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,870
-We know everything.
-We know everything.

450
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,250
Then who's Joker?

451
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,253
-Joker?
-Joker?

452
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,630
Joker is...

453
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,935
INTESTINE MEDICINE

454
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:02,902
What's in Ongsan?

455
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,905
SPEEDING TICKET

456
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,034
Get your act together.

457
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,621
I'm joining you this time
for your water purifier ad,

458
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,250
so if you get in trouble for DUI
or speeding, you'll be a nuisance to me.

459
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,502
You're doing it with me?

460
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,379
Hey, why would do that?

461
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,799
Do you know
how scary the public is nowadays?

462
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:25,925
Whatever.

463
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,595
Why do you try so hard to get disliked?

464
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,972
People like me.

465
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,975
I get over 600 likes
whenever I post a picture.

466
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,894
Are you a celebrity or an athlete?

467
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:39,439
What in the world are you?
How can an unemployed person film an ad?

468
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,233
Well, I was annoyed
about you calling me unemployed.

469
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,819
I told you to be more respectful.

470
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,406
I'm going to Milan.

471
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,117
-What?
-I'm going there in November.

472
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,454
Gosh, you're so laid-back.

473
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,789
What about our kid? Why you travel--

474
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,334
No, it's not a trip. I'm studying abroad.

475
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,003
A modeling school for two years.

476
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,630
Two years?

477
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,716
Wait, you're going to abandon your kid
and leave for two--

478
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,259
I'm not abandoning her.

479
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,385
She has her loving dad,

480
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,722
her grandmother, and her nanny,
so I can be away for two years.

481
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:16,476
Wait. Do you know
how much she needs you right now?

482
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,977
She can't remember anyway.

483
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,979
You remember when you were one?

484
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,234
Don't you have any maternal instinct?

485
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,820
A mom needs to be successful
for her child to be happy.

486
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,034
That delivery guy.

487
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,746
That rude delivery guy
of Dongwon Chinese Food.

488
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,290
He was one unusual guy.

489
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,833
Definitely, yes.

490
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:45,463
I believe he stole
my husband's motorbike, too.

491
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,216
-Right.
-You're right.

492
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:53,429
Then he would've been
one of the key suspects, right?

493
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,639
-Yes.
-Right.

494
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,058
-But he died.
-What?

495
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,894
He was the second person
that Joker killed.

496
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,356
So it was a misunderstanding.

497
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,817
-We feel kind of bad.
-Right.

498
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,819
-You're right.
-We're sorry.

499
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,029
A misunderstanding.

500
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,866
Then who's Joker?

501
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,452
I think

502
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,038
it's the guy at the fortune-teller's.

503
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,626
That vicious-looking guy
who visited her often?

504
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,211
-Yes.
-That evil-looking guy?

505
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,796
-Yes.
-That guy.

506
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:31,217
The case broke out
whenever he came into town.

507
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,720
-You're right.
-Yes, you're right.

508
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,054
This is a good point.

509
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,598
Then is that vicious-looking guy--

510
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,560
But he got on a deep-sea fishing vessel.

511
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:41,853
What?

512
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,980
When people were dying in Ongsan,

513
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:47,358
he was catching mackerels in Norway.

514
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,444
-Norway?
-I mean, he was in Norway.

515
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,738
-In Norway.
-We can't help it if he was there.

516
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,740
-He was in Norway.
-In Norway.

517
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,325
He was diligent, after all.

518
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,915
Why do you keep saying nonsense?

519
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,877
You say someone stole a motorbike
and looks vicious,

520
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,504
but that's all subjective.
It's not clear evidence.

521
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,923
Tell me objective circumstantial evidence.

522
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,551
-The Norway guy--
-Forget the Norway guy.

523
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,304
Norway, that darned Norway.

524
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,681
If I know that,
why would I be selling rice cake?

525
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:22,185
You would sell rice cake
while she's the head of the investigation.

526
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,186
She's right.

527
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,441
Forget it. What was I expecting?

528
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,028
Hey, forget it. This is over. Go.

529
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,697
You should get back to your businesses.

530
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:38,034
There is one guy who made money
after the murder case.

531
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,536
-There is.
-Yes, there is.

532
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,206
Gyu-tae.

533
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,541
No Gyu-tae?

534
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,876
OK AESTHETIC

535
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:50,588
Gyu-tae pretty much bought the
Ok Aesthetic building for free.

536
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,841
I didn't know why he bought a building
where someone died,

537
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,844
but after a year, the terminal
moved to behind that building.

538
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,597
Who knows if he knew something

539
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,849
or if he just got lucky with money?

540
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,313
Why would you go to Milan? Why?

541
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,690
Quiet.

542
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,318
You aren't a real model
or a fashion major.

543
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,070
Why would you suddenly go to Milan?

544
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,364
That camera can record sounds, too.

545
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,325
You know that this is
kind of like your name, don't you?

546
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,452
You lived your whole life
in Jeolla Province,

547
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,163
but your name is Jessica,
so it's kind of like that.

548
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,917
I'm a New Yorker.

549
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,919
I've been Jessica ever since I was there.

550
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,255
You were there for only three months.

551
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,382
Then am I Japanese
since I played for Yomiuri?

552
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,008
-Shut up.
-You can't go.

553
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,844
I have no money for you to study.

554
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,221
Then we can get divorced,
and I'll get alimony.

555
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,515
-Park Sang-mi!
-What, Kang Jong-ryeol?

556
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,025
Fine, go study abroad or whatever.

557
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,863
I'll let you do it.
But leave after Ji-seon is a bit older.

558
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:59,782
Stop trying to clip my wings
by using Rebecca as an excuse!

559
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:03,161
She's not Rebecca! She's Kang Ji-seon,
Kang Jong-ryeol's daughter!

560
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,788
And you're Park Sang-mi!
Park Sang-mi!

561
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,666
Stop the car.

562
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,962
You'll die of embarrassment
in just ten years.

563
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,424
People make fun of stars for life
for something stupid they did.

564
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,342
You need to grow up!

565
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,178
I said, stop the car!

566
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,069
I shouldn't go there.

567
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,031
I shouldn't.

568
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:47,288
I found my crazy escape
in an absurd place.

569
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,668
MATH QUIZ

570
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,296
If he does this badly in math
during his first year,

571
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,423
it'll only get worse as he grows.

572
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:04,847
But Pil-gu is better at math than I was.

573
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,349
Pardon?

574
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:11,437
I think it's okay for him
to not try so hard

575
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,191
to get good grades on math
if it's too hard for him.

576
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:17,944
I see.

577
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:19,904
What I want to know

578
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,365
isn't his math grade.

579
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,994
I want to know
how he gets along with others.

580
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,747
Just because his mom runs a bar...

581
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,709
Does he get made fun of? Or...

582
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,544
Because he doesn't have a dad...

583
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,089
Or if he gets intimidated and such.

584
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,592
He sometimes comes home after a fight.

585
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,846
Pil-gu isn't the side that gets beaten up.

586
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,483
Mr. Kang.

587
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,153
Hello. You come here pretty often.

588
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,365
Are you conducting
some business over here?

589
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,493
I can poop whenever I come to this school.

590
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,120
What?

591
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,956
My mind blanks out,
but my organs work well.

592
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,333
My heart feels tense,

593
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,670
but I only feel at peace
after seeing it with my eyes.

594
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,010
So you come all the way to Ongsan to poop?

595
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,769
Goodness.

596
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,483
Pil-gu. Why are you kicking the wall for?

597
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,693
Do you play soccer?

598
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,154
Why do I have to write
my journals in English?

599
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,990
I didn't because I'm a patriot.

600
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,035
So what? Should I get your mom?

601
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,079
I already told you hundreds of times.

602
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,957
My mom is a working mom. A working mom!

603
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,547
-Why does he have my temper, too?
-What is he saying?

604
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,884
Man, that punk.
I wonder who he took after.

605
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,969
Why do you care who he took after?

606
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:10,556
A child is a human being, too.
Don't call him a punk.

607
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,728
Is he a children's rights activist
or what?

608
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:29,533
LET'S ALL MAKE
THE HAPPIEST SCHOOL IN THIS WORLD

609
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,746
I'll become a major leaguer

610
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,165
and make a huge bar for my mom.

611
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,708
Kang Pil-gu.

612
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,795
CAMELLIA

613
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,296
Why is that tiny little kid

614
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,132
so manly?

615
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,259
That makes me want him even more.

616
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,890
Is that why you've been
investigating Mr. No?

617
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,100
You think he's Joker?

618
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,521
Hey, do you think No Gyu-tae is
a guy who can kill a man?

619
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,400
It's always like that. Always.

620
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,026
On CSI,

621
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,363
those who are the least likely
always end up getting arrested.

622
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,908
Hey, No Gyu-tae suffered
from facial nerve palsy

623
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,661
-after he hit an elk with his car.
-What?

624
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,996
His mouth got droopy because of the shock.

625
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,248
My gosh.

626
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,583
Some even say that he got an exorcism

627
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,169
because he had too many nightmares.

628
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,089
That's how much of a coward he is.

629
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:28,551
Did the elk trample him
in his nightmares or what?

630
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,929
Man, that guy is really unbelievable.

631
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:36,058
Anyway, he's really weird.

632
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,519
He's right in the gray area

633
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:43,190
between a bad guy and a fool.

634
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:46,485
Hey, he isn't just a coward.
He's pretty stupid, too.

635
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,447
And if Mr. No was Joker,

636
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,616
he would have left
tons of evidence already.

637
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,576
POLICE

638
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,912
The building.
Why did he buy that building?

639
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,915
It show he's the only one
who made money thanks to Joker.

640
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,836
Hey. It was sold at half
its original price because of the murder.

641
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,547
I would've bought it as well
if I had the money.

642
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,842
My gosh, then who is it?

643
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:11,719
Darn it.

644
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:15,181
Chief, let me be honest.

645
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,018
I have absolutely no idea
whom it could be.

646
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,061
My goodness.

647
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,355
It's normal for you to be lost.

648
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,483
When you're lost like that,

649
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,068
you should go and see Yeong-sim.

650
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:31,238
My goodness, I've heard enough of her.

651
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,701
EVEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KIDS KNOW THIS
DRIVE SLOWLY IN FRONT OF A SCHOOL

652
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,254
Look far ahead of you.

653
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,506
Okay, next.

654
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:52,551
Don't forget to go home
and tell your mothers about this.

655
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,221
Okay, good job. Next.

656
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,974
Tell them that Kang Jong-ryeol
gave you baseball lessons today.

657
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,685
Tell them I arranged it for you, okay?

658
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,603
-Okay.
-Okay.

659
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,230
But to be honest,

660
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,649
-we can't call this a lesson--
-Focus on the ball!

661
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,526
Try that again. Go on.

662
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:16,325
You need to stay balanced. Keep your legs
firmly on the ground. Again!

663
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,666
Pil-gu, why are your arms so loose?
What's wrong with you? Again!

664
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,838
Stop. Why do you always sigh
before you hit the ball?

665
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,049
Is that some kind of routine you do?

666
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,469
You think that's cool?
Where did you learn that kind of stuff?

667
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,724
What about you? Why do you always
smell your helmet before you hit the ball?

668
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,644
Do you know how disgusting that is?

669
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,649
They say even teachers
can't teach their own kids.

670
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,153
-Well...
-Mom!

671
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,407
Mom!

672
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,535
-Mom!
-It must be his mom.

673
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,706
I'm surprised to see Dongbaek here.

674
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,458
Is she your friend?

675
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,961
She's a student's parent,
not your friend.

676
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,714
You should have some manners.

677
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,968
Who does he think he is?

678
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,929
Mom!

679
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,598
Mom!

680
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,183
-Mom!
-What?

681
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,521
Mom, didn't you hear me?

682
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,316
I called you from
all the way from over there.

683
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,235
No, I didn't hear you. You called me?

684
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,988
Why did you run over here
in the middle of training?

685
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,281
-Hello.
-Hello.

686
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,658
Oh. Hi, guys.

687
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,162
Mom, what's with your hair?

688
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:48,250
-Why? Does it look weird?
-Why did you come here like that?

689
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,462
I was just about to go.

690
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,672
You guys should
get back to training. Go on.

691
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:57,509
What did I tell you guys?
I told you that my mom's really pretty.

692
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,220
She looks even prettier with a bun.

693
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,098
Pil-gu never lies.

694
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,394
I told them you're as pretty as Tzuyu,

695
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,979
but they thought I was lying.

696
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,025
That's why I always told you
to come and see me at school.

697
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,777
But why with a ponytail?

698
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,528
I told you to make a bun

699
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,281
just like Dahyun.

700
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:23,118
I came in such a hurry
that I totally forgot.

701
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,787
I'll do it next time.

702
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,705
By the way, Dong-gyu.

703
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:30,292
You told me your dad's a vice president,
right? My mom's a CEO.

704
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,465
My goodness, yes. I am a CEO.

705
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,469
Do you guys want to eat ice cream?

706
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,179
-Here.
-My mom bought these for us.

707
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:45,724
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Thank you, ma'am.

708
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,309
Don't mention it. Enjoy.

709
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,019
Thanks, Pil-gu.

710
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,439
What's he doing here again?

711
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,191
Would you like one?

712
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,237
-No, it's okay.
-You should have one.

713
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:01,699
By any chance,

714
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,577
do you have a chestnut-flavored one?

715
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,698
I understand you're curious about Pil-gu

716
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,659
because he's your son,
even though we didn't end on good terms.

717
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,539
But you're really disrespecting your wife.

718
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,754
How could you do
something like this to me?

719
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,672
This is driving me crazy.

720
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,139
If you care about him,
don't come here anymore.

721
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,891
Instead,

722
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,393
let me ask you for a favor.

723
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,854
There's no need to ask.

724
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:17,149
You probably know since it's on the web,
but I earn a lot of money.

725
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:21,403
I heard the landlord asked you
to move out of the building.

726
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:26,241
You know The Return of Superman?
Can you just quit that show?

727
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:27,743
What?

728
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:31,872
You take your daughter to go see dinosaurs
and go camping with her.

729
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,751
Can't you at least do that much
for Pil-gu's sake?

730
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,922
Why do you want me to quit the show?

731
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,802
If he finds out
that the really kind dad on TV

732
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,094
is actually his dad,

733
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,348
it'll scar him.

734
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:59,066
You already earn a lot of money
regardless of that show.

735
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:02,319
You can do whatever you want,
but please quit that show.

736
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,570
Please.

737
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:07,991
What about you?

738
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,372
Did it scar you as well?

739
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:25,259
Why did you have to show up now
instead of when I looked for you?

740
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,303
I know...

741
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,433
I know I'm a real jerk for saying this.

742
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,354
But now that I see you again...

743
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,440
You and Pil-gu.

744
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,862
How am I supposed to bear it?

745
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,116
You haven't changed.

746
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,244
You're still a jerk.

747
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,767
Why did you have to like a jerk like me?

748
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,732
Pil-gu will be here soon.
You should go now.

749
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,568
Your bad taste in men
is what ruined your life.

750
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,280
What's wrong with my life?

751
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:30,741
My life isn't yours, you know.

752
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,161
-What?
-I dated you because I liked you

753
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,331
and had Pil-gu because I wanted to.
I'm the one who controls my life.

754
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,499
I'm responsible
for everything that happened.

755
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,127
Who do you think you are?

756
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,756
Why do you think
you have control over my life?

757
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:51,553
You

758
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,890
kind of look really cool now.

759
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:59,186
That's because I am cool.
I'm 173cm tall with a great body ratio.

760
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,356
I have an amazing son,
and I'm the CEO of this bar.

761
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,525
I was never a supporting role
of someone's life.

762
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,402
I was always the lead actress.

763
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,322
You must be dating him.

764
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,536
Does that hillbilly make you cool?

765
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:21,750
-Heung-sik, this way.
-Okay.

766
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,336
Hi, Dongbaek.

767
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,266
Hello.

768
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,103
I'll install it over there.

769
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,530
This shot is amazing.

770
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,908
I'm glad I chose to work here.

771
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,827
Don't step out of line.

772
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:02,124
Pay 5,000 won. I added some honey too.

773
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,668
He doesn't need to pay.

774
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,212
Heung-sik, you should eat before you go.

775
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,714
-Yes, you should.
-Okay.

776
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,924
You're giving him free food?

777
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,259
Why give him free food?

778
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,469
She really does have mood swings.

779
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:20,642
I always felt worried
leaving Pil-gu here all by himself.

780
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,562
Thank you for being so considerate.

781
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,857
I'd also like to thank you.

782
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,568
Thank you.

783
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,738
You don't need to thank me.

784
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,658
No, I do want to thank you. Thanks a lot.

785
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,041
Yong-sik, you just
got out of trouble yesterday.

786
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,209
Dongbaek.

787
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:54,593
Mr. Kang.

788
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,972
Let's go and eat together.

789
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,893
Do you like Dongbaek?

790
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,188
She's a single mother.

791
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:14,571
Who are you to ask me that kind of stuff?

792
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,783
I'm asking because I deserve to know.

793
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:27,959
Is it because

794
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,003
you're Pil-gu's dad?

795
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,258
Is that why you think you deserve to know?

796
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:36,968
What's your deal?

797
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,930
Do you think you look cool
because you like a pitiful woman?

798
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,810
Don't sway her. Don't pity her, okay?

799
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,520
Mr. Kang.

800
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:50,273
Do you start liking someone out of pity?

801
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,151
-What?
-You really are

802
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:54,861
a stupid man.

803
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:57,697
Don't you know

804
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,367
how attractive Dongbaek is?

805
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,749
You let her go
so you could have everything.

806
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,209
But

807
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,462
I can sacrifice everything
for Dongbaek.

808
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,716
That's how great she is.

809
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:20,303
You already know that.
That's why you're being so clingy.

810
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,848
Yes, I know.
That's exactly why I'm being so clingy.

811
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,016
I'm going to fix things now that I know.

812
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,519
Now that I found out how she's living,

813
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,396
I can't just ignore her.

814
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,609
What's about her life?

815
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,155
You're the most pitiful person here.

816
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,992
You already lost your chance
with Dongbaek.

817
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,994
She's no longer yours.

818
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,579
And Pil-gu

819
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,082
isn't your son, either.

820
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,425
Hey, you have no right to tell me
that he isn't my son.

821
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,511
The next time you grab me,
be prepared to break a shoulder.

822
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,098
Look at how vulgar you are.

823
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,559
I'm really simple-minded.

824
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,938
You're a great dad to your daughter,
a famous athlete, and you shoot ads.

825
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,482
You're just looking back

826
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,484
and reminiscing the past
in your free time.

827
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:20,238
But I'm going to put
everything on the line for Dongbaek.

828
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:22,824
So

829
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,285
stop coming to Ongsan.

830
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,622
Or I'll beat the shit out of you.

831
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,257
He's just like me

832
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,385
back when I was 25 years old.

833
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,854
What did you guys talk about?

834
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,398
Nothing much.

835
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,109
We just had some noodles together.

836
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:04,157
Dongbaek, try some of this peanut bread.

837
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,452
Everyone has their own social media page.

838
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,913
What?

839
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,542
Everyone has something in the past
that they want to hide

840
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,544
or a small secret of their own.

841
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,589
People all manage to keep things a secret.

842
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,676
But why does my past
always get revealed like this?

843
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,055
You didn't have to meet Pil-gu's dad

844
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,599
and eat noodles with him.

845
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,021
Dongbaek.

846
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,025
The past is just the past.

847
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,404
It holds no power whatsoever.

848
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,741
You say that,
but guys are all pretty much the same.

849
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,452
They're all similar.

850
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:55,875
Try this peanut bread.

851
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:00,213
You act like it doesn't bother you,
but men are men.

852
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,882
Who wouldn't be bothered by this?

853
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,433
Dongbaek.

854
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:15,228
How many guys have you dated?

855
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:22,819
Kang Jong-ryeol isn't
the only guy in this world.

856
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,280
I'm not like him.

857
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,240
You said you want to see me.

858
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,951
If you think I'm no different,

859
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,579
why would you bother seeing me?

860
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,082
That's not what I meant.

861
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,876
You never tried with me.

862
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:39,878
Try what?

863
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,089
Dongbaek.

864
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,884
If we actually start a relationship,

865
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:48,428
I promise...

866
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,347
I promise that...

867
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:51,765
Gosh.

868
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,142
It'll be out of this world.

869
00:55:55,352 --> 00:56:00,231
You'll be so happy every day
that you'll totally lose it.

870
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:09,449
So don't compare me to a lousy punk
and say I'm similar to him

871
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,743
when you don't even know
anything about me.

872
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,497
I came to see you at 5 a.m.
because I missed you so much.

873
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:19,292
So stop making me get so angry.

874
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:28,802
You're different.

875
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,722
You're very different, Yong-sik.

876
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,144
That's why I'm so grateful--

877
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,938
Will you stop saying you're grateful?

878
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,777
My heart flutters every day.

879
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:57,455
I didn't know buying flatfish
was such an exciting thing to do.

880
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,842
Should I hold the peanut bread?

881
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,344
Sure.

882
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,645
I don't want to eat anymore. I'm full.

883
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:21,896
Oh, okay.

884
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:28,570
Then let me tell you something
about my past as well.

885
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,449
My first love...

886
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,118
My gosh.

887
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,789
It was Seung-yeop's older sister.

888
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,961
We always spent time playing together

889
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,464
in the same neighborhood.

890
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,593
So you guys actually dated each other?

891
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:53,553
Yes.

892
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:58,766
But she dumped me

893
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,853
as soon as she went to middle school.

894
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:06,149
And as she dumped me,
she wrote me a letter

895
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,569
saying she'll beat me up
if I told Seung-yeop that we dated.

896
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:13,531
So I still haven't told him about it.

897
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,619
I also have a list of exes
in this neighborhood, you know.

898
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,580
I'm serious.

899
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:26,252
But here's the real secret.

900
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,422
I still don't know

901
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:33,760
why she dumped me.

902
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:35,887
My gosh, seriously.

903
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,933
Women are so difficult to understand.

904
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:46,397
But you're especially more difficult

905
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,900
because I like you so much.

906
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:51,861
On top of that,

907
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,323
you sometimes get smaller.

908
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,663
No, let me rephrase that.

909
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:06,709
I'm just saying there are times

910
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,128
when you seem to shrink and wither.

911
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:15,552
Whenever you're like that,
I don't know what to do to console you

912
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:18,680
other than buy you sweet snacks like this.
It's really difficult.

913
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,100
And you'll only think

914
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:26,896
I'm being too chatty
if I talk too much, right?

915
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,775
I like it when you're chatty.

916
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,194
You're an easy guy.

917
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:35,905
No, I'm quite difficult.

918
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:41,578
My life's already filled with hardships.

919
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:45,206
So why can't you just be easy for me?

920
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:49,836
Okay.

921
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,630
-It's hot, isn't it?
-Yes.

922
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:03,516
I personally think
that the most underrated hero

923
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,935
is the genie in Aladdin.

924
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:09,188
If you think about it,
he has no limits to his power.

925
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:13,234
But he keeps limiting
the number of wishes he can grant.

926
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,445
That made him seem really cheap.

927
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,572
And that's why he can't join the Avengers.

928
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,950
But why are you suddenly
talking about the genie?

929
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:24,954
You seem to say
whatever that comes to your mind.

930
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:31,711
Dongbaek.

931
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,718
I'm going to be limitless
when it comes to you.

932
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,596
A hundred wishes in a day? Sure.

933
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,431
If you want 1,000, that's fine.

934
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:48,561
I'm going to become
the easiest person on Earth

935
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,230
just for you.

936
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:59,656
You know, the genie is also called
the fairy of the lamp.

937
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,533
What?

938
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:06,663
Hwang Yong-sik, the fairy. It suits you.

939
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,586
My gosh.

940
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,256
This place is so dark

941
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,176
even during the day
because there are no windows.

942
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,846
Well, I think it's nice and cozy.

943
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,224
Really?

944
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,727
-Yong-sik, just leave it there.
-Okay.

945
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:31,979
-I'll place it on the table.
-Okay.

946
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,738
What's with the light?

947
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,907
Maybe I need a sensor light--

948
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,426
I TOLD YOU NOT TO BE A JOKE

949
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:07,181
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU EVERY DAY
EVER SINCE THAT DAY

950
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,805
He definitely knows this place.

951
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,057
He even knows
where the camera is.

952
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:52,101
Pil-gu, should we move?

953
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,562
I just want to raise you somewhere safe.

954
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,189
You should go your own way, Mom.

955
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:58,024
Figure out
if you have another child.

956
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,734
Once we catch him,

957
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:02,695
I'm scared he might turn out to be
someone we all know.

958
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,364
Everyone looks nice on the outside.
Don't trust everyone.

959
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,868
No one's curious about the truth.
What they believe becomes the truth.

960
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:12,163
Do you really think you can take care
of both Dongbaek and Pil-gu?

961
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:14,624
I keep getting the creeps.

962
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:16,542
I'm done acting like I'm okay.

963
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:20,755
