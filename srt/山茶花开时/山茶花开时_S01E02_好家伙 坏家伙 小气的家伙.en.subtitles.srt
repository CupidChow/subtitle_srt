1
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,530
WHEN THE CAMELLIA BLOOMS

2
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,883
CAMELLIA

3
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,598
WHEN THE CAMELLIA BLOOMS

4
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,801
We found this in the pocket.

5
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,855
I TOLD YOU 5 YEARS AGO NOT TO BE A JOKE

6
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,986
THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE CHEAP

7
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,698
Are you going this way, too?

8
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,283
Sorry?

9
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,203
Go ahead. I left something at the bar.

10
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,330
Then let's go back together.

11
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,290
But why...

12
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,962
I'm patrolling the area at the moment.

13
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,047
What?

14
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,592
Such...

15
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,345
an outstandingly beautiful lady
like yourself

16
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:21,933
shouldn't walk down this alley
by yourself.

17
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:28,565
I'll be so worried
since I'm a police officer.

18
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,483
By any chance...

19
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,903
Are you drunk?

20
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,910
No. I just smell a little bit
like alcohol, that's all.

21
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,456
Well, let's go. Which way are we going?

22
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,633
Just think of me

23
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,969
as a cop on duty.

24
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,804
Just think of it like that.

25
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,141
He's such a weirdo.

26
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,811
By the way, why do you have
Mr. No's wallet?

27
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,979
This?

28
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,773
It somehow ended up in my hands.

29
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,944
I hope you didn't extort it from him.

30
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,155
I'm a cop.

31
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,449
COMPLAINT FORM

32
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,411
This country is governed by the law.
I'll keep this short.

33
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:27,165
-I'm going to take legal action!
-My gosh.

34
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:30,168
Mr. No, why are you so worked up?

35
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,588
Things like that can happen
when guys drink together, you know.

36
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,382
-Calm down. Have a seat here.
-That piece of...

37
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,842
Gosh, calm down.

38
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:43,181
I really didn't want to bother him
over something like this.

39
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:47,101
As you know, the father-in-law of
my cousin's brother-in-law is--

40
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,479
He's the Chief of Ongsan Police Station.

41
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,027
If he finds out about this incident,

42
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,822
-he'll pay keen attention to it.
-All right.

43
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,661
I heard in the morning

44
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,580
that Yeong-sim's brown dog
gave birth to a black puppy.

45
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,874
In cases like that,
it's not about property rights.

46
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,294
Shouldn't the chicken farm's white dog
sign over his parental rights?

47
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,380
Well, I don't know much
about genetics, though.

48
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,382
You might get fired.

49
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,467
Why are you worried about
someone else's dog?

50
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,468
Gosh, please.

51
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,429
Mr. No, when you're appointed governor,

52
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,307
you and Officer Hwang will work together
for the government.

53
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,351
So just think of him as your family.

54
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,020
Let's not complicate things, okay?
Here, have a seat.

55
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,651
If you eat something worth 8,000 won
and run without paying it,

56
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,528
you'll end up in jail!

57
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,904
-You punk!
-What the...

58
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,908
You still think
I shouldn't file the complaint

59
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,785
even after hearing that from the thief?

60
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,789
Well, don't call him a thief.

61
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,084
Let's be honest.
He didn't exactly steal it from you.

62
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,129
They air reruns of this all the time.

63
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,923
Why bother showing dolphins
to a one-year-old baby?

64
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,010
-She won't even remember it.
-His daughter is the apple of his eye.

65
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,887
By the way,

66
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,848
who is Pil-gu's dad?

67
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,269
You're the first person
who's asked straightforwardly.

68
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,938
I have no filter, you know.

69
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,482
That's right, Hyang-mi.
That's why I like you.

70
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,568
Why not make him pay for Pil-gu's academy?

71
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,154
Do you two still talk?
Do you see him occasionally?

72
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,867
Come on, tell me.

73
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,997
I can see him every day if I want to.

74
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,750
I have to say, you're really something.

75
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,209
See you in a bit.

76
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,134
Yong-sik.

77
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,597
Almost everyone in town has borrowed money
from Mr. No at least once.

78
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,891
What?

79
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,144
So he uses money to win people's votes?

80
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,981
It's just that no one in town

81
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,151
lends money as easily as he does.

82
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,904
-What?
-He's so generous when he's feeling good.

83
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,198
"I greatly admire you, Mr. No."

84
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,867
That's all you need to say
to borrow money from him.

85
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,202
You get the picture, right?

86
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,330
My gosh! You're originally from Boeun?

87
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,040
Are you from Boeun, too?

88
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,710
My great-grandfather's third wife
is part of the Boeun Gong clan.

89
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,006
That means we're a family.
We are a family indeed.

90
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,549
He's very simple-minded.

91
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,344
He loves cliques, acting like a leader,
and showing off his power.

92
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,389
I should take you guys
to the masu salmon restaurant.

93
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,348
I only...

94
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,059
take my good friends to that restaurant.

95
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,645
Masu salmon?

96
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,066
You don't want to go?

97
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,610
He loves receiving special treatment.

98
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,904
He gets all childish
when he doesn't get that.

99
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,951
The thing is, Dongbaek is the only one who
doesn't give him any special treatment,

100
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,078
and it drives him up the wall.

101
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,789
What's his problem?
Is he insecure or something?

102
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,709
Hey, he lives with Ms. Know-it-all.

103
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,336
Of course he's insecure.

104
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,881
LAST NIGHT AT NO GYU-TAE'S HOUSE

105
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,924
Well...

106
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,846
I want to consult you
with regard to filing a complaint.

107
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,349
It's not about me, though.

108
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,145
It's about someone in the soccer club.

109
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,772
What happened?
Someone doesn't want you to be the leader?

110
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,739
Well, there's a newbie
who recently moved to the substation.

111
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,657
"Transferred."

112
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,076
But he doesn't know his place.

113
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,536
-That oblivious--
-"Obnoxious."

114
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,663
It's not "oblivious."

115
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,166
"Obnoxious," with an X.

116
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,878
Are you Sejong the Great?

117
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,046
Are you my proofreader or what?

118
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,674
I'm correcting you
so you won't embarrass yourself later.

119
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:50,344
I don't even want to say anything
in front of you. I really don't.

120
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:51,804
Gosh.

121
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,848
-So you won't consult me?
-No, forget it!

122
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,642
I'm sure he wants to play the boss
when he's not home.

123
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,437
So just play along with it.

124
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,107
Jeez, why should I?

125
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,111
Yong-sik, I have huge respect for you.

126
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,698
-What is the matter with you?
-You're our hero, you know.

127
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,409
Heros don't just beat up
and arrest criminals.

128
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,329
Have some pity for losers like him.

129
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,499
Whatever. I'll just punch him
if he gets on my nerves.

130
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,211
What's the biggest difference
between Iron Man and the Hulk?

131
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,296
What? You watch movies?

132
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,881
It's flexibility.

133
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,676
Iron Man knows when to be flexible.
That's why he can wear expensive clothes.

134
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,304
The Hulk walks around half-naked
because he's hardheaded.

135
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,224
Hey, we should have some flexibility.

136
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,356
That's a Japanese word.
You should use Korean.

137
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,650
Right, sorry.
Anyway, don't be so stubborn, okay?

138
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:52,073
You know what, though?
I think the Hulk is much cooler.

139
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,119
Pil-gu, do you want to see dolphins?

140
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,330
I'm not a kid.

141
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,667
Shall we go see dolphins?

142
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,628
Here.

143
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,967
No, forget dolphins.
Can't you just buy me a game machine?

144
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,595
Chung-jae's dad sent one for him
from Seoul.

145
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,396
I'm curious about something.

146
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,150
Are you starting to become curious
about your dad?

147
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,778
No, not really.

148
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,613
Why not?

149
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,325
What do you think is better
between never owning a game machine

150
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,119
and having one taken away?

151
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,290
Do you still go to the arcade often?

152
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,543
I'll probably go bonkers
if I get mine taken away.

153
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,129
I won't even be able to sleep.

154
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,174
But if I never owned one, I'd feel...

155
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,429
I wouldn't be too upset.

156
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,807
Gosh.

157
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,394
Chung-jae's dad moved to Seoul
because his parents are divorced.

158
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,565
In a way, I think my situation is better
than Chung-jae's.

159
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,903
Right.

160
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,947
We aren't so bad, right?

161
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,782
We're average.

162
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,826
Let's go.

163
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,373
-Hey, you stepped on...
-No, I didn't.

164
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,666
I didn't, either.

165
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,343
Officer Hwang said he made a mistake.

166
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,179
Can he not talk?

167
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:42,975
Well,

168
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,101
it's...

169
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,604
I'm sorry.

170
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,024
We both drank quite a bit last night.

171
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:55,029
I literally just transferred here,
so I don't want to cause trouble.

172
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,238
Well...

173
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,032
-Governor.
-I know!

174
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:03,079
As our future governor,

175
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,414
please try to be understanding.

176
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:11,671
He apologized.
You should accept his apology.

177
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,632
If you win him over,
he'll vote for you as well.

178
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,470
I should give in, as a public figure.

179
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,808
Then why don't we all go
for some hangover soup together?

180
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,018
-All right.
-Great, let's go.

181
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,745
I understand.

182
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,249
You probably wanted to look cool
in front of that bar girl.

183
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,543
Dongbaek seems quite mysterious.

184
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,421
She has that face
many guys would fall for.

185
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,672
But you see,

186
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,509
don't be mistaken into thinking
that she looks down on me.

187
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:02,179
She does that on purpose
to get my attention.

188
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,349
Girls like her are actually...

189
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,853
You know what I mean.

190
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,691
What do you mean?
Girls like her are actually what?

191
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,818
Did you see it?

192
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,113
Did you see her seducing guys or what?

193
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,531
Hey, calm down.

194
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,784
-People like you are the worst kind.
-What?

195
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,786
You're bad-mouthing her
for not liking you.

196
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,913
It's the lamest thing any man can do.

197
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,624
Are you done?

198
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,753
No, I'm not finished yet.

199
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,962
Dongbaek...

200
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,341
is a restaurant owner, not a bar girl.

201
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,386
She's not obligated
to give you peanuts on the house!

202
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,266
And you have no right
to speak about her that way.

203
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,517
Who do you think you are?

204
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,437
Are you her husband or guardian?

205
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,897
What the...

206
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,066
If I were her guardian,

207
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,402
you'd be dead by now.

208
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,279
Damn it.

209
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,574
-Hey, Yong-sik.
-That bastard.

210
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,995
-Let go.
-Gosh, calm down.

211
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,498
-Go.
-All right.

212
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,833
-Nice.
-No!

213
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,919
-This one's too strong.
-Hey, move.

214
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,839
I heard Kang Jong-ryeol is coming tomorrow
to shoot that TV show.

215
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,884
Why Kang Jong-ryeol of all people? Why?

216
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,179
Kang Jong-ryeol sucks.
I'd love to see Choo Shin-soo instead.

217
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,014
He didn't go to our school.

218
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,433
Jun-gi! Come and eat.

219
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,352
You have to go to the academy soon.

220
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,313
I made tonkatsu for you!

221
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,232
I have to go. See you at the academy.

222
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,782
KANG PIL-GU

223
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,750
Get up.

224
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,836
I told you.

225
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,712
If I catch you...

226
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,717
Here. You have to eat
every time I catch you.

227
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,303
Why do you always try to
feed me whenever you see me?

228
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,098
If I eat at every mealtime
and never skip the academy,

229
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,267
I'll have no time to play games.

230
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,061
Here, watch this while you eat your food.

231
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,731
I'm going to pay close attention to him.

232
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,819
Even though he joined the team late,
he's been doing very well and...

233
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:23,988
Helena.

234
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,031
Peace be upon you.

235
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,119
It's nice to meet you.

236
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,538
Helena?

237
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,040
What the hell are you saying to her now?

238
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,627
Had you cared about baseball
as much as you care about ladies,

239
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,629
you could've easily beaten Lee Seung-yuop.

240
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,464
That's an overstatement.

241
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:47,261
Helena, go in and fry some tonkatsu
for the boy.

242
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,851
I guess her Korean isn't improving at all.

243
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,769
Her Korean is good.

244
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,731
She just doesn't want to talk to you.

245
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,982
What?

246
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,320
Seung-yeop, stop being so focused
on dating around.

247
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,488
Why don't you coach Yong-sik
on dating instead?

248
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,116
Coach him on what?
He's doing just fine on his own.

249
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,203
What are you talking about? He's so naive.

250
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,080
He's clueless when the lights are off.

251
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,957
What? Clueless, my foot.

252
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,838
Mom, you'll soon have a daughter-in-law
with a very good job.

253
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,964
A good job?

254
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,675
Yong-sik actually has
extremely high standards.

255
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,013
The woman he's seeing these days
is a lawyer.

256
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,516
-What? A lawyer?
-Yes.

257
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,061
Mom! I'm hungry.

258
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,604
Gosh.

259
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,485
Eat up.

260
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,780
Hey. You wash your hair every day, right?

261
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:52,284
When you get a girlfriend, you should
bring her over for some marinated crab.

262
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,702
He's such a hearty eater.

263
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,705
I won't make it obvious that I'm your mom.

264
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,582
I'll just quietly peep at her.

265
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,917
How one eats marinated crab

266
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,795
reveals a lot about
one's personality and upbringing.

267
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,966
Mom, change the sign first
if you want a daughter-in-law.

268
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,968
Who'd want to be Baekdu's daughter-in-law?

269
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,388
You must be seeing someone, then.

270
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,515
By the way, who's that kid?

271
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,351
Why is he eating marinated crab
all alone here?

272
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,522
He's the first one to dine and dash
at Baekdu Marinated Crab.

273
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,232
He's one special kid.

274
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,943
You're giving him food for free?

275
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,780
Those who are hungry should be fed first.

276
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,448
Is Seung-gyo doing well at school?

277
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,702
Then why is he out until this late
on his scooter?

278
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,998
I have to say, Seung-gyo
scratching the customer's Mercedes

279
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,042
isn't unrelated to Dongbaek.

280
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,753
Dongbaek doesn't even know
how to ride a scooter,

281
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,922
so you can't blame it on her.

282
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,801
Seung-gyo was a model student
before Camellia opened.

283
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,513
He couldn't ride a scooter back then
because he was in elementary school.

284
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,349
He's just being an idiot.
Why blame it on Dongbaek?

285
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,684
Okay, you smarty-pants.

286
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,687
It's not good for children's education.

287
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,690
Look at the price of
Jangmi Apartment Complex dropping.

288
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,359
Once an adult entertainment district
is formed,

289
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,821
this whole neighborhood will fall apart
before you even know it.

290
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:16,035
We can't really call Camellia
an adult entertainment business.

291
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,412
Remember the cigarette butt
that burned down

292
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,248
Yeong-sim's chili pepper field?
We should've investigated it.

293
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,251
Well, I'm sure that wasn't Dongbaek.

294
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,004
She can't even stand
the smell of cigarettes.

295
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,338
Why don't you quit smoking?

296
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,674
Some say our crab
smells like menthol cigarettes.

297
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,178
Get out. Go shag some balls.

298
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,596
-Goodness.
-What the hell?

299
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,890
You should quit smoking. Oh, dear.

300
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,016
Have some rice cake.

301
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,684
CREDIT CARD STATEMENT
CAMELLIA

302
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,770
I can't believe this.

303
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,272
What?

304
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:50,069
My gosh, I can't believe how brave he is.

305
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,363
In school, he was always one of the kids
with the lowest grades.

306
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,366
How is he even going to converse
with a lawyer?

307
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,953
She'll realize he's a fool after hearing
just three words from his mouth.

308
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,333
Isn't it so funny?

309
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,086
Yes, it is very funny indeed.

310
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:11,090
I'm telling you. Yong-sik is so gutsy.

311
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,885
He's so ambitious and manly.

312
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,678
That's how he is.

313
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,931
That's why I might have the honor
of welcoming

314
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,558
a daughter-in-law who's a lawyer
even if my son's a fool.

315
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,269
My gosh, I just can't believe it.

316
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:29,483
You can't stop bragging
about your son today.

317
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,238
By the way, where did Chan-suk
and other ladies go?

318
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,366
I have to share
this funny story with them.

319
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,576
Well, Chan-suk...

320
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,412
She went to speak with Dongbaek again.

321
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,331
Again? Why?

322
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,250
CREDIT CARD STATEMENT
CAMELLIA

323
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,627
You see this, right? "Camellia."

324
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,046
I've made it clear to you

325
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,924
that I do not want you
to sell booze to my husband.

326
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,553
The entire foot volleyball club
came together.

327
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,096
I can't pay this.

328
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,931
Give back the 88,000 won.

329
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,936
Chan-suk, that is considered
illegal cash-back.

330
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,437
-It's a crime.
-Shut your mouth.

331
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,024
Why aren't you answering?
I want my money back.

332
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,154
-The thing is--
-I want my money back!

333
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,780
You won't pay me back?

334
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,994
The entire amount, 88,000 won?

335
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:26,290
That's right. The transaction fee, too.
I want it all back.

336
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,506
-Then...
-What? Just say it!

337
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,053
How about I pay you back just 50,000 won?

338
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,472
Goodness, that fool.

339
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,768
What the hell is going on here?

340
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,815
Your dumb husband gets one order
of whelks which is only 12,000 won

341
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:56,403
and can't stop thinking about getting
a chance to talk to her with a lame joke.

342
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,740
You think he is completely innocent

343
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,870
and only Dongbaek is at fault
because she is a flirty bitch?

344
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,123
Legally and morally speaking,

345
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,834
how can you blame her
for selling booze at her bar?

346
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,963
I have no way of knowing if she only
sold booze or also sold something else.

347
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,634
Goodness, even the crabs
would laugh at you.

348
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,886
Wake up.

349
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,680
Look at this face and this body.

350
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,141
She can easily marry a nice single man.

351
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,768
Why would she even like him?

352
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:31,104
Why? Do you think she's been shot
in the head or something?

353
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,064
Why not?

354
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,358
There is nothing wrong
with my husband. What?

355
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:37,110
Oh, dear. You sure love your husband.

356
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,738
Seriously, what is the matter with you?

357
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,616
Is Dongbaek your daughter-in-law?
Is she your daughter?

358
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,117
Why must you do this every time?

359
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,535
Chan-suk.

360
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,288
Do you really not know the truth?

361
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,083
Don't kid yourself.

362
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,126
You're embarrassing yourself!

363
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,631
Why do I spend all my time
making marinated crab

364
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,175
when I should be teaching that idiot
a serious lesson?

365
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,343
Get lost!

366
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,511
-Hey.
-Go!

367
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:06,139
Anyway, you ladies had better not
bother Dongbaek for no reason.

368
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:10,227
I can't focus on my restaurant
if you keep bothering her. Okay?

369
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,064
I can't believe you.
You used to say I'm your favorite.

370
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,525
Now, you don't even look at me.
What's your problem?

371
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,151
Does love change?

372
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,533
You silly goose. You shouldn't have
let him spend more than 30,000 won.

373
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,660
Why did you let him spend 80,000 won?

374
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,038
And why offer to give her 50,000 won?

375
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,374
Gosh, you're such a fool.

376
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,293
Ms. Kwak, do you know this?

377
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,669
What?

378
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:41,216
I've never been friends with anyone
who's as influential as you are.

379
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,262
Even back in school, I was never close
to the class presidents.

380
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,682
You're my first powerful friend.

381
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,563
Gosh, you laugh and smile so easily.

382
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,815
I laugh and smile every day.

383
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,193
Do you have kimchi at home?

384
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,782
Don't be intimidated.

385
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,536
When I used to sell sundae soup years ago,

386
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,830
I had to put up with a lot of bullshit.

387
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,750
Back in those days,
a widow selling sundae soup and soju

388
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,585
was totally frowned upon.

389
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,629
Men hit on me all the time,
and their angry wives barked at me.

390
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,883
I cried a lot in secret.

391
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,345
But what could I do?
I had to raise my three children.

392
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,805
I had no choice but to put up with it all.

393
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:35,062
So just let them bark
and keep going your way.

394
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,438
That's all you can do.

395
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,107
I wish I had a mom like you.

396
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,903
I would've loved to marry
one of my sons off to you.

397
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,990
Oh, right. I heard
your youngest son is still single.

398
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,826
-What?
-I was just kidding.

399
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,912
-Thank you for this.
-No problem.

400
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,334
CAMELLIA

401
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,800
-Hey! You're up early.
-Yes, hello.

402
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,177
-All right, have a good day.
-You too.

403
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,234
That woman seems like trouble.

404
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,820
I can't believe I miss her already.

405
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,584
Is my mom your friend?

406
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,129
Why are you calling my mom Dongbaek?

407
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,257
Everyone calls your mom Dongbaek!

408
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,633
Is that so?

409
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,844
Then I'll call your mom
Pork Belly from now on!

410
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,595
Do you have a death wish?

411
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,014
Hey, his mom is different from your mom.

412
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:53,932
How so?

413
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,978
Your mom sells pork belly,
and your mom sells insurance policies!

414
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,272
My mom just sells booze, that's all.

415
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:01,731
What's wrong

416
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,275
with that?

417
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,571
Yes, my mom sells sundae soup and soju.

418
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,197
So what? Why do you care?

419
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,074
Hwang Yong-sik, I'll tell my dad on you!

420
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,119
Go ahead! My second oldest brother
has a black belt in taekwondo,

421
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,912
and my oldest brother failed a year.

422
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,083
Besides, your mom also sells soju
along with pork belly.

423
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,169
What? Do you have a death wish?

424
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:26,173
Stop, kiddos! You little rascals.

425
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,426
How can you kick your friend?

426
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:33,013
Shall I lock you up in a detention cell
to teach you a lesson?

427
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,015
I can easily do it!

428
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,606
Stop crying.

429
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,068
I didn't even do anything.

430
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,695
Stop crying.

431
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,326
We just met, but I saw you
getting beaten up.

432
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,785
I know you want to look tough,

433
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,456
but that's not something an eight-year-old
can do easily.

434
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,127
Even if you cry a river,
I'll pretend like I didn't see it.

435
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,420
You can cry all you want.

436
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,757
He's supposed to be older anyway.

437
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,010
-What?
-The guy who kicked me here.

438
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,555
He was born in January,
and I was born in December.

439
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,475
In the old days,
he is supposed to be early-born 2012.

440
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,435
That means he's older!

441
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,562
Wait, early-born what?

442
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,108
So I practically won, okay?

443
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,153
Early-born 2012?

444
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,866
I'm an early-born 1988.

445
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,831
I knew exactly what an eight-year-old
could use at times like these.

446
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,505
I have to get on the academy bus
over there.

447
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,632
Okay, then.

448
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,008
I'll see you around.

449
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,887
Thanks for the chips.

450
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,015
I only took it
because you said you're a policeman.

451
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,351
Sure. You're a smarty.

452
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,397
Are you going to the arcade?

453
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,274
PHOTO STUDIO, ARCADE

454
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,651
-Yes.
-You're going there when you're an adult?

455
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,570
While a kid's going to an academy?

456
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,912
You know, after I became a grown-up,

457
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:24,207
I realized I learned more about life
at an arcade than at an academy.

458
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,376
About life?

459
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,880
Know what a sense of defeat
and a sense of achievement is?

460
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,632
Concept of operation, team spirit,

461
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,552
money extortion, and shame.

462
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,389
Anyway, such things
can't be learned at an academy.

463
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,311
INSERT BILL HERE

464
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,029
You can play if you want.

465
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,662
That was the most movie-like scene

466
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,874
in that kid's eight years of life.

467
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,959
EIGHT YEARS OF LIFE

468
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,338
Yes, I'm sorry. All right.

469
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,757
Pil-gu isn't at the academy?

470
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,383
Did he go to the arcade?

471
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,261
What am I going to do with him?

472
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,184
NOOB IN LIFE, PRO AT GAMING

473
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,936
I'm probably old enough to be your father.

474
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,314
Kill the guy at the top.

475
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,236
Anyway, how old is your father?

476
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,197
No idea.

477
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,824
You don't even know how old your dad is?

478
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,452
-He probably doesn't know how old I am.
-What?

479
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,205
He may not even know my name.

480
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,586
Don't you have a dad?

481
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,797
You're saying that to my face?

482
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,549
It's not a shame to not have a dad.

483
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,469
MAGICAL TIME OF GETTING CLOSER
IN A COMPACT SPACE

484
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,845
I didn't have a dad, either.

485
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:04,265
It's not like everyone has a dad.

486
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,645
I'm the only one
who doesn't have a dad in my class.

487
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,441
There are two more in class seven.

488
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,154
See that? I told you so.

489
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:24,327
Hey, those who think
that everyone has a dad

490
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:28,123
and those who look at you with pity
when you tell them you don't have one

491
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,209
are the tackiest people in this world.

492
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:35,380
You can look at them
with pity instead. Okay?

493
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,807
Let's go!

494
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,352
-Hey.
-Yes?

495
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,979
Come and visit our bar later.

496
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,982
I'll give you three refills of corn puffs.

497
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,234
Where's your bar?

498
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,862
At the end of the marinated crab street.

499
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,864
Where around that street?

500
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,533
-Next to the mill...
-Kang Pil-gu.

501
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,577
Mom?

502
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,546
Mom?

503
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,547
Yes.

504
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,050
My lady who's full of twists
also has a son.

505
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,225
He exchanged 10,000 won into
500-won coins for me to play.

506
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:33,354
It takes me forever to use up 10,000 won,
so how could I go to the academy?

507
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,899
It was 10,000 won. 10,000 won!

508
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,861
That was pretty persuasive
for an eight-year-old.

509
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,362
Ten thousand?

510
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,907
Oh, you know, it's...

511
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,826
-I--
-Why did you give him money to play games?

512
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,746
He's a weird man. Let's go.

513
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,956
Did you use up the 10,000 won, then?

514
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,082
I was about to.

515
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,045
And I...

516
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,422
became a weird man again.

517
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,759
I'm a bachelor.

518
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,678
He's not a weird man.

519
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,639
He's a policeman.

520
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,808
I know that, too.

521
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,396
He took my side
when I got into a fight with Dae-seong.

522
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,942
You fought with Dae-seong again? Why?

523
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,320
Why do you keep getting in fights
with other kids?

524
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,655
What's the problem?

525
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,449
You don't have to know.

526
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,535
ONGSAN POLICE STATION

527
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,869
My gut feeling says

528
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,081
Joker is still somewhere in Ongsan.

529
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,499
And it's because...

530
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,919
Goodness, don't do it.

531
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:41,047
People will write more malicious comments
after you do the interview.

532
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,553
Yong-sik, should I put
some powder on my face

533
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,848
for the interview?

534
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,724
Why would a former detective of that case

535
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,893
who couldn't even catch Joker
do an interview?

536
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:58,398
I didn't ask a soon-to-be
former constable for an opinion.

537
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:02,235
Mr. Hwang Yong-sik,
get ready to quit your job.

538
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,238
Hey. Just tell them
you won't do the interview!

539
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,366
Mr. No filed his complaint!

540
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,701
What are you going to do?

541
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,162
He really did that?

542
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,767
SENTENCE FOR MUGGING

543
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,530
HONG JA-YEONG LAW OFFICE

544
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,491
Where did he use the million won?
Did you pester him?

545
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:55,663
No matter how many times I ask,
he glued his lips and wouldn't talk.

546
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,750
Maybe he got himself a mistress.

547
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,921
I'm the only woman
that he has ever been with.

548
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,048
Right, there's no one else
who looks like you.

549
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,759
Then you should look at his bank account.

550
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:11,095
Excuse me,
how much is the injeolmi rice cake?

551
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,555
It's 3,000 won.

552
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,266
INJEOLMI: 2,000 WON

553
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,102
The sign says it's 2,000 won.

554
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,229
If you know, why do you ask?

555
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,191
Why, Dongbaek? Are you hitting on me?

556
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,652
You can take two for 2,000 won.

557
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,197
They'll be thrown out
once they're spoiled.

558
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,365
Hey!

559
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,034
They're shooting a TV show.
Let's go watch.

560
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,535
Why? For a restaurant?

561
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,331
No, The Return of Superman crew
came to the kids' school.

562
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,416
-The Return of Superman?
-You know, that guy.

563
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,794
The baseball player from Ongsan.

564
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,505
-Jong-ryeol?
-Yes, Jong-ryeol.

565
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,425
Where is she going?

566
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,387
Gosh, the air is great.
Isn't it great to be out here?

567
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,473
This is my old school.

568
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,893
I used to get punished on this ground
and I studied...

569
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,937
You don't have to mind them.

570
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,816
They have to train for tomorrow's game,
so they're protesting.

571
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,402
I don't want to mind them,

572
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,654
but look at them. How can I not mind them?

573
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,908
ONGSAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

574
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,497
What's with him?

575
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,335
-What?
-Darn it.

576
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,795
What, kid?

577
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,556
Hey, stop right there.

578
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,603
Do you own this ground, senior guy?

579
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,482
Does this field belong to you, senior guy?

580
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,277
Will you take responsibility
if we lose tomorrow?

581
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,072
Do you think you'll feel great
if I don't let you

582
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,949
use the field, either?

583
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,869
Why are you laughing?

584
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:03,624
My friend, you looked so serious
so I wanted to hold it back, but--

585
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,752
You aren't a friend. You're an old man.

586
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,339
Hey, you're a huge
pain in the ass, aren't you?

587
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,884
Pil-gu!

588
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,573
Pil-gu!

589
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,411
Mom?

590
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,442
All kinds of concerns and agonies
seem to be going through his mind.

591
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,911
Well, you know.

592
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,707
If he's in elementary school,

593
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:31,087
no matter how young he is,
he must be about...

594
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,588
Yes, he's your son.

595
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,840
Dongbaek...

596
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,050
never beats around the bush.

597
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,553
He's definitely your son.

598
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,975
So it's a fact that you took his wallet.

599
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,187
Well, yes.

600
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:52,191
But I wasn't trying to take
8,000 won for myself.

601
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,694
-You had a just motive?
-Yes, that's it.

602
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,865
If he didn't pay in full at a diner,

603
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,075
that's considered dining and dashing.

604
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,036
You can persuade the owner of the diner

605
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,705
and make a counteraction.

606
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,082
Well, but...

607
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:12,336
there's something significant about him.

608
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,337
Okay.

609
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,548
It seems like...

610
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,595
his first cousin's sister's...

611
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:25,433
husband's in-law is

612
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,269
almost an in-law...

613
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,481
with the chief of Ongsan Police Station
or something.

614
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:37,153
So he's not just
a leader around this town.

615
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,989
He has ties with governmental officials.

616
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,908
FIRST COUSIN'S SISTER'S HUSBAND'S IN-LAW

617
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,952
He ran away

618
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:49,081
-without paying 8,000 won at a diner?
-Yes.

619
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:53,586
So this means
this is a wicked guy who's well-off

620
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,547
-but took 8,000 won from--
-Is that diner Camellia?

621
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,300
How did you know?

622
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,055
I'm the wicked man's wife.

623
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,896
Oh, goodness.

624
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,482
I didn't know.

625
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,152
-I really had no idea.
-Case closed.

626
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,697
No Gyu-tae won't sue you, Mr. Hwang.

627
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,243
Because if he does something that low,

628
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,203
I won't live with him anymore.

629
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,084
Right.

630
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:39,465
It feels like I just told on him to you.

631
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:42,301
-But do let me ask a question.
-Sure.

632
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,054
Why did you take his money
for Dongbaek's sake?

633
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,432
-Pardon?
-I'm beginning to wonder

634
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,270
who exactly this Dongbaek is.

635
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,902
Are you...

636
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,197
Wait. One second. You need to be honest.

637
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,950
Are you sure? Are you sure he's my son?

638
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,994
KANG JONG-RYEOL

639
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,495
Are you serious?

640
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,622
Are you some kind of a thug?

641
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,419
How can you do something so huge?

642
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,004
How can you do something so...

643
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,132
You said you weren't. You said it!

644
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,595
I had no choice. You know what I'm like.

645
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,765
Yes, I do know.

646
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,059
She was a 23-year-old girl

647
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,228
who only wanted a family.

648
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,237
Forget Mom or Dad.

649
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,448
I don't even have an aunt or a grandma.

650
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:49,035
You have me.
I'll be your dad, uncle, and grandpa.

651
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:54,123
I want to have at least five children.

652
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,542
So I want to make
the biggest family in the town.

653
00:38:56,625 --> 00:39:00,004
Hey, people abandon their children
because even one was too much...

654
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:07,053
Right, but I'm not like my mom.

655
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,056
Once I have a child,
I won't abandon my kid

656
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,058
no matter what happens.

657
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,728
Goodness, I got it!

658
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,855
-Look.
-You did.

659
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,441
-She was all alone in this world.
-What is it?

660
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,781
I was the first one in her life

661
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,366
-It's pretty.
-who took her side.

662
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,659
I heard germanium is great for your body.

663
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,628
But why here?

664
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,630
Why did it have to be Ongsan?

665
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:47,968
Was it because of me?

666
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,763
Because it was me?
Because this is my hometown?

667
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,598
Ongsan isn't yours, you know.

668
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,935
Do you own this ground, senior guy?

669
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,570
Why? Are you scared?

670
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,573
Do you think I lived here all along
to drag you down?

671
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:13,452
Just tell me. Why did you move here?
Why? Seriously, why?

672
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,038
Jong-ryeol, don't be a chicken.

673
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,792
I was busy making a living

674
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:23,170
so I had no time
to look back on my memories.

675
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,925
My husband treats me so well
that I even forgot what you looked like.

676
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,805
You're married?

677
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,724
Then did you think
I still wouldn't have gotten over you?

678
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,478
I never said you shouldn't.

679
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,022
So don't be scared.

680
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,692
You weren't...

681
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,901
What?

682
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,699
You weren't that big of a deal
as a first love anyway.

683
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,466
To be honest, I loved him a lot.

684
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,886
So I never wanted to meet him again.

685
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,721
Especially not like this.

686
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,020
What a lousy day.

687
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,733
Let's talk outside.

688
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,027
Hyang-mi, listen to me.

689
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,155
Look at this.

690
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,908
It says here
that he wired you 1,000,000 won.

691
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,327
You took money from her husband.

692
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,622
I borrowed money from him,
but who are you to cause a fuss?

693
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,540
-I haven't caused a fuss yet.
-Hyang-mi.

694
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,001
Hyang-mi, what's wrong?

695
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,712
-Hello.
-I'm glad you're here, Dongbaek.

696
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:48,631
Dongbaek!

697
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:52,927
Do you even know what kind of mess
Hyang-mi's been getting herself into?

698
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,803
What is it? What's going on?

699
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:58,182
Hey, you should arrest them.
They're acting like thugs.

700
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,475
-What?
-What a joke.

701
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,935
Dongbaek.

702
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:05,648
Why did you have to bring someone
so ignorant to the neighborhood?

703
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,484
We don't want her here,
so just fire her. Fire her, okay?

704
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,569
If not, you'll have to shut down your bar.

705
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,197
But she's my family.

706
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,659
How about we hear her out first?

707
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,870
That's going to be pointless.

708
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,374
She seduced a naive man
and made him act out of the ordinary.

709
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,917
She probably has nothing to say.

710
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,502
You know what?

711
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:30,172
I guess it's his fault to be dumb enough
to get seduced by a gold-digger.

712
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,299
She's not a gold-digger.

713
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,928
-What?
-She's not that kind of person.

714
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,639
Oh, right.

715
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,058
You're no different.

716
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:45,020
She's the hostess, and you're the owner.
You're probably exactly like her.

717
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,357
Ma'am, come on.
I think you're crossing the line.

718
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,778
Hey, do you think you're equal to us
just because you work

719
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,780
to earn a living every day?

720
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,495
I saw your mom fighting again.

721
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,957
No wonder you live such a lowly life.

722
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,420
I was nice to you
because I felt sorry for your sad life.

723
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,214
But this is how you repay me?

724
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,425
-Get out of my way.
-My goodness.

725
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,468
-That's enough.
-Please stop it.

726
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,720
My goodness.

727
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:18,887
Repay you for what?

728
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,728
What exactly do I owe you?

729
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,525
What did I do so wrong?

730
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,653
I did nothing.

731
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:41,535
All I ever do is work hard
so I can make ends meet.

732
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,748
But why...

733
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:46,874
Why are you...

734
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,918
Why are you always blaming me?

735
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,505
My gosh, Dongbaek's finally talking now.

736
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:57,176
Will you please leave me alone?

737
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,470
Please just leave me alone.

738
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,223
This is the problem with pretty girls.

739
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,560
They think crying will help them
get away with everything.

740
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,146
Dongbaek, why are you crying?

741
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,273
-Why are you crying?
-Seriously.

742
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,150
-What did we do?
-What's wrong with her?

743
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:16,028
-What did we do to you?
-My gosh, stop it.

744
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,364
-Stop interfering!
-Who do you think you are?

745
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,615
-Who are you?
-Me?

746
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:20,574
Tell me.

747
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:24,703
If you cry in front of us like this
in broad daylight,

748
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,622
-people might think we hit you.
-My gosh.

749
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,707
-Don't you think so?
-Will you stop that?

750
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,877
-My gosh, move.
-Why are you hitting my mom?

751
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,961
My goodness.

752
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,465
Hey! How dare you hit an adult?

753
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,550
If you hit my mom,

754
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,886
I'll hit Jun-gi every single day!

755
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,390
I'll punch him and break his nose,
and I'll kick him, too!

756
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,266
I'll make sure I do that!

757
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,686
You just wait and see.

758
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:52,147
-Just wait and see!
-See what?

759
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,400
See what, you punk? Hey!

760
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,405
You shouldn't behave like that to adults.

761
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:03,283
You always talk back to adults
and get into fights with your friends.

762
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:06,036
That's why everyone calls you a pit bull.

763
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,330
Do you even know why I became like this?

764
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,291
It's all because of you.

765
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,712
-What?
-Why do I need to protect you?

766
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,423
You should be protecting me.

767
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,049
I'm only in first grade.

768
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,635
I'm too young to be protecting you.

769
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,305
When did I ask you to protect me?

770
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,807
I don't want to do that either.

771
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,434
But...

772
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,186
I have no choice but to protect you.

773
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,232
Why?

774
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:38,861
Because everyone else hates you!

775
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,157
I'm the only person

776
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,784
who likes you in this entire world.

777
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,246
I already know

778
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,000
how much the neighbors hate you
and harass you.

779
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,586
That's why

780
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,963
I can't even play baseball.

781
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,883
I'm always busy protecting you.

782
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,636
Sometimes,

783
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,639
I get tired of doing this.

784
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,434
I get...

785
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:12,978
I get really angry at times.

786
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,775
You little...

787
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:49,097
I thought I should say hello to the coach
since I came here for a shoot.

788
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,559
-And maybe give you a hand.
-Oh, okay.

789
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,979
But I heard you got transferred here
when you were in fifth grade,

790
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,397
so you weren't here for long.

791
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,608
This place is still my alma mater.

792
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,777
Whatever you say.

793
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,695
By the way,

794
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,490
when you manage the kids,

795
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,785
I'm guessing you also
look into their family backgrounds.

796
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,371
And I noticed a kid earlier
who seemed pretty talented.

797
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:16,333
I think his uniform number
was number three.

798
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,548
What's with you?

799
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,175
-Pardon?
-You're suddenly asking me

800
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,637
about their family backgrounds
and showing so much interest.

801
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,683
You never offered a single scholarship
for any of the players until now.

802
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,726
But you're suddenly
caring so much for them.

803
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,521
Just be honest with me.

804
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,610
I guess you already heard.

805
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,737
My gosh, of course.

806
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,867
-To be honest--
-Your batting average is decreasing,

807
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,869
and you're not doing well
on variety shows.

808
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,289
You're trying to do politics, aren't you?

809
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:56,748
What?

810
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,126
This is on the house.

811
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,420
Why...

812
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,882
are you giving me peanuts for free?

813
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,927
I heard you took Pil-gu's side
when he fought with his school friends.

814
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,137
What?

815
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,640
Oh, right. Yes.

816
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,434
I think it made him happy.

817
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,812
You were the first adult
to take his side in this neighborhood.

818
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,314
My gosh, don't mention it.

819
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:25,485
I know I shouldn't be biased
as a police officer.

820
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,779
But I really couldn't help it.

821
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,490
But please don't take him
to the video arcade.

822
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,826
-Okay.
-Enjoy your peanuts, then.

823
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,453
What?

824
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,080
Are you going somewhere?

825
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:51,219
Are you on patrol again?

826
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:56,099
You seemed to be leaving alone,
so I got worried.

827
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:57,601
Why?

828
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,021
Why are you worried about me?

829
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,399
Why did you get involved
when I was fighting earlier?

830
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:07,069
And why did you get that 8,000 won for me?

831
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:11,198
I don't know why,
but I constantly find myself...

832
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,916
Is it because I'm the most pitiful person
in the neighborhood?

833
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,213
-What?
-I also have a sense of pride.

834
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:30,384
Starting from what happened with Mr. No
to what happened just now,

835
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:34,972
I feel like you always catch me
in my most embarrassing moments.

836
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,808
It's uncomfortable being around someone

837
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,851
who's seen me get humiliated.

838
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:41,812
It's annoying.

839
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:43,855
So please

840
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,899
just mind your own business.

841
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,822
Will you stop following me?

842
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,907
It's because I feel nervous!

843
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,742
Why?

844
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,746
Do you think I'll leave my son behind
and jump into the lake or something?

845
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,041
-I know you won't do that.
-Then why are you nervous?

846
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,793
Why do you keep following me?

847
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,879
I'm worried that you might cry!

848
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:11,633
You'll obviously go somewhere
and end up crying all by yourself.

849
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,389
Who are you to care whether I cry or not?

850
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,182
I got really angry

851
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:24,396
when I saw you cry earlier
even though we're complete strangers.

852
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,277
What a weirdo.

853
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,656
I'll just walk behind you
as if I don't exist.

854
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:38,869
Just think of me as a pet dog.
I'll be quiet.

855
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,620
A pet dog would at least be cute.

856
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,715
He's really acting like a dog.

857
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,717
Why's he following me
without saying anything?

858
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,303
-You should think about your son.
-What?

859
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:03,351
You can't just leave without him
just because you're angry.

860
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,270
It could really ruin his life.

861
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:07,481
Where would I go without my son?

862
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:11,026
Then why did you come
to a train station at this hour?

863
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,570
I'm just going to go inside and sit down.

864
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,992
Why would you just sit there?
It's not like you're homeless.

865
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:22,037
That's my gas station.
Let me fill up my gas tank.

866
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,371
So stop following me now.

867
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:26,166
A gas station?
The train station doesn't sell any gas.

868
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,001
I'm thinking about switching jobs.

869
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,045
Switch jobs?

870
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:33,465
A man should learn to dream big.

871
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,051
Let's talk once we get there.
Aren't we there yet?

872
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,469
We're here.

873
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:40,680
This is where you go
to socialize in Ongsan.

874
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:42,682
Come inside.

875
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,643
CAMELLIA

876
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,187
This is what she named the place?

877
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,194
A hotdog joint?

878
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,612
That sounds great.

879
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,865
Or do you want to sell
hand-pulled noodles?

880
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,625
A stationmaster?

881
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,669
Do you want to drive a train?

882
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,798
Why would I drive a train?

883
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,218
So tell me what you have in mind
as your next job.

884
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:20,804
I'm not going to tell you.

885
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,723
Dongbaek.

886
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,226
Words have power, you know.

887
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,396
You need to talk about your dreams
in order for them to come true.

888
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:33,400
And you should tell your biggest secrets
to complete strangers.

889
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,861
-Says who?
-Hwang Yong-sik.

890
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,576
Then just tell me the first letter.

891
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,870
Why are you so curious about my dream?

892
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,496
I'm dying to know.

893
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,624
It's nothing much.

894
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,169
Then why can't you just tell me?

895
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,006
I just...

896
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,343
Never mind.

897
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,514
I just...

898
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,434
A public enterprise...

899
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,144
What?

900
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,856
I want to get a job
at the National Railroad Administration.

901
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,617
Oh, you want to get a job
at a public enterprise?

902
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:27,579
My gosh, you really know how to dream big.

903
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,875
And more importantly,
that's where I want to work.

904
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,835
I want to sit in that office.

905
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,546
Where?

906
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,465
The Lost and Found Center?

907
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,717
Why?

908
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,471
Because people always say something to you

909
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,724
whenever you find something for them.

910
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,310
What?

911
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:51,978
They thank you.

912
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,356
They always thank you.

913
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,319
Throughout my life,

914
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,073
I've always had people apologize to me.

915
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,660
And people say "I love you" very easily.

916
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,120
But for some strange reason,

917
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,957
no one ever thanks me.

918
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,251
No one says "Thank you."

919
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:22,968
But that person is like an angel
and a savior at the Lost and Found Center.

920
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,806
She finds your cell phone,
your baby's doll,

921
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,809
and even the side dishes you packed
for your son and his wife.

922
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:36,064
Just like now, people thank her
over and over again.

923
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,150
I can't even imagine
how great that must feel.

924
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,372
Strangely enough,

925
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,333
I suddenly found myself burning inside.

926
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,128
I couldn't tell

927
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,965
if it was anger or sorriness,
but I was definitely burning inside.

928
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,186
Dongbaek.

929
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:16,938
From now on,

930
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,357
don't come here by yourself

931
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,901
regardless of how upset you may be.

932
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,280
And don't mind what other people say.

933
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,408
If you get hurt by everything they say,

934
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,618
you won't be able to live a proper life.

935
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,956
Why can't I just get used to getting hurt?

936
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,710
It hurts so much every time.

937
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,171
It feels as if

938
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:44,632
someone is stabbing my heart with a knife.

939
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,928
Then you should treat them
exactly the same way.

940
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,889
You should be just as mean

941
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:54,017
to people who are rude
and don't know how to thank you.

942
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:57,896
Why bother? I'll just ignore them.

943
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,149
Why would you just ignore them
and do nothing

944
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,610
when they're nothing but mean to you?

945
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:10,367
People come to drink
when they're so sick of life.

946
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,370
They're annoyed and exhausted
with everything.

947
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:17,874
So I just want to be nice to them.

948
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,461
It doesn't cost money to be nice.
We should be nice to each other.

949
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,463
But

950
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,007
I sometimes feel like the neighbors

951
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,218
are a bit too mean to me.

952
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,178
They sometimes cross the line.

953
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:35,350
And that sometimes really upsets me.

954
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,105
Dongbaek,

955
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,190
you're really beautiful.

956
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,566
You really are.

957
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:47,779
But you have a way of making me
get really angry sometimes.

958
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,582
Come closer. Come on.

959
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,709
We don't want to catch a cold.

960
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,462
This is so uncomfortable.

961
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,589
You should cover yourself as well.

962
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,299
Or just get another umbrella.

963
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,510
This tiny umbrella costs 8,000 won.

964
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,929
Don't waste your money on an umbrella.

965
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,306
You really seem to care a lot
about my money.

966
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,516
My gosh, be careful.

967
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,908
About uniform number three...

968
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,911
Number three? Pil-gu?

969
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,874
Kang Pil-gu?

970
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:43,751
-How do you even know his last name?
-What?

971
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,214
I think I saw his name.

972
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,260
He does stand out a lot.

973
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,179
Why?

974
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,097
He's got talent.

975
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,099
Isn't that why you're interested?

976
00:57:58,558 --> 00:57:59,767
Really?

977
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,144
He's got talent?

978
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:06,107
This isn't my personal opinion.
I actually read it in a book.

979
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:09,694
If you eat sashimi with soju
when you're feeling upset,

980
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:12,238
the frontal lobe lets out
certain hormones--

981
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,366
No, I don't drink with strangers.

982
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,744
I'm not a stranger. I'm Hwang Yong-sik.

983
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:19,037
Okay.

984
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,080
We don't have to drink soju.

985
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:24,000
But take me with you
whenever you go to the train station.

986
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,878
I won't say anything.
I'll just walk by your side.

987
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,130
Why would you do that?

988
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,257
My name is Hwang Yong-sik.

989
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:35,762
Okay, but why would you
come with me, Mr. Hwang?

990
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,597
What a do-gooder.

991
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:43,436
Then how about we become something
where it's okay for me to be good to you?

992
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,273
What?

993
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,902
Let's do "that."

994
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,321
What?

995
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,448
Let's become...

996
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,409
friends.

997
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,828
Let's be friends.

998
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,296
No one's ever asked me to be their friend.

999
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:15,260
I'm not the type of guy who asks anyone

1000
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,262
to be friends.

1001
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:19,764
Then why...

1002
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:22,100
Let's be friends. If we become friends...

1003
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,479
-Who do you think you are?
-Who do you think you are?

1004
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,315
If we become friends,

1005
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,025
will you

1006
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,696
let me side with you and Pil-gu
whenever I want?

1007
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,491
Can I always be on your side?

1008
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,787
-You want to be on my side?
-Yes.

1009
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:45,498
My gosh, well...

1010
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,293
I'm not asking you to date me.

1011
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:53,214
I'm just asking you to be friends.

1012
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,716
That's all I'm asking.

1013
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,217
Let's...

1014
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,553
be friends.

1015
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:04,934
For now at least.

1016
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,689
My gosh, Dongbaek.

1017
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,275
I LOVE ONLY YOU

1018
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,079
What's Pil-gu doing?

1019
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,080
He's sleeping.

1020
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:29,417
CAMELLIA

1021
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,337
Sir, this is a non-smoking area.

1022
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,679
Well...

1023
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,223
You should bring Pil-gu out now.

1024
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:49,937
My husband treats me so well
that I even forgot what you looked like.

1025
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,731
You should take him with you

1026
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,651
now that we're about to go home...

1027
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,991
Let's just go.

1028
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,037
Only ten minutes after agreeing
to be friends...

1029
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:08,956
I realized

1030
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:11,918
that I can't be friends with her.

1031
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,551
What's going on?

1032
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,221
Let's go.

1033
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,181
Are you guys dating?

1034
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:27,392
They're dating?

1035
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:30,395
Are we dating?

1036
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,234
Are we dating now?

1037
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:59,674
DONGBAEK, I ENJOYED THE FOOD

1038
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:03,302
MS. DONGBAEK, I ENJOYED THE FOOD

1039
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:10,017
Why are they talking to Dongbaek
as if she's their friend?

1040
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,687
This is on the house.

1041
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:17,316
Why are you giving me peanuts for free?

1042
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:21,988
I heard you took Pil-gu's side
when he fought with his school friends.

1043
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:25,783
What? Oh, right. Yes.

1044
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,910
I think it made him happy.

1045
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:32,498
DONGBAEK, YOU ALSO NEED TO STOP
BEING A JOKE

1046
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:58,399
I think mankind was able to prosper

1047
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:01,027
because men and women were impulsive.

1048
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,279
You should do what you think is right.

1049
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:05,823
Most importantly,
you're really not my type.

1050
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:08,868
I've been such a kind landlord until now.

1051
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,704
Some people still don't know
the Lease Protection Law.

1052
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,707
-It's a sin to be dumb.
-Hey!

1053
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,628
The neighbors will have more to talk about
if you keep behaving this way.

1054
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:21,339
I told you not to mess with Dongbaek.

1055
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:24,133
I'll kill whoever messes with her.
