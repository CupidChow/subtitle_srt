ONGSAN RICE SHOP

5
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,858
What's going on?

6
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,028
Let's go.

7
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,988
Are you guys dating?

8
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,282
They're dating?

9
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,743
Are we dating?

10
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,999
Are we dating now?

11
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,378
CAMELLIA

12
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,006
Jong-ryeol, did you take my lighter...

13
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,467
I took it.

14
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,277
These days, you can't smoke in bars.

15
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,909
Well, I guess
I missed the right timing to leave.

16
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,745
-I missed the right timing.
-You sure did.

17
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,168
Dongbaek, you're one busy lady.

18
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,171
You have to look after your son,
date, and run your bar.

19
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,798
She runs a bar?

20
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,342
Will you be able to pay
your rent for Camellia on time?

21
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,762
Well...

22
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,515
I'm really sorry
to go back on my word so quickly...

23
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:23,726
but...

24
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,354
I don't think I can be friends with you.

25
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,776
I'm not okay with just being your friend.

26
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,613
The bomber is ready to take off,

27
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,199
and there's no such thing as a secret.

28
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:44,998
THE MUTT'S STRATEGY

29
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,668
Especially in this small town, Ongsan.

30
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,129
They were holding hands,
so they've gone all the way.

31
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,590
I wonder where
they were coming from that late.

32
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,467
Gosh, Ms. Kwak was always
so protective of Dongbaek.

33
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,803
I guess Dongbaek will be
her daughter-in-law.

34
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,680
She told me he's dating a lawyer.

35

INTERSECTION RICE CAKE

36
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,518
You look prettier today.

37
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,772
Oh, my. Look at your bangs.
It looks like you styled them today.

38
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,482
My gosh, you look great today.

39
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,861
I didn't sleep much last night,
so I look tired today.

40
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:15,987
Really?

41
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,532
-What happened? You need to sleep well.
-Oh, dear.

42
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,701
-Dongbaek.
-Does this even make sense to you?

43
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,579
-What?
-Why would he date a single mother?

44
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,167
What? I'm talking about this TV show.

45
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,668
-Oh, right.
-That TV show.

46
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:34,672
-Yes.
-I mean, is it even possible?

47
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,842
Either the guy has some serious flaw,
or the girl has the wrong idea.

48
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,637
-You're right.
-It's just a TV show, you know?

49
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,139
I'd like a pack of injeolmi.

50
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,099
No need to buy it
just because you feel bad.

51
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,311
I'll have a word with Hyang-mi.

52
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,605
I'll tell her to pay the million won
back soon...

53
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,984
Have a word with her?
What she needs is a good slap.

54
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,280
Dongbaek...

55
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,533
-What's with you today?
-Darn it.

56
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,912
-Are they bullying her again?
-You don't have any money on you?

57
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,672
I'm off.
I'll talk to Hyang-mi when I get home.

58
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,138
Dongbaek!

59
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,101
-Are you running away or what?
-Why would I?

60
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,686
Then why are you walking so fast?

61
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,939
Wait, stop. Don't follow me, please.

62
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,816
Why are you following me again?

63
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:40,029
Well, shouldn't we talk about
the hand incident last night... My gosh.

64
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,700
I mean, shouldn't we talk about
what happened last night?

65
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,451
My gosh.

66
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:50,540
You see, I couldn't sleep a wink
last night because of this hand.

67
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,086
I kept asking myself,
"Why did Dongbaek hold my hand?"

68
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,338
Stop talking about your hand, will you?

69
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,384
"What could it mean?"

70
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,847
I kept racking my brain,
trying to figure out what it could mean.

71
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,391
By any chance, does it mean...

72
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,937
Does it mean we can hold hands
whenever we want from now on?

73
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,358
POLICE

74
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,987
Let's go somewhere quiet and talk.

75
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,199
"Somewhere quiet"?

76
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,836
If anyone saw us now, they'd think
a cop is about to get robbed or something.

77
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,507
Why did you bring me
to this deserted alley?

78
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,721
-I'm sorry.
-What?

79
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,726
I made a mistake.

80
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,229
I can't explain everything,

81
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,732
but I was in a bit of a situation
last night.

82
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,735
It was urgent,
so I did it without thinking...

83
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,111
Right, I understand.

84
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,657
You see, when you hold someone's hand,

85
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:11,412
it's always done impulsively.

86
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,333
I think mankind was able to prosper

87
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,960
because men and women were impulsive.

88
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,423
If you try to calculate everything...
Gosh, it just makes you look petty.

89
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,385
In the end,
whether you use your brain or not...

90
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,721
Whether you go this way or that way,
it doesn't matter.

91
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,681
What are you talking about?

92
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,392
You can win someone's heart

93
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,020
in just three seconds.

94
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,274
I realized it in three seconds
the moment I first saw you

95
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,610
at the bookstore.

96
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,494
But I never intended that to happen.

97
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:56,457
Plus, you don't even know much about me.

98
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,544
I simply fell in love at first sight.

99
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,628
My gosh.

100
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:04,340
I'm not the type to plan or calculate
the push and pull in a relationship.

101
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,969
"I should just go for it
if she's not married."

102
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,263
I've made up my mind.

103
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,348
What are you talking about?

104
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,226
How could you be so reckless--

105
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:19,105
Sure, we should all be careful
and cautious, but I think

106
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,315
it's more important
to give your 100 percent.

107
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,317
If I keep testing the waters...

108
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,028
you, Diana of Ongsan,

109
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,407
will walk away from me.

110
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,243
When you're sure about something,
you have to go for it.

111
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,787
Why are you calling me "Diana"?

112
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,749
This guy isn't just straightforward.
He doesn't hold back at all.

113
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,710
Oh, gosh.

114
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,380
We shouldn't be talking about this
in front of this "No Pee Zone."

115
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,717
Well, how about we go
for some pork cutlet later?

116
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,552
Pork cutlet? Why?

117
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,304
Do you want to profess your love to me?

118
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,895
Dongbaek, you can be quite blunt at times.

119
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,108
Yong-sik.

120
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,028
Yes.

121
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,449
I'll have to reject you in advance.

122
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,791
There it is.

123
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,003
-It's 18 kilograms.
-Okay, 18 kilograms.

124
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,507
-Nice.
-Give it to me.

125
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,760
Gosh, they're so nice and fresh.

126
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:35,473
By the way, do you think
Ms. Kwak knows about this?

127
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,683
-If she knew, she would've thrown a fit.
-Why?

128
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,894
Dongbaek and Ms. Kwak are really close.

129
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,563
They may have been close,
but the situation is different now.

130
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,149
Dongbaek was just
a pitiful neighbor to her.

131
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,985
But things would be different
if she's dating her son.

132
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,321
I guess you're right.

133
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,741
Even the kindest woman would go nuts
if her son fell for a single mother.

134
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,661
Once Deok-sun finds out,
all hell will break loose.

135
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,413
Who gave you permission
to call me by my first name?

136
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,873
-Hello.
-Hi.

137
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,501
No, don't get me wrong.

138
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,171
We were just talking about
when your son will get married.

139
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,550
Watch what you tell her.
All hell will break loose.

140
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,927
He'll get married when he wants to.

141
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,013
If you cause a fuss,
you'll only end up ruining things.

142
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,308
I'm just going to wait
and see how things turn out.

143
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,271
Then what kind of girl do you want
as your daughter-in-law?

144
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,899
We're not living in the middle ages.
That kind of stuff isn't important.

145
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,859
It's about how much they love each other.

146
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,364
I'm not the kind of person
to be fussy about my daughter-in-law.

147
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,491
That's a very old-fashioned mindset.

148
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,743
Wait, come on.

149
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,204
It's not fair to just reject me
in advance like that.

150
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,082
You should at least tell me
why you don't like me.

151
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,752
Then I'll fix whatever that is
or decide to give up on you.

152
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,255
Let's make him give up on me.

153
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,220
Life isn't like a drama you see on TV.

154
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,223
Single mothers also have standards.

155
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,729
Just because I'm a single mother
doesn't mean I'm okay with anyone

156
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,147
that likes me.

157
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:11,652
Most importantly,
you're really not my type.

158
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,532
Well, then tell me your type.
I'll become that kind of person.

159
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,200
Gong Yoo.

160
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,246
I like bad boys.

161
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,206
But

162
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,084
you look like the type...

163
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,795
who'll easily lend money to others.

164
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,548
I like guys who are kind of cold.

165
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,717
They need to be witty and refined.

166
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,471
I like guys who are sensitive
and are hard to get.

167
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,306
You know what I mean, right?

168
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,600
Why isn't he saying anything?

169
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,978
How can a human being beat a goblin?

170
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,647
I can't beat a goblin.

171
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,440
What?

172
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,360
Well...

173
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,863
I need to patrol the neighborhood now.

174
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,492
Patrol? All of a sudden?

175
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,293
Was I too mean?

176
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,879
He's making me feel uneasy.

177
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,051
Why did he stop?

178
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,805
-Dongbaek!
-My gosh.

179
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,431
I... Well...

180
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:27,228
A mutt is the cutest type of dog!

181
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,857
And it's the little things that grow
on you without you knowing.

182
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,237
Me?

183
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,324
Just don't regret this later on
and start following me around.

184
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,000
What was that? Was that a declaration
of war, or a love confession?

185
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,253
My gosh.

186
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,313
-Is it hot?
-No.

187
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,734
You look like you were
in front of a fire or something.

188
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,111
Me?

189
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,656
Hyang-mi.

190
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,283
Why did you

191
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,494
borrow money
from the rice cake owner's husband?

192
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:26,996
That's personal.

193
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,999
Why do you go around
borrowing money from people?

194
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,417
What about your monthly pay?

195
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,128
You talk as if I get paid
tens of millions of won.

196
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,381
Let's pay him back first.

197
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,842
I don't have any money to pay him back.

198
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,051
I'll pay you in advance.

199
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,555
Why would you do that for a part-timer?

200
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,434
She still has a long way to go
before she grows up.

201
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,729
What's his bank account number?

202
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,230
A place where you can have fun!

203
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,482
You must have some money.

204
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,025
3 DAYS IN QINGDAO

205
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,611
I don't have any money at all.

206
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,654
Don't make things worse
by causing trouble.

207
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,074
Don't make things worse
by being so cold to me.

208
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,662
My mom doesn't even visit that often.

209
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,664
She only comes two to three times a week.

210
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,041
Why can't you be nice?

211
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,878
I heard you left the bar
without paying 8,000 won

212
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,672
and got your wallet confiscated
by a constable.

213
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,427
Didn't you have 8,000 won?

214
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,641
Well, the thing is...

215
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,061
We have a newbie at the precinct station.

216
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,773
I organized a gathering to welcome him,
but we ended up getting into an argument.

217
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:36,982
So what?

218
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,819
Are you going to sue him?

219
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:45,574
It's not about the lawsuit.
It's about my authority.

220
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,244
-Are you sure it's not about illicit love?
-What?

221
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,085
You got this eye cream
from a buy one, get one free event.

222
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,421
If you buy one that's 100ml,

223
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,341
you get this one that's 20ml.

224
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,971
What, 100 milliliters?

225
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,358
Honey.

226
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,360
Don't sue him.

227
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,656
You can go around embarrassing yourself.

228
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,616
But don't humiliate me.

229
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,330
The least you can do for me
is to help me protect my pride.

230
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,297
Why do you even live with me?

231
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,637
ONGSAN ARTS CENTER

232
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,222
Ms. Hong.

233
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,934
Camellia was part of the old contract,
so it won't get protected anymore, right?

234
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,978
-What?
-Camellia.

235
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,147
The bar that you guys leased out
at the market.

236
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,107
I think I've heard of it.

237
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,735
I noticed that the contract there
is going to end soon.

238
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,404
-Are you going to renew it?
-My husband will deal with it.

239
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,616
But shouldn't you get involved
if they decide to renew the deal?

240
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,326
My husband will take care of it.

241
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,621
You should take a look at your neighbor
and see how she's doing.

242
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,581
My husband will take care of it.

243
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,791
It'd be great
if he takes care of it properly.

244
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,210
-But I'm not sure if he will.
-Exactly.

245
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,963
Mr. No practically lives there.

246
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,674
Why would you say that?
He goes three to four times a week.

247
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,053
My husband didn't lend a million won
to someone

248
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,346
because he's the only fool

249
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,889
-in the neighborhood.
-Right.

250
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:35,142
I heard Mr. No is the only one
who buys hard liquor there.

251
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,977
If he didn't like her at all,

252
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,688
why would he spend money there
and let her earn so much?

253
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,357
My goodness.

254
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,277
Mr. No may have gotten the lowest grades
back when he was in high school,

255
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,446
but I'm sure his brain still works fine.

256
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,240
There's no way he'd cheat on his sexy wife

257
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,243
with that single mother
who runs a damn bar.

258
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,872
She stands no chance against Ms. Hong.

259
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,625
I'm just saying she should
keep an eye on her husband.

260
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,044
-Of course.
-This isn't just your problem, you know.

261
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,253
You're right.

262
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,590
If a guy is determined to cheat,

263
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,425
he'll cheat no matter what you do.

264
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,094
-What?
-You can try everything

265
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,555
starting from tracking his location
to tracing his credit card,

266
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,599
but he'll still cheat if he wants to.

267
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,268
If he's not that type of guy, he won't.

268
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,148
My husband will never cheat on me
even if Dongbaek comes onto him.

269
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,902
I'll be off now.

270
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,529
Okay, go ahead.

271
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,700
Gosh, it's always impressive
to see a woman drive.

272
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:44,461
She really is a magnanimous woman.

273
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,132
It must be hard for Gyu-tae
to meet her standards.

274
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,926
Magnanimous, my ass. She's intimidated.

275
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,302
Really?

276
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,388
She's totally intimidated.

277
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,141
She says she doesn't know Camellia.

278
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,143
But she knew Dongbaek's name.

279
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,314
You can't stop
just because it's a yellow light.

280
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,899
I knew you'd be a woman.

281
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,861
If you have free time,
just go home and take a nap.

282
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,905
What is a woman doing outside
driving a car?

283
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,617
You should fucking get married
and just cook for your husband.

284
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,536
Why would you drive a car?

285
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,458
What... What's that finger
supposed to mean?

286
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,667
I'm married already.

287
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,338
-What?
-I'm married.

288
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,929
Don't be so nervous.

289
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,057
Just look at the camera
and speak comfortably.

290
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,725
Do I begin?

291
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,812
The biggest thing
that confused the investigation...

292
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,275
was that the victims didn't have
a common ground.

293
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,321
The first victim was a prostitute.

294
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,491
So we thought it'd be a sex crime,
but it wasn't.

295
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,328
Then we thought maybe he had
a strong hatred toward women,

296
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,038
but the next victim was a man.

297
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:01,997
DON'T BE A JOKE

298
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,624
The jjajangmyeon delivery guy?

299
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,917
Yes.

300
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:09,171
And in 15 days, the president of an
apartment residents' society got murdered.

301
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,592
The fourth victim was a boy
who was in sixth grade.

302
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,969
And the last victim was a skin therapist.

303
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,307
The victims all had nothing in common.

304
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:28,482
But we always found the same memo
written in the same handwriting.

305
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,983
PLEASE DON'T BE A JOKE

306
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,068
Here you go.

307
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,528
Thank you.

308
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,490
The memos always had the same handwriting,

309
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,494
and he always finished off
with three dots at the end.

310
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,163
It's like he wanted us to know
that it was him.

311
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:47,334
Everyone in the country
knows about the memo.

312
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,253
Is there anything new?

313
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,130
Like what?

314
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,383
I heard there was a survivor
at the scene of the accident

315
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,844
when the skin therapist got murdered.

316
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,513
No one really raised an issue about that.

317
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,432
Can we meet that person?

318
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,603
We'll protect that person's identity
and offer big compensation.

319
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,940
That person was a witness, not a survivor.
And don't dig into that.

320
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,568
Wait a minute. There was a witness?

321
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,735
No!

322
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,780
When are you going to fix the sink?

323
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,615
Heung-sik will come by soon.

324
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,909
Is there something in there?

325
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,289
By the way...

326
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,292
Are they really dating?

327
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,460
You don't date
just because you hold hands.

328
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,255
Then why were they holding hands?

329
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,758
The constable obviously likes Dongbaek.

330
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,051
So they held hands?

331
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,680
It's probably a one-sided thing.
He's really not her type.

332
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,599
Then why did she hold his hand?

333
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,393
Stop causing a fuss.
What's the big deal about holding hands?

334
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,896
If it's not a big deal,
why won't she hold my hand?

335
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:55,068
So let me get this straight.
She doesn't mind him holding her hand,

336
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,738
but she totally pushed mine away?

337
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,866
You're always telling her to drink
and give you free peanuts.

338
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,992
You annoy her.

339
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:06,246
Hey, I'm the only guy who buys hard liquor
at this shabby bar.

340
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,248
Why can't she give me free peanuts?

341
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,377
She's the annoying one.

342
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,589
She never offers her customer
a free bowl of peanuts.

343
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,425
-She does.
-What?

344
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,386
She does offer free peanuts.
She just doesn't give them to you.

345
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,973
She gave some to Yong-sik.

346
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,183
THANKS FOR THE FREE PEANUTS!

347
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,352
She gives peaches
to Heung-sik and Seung-yeop.

348
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,355
They only order soju,
but she still gives them stuff for free.

349
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,653
Are you saying I'm the only one
who never got free peanuts?

350
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,864
This is eye cream.

351
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,742
She discriminated me with peanuts?

352
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,870
-Is it for Dongbaek?
-Why would I give her that?

353
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,248
Then why did you bring it here?
It's Chadel.

354
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,458
Why do you have a limited edition?

355
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,710
Why do you carry around a 100ml eye cream?

356
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,838
What? Do you want it? You can keep it.

357
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,259
-Really?
-It's nothing expensive.

358
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,011
I bought it at a duty-free shop
because they gave free samples.

359
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,056
But I can't really give it to my wife now.

360
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,183
I got lucky today.

361
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,477
I can't believe I got eye cream
from a guy like you.

362
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,021
-A guy like me?
-You're on a different level.

363
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,276
A different level?

364
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,112
You're a landlord, you're smart,

365
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,656
you're the future governor,
and you have a lot of hair.

366
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,158
You're one of the best guys in Ongsan.

367
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,079
That's complete nonsense.
My wife and Dongbaek all look down on me.

368
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,623
I respect you.

369
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,628
What?

370
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,297
What did you just say?

371
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,841
"Respect"?

372
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:44,636
I wonder why that word moved my heart.

373
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,682
This much probably costs about 2,000 won.

374
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,601
Thanks to you,
I got to slab money on my eyes.

375
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,440
I've never had a woman tell me
that she respects me.

376
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,774
My gosh.

377
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,153
We're not open yet.

378
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,988
They're not open yet.

379
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:08,994
Do you live here?

380
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,164
Call everyone you know
at Ongsan Police Station

381
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,498
so we can find the witness.

382
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,417
He told us not to dig into that.

383
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,545
Unanswered Questions is
going to do a cover on the Joker.

384
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:22,174
Ongsan is finally getting attention.
We should strike while the iron's hot.

385
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,134
The Joker didn't even get caught.

386
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,720
Wouldn't it be dangerous
to reveal the witness?

387
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,348
The headline should say
"The One and Only Survivor"

388
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,558
rather than "The One and Only Witness."

389
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,436
-But it's a witness.
-Gosh.

390
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,106
Who knows if the Joker had
initially planned to kill that person?

391
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:43,236
And isn't it weird that he let one person
escape from the scene alive?

392
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,702
-What are you doing here?
-What?

393
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,953
Shouldn't you be at work?

394
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,165
-What?
-Did you do something wrong?

395
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,625
Why are you so intimidated?

396
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,794
I'm not intimidated.

397
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,672
But you showed up so unexpectedly--

398
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,341
Can't I take a look at my building?

399
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,218
Your building?

400
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:09,596
Didn't we register this building
under both our names?

401
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,599
We agreed to do that
because you earn less than I do.

402
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,356
It wasn't exactly
because of how much I earn...

403
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,400
Why don't you kick them out
of the building?

404
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,360
-What?
-Kick them out.

405
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:24,778
Why?

406
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,823
It just bothers me.

407
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,991
Who? I mean, what?

408
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,536
Everything.

409
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,996
It's filthy.

410
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,963
But it's not easy to just tell them
to leave. They're doing business here.

411
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,340
So you can't do it?

412
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,178
You're not going to do it?

413
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,770
Why are you getting involved
in my business?

414
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,690
I was always in charge
of handling the tenants.

415
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,275
You're refusing to kick them out?

416
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,652
I'll deal with it myself.

417
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,196
As the decision-maker of the family--

418
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,322
Okay, fine.

419
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,074
Just leave it for now, then.

420
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,326
"For now"?

421
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,956
Judging by your behavior,

422
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,750
it seems like this building
will soon become mine.

423
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:35,265
My hunch tells me
that the Joker is still here.

424
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,433
Marinated crabs for lunch?

425
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,518
It's been exactly five years now.

426
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,146
And the world is
starting to give him attention,

427
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,941
so he's probably
getting all excited again.

428
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,278
Jerks like him
tend to be attention-seekers.

429
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,113
I'll call and make a reservation.

430
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,535
Is your mom never going to give us
a discount? You're her son.

431
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,330
Never in her life.
She even makes me pay for beverages.

432
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,582
What about lunch discounts?

433
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,542
You should suggest that to her.

434
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,711
If you think about it,

435
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,839
the market price for marinated crabs
don't go down during lunchtime.

436
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,967
He's taking his mother's side.

437
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:16,723
Since my mom doesn't
give us discounts for lunch...

438
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,730
I have to say, the best dish
you can have with rice

439
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:27,275
is stir-fried pork, not marinated crabs.

440
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,905
If there's a fight between stir-fried pork
and marinated crabs...

441
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:34,950
What?

442
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,703
Dongbaek, did you have to cook rice
because of us?

443
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,622
Rice doesn't take that long to cook.

444
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,294
Dongbaek, why don't you use this chance
to start selling lunch?

445
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,838
If you do business at night, it's a bar.

446
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,675
But if you sell lunch,
it becomes a restaurant.

447
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,718
I'll take care of my own business.

448
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,598
You little punk. Look at you.

449
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,685
-What?
-You fell for her, didn't you?

450
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,312
My hunch is always right.

451
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,193
Why don't you use your hunch
to investigate instead of using it now?

452
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,278
Hey.

453
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,991
-What?
-You like Hyang-mi, don't you?

454
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,873
Hey, come on. Look at me in the eyes.

455
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,127
You can't fool me.

456
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,132
Sir, just eat your food.

457
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,806
I was wondering
why you opened so early today.

458
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,685
But I guess it's because you have
a special guest.

459
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,314
My goodness.

460
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,859
Look at that.
Why did you nail wood up there?

461
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,194
My gosh, why would you do this?

462
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,946
-Where exactly?
-Goodness.

463
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,573
Why are you taking photos of that?

464
00:26:56,656 --> 00:27:00,702
You need to fix the sink
with your own money.

465
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:04,497
You're the one who broke it,
so it's only right that you pay for it.

466
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,624
-Of course.
-Right.

467
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,542
Oh, gosh.

468
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,421
Look at the broken tiles.

469
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:16,676
The tenant needs to fix everything
back to how it was.

470
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,678
This was like this before I came here.

471
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,890
Heung-sik, take a look at the tiles.

472
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,767
Okay.

473
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:28,021
My gosh, this is really expensive.
How could you ruin this?

474
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,570
-It's really pricey.
-I found something in the sink...

475
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,283
Heung-sik, do you want some
multi-grain shake?

476
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,705
I can't believe
you totally ruined this wall.

477
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,291
I really loved this wall.

478
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,877
I can't even use this
as a warehouse anymore.

479
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,130
You ruined the wall
and destroyed the tiles.

480
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,759
My goodness, you even
nailed something on the wall.

481
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,886
If you sign a deal with the wrong tenant,

482
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,056
you end up ruining the entire building.

483
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,350
Chief, from what I heard,

484
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:09,938
this place used to be
a really filthy warehouse for dried fish.

485
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,066
I mean, how could the landlord
not even build a window for her?

486
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,860
That's not a window.
Sunlight doesn't come through.

487
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,947
This is all because the landlord
has a bad character.

488
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,784
I've been such a kind landlord until now.

489
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,121
Wait a minute.
Does the contract end in December?

490
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,498
Chief, I noticed that some people

491
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,501
still don't know the Lease Protection Act.

492
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,796
We should arrest all of them to teach them

493
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,173
that it's a sin to be dumb.

494
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:41,302
I didn't know thieves had
any interest for the law.

495
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,555
Dongbaek, pick the right person
to side with.

496
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,516
If you hang around with a criminal,
you'll offend the landlord.

497
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,185
Chief, you know how harsh
the world can be nowadays, right?

498
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,438
If you abuse your power,
you could lose everything.

499
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:55,817
My gosh, look at that wall.
What a complete mess.

500
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,529
I want you to restore the wall today.

501
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,575
Today? How? Where am I going
to find the right person to do that?

502
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:06,453
Dongbaek, don't worry.

503
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,788
There's a paperhanger right here.

504
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:10,874
Who?

505
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,959
Hwang Yong-sik.

506
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:19,591
You see, I'm a paperhanger
with an international certificate.

507
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,676
Hey, stop being so ridiculous.

508
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,721
Just take care of
Yeong-sim's dog problem first.

509
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,847
Okay, I will.

510
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:30,101
I'll paint all the walls here tonight.

511
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,104
This place is so damn tiny.

512
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,565
It'll only take me
about two to three hours.

513
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:40,695
I'm guessing you at least own a place
that's this damn tiny.

514
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,202
Heung-sik, you have extra paint
at your store, right?

515
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,745
Yes.

516
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:52,165
I'm planning to erase all the scribbles

517
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,834
on the wall tonight.

518
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,920
Do you have the right color?

519
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,922
Well...

520
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,966
Heung-sik, you should eat before you go.

521
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,468
I made a lot of rice.

522
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,679
No, I'll just eat with my father--

523
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,847
Hey!

524
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,935
Why aren't you offering me any food?

525
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,230
If you made so much rice,
why aren't you offering me any?

526
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,273
Why?

527
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,456
I'll pay you for this.

528
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,624
What?

529
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,292
My goodness.

530
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,253
Come on, there's no need.

531
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,548
-Why not?
-What?

532
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,301
I'm going to pay you.

533
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,014
Okay, fine. Go ahead.

534
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,728
This place stinks of paint.
You should wait over there.

535
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,701
Why does he get intimidated
by everything I say?

536
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,538
He's a grown man, but he acts like Pil-gu.

537
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,832
Then why are you giving him
a multi-grain shake?

538
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,129
Look at him. He's working so hard
to paint the walls.

539
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,964
He's covered in sweat right now.

540
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,675
Pil-gu also sweats a lot.

541
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:28,011
Why is a grown man
acting exactly like Pil-gu?

542
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,639
-You're being weird.
-What do you mean?

543
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,976
You act so irritated in front of him
for some reason.

544
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,354
-I do?
-You're really blunt to him, too.

545
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:42,358
I never saw you talk like that to anyone.
You're always so quiet.

546
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,569
Really?

547
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,864
Do you think I'm being too mean to him?

548
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,451
I guess you find him easy.

549
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,954
What are you talking about? He's just...

550
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,751
She's so difficult.

551
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,213
She's such a difficult woman.

552
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,636
I don't find him easy. It's just that...

553
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,471
You find him comfortable.

554
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,974
When things feel easy with someone,
they get comfortable, then heartrending,

555
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,435
and then it becomes awfully romantic.

556
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,062
No way.

557
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,025
Do you think I'm too harsh on him?

558
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,902
Just keep treating him that way.

559
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,112
What?

560
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,573
Do you know the kind of women
that men love the most?

561
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,825
The ones that hate them.

562
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,458
Hey, you had some beer again, didn't you?

563
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,337
These idiots don't get how precious
a woman is when she likes them,

564
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,506
but they go crazy
for women who hate them.

565
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,138
Hey, you need to stop drinking
during the day. Okay?

566
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,850
So I'm telling you
to continue to turn him down.

567
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,121
Why would anyone mention

568
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,415
something about her legs
on this public wall?

569
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,543
Darn it.

570
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,467
Wait, we need to find this jerk
who mentioned her legs here.

571
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,886
We need to track him down.

572
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,642
This guy has dangerous ideas.

573
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:44,188
I should keep track of these handwritings

574
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,816
of the men who mention her legs...

575
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,163
Wait.

576
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,624
DONGBAEK, YOU ALSO NEED TO STOP
BEING A JOKE

577
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,211
That psycho left a message
whenever he killed someone.

578
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,671
It said, "Don't be a joke."

579
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,840
The memos always had the same handwriting,

580
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,968
and he always finished off
with three dots at the end.

581
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,603
DONGBAEK, YOU ALSO NEED TO STOP
BEING A JOKE

582
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,492
The multi-grain shake is free.

583
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,952
It's not just for you.

584
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,622
I give it to Heung-sik

585
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:46,084
when he comes to fix the sink, and
I give it to the internet cable guy, too.

586
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,631
Why? Do you want me to charge you?

587
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,885
Well...

588
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,513
Wait, Dongbaek.

589
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,808
How long has it been since you came here?

590
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,559
Why?

591
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,730
Six years. It has been
exactly six years, hasn't it?

592
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,743
My goodness.

593
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,496
Why did you barge in like that?
Did you come to rob...

594
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,249
What happened to you?

595
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,252
That thing. Where's the case file?

596
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,922
-What file?
-For that guy, Joker.

597
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:36,342
What's with you? You're making me nervous.

598
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,845
KARAOKE ROOM MURDER CASE FILE
JOKER'S FIRST CASE

599
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,892
Joker started killing people
six years ago, didn't he?

600
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,228
What about him? Did you see him somewhere?

601
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,106
Why did you see Joker

602
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,858
instead of Yeong-sim's dog?

603
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,236
YOU ALSO NEED TO STOP
BEING A JOKE

604
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,197
When you got arrested at 17
after beating up a bank robber,

605
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,992
if only I hadn't found you so interesting,

606
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:04,328
I wouldn't be living my later life
with such anxiety.

607
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:09,375
I get really anxious
whenever you pant and flare your nostrils.

608
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,170
Why? What is it?

609
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,131
Well...

610
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,717
I took this picture somewhere,

611
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:22,930
and the handwriting looks so similar.

612
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,390
Of course it does.

613
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:25,600
What?

614
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,520
Back then, we got 200 reports a day
regarding Joker.

615
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,273
Joker's message was written
on walls all over the country

616
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,526
and it was even found on the stone sign
of Mount Jiri's Cheonwang Peak.

617
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:39,322
And they all seemed like
it was written by Joker.

618
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,201
The handwriting was exactly the same.

619
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,661
Right?

620
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,665
You can copy the handwriting
from the pictures you see in newspapers.

621
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,840
YOU ALSO NEED TO STOP
BEING A JOKE

622
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,592
Hey.

623
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,011
Was this at Dongbaek's place?

624
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,930
Did...

625
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,806
Did you see this there?

626
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,728
Why? Why did you stop
mixing your instant noodles?

627
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,648
Is it that strange for it to be there?

628
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,196
Why? What is it?

629
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,657
Why are you running away,
leaving your noodles behind?

630
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,451
I'm not running away.
I have to go home to watch a drama.

631
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,535
Wait.

632
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,081
Is there a connection
between Dongbaek and Joker?

633
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,707
No. Never.

634
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,544
Exactly, so why? What? What about Joker?

635
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,631
I can dig up this case if I want...

636
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,007
You idiot.

637
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:41,717
Just sit still.

638
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,512
You'll be more help to her that way.

639
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,222
Yes, so why?

640
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,392
No idea. I don't know anything.

641
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,894
Goodness.

642
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,606
You... Damn it.

643
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,820
Why? Did someone comment that
Kang Jong-ryeol is done and over with?

644
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:07,326
ONGSAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

645
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,209
Man, why is he the only one without a dad?

646
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,420
This is driving me insane.

647
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,882
What am I supposed to do?

648
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,056
Hey, man. Well...

649
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,852
This isn't my story.
It's about a friend of mine.

650
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,397
If your first love suddenly appeared...

651
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,899
Why? Did you meet Dongbaek?

652
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,610
-Gosh.
-Goodness, that darned Dongbaek.

653
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,529
"Dongbaek!"

654
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,490
-"Dongbaek!"
-"Dongbaek!"

655
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,535
I don't know his wife's name,
but I know Dongbaek.

656
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,788
Wait, how do you all know her?

657
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,373
You need to quit drinking.

658
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,585
You might end up screaming out for her
in front of your wife.

659
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,170
You idiot.

660
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,548
So who is this Dongbaek?

661
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,967
Is she awfully pretty?

662
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,303
No...

663
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,806
She is the worst

664
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,101
among all the women I have dated.

665
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,188
The worst.

666
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,904
Hey, they're all prettier, smarter,

667
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,531
and richer than Dongbaek.

668
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:31,494
And at times, some were even nice.

669
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,289
Is this about Dongbaek again?
Put him to sleep.

670
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,417
But do you know what the problem is?

671
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,127
-What is it?
-What?

672
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,296
Yes, you're right. Over there.

673
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:47,593
Yes. Sir, if you take a left
at the intersection, we're right there.

674
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,554
-I'm telling you. This is the problem.
-Okay.

675
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,891
The girl who's prettier than Dongbaek

676
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,894
isn't Dongbaek.

677
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:58,729
What I mean is...

678
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:06,028
It's just that none of them are

679
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,239
Dongbaek.

680
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:16,122
Darn it. I have no idea
what kind of a damned situation this is.

681
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:30,136
Hey, if you suddenly meet her again,

682
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,513
what are you going to do?

683
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,140
Crazy idiot.

684
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,393
He loves his kid.
He wouldn't break his family.

685
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:41,230
Forget about his wife. Doing that
to his kid would be a huge sin. Okay?

00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,408
Mom, about Joker.

688
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,912
You should cut your hair right here.

689
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,498
And try using some cologne, too.

690
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,669
Do you scrub your body from time to time?

691
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,881
How many people died back in 2013?

692
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,843
Yong-sik. You aren't so bad.

693
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:14,305
-What's with you?
-You may be a bit out of style

694
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:17,892
and you aren't exactly
the gentle and pretty type that women like

695
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,936
since you look like
a big toe, but still...

696
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,607
Are you trying to pick a fight?
How can you say I look like a big toe?

697
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,026
But you're likable. A likable guy.

698
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,111
So keep up your spirits.

699
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,197
-What are you saying?
-Baekdu.

700
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,200
You have to come.
The rice cooker is about to blow up again.

701
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,953
That little... Do you honestly have
no idea how to speak politely?

702
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,081
-Do you want to order?
-Sure.

703
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,042
NOW SERVING LUNCH

704
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,586
Well, what should we order?

705
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,297
We have killer stir-fried pork.

706
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,257
Oh, stir-fried pork.

707
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,801
But

708
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:56,388
it is a bit discourteous for a woman
to come to such a bar, isn't it?

709
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,851
What? What do you mean, "such a bar"?

710
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:07,024
I plucked up some courage
knowing that it's not great manners.

711
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,946
You're the witness, aren't you?

712
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,120
I know that
you didn't want to be made known.

713
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,331
-But for a bigger cause...
-Please leave.

714
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,502
-Pardon?
-I'm sorry, but please leave.

715
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,093
Go home right away after the academy.

716
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,844
I'll be home early too, okay?

717
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,014
Should I stay with you?

718
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,768
No, I can beat them on my own.

719
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,229
Go.

720
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,106
I told you, right?

721
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,359
If they try to do something,
punch their nose. It's the nose.

722
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,737
-Okay.
-He looks like a smart boy.

723
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:59,618
I'll hit their nose.
You just stay away from the arcade.

724
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:00,911
Go.

725
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,414
Make sure you get off work early.

726
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:04,915
Okay.

727
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,051
My goodness. You surprised me.

728
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,096
Hey, Pil-gu.

729
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:23,225
What? What is it?
Do you want some marinated crabs?

730
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,519
Or do you want
to play a game at the arcade?

731
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:29,064
Hey, you're looking great today.

732
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,692
You're on our side, right?

733
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:33,819
What?

734
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:37,072
You're one of the two people
who are on our side in this town.

735
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,659
And you're a policeman,
so you need to take the outcast's side.

736
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:42,453
Right?

737
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:43,787
The outcast?

738
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:47,166
My mom is the nicest person in this town,
but she's an outcast.

739
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:52,463
Something just happened
which made me really concerned,

740
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,465
but I have to go to the academy.

741
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,636
So I want to ask you for a favor.

742
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,056
I am making an official move right now

743
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:06,644
since her immediate family officially
asked this guy, Hwang Yong-sik.

744
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:10,189
I'm not sure who told you what,

745
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:14,401
but I have no idea. That's not me.

746
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:19,615
I understand that it can be uncomfortable
to bring it up again after five years.

747
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,575
Hey!

748
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,203
I need to talk to you, okay?

749
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,414
Goodness. It's you.

750
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,541
What brings you here?

751
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,379
Did Chief Byeon send you here
in case we found out about her?

752
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,882
-What?
-Excuse me, please just leave.

753
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,967
I understand that you're worried,

754
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,595
but we'll make sure we provide protection.

755
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,473
-No, I...
-What? Protection from what?

756
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,642
Please don't say another word and go.

757
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:50,020
We're definitely thinking about
giving you compensation, so...

758
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,480
Please just leave, will you?

759
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,652
It's so tough to get an interview
from a witness.

760
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:03,075
We wouldn't come asking you
if we had another witness.

761
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,119
You're the only witness.

762
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,663
Shouldn't you do something
for the greater cause?

763
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,207
We'll take responsibility and protect you.

764
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,875
How?

765
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,336
How are you going to protect me?

766
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,882
Did you get my permission
to visit me here today?

767
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,510
Did you at least give me a call?

768
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:28,434
You already came without notice

769
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,978
to ask questions without manners.

770
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,814
How can you protect me?

771
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,365
Excuse me.

772
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,455
Hey, man.

773
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,874
There's a kid inside. Put that away.

774
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,753
Why did you call the forensics?

775
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:59,423
To check if there's the same fingerprint
as the one found at the crime scene.

776
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,717
The culprit may have
visited the place before.

777
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,760
My goodness.

778
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,137
She's already deemed as a victim.

779
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:09,308
Did Joker make an announcement
that Dongbaek is next? Did he?

780
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,560
According to a police source,

781
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,605
the culprit's target may be
female prostitutes.

782
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,357
July 9th, on the day of his first crime,

783
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,777
he used a fire extinguisher at the scene,

784
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:23,697
but during this crime,
he activated the sprinkler.

785
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,532
Investigators suppose

786
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,452
that he did this to destroy the evidence,

787
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,121
but the real reason is yet to be revealed.

788
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,874
Next up is local news.

789
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:37,795
Around four o'clock today,
a man fell down a building

790
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:41,590
trying to install the outdoor AC unit
for a shopping mall near the terminal.

791
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:49,348
Excuse me,
I have to start running my business.

792
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,475
What?

793
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,353
Okay. Sure.

794
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,855
Go ahead.

795
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:01,235
Darn it. Do you think
you rented out the whole place?

796
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,697
Come on, don't sit around everywhere.
At least sit together.

797
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,325
I can't believe this.

798
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,536
What's important isn't
running your business.

799
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:14,289
It's not like we're here
because we have time to kill.

800
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,168
Then can you return tomorrow?

801
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,753
I do need to run my business.

802
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:25,092
My gosh, you must have no idea
what's going on.

803
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:29,096
Hey, you aren't just a witness.

804
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,682
You could have been his target.

805
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,393
You do know that his first victim
was a prostitute

806
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,395
who worked at a karaoke room, don't you?

807
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,564
The skin therapist who died this time

808
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,191
was a bar girl
before she opened her clinic.

809
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:46,029
So if we don't protect you
as a witness, a survivor, or whatever,

810
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,490
we don't know what will happen.

811
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,117
Hey, man.

812
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,744
If another murder breaks out,
it'll make our lives harder.

813
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,205
But...

814
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,834
No, it's not that
you're his target right now.

815
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,963
I'm just a mom who has a child.

816
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,551
I'm not a prostitute...

817
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,346
or a bar girl or anything like that.

818
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,183
I'm just trying to put food on the table
for my child.

819
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,478
I feel bad for her,

820
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:22,024
but some girls
are just destined to have rough lives.

821
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,650
Luck shapes our lives.

822
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,069
Look at how Joker surfaced
right after she moved here.

823
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:29,072
If shit happens,
the entire neighborhood will suffer.

824
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,325
-Hi.
-Hi, there.

825
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,330
ONGSAN MARINATED CRAB STREET

826
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:38,790
Sir.

827
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,794
Why haven't you been around
for meals lately?

828
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,755
Oh, well...

829
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,673
Say hello.

830
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,051
You even canceled dinner
for your foot volleyball club.

831
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:53,305
Are you still in business?

832
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,600
Yes.

833
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,222
Pil-gu, where did one of the wheels go?

834
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,435
Where is it?

835
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,149
Where is it?

836
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,032
Where's the wheel, Pil-gu?

837
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:21,518
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

838
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,730
I'm sorry.

839
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,699
Pil-gu...

840
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:38,869
I'm sorry.

841
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,497
Leave

842
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:43,999
and never come back!

843
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,418
SERIAL MURDER, SOLE WITNESS

844
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,961
Look here, miss.

845
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,590
We're not protecting you
because we have nothing better to do.

846
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:55,135
Then don't bother.
Joker can just take me for all I care.

847
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,888
-What?
-I'm more scared

848
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,474
of the police and reporters
than I am of Joker.

849
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,560
How is this police protection?

850
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,146
You're invading my place of work.

851
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,524
-What?
-This is my space.

852
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:13,487
You don't care at all about my livelihood.

853
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,868
I'm not a prostitute.

854
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:22,829
Also, I'm not unlucky, ominous,

855
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,207
or the kind of woman
who is destined for tragedies.

856
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,168
Dongbaek...

857
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,421
Why...

858
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:35,342
Why are you making me out to be one?

859
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,095
Just

860
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:42,140
let me live peacefully with my boy.

861
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,991
How is this protection?
You're basically branding me.

862
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:04,871
You're just acting as you please.
This is wrong.

863
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:06,915
You shouldn't act like this.

864
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,919
I understand how you feel,
but the situation has changed.

865
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,506
We're not like the reporters
you came across in the past.

866
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:18,760
She already declined.

867
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,346
She said no and that's it.

868
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:24,266
Look here, officer.
This is an abuse of authority.

869
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,809
Stop fidgeting with that camera.

870
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,019
Or I'll smash it to bits.

871
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,485
Have some respect, will you?

872
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,029
Camellia and Dongbaek...

873
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,242
aren't objects you can poke around at.

874
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,203
She's not alone anymore

875
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,331
and I'll be by her side 24-7, so--

876
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,668
Who are you
to interfere with our business?

877
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,211
This is oppression of media--

878
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,547
I told you not to mess with Dongbaek.

879
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,885
I'll kill whoever messes with her.

880
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,138
Got it?

881
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,732
I'll pay for the udon.

882
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,984
It's the least I can do for what you did.

883
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,360
Right.

884
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,158
So...

885
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,912
did you actually see anything?

886
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,665
I got a glimpse from behind.

887
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,334
My gosh.

888
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,960
It must've been so scary.

889
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,339
If only I could whack the bastard myself.

890
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,385
I begged the Chief
when I became a witness.

891
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:47,641
I asked if he could
keep my identity a secret

892
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,644
and not tell others
that I witnessed anything.

893
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,687
I wanted to stay hidden forever...

894
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:57,651
so people wouldn't say Pil-gu's
the son of a woman who brings disaster.

895
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,403
That's not true at all.

896
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:07,452
Even from a young age,
people were never fond of me.

897
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,455
They say I cast shadows around me

898
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,749
and that I'm unlucky.

899
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:18,672
It's not like I wanted
to be an orphan, though, right?

900
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,509
It wasn't my plan
to become a single mother, either.

901
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,553
But people keep saying I bring bad luck.

902
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,223
Damn morons.

903
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,559
Who'd say that about you?

904
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,896
They even say that I look unlucky, too.

905
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,692
That I look like I'll have a sorry life.

906
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,865
The thing is, though,

907
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,952
sometimes I feel that way too
because it's what I hear.

908
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,955
Why pay attention to such nonsense?

909
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,543
You're right. It's absolute nonsense.

910
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,045
What?

911
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:02,882
I'm quite lucky, you know.
I have a good life.

912
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,010
I'm the only one with Pil-gu, aren't I?

913
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,262
He only belongs to me.

914
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:11,933
Even if the goddess of birth
offered me Kim Yuna

915
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,103
or the wealthy G-Dragon,

916
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,813
I'd always choose Pil-gu.

917
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:23,236
Do people not see how lucky I am?

918
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,489
Unlucky and sorry? Unbelievable.

919
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,660
Why would they say that?

920
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:39,461
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

921
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:49,846
It's the same for me.

922
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,016
Even if Princess Diana is reincarnated,

923
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,436
-or if Lim Soo-jung claims to like me--
-Who?

924
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,189
Lim Soo-jung.

925
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,193
Why would she ever do that?

926
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,072
Anyway, I wouldn't trade them for you.

927
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:11,284
You say that as if I'm yours.

928
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,205
You never know what'll happen in life.

929
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,257
CAMELLIA

930
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,603
What's the point of this? Let's just go.

931
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:47,695
See? I'm already sick and tired
of the rumors around here.

932
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,364
Can you please just go?

933
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:53,493
Don't be absurd.
How can I let you be all by yourself?

934
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:57,122
I get upset just thinking of you crawling
into a corner at the train station

935
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:59,749
after getting slapped by someone again.

936
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,336
It's driving me crazy, too.

937
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:07,090
Who are you to get upset over it?

938
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,718
You're acting like we're something more
than we really are.

939
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:16,516
Dongbaek, you need someone
to vent your frustration on, right?

940
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,769
If anyone annoys you in any way,

941
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:24,232
poop it all out on me, all right?

942
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,904
Did you have to call it pooping?

943
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,241
The more you do this,

944
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,035
the more my neighbors will talk.

945
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,912
Anyone can see that it's strange.

946
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,665
Why are you coming to my aid like this?

947
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,878
I've already rejected you in advance

948
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,672
and it's not like we're friends, family,

949
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,843
or even a landlord and tenant
for that matter.

950
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:55,305
We have no business whatsoever between us,
so why are you doing this?

951
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,934
Dongbaek, you like good reasons, right?

952
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:02,437
What?

953
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,481
Follow me.

954
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,578
I see she's having a fun life...

955
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,581
That kind of makes me...

956
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,459
quite annoyed.

957
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:28,546
Why are you dragging me into my own diner?

958
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,590
-Just follow me.
-What are you doing?

959
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,634
My gosh. What is it?

960
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,387
Dongbaek, don't be alarmed.

961
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,313
Look.

962
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,689
YOU ALSO NEED TO STOP
BEING A JOKE

963
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,566
You should know to take this seriously.

964
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,195
What's this?

965
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,489
I'm a patrol officer of this town

966
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,574
and this is written in your diner.

967
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,452
The year 2013?

968
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:05,208
I don't know if this was written
by the actual culprit or not,

969
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,627
and I don't care if you rejected me.

970
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:10,129
I'm a police officer

971
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,883
and I will protect you no matter what.

972
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,221
When bad guys surface,
the good guys come together.

973
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:22,267
From the Five Eagle Brothers
to the Avengers,

974
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,893
that has been a cardinal rule.

975
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,938
Also, you...

976
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:29,941
You know...

977
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,822
Anyway, it's how I plan to win you over.

978
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:38,616
How's that...

979
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,202
for a reason?

980
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,497
What on earth are you talking about?

981
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,126
Could he be any weirder?

982
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:51,087
Never mind Joker. I don't care...

983
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:55,925
if North Korea decides
to bulldoze us with tanks.

984
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,303
I will protect you.

985
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:02,348
No matter what, I will keep you safe.

986
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:04,976
That I'll do.

987
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:15,320
Yong-sik, do you have any idea

988
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:19,157
how much you're flustering me?

989
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:37,884
THAT DAY ON JULY 9, 2013

990
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,762
The peanuts are on the house
for my regulars.

991
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,017
Here.

992
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:49,979
Gosh, your shoes...

993
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,655
It's like you got flour all over them.

994
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,406
Enjoy.

995
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:22,845
DONGBAEK

996
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:30,937
YOU ALSO NEED TO STOP BEING A JOKE

997
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,620
DONGBAEK, YOU ALSO NEED TO STOP
BEING A JOKE

998
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,665
DONGBAEK, THANKS FOR THE PEANUTS
P.S. I'LL THANK YOU EVERY DAY, YONG-SIK

999
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:15,481
-Jong-ryeol!
-You seem down-to-earth.

1000
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:18,609
I think a lot of ladies will find
that quality very charming.

1001
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,571
The men of Ongsan
must tend to be that way.

1002
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:23,948
Don't get mixed up with men
who are like bears.

1003
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:27,034
But Winnie the Pooh is sort of cute,
right?

1004
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:29,996
My own house is a prison for me
mentally and physically.

1005
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:31,998
You don't even respect me, do you?

1006
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,250
Who else in Ongsan do you respect?

1007
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,961
You acting like this
will only humiliate me.

1008
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:39,005
I'll make sure that

1009
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:42,425
no one in Ongsan says
you're the one hitting on me.
