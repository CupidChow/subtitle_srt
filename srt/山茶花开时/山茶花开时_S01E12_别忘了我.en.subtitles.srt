1
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,728
You must've forgotten already.

2
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,230
-Let me remind you.
-Let me go!

3
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,902
I told you to get lost!

4
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,362
I have a bad temper!

5
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,074
She also has a temper! Everyone does!

6
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,170
CAMELLIA

7
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,642
You're driving me nuts.

8
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,645
Hey.

9
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,065
Didn't I tell you to get lost
while I'm being nice?

10
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,484
Well, consider this your last day.

11
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,661
You.

12
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,289
Did you just grab
my Dongbaek by the collar?

13
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,209
You choked her first.

14
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,837
What do you mean, I choked her?

15
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,381
You did choke me!

16
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,723
Then what happens after
is considered as self-defense. Got it?

17
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,894
What's with all these people
in the neighborhood?

18
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,356
There won't be any witnesses.

19
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,827
I was smacked in the head
with a blunt weapon.

20
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,454
Sir, please calm down.

21
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,292
Your injuries and
the fact that you were outnumbered

22
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,004
do make it look like
a one-sided attack, but--

23
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,506
Officer, see for yourself.

24
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,592
-Shit.
-Okay, okay.

25
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:59,679
That bitch hit me with a blunt weapon.

26
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,306
And you choked her!

27
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,433
You strangled her.
That's attempted murder!

28
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,603
Sit. Please stay seated.

29
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,522
-Sir.
-What now?

30
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,652
Damn it.

31
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,364
I know quite a lot about the law.

32
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,409
I've run into it quite a bit.

33
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,661
Chief.

34
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,748
Let's just settle. I wouldn't mind that.

35
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,750
I'll let her off the hook this once.

36
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:30,877
You.

37
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,963
Get out. Come on.

38
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,090
-What?
-Get lost.

39
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,009
Take this somewhere else. Go on.

40
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:44,057
Even the police officers
in this neighborhood have lost it.

41
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,102
I believe that everyone
has a shot at redemption.

42
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,313
But whether it happened or not,

43
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,191
those who were charged with
attempted rape or murder

44
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,525
aren't humans to me.

45
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,903
-So get lost.
-Damn it!

46
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,449
I'm not a human to you?

47
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,327
Good.

48
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,579
Now I can be the animal that I am.

49
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,791
You.

50
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,628
You heard him, right?

51
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,881
-Consider yourself on my radar.
-Hey!

52
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,259
Are you threatening Dongbaek right now?

53
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,011
That's right, I am. So guard her safely.

54
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,265
Maybe one day,
it won't end at just an attempt.

55
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,474
Right?

56
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,685
That little...

57
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,603
Hey, take it up with me.

58
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,403
Don't mess with them.

59
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,285
What's that expression?

60
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,371
I've never seen you like that.

61
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,249
I'll return by the end of the month,

62
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,043
which means you have
no business coming back here, right?

63
00:04:56,004 --> 00:05:00,258
You used to live like there's no tomorrow,
but you have a weakness now.

64
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,970
It's nice to see you
finally putting down roots.

65
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,348
Is this your home now?

66
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,351
As if. She and I aren't even friends.

67
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,062
A home isn't anything special.

68
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,648
It's just a place you feel comfortable in.

69
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,066
We're strangers,

70
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:18,776
so just let them be.

71
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,072
Now I don't have to go around
to search for you.

72
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,414
Hyang-mi, let's go eat some meat.

73
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,296
Dongbaek, make sure
to always stay by my side.

74
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,966
That weasel just now
and the guy who feeds the cats...

75
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,719
There are a few I'm worried about.

76
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,305
It's like you're arresting me, though.

77
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,099
Hurry up already!
They're going to close soon.

78
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,392
Sure thing.

79
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,147
Good job, everyone.

80
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,276
Are you some kind of thug?
Why did you bring the roller?

81
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,862
-You must be crazy.
-Dongbaek, come on.

82
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,449
Right, I'm sorry.

83
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,995
Dongbaek! Over here.

84
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,956
-Pil-gu, you're here.
-Pil-gu!

85
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,458
-Come here.
-Have a seat.

86
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,212
How was the academy?

87
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,631
What's this?
Why are we suddenly having meat?

88
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,299
Zip it and eat up.

89
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,884
You know how greedy she is.

90
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,722
Hyang-mi.

91
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,600
Eat up.

92
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,519
A home isn't anything special.

93
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,063
It's just a place you feel comfortable in.

94
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,482
What a weird place to call home.

95
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,817
All right.

96
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,069
Ma'am, aren't you drinking tonight?

97
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,196
Why do you want me drunk?

98
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,240
A mom who abandoned her daughter.

99
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,827
A bumpkin who even adores
someone else's child.

100
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,497
Excuse me. Can we get a soda for the kid?

101
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,417
Are you trying to lose weight again?
Why aren't you eating?

102
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,461
The kid who's the oasis of this family.

103
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,965
Hyang-mi, snap out of it and eat up.

104
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,801
And the woman all these people love.

105
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,970
Dongbaek.

106
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,847
Dongbaek.

107
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,640
Dongbaek.

108
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,976
-Dongbaek.
-Yes?

109
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,686
-Here, have a wrap.
-Me?

110
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,652
-Thank you.
-It's nothing.

111
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,988
It was wrapped with love.

112
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,656
DON'T FORGET ME

113
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,074
Gosh, thank you.

114
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,000
Your hair has gotten really long.

115
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:39,959
Right.

116
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,089
Why aren't you asking me?

117
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,550
"Who's the thug?"

118
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,887
"What in the world have you been up to?"

119
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,513
It's normal to ask.

120
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,599
There's no need.

121
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,813
I've always been curious.
Why did you take me in?

122
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,901
You know I lied about
my age, name, and experience.

123
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,238
You have nowhere to go.

124
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:16,496
Excuse me. I saw a sign saying
you're hiring a part-timer.

125
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,583
You're the first person in my life

126
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,336
who noticed that I have nowhere to go.

127
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,589
Is the world bright in your eyes?

128
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,716
Is it nice and soft?

129
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:34,388
Our lives are both shitty, but why are you
the only one who's so good-natured?

130
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,685
Enough with the nonsense.
I'll give you a raise,

131
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,854
so save up the extra when you can.

132
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,776
Will the raise help me buy
a house and then a family?

133
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,953
We're abandoned, under-educated,
poor, and have no connections.

134
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,830
Our lives are already screwed, right?

135
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,043
We were given the worst hand possible,
so why try hard to live?

136
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,545
It's just pathetic.

137
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,213
You talk as if it's over.

138
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,091
You have to live it to see the outcome.

139
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,176
We were screwed
from the beginning.

140
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,888
I bet you think about helping the poor

141
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,473
when you hear about them on TV.

142
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,935
But truth be told,
when wallets go missing in schools,

143
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,604
kids from broken families
are doubted first.

144
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,648
You know it all too well.

145
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,320
Don't go anywhere and stay with me.

146
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,198
Here, have a bite.

147
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,375
This is why I hate you.
Why do you always peel this for me?

148
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,210
Don't leave.

149
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,379
Just don't, all right?

150
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,048
I never really felt embarrassed
about anything.

151
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,509
But you're starting
to make me feel that way.

152
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,016
We both had shitty lives,
but I'm the only one who messed up.

153
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,434
It makes me feel worse.

154
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,645
We all hide our weakest spots.

155
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,981
That's why I'm going to leave.

156
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,442
I should.

157
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,485
I must.

158
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,656
However, some people
are just too transparent.

159
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,996
Meanwhile, there are some people
that are impossible to read.

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,004
Hey, Heung-sik. Do you still adore cats?

161
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:34,300
Didn't you raise one as a boy?

162
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,760
I've known him for 30 years.

163
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,597
I don't know why, but I just love cats.

164
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,894
Gosh. Your hands must feel stuffy.

165
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,606
It isn't easy to keep
wearing those gloves.

166
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,112
I've made my peace with it,
but people find it uncomfortable.

167
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,740
What? Oh, I see.

168
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,825
That was a mistake.

169
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,870
Dad, I'm heading out.

170
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,638
ONGSAN HARDWARE

171
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,730
Should you lock that when he's inside?

172
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,234
I'd feel anxious if I don't.

173
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,236
The world is a scary place.

174
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,154
Another mistake.

175
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,531
Right, of course.

176
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,327
So what's with that thug from last night?

177
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,247
He had a weird gaze.

178
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,542
What? His gaze?

179
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,840
You pay attention to people's gazes?

180
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,969
People give off specific vibes, right?

181
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,139
Meanwhile, this guy's eyes...

182
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,434
I just can't read them.

183
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,230
So,

184
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,316
is Hyang-mi okay?

185
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,277
Right, of course.

186
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,197
She eats, drinks, and passes out drunk.

187
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,243
You know how mentally strong she is.

188
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,456
That's not true at all.

189
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,917
She only pretends
to be fine with everything.

190
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,670
Hold on.

191
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,589
Do you...

192
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,966
have feelings for Hyang-mi?

193
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,927
That's absurd.

194
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:47,433
Gosh. You talk as if
it's so easy to like someone.

195
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,560
Who knows, right?

196
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,729
Unbelievable.

197
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,985
Are people really that hard to read?

198
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,579
"The police sent a sample of the fish
that the street cat ate

199
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,749
to the National Forensic Service."

200
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,127
Are you telling me to send this
to the NFS?

201
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:20,090
"The NFS was asked to see if there were
traces of agricultural pesticides."

202
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,052
-The police did a fine job.
-You!

203
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,722
Is that so?

204
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,685
Let's say that traces of
pesticides are found.

205
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,731
How are we supposed to know
who put it there, though?

206
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,443
It could've been the guy
who put out the food or someone else.

207
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:45,032
This is from the guy that feeds the cats,
so send in a separate sample.

208
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,992
What a load of nonsense.

209
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:51,163
By the way, I hope you're still searching
for a Jeong-suk born in the 1960s.

210
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,959
You punk. How can I find someone
when we don't know her exact age?

211
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,962
There are 6,000 Jeong-suks in Korea.

212
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,381
Unbelievable.

213
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:05,261
I guess it's up to the future son-in-law
to find out then.

214
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,267
I need to ask her date of birth.

215
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,853
But what's with that sour expression?

216
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,230
-How much was that this time?
-Sorry?

217
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,400
-Do you have lots of money?
-Mom. Seriously.

218
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,363
Hold on. Dumplings shouldn't be this big.

219
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,782
You'll never make money with this.

220
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,203
Gosh. If one is ditsy,
the other should at least be clever.

221
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,205
This is just worse.

222
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,083
Are you sure it has to be him?

223
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,005
This came for Pil-gu.

224
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,467
No way. What's this?

225
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,262
When is he supposed to study
if he has all these toys?

226
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,185
My gosh. He even sent him his credit card.

227
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,687
Annoying jerk.

228
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,273
He is ridiculous.

229
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,526
He earns 1.2 billion won,
so what'll be the max on this?

230
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,195
Pil-gu has a rich parent now.

231
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,323
Want a glass of beer?

232
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,082
It serves you right
for stuffing the dumplings in.

233
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,460
They were delicious.

234
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,339
So Dongbaek...

235
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,968
You know, I have money, too.

236
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,678
Sorry?

237
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,390
I can buy Pil-gu a new bag
if he needs one.

238
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,686
I work in the public sector, remember?

239
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,564
And even though I have to share,

240
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,817
I'll inherit Baekdu Marinated Crab later.

241
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:49,907
I do quite well for myself
compared to the people of Ongsan.

242
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,253
To be honest...

243
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,633
If I may say so, I'm a little annoyed.

244
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,469
Why did I have to compete

245
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,973
with someone who's worth
1.2 billion won a year?

246
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,102
It's not like many
earn that much in Korea.

247
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,814
All that money
just because he plays baseball?

248
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,525
I don't even have a tenth of that.

249
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,739
Why are you kissing my hand
when I'm annoyed?

250
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,742
-Kiss me on the lips instead.
-Yong-sik.

251
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,997
I don't even have
1 percent of 1.2 billion won.

252
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,375
I have no money saved up,
and I have to move out.

253
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,669
Even though I need money,

254
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,588
the gold card only
made me think of one thing.

255
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,968
"Why is Yong-sik gobbling down his soup?
Is he upset?"

256
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,975
I'm not one to get upset
over these things.

257
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,396
I bet I'm the only woman
who receives flowers every day.

258
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,482
You bring me flowers every day,

259
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:10,863
and I let you eat dumpling soup for free.

260
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,448
How's that not luxurious?

261
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,699
Right?

262
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,830
You're so annoying.

263
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,125
You just know how pretty you are.

264
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,170
You, with that face like a round bun.

265
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,963
A round bun?

266
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,384
I can't believe these flowers
cost 20,000 won.

267
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:37,181
I'm a man who buys flowers
with money enough for 1.2kg of pork.

268
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,767
You don't have to keep saying that.

269
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,310
Then how would you know?

270
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,187
Just give her money instead.

271
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,606
We've already run out of vases.
Stop buying flowers.

272
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,608
What are you talking about?

273
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,611
Here... There...

274
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,655
Look. Check this out.

275
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,325
Any container can be a vase.

276
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,079
It's the same as how Dongbaek looks sexy
even in plain rubber boots.

277
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,122
You and your words.

278
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,124
Sorry?

279
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,835
Take it outside, will you?

280
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,922
What's this?

281
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,757
My goodness.

282
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,177
Hyang-mi.

283
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,889
Are you a squirrel or something?
It's like you're hoarding acorns.

284
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,187
Why do you always steal lighters?

285
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,773
I don't know.
Maybe it's because I'm lonely.

286
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,192
Stealing things
fills the void in my heart.

287
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,698
Does...

288
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,661
Heung-sik come by here often?

289
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,330
He's here almost every day.

290
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,082
I TOLD YOU NOT TO BE A JOKE

291
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,210
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU EVERY DAY
EVER SINCE THAT DAY

292
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,216
I guess I'll use a soju bottle as a vase.

293
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,425
Right.

294
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,928
Wasn't there...

295
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,808
a lighter burn here?

296
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,479
Hyang-mi!

297
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,357
Did you burn this off with a lighter?

298
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,693
This is a non-smoking zone.

299
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,737
I think I saw something similar.

300
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,658
What's with these marks?

301
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,581
From where?

302
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:30,210
Do people burn parts
of their own dining table?

303
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,881
Whose dining table?

304
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,633
Did you actually see it?

305
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,346
Why are you so curious?
I just saw it at a friend's.

306
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,682
Which friend was that?

307
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,269
So you definitely saw something?

308
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,855
I'd rather you respect my privacy.

309
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,690
Hyang-mi.

310
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,942
A letter came for you.

311
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,821
CAMELLIA

312
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,619
This is what you get
for crossing the line.

313
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,079
CLAIM FOR DAMAGES
CERTIFICATION OF CONTENTS

314
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:11,001
These kinds of people
make me stay the person I am.

315
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,381
I almost matured for a second there.

316
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:23,305
AROUND 10 A.M., GOT ON BUS TO SEOUL

317
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,516
"As your children grow,

318
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,145
be the Superman
that protects their future."

319
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,856
"As your children grow...

320
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,364
-be the Superman
-Jong-ryeol.

321
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,199
that protects their future."

322
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,076
Jong-ryeol.

323
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,872
"Be the Superman
that protects their future."

324
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,249
Jong-ryeol.

325
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,752
What brought you here?

326
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,295
I came by bus.

327
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,339
This is a restricted area.

328
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,549
Well, I know someone here.

329
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,302
-Who...
-Jong-ryeol.

330
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,513
Jong-ryeol?

331
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,810
Pil-gu's dad.

332
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,942
Maybe I should just kill her.

333
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,531
You have money,
so why take the difficult route?

334
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:26,702
Do you think I've never dealt
with people like you before?

335
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,746
If I show any kind of generosity,

336
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,000
I'll become a personal ATM machine.
Why would I agree to that?

337
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,585
Did you know that I'm friends
with Jessica online?

338
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,546
Tell her to check her messages.

339
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:39,923
In your dreams.

340
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,427
Do you think I'd let someone like you
to suck money out of me?

341
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,972
That's rich for someone
who sent a certification of contents.

342
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,267
Why are you doing this?

343
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,436
I feel bad that this is your life.

344
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,938
Hey, Jong-ryeol...

345
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,440
What?

346
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,485
Since you're completely clueless,
I'll address you accordingly.

347
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:06,700
When those who have so much to lose
face those who have nothing to lose,

348
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,660
the latter most likely wins.

349
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,622
You see, the latter has nothing to lose.

350
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,708
There's no tomorrow.

351
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,752
Who do you take me for--

352
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,880
I bet you're anxious to death.

353
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,509
This is you being punished.

354
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,430
You really shouldn't have abandoned
Dongbaek.

355
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,476
Why is a dirty pig judging my life?

356
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,022
Do you have a death wish?

357
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:41,109
That's how it is for clueless morons.

358
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,830
They have to suffer things themselves
to acknowledge reality.

359
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,502
Don't admit to anything.
She's a divorce attorney, remember?

360
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,170
She'll take everything you have.

361
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,922
What do you mean?

362
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,883
Why do you keep raising me to be a coward?

363
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,386
How dare you raise your voice at me!

364
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,972
Mom. Didn't you say that
Dad's lies gave you capsulitis?

365
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,391
But now you want me to lie.

366
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,352
Would you rather have her
take everything and kick you out?

367
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,604
Even this house is in her name.

368
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,440
Just let her have it.
She can have everything.

369
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,734
She's worth...

370
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,445
all of that.

371
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,407
You imbecile.

372
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,325
Are you a romantic now?

373
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,369
Why not be one sooner?

374
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,247
Unbelievable.

375
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,834
You're just as idiotic as your dad.

376
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,964
-Why do you keep calling me?
-Must you answer Dad's calls like that?

377
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,759
Do sons always turn out like their dads?

378
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,018
Today, 3 p.m., Ongsan Lake.

379
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,688
-Why?
-I'm going to push you in.

380
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,275
Why do so many people want to kill me?

381
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,505
ONGSAN LAKE

382
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,548
Get in!

383
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,552
Get in before someone sees you.

384
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,012
But I'm cold!

385
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,272
Pedal, damn it!

386
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,150
Where are we going? I said I'm cold.

387
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:49,529
The governor's clerk's sister-in-law
saw us at the coffee shop.

388
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,451
I'm a politician of this neighborhood,
so there are eyes on me everywhere!

389
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,204
You talk as if
you'll be the president or something.

390
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,624
Whatever. The cat's out of the bag now.

391
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,501
You're not getting a single penny.

392
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,544
I'm reporting you for blackmail

393
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,379
in order to clear my name,

394
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,089
so bring it on!

395
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,551
If your conscience is that clean,
why are you pedaling that fast?

396
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,349
You've seen my wife, haven't you?

397
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,603
If you wish to live,
you have to listen up.

398
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,814
You have to bear witness.

399
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,317
Not a false one, but a real one.

400
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,153
Darn it. Did you get me
on this boat to say that?

401
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,863
Just text me, will you?

402
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,616
Tell her I paid for your room,
but I didn't go up with you.

403
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,826
Do you know how ridiculous that sounds?

404
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,829
Tell her that I didn't even know
your room number.

405
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,083
Go kneel down to my dear Ja-yeong
and bear witness!

406
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,378
You never mentioned
your wife on our way to Yangpyeong,

407
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,004
but now she's your dear Ja-yeong?

408
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,590
Do men take classes
on falling a step behind?

409
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,218
You don't want to get involved
in my life either, right?

410
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,471
Why are you making such a fuss?

411
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,730
I didn't hit on you first.

412
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,483
It was you.
Why did you give me the eye cream?

413
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,944
That wasn't for you. It was for Dongbaek.

414
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,280
What?

415
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:17,200
Darn it, I couldn't throw it out
or give it to her, so I gave it to you.

416
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,828
Fine, whatever.

417
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,205
I already knew that was the case.

418
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,541
But you went waterskiing with me.

419
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,544
You're the one who suggested
that we become friends or something.

420
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,838
To be frank,

421
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,800
I didn't want to have an affair with you.

422
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,260
I just...

423
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,178
You just what?

424
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,931
I just wanted to show off.

425
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:41,808
What?

426
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:45,020
All these people who are well-off
think I'm a joke,

427
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:50,150
but you seemed just like me,
so I could show off to you.

428
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,404
How dare you compare me to you?
Do you think I'm as stupid as you?

429
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,407
You think you're cool and in the know,
don't you? But you aren't.

430
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,201
You don't know a thing about me.

431
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,828
After seeing you for a while,

432
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:05,290
I realized you're just like
a stray dog that was never loved.

433
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,295
A dog that shows their stomach
when I simply reach out to them,

434
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,672
and they go, "Look at me, look at me!"

435
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,716
And when I tell them to stop,

436
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,178
they turn the entire house into a mess
to get more attention from me.

437
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,929
You're just as sad as them.

438
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,768
My life turned into a mess
after I got involved with you.

439
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:29,814
If you

440
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:34,319
really want to get eye cream
from someone, don't be like that.

441
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,196
You'll just embarrass yourself.

442
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,616
Let us please stop
getting humiliated, all right?

443
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,162
Then why were you going to give
that eye cream to Dongbaek?

444
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,459
Let me ask you for once.

445
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,920
Why do you all love her?

446
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,132
How is she different from me?
We're almost the same.

447
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,176
You aren't.

448
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,221
I told her that she could stay

449
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,847
in return for firing you.

450
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,557
But she rejected my offer.

451
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,145
-What?
-Being loyal won't pay her bills,

452
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,980
but that girl was very firm on that.

453
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:16,736
You should try to live more like a human.

454
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,240
But I'm not the one to talk.

455
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,542
If I live like a human,

456
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,420
who'll live like a beast?

457
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,132
INTERNATIONAL CALL

458
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,676
Just tell me the amount.

459
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:45,348
What? I don't have 30 million won.

460
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,767
I gave you all the money that I earned!

461
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,897
So who do you like more?

462
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,943
You don't hate your dad
who bought you a backpack, do you?

463
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,489
Should I stop asking
difficult questions?

464
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:07,078
Instead of telling you who I like more,
I can tell you who I hate more.

465
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,873
Who do you hate more?

466
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,543
They're almost on the same level,

467
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,423
but I hate the Superman guy more.

468
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,341
Why?

469
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,846
That show, The Return of Superman.
I watched the whole thing.

470
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,558
He's apparently

471
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,603
the biggest fool for his daughter.

472
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:36,149
Then is that girl
supposed to be my sister?

473
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,401
What should I say?

474
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,073
More sundae, please.

475
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,786
That girl. The girl who poops on her back.

476
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,871
Babies are all like that.

477
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,123
He really adores her.

478
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,168
He keeps calling her his princess.

479
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,754
She's just a bald girl who poops.

480
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,592
Is that why you're jealous?

481
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,803
I mean, it's just unfair.

482
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,848
He can just adore her, then.
Why does he come after me?

483
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,225
That cheap jerk.

484
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,144
Why did he break the kid's heart
by going on that show?

485
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,523
So I absolutely hate the Superman guy,

486
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,275
and I kind of hate Mr. Hwang.

487
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:25,406
Goodness, Pil-gu. You chose the best side.

488
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,533
You're so smart.

489
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,828
-Grandma.
-Yes?

490
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,205
Should we go to the arcade?

491
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,082
You know my name.

492
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:39,379
Why do you keep calling me Dongbaek
when Mom is around?

493
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,215
Goodness.

494
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,970
You couldn't have taken after anyone
to be this smart.

495
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,348
You have reached your destination.

496
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,142
That dirty jerk. He came here so often.

497
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,939
Why do you want to see him?

498
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,316
He doesn't look that much like him anyway.

499
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,069
Once we get some of his hair,
run a DNA test, and sue him,

500
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,654
we'll definitely win.

501
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,949
We'll definitely win what?
He doesn't even look much like him.

502
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,578
Of course, he does.
He looks exactly the same.

503
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,838
One stir-fried pork, please.

504
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:25,675
Just one?
There are two of you here.

505
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,177
You're crazy to think
about your diet right now.

506
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,179
I can't eat pork.

507
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,849
Just give us two servings.

508
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,602
Wait, little boy.

509
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,729
How old are you?

510
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,398
Are you about eight?

511
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,233
Then when were you born?

512
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,403
My boy, you need to go to the academy.

513
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,741
Is this a bar?

514
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,076
It's a regular restaurant.

515
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:57,040
By the way,
aren't you on that Superman show?

516
00:31:59,042 --> 00:31:59,876
He knows you.

517
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,378
-You were in front of my school before.
-What?

518
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,840
If you don't eat pork,

519
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,967
why are you here?

520
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,639
Well, you know...

521
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,892
When is your mom coming?

522
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,603
-My mom is good at fighting.
-What?

523
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,273
I told her to hit people in the nose
since I was little.

524
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,233
-Gosh.
-Oh, no.

525
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,903
How dare you touch him?

526
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,740
Mom! Hey, lady! Are you insane?

527
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,326
Goodness. Are you insane?

528
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,661
Yes, I have dementia.

529
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,206
-What?
-She met him first.

530
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,083
How dare you be so arrogant?

531
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,251
How dare you talk to me like that?

532
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:46,047
She was not his legal wife, but she lived
with him longer than you did.

533
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:50,301
The law may not acknowledge that,
but the time they spent can't disappear.

534
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:54,847
Then what? Are you saying that
she's his wife or something?

535
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,516
His wife? You can be that.

536
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,394
So you're saying
you'll steal my son-in-law--

537
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,645
No, thanks!

538
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,523
Your son-in-law? Your husband?

539
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,192
We don't need him. And go tell him

540
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,944
to stop lurking around.

541
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,237
He didn't lurk around!

542
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,948
How dare hold your head high
when they had a dirty affair?

543
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,242
A dirty affair? Fine.

544
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,536
An affair can change
the presidency in this land.

545
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,747
Do you want him
to stop making money with baseball?

546
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,749
Do you want a jobless husband?

547
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,006
Hey, we don't have to talk to a woman
who apparently has dementia.

548
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,633
Forget it.
Let's talk to that woman instead.

549
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,427
Come again if you dare.

550
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:37,807
I have nothing to lose, and I'll do
at least one thing for Dongbaek.

551
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,643
CAMELLIA

552
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,438
-What's with her?
-My gosh.

553
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,108
-And at a perfect timing,
-She's insane.

554
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,902
-Jessica finally showed up.
-Goodness.

555
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,740
Are you bleeding?

556
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,497
I was the first.

557
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:05,543
I was the first to spread
Kang Jong-ryeol's rumor.

558
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,920
Hyang-mi has been busy lately.

559
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,006
You're right.

560
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,927
SOO COFFEE SHOP

561
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:22,769
I wanted to tell you something,
but you just won't read your message.

562
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,439
What is it?

563
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,232
Come to think about it,

564
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:31,152
you seem to be the most desperate one
in this situation.

565
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,696
Kang Jong-ryeol,
who makes 1.2 billion a year.

566
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,323
Kang Jong-ryeol, the best husband.

567
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,493
Kang Jong-ryeol, a fool for his daughter
and the commercial star.

568
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,747
Who's the one most desperate
to keep all those titles?

569
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,041
-Who are you?
-Are you going to divorce him?

570
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,959
Will you sign the papers?

571
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,549
Now, what's important isn't

572
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,803
whether or not Kang Jong-ryeol had
an affair with Dongbaek.

573
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,016
It's whether you can keep your title
as Mrs. Kang Jong-ryeol.

574
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,727
Hey, who are you to decide if she can--

575
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,814
Let me tell you something
that will make you scared.

576
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,776
Do you want people to keep saying,
"I'm so jealous of you,"

577
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:15,238
or do you want them to comment,
"Cheer up"?

578
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,909
To be frank, among your 80,000 followers,

579
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,829
about 50,000 probably
want to see you ruined.

580
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,083
If you want to keep living the life

581
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:30,670
as Mrs. Kang Jong-ryeol,
a social media influencer,

582
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,338
you need to pay your fees.

583
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,590
You want money for her shame?

584
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,389
Hey, why doesn't Dongbaek
associate with normal people?

585
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,182
ONGSAN BANK

586
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,730
I need 30 million won.
It's a huge discount. Just 30 million.

587
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,733
I can't believe this crazy brat.

588
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,527
This secret won't be leaked

589
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,530
if this crazy brat stays quiet.

590
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,117
It's a fee that the famous Jessica
has to pay for her fame.

591
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,412
You need to do your best
to keep my mouth shut.

592
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,338
If you can, send me the money right now.

593
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,215
It's kind of urgent for me, too.

594
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:22,805
Hey.

595
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,183
I'm Jessica.

596
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,643
Someone like you can't fool me.

597
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,814
-Someone like me?
-Yes, someone like you.

598
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,735
You lowly fakes.

599
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:40,031
You cheap girls who live recklessly
without knowing how humiliating it is.

600
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,662
Hey, do you think
you're that different from me?

601
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,082
-What?
-You and I are the same.

602
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,628
A girl who's dying for attention
and who was never loved.

603
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,927
If you're lucky, you become Jessica.

604
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,845
If you aren't, you live as Hyang-mi.

605
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,722
That's all there is to it.

606
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,019
Hey! Do you seriously have a death wish?

607
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,355
I'm never sending you that money!

608
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,191
Why? Did that bitch say something else?

609
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,445
I'm going to kill her.

610
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,573
A lowly fake?

611
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,285
How dare that young bitch
say something so true to my face?

612
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:39,966
Pil-gu.

613
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,301
Give me your hand.

614
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,220
I'm not a kid.

615
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,056
Can you just hold my hand?

616
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,183
I'm having a tough day.

617
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,686
You're the portable charger of our family.

618
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,651
Everyone in my family bothers me so much.

619
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,821
Hey, I just said

620
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,657
"our family," didn't I?

621
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,576
How ridiculous.

622
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,041
You're on your way to your math academy,
right? I'll walk you there.

623
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,584
I'm not a kid.

624
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,421
Pil-gu, play more baseball
instead of studying math.

625
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,382
Become a major leaguer
and give your mom a good life.

626
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,134
Don't betray her like the others.

627
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:33,436
HUMAN GARBAGE KIM NAK-HO

628
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,099
This is Dongbaek's fault.

629
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,436
Why did she leave the money here?

630
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,564
Why did she take in human garbage like me?

631
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,237
Doesn't Dongbaek use a curling iron?

632
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,448
I wanted to copy her hairstyle, too.

633
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,952
She must have done
something to her face lately.

634
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,831
She said, "I'll be there at the meeting."
Then she smiled cutely,

635
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,250
and the entire marketplace was
enchanted by her.

636
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,463
She has been looking great lately
after she started dating.

637
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,383
Happy?

638
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,343
Having fun?

639
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:52,014
She put on a tiny little skirt
and swayed her hips really seductively.

640
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,644
Dongbaek would never do that.

641
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,688
You need to keep
Geum-mi's hips under control.

642
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,274
Her uniform is too short,
it's like underwear.

643
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,277
She's just unique, that's all.

644
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,071
Is that why she wears a tiny skirt

645
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:10,282
and leaves cigarette butts in my restroom
when she's a high schooler?

646
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:14,286
Stop badmouthing Dongbaek.
She's Ms. Kwak's best friend.

647
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,623
Mom, I want a battling top, too.

648
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,211
I should, but I have no money.

649
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,424
Jun-gi, why have you been
going around alone nowadays?

650
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,175
Where's your friend?

651
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,635
Hello.

652
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,638
Is it all over with Pil-gu?
Did you get into a fight?

653
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,724
They aren't over. He's coming back
from the academy with him.

654
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,768
They still love each other dearly.

655
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,938
But why haven't I seen Pil-gu lately?

656
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,982
I have leftover pork cutlet at home.

657
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,317
He doesn't use this street anymore.

658
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,988
-What?
-He goes around that way.

659
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,657
So we just said goodbye.

660
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,617
Why does he take the long way?

661
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,372
Because of me?

662
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:04,587
Both the mom and the son
are trying to make me feel bad.

663
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,298
You two just said goodbye?

664
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,356
Hey, who's the boss around Ongsan?

665
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,693
Who is it?

666
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,737
You.

667
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,823
All of Ongsan is my turf.

668
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,159
Did you think you can hide from me?

669
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,620
Gosh, why is this town so tiny?

670
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,205
Will you avoid me forever?

671
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,333
You sometimes have to break through.

672
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,627
If you can't avoid me,
you need to beat me.

673
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,046
You want me to beat you?

674
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,964
No, just have some pork cutlet.

675
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:54,178
Don't think too much
and have some pork cutlet.

676
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,767
He's going left! He's on his way!

677
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,561
School bags these days
are really one of a kind.

678
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,146
It must be fun going to school.

679
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,690
No, school's never fun.

680
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,901
I heard your mom also delivers food.

681
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,195
Does she make better money now?

682
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,489
This looks quite expensive.

683
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,451
My mom didn't buy me that.
I got it from a guy.

684
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,786
My goodness.

685
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:23,040
Yong-sik didn't even seem to care
when the wheels on my cart

686
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,917
broke down.

687
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,002
He's not the one who bought it for me.

688
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,131
Then who was it? Who bought this for you?

689
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,388
Hey!

690
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,723
What is that?

691
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,059
You even deliver food now?

692
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,437
How much money do you need?
How much money will cut it?

693
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,439
Those are lines from a movie.

694
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,775
Did you get the parcel?

695
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,528
Is the psycho inside?

696
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,572
So what if she's inside?

697
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,949
Come and take your money back.

698
00:42:57,032 --> 00:43:00,619
Jessica's asking me to give her money
so she can study abroad.

699
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,871
I can give you 30 million won for my kid.

700
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,042
Then take that money
and give it to Jessica.

701
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,628
CAMELLIA

702
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,966
Okay, fine. Thank you.

703
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,885
You know what? Don't take that money!

704
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,638
That way, you'll be able
to make me feel worse.

705
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,274
It's gone.

706
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,568
The money's gone.

707
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,029
This darn fate of mine

708
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:38,866
is playing a joke on me again.

709
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,080
What are you doing with him again?

710
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,046
I made myself clear
that I don't want you to be

711
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,423
vague or indecisive.

712
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,303
I really don't like
seeing you with that jerk.

713
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:00,804
What? "That jerk"?

714
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:05,559
Then what am I supposed to do?
What do you want from me?

715
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,813
I always find myself
stuck in situations like this.

716
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,398
Are you crying?

717
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:15,027
Dongbaek, I didn't even say much.
Why are you crying all of a sudden?

718
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,364
Gosh, someone stole money from me.

719
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,032
-What?
-What? The money I gave you?

720
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,201
I wired you the money.

721
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,787
I also bought a ticket for tomorrow.

722
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,747
The plane leaves late at night.

723
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,666
OVERSEAS REMITTANCE

724
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,708
What?

725
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,044
I told you I'm fine.

726
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:37,466
I'll go there. You can't take care
of a patient all by yourself.

727
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:42,596
Why do you keep telling me not to come?
I have nowhere to go now.

728
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,767
Why do bad things keep happening to me?

729
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:51,980
Why did someone steal from me?
I really don't want his money.

730
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,525
I guess nothing really works out for me.

731
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,777
You should've just spent that money.

732
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,612
Why did you leave it in the fridge?

733
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,450
My gosh, what a complete jerk.

734
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:08,247
You know what? I'm the jerk.
I'm just one stupid jerk.

735
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,500
I can't believe I made you cry.

736
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:15,671
Hearing you sigh is enough
to make me feel heartbroken.

737
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,675
Dongbaek, I become miserable
every time you cry.

738
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,301
What a fucking joke.

739
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,097
Dongbaek.

740
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,725
I'll do what I can

741
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,394
to take care of this.

742
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:34,314
Hey, it's not even your money.
Why would you take care of it?

743
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,900
We'll take care of it on our own.

744
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,610
So just stay out of it.

745
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,405
"We"? Are you seriously
pulling that shit now?

746
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,368
What's wrong?
She's unbelievably pretty, isn't she?

747
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,705
Does it drive you crazy
to see how pretty she is?

748
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,290
Does it make you feel anxious?

749
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:53,751
Yes, right.
I don't ever want to lose her again.

750
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,419
Listen to me, Mr. Kang.

751
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,133
I'm the reason why she looks pretty.

752
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,135
What?

753
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,304
Just think about it.

754
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,223
She always looked gloomy
when she was with you, didn't she?

755
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:10,434
But now that she's with me,

756
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,896
she's pretty every single day.
She's always smiling.

757
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,482
I'm not like you.

758
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:20,027
I'm going to make sure she stays happy
until the day she dies.

759
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,281
My gosh, come on.

760
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,867
Are you okay? Let me see your hand.

761
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:30,204
-Do you seriously like him that much?
-Let me see your hand.

762
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,749
I'm pretty sure
I already sent you 100 million won.

763
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,418
That's how much you needed to settle down.

764
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:41,632
I'll find a job there and make money.

765
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,054
Since when were you
so worried about Grandma?

766
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,016
I already hired a caregiver,
and I'll visit every once in a while.

767
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:54,520
I'm caught in a pickle,
so I need to leave Korea.

768
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:55,771
And...

769
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,441
I want to be with you now.

770
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,735
Why do you keep pushing me away?

771
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,656
What?

772
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,242
I already know what you do for a living.

773
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:15,791
Are you going to do that here?

774
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,711
The Koreans here all know each other.
That's why it's scarier.

775
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,756
On top of that,

776
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,844
Su-jeong and her family don't know
that I have an older sister.

777
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,264
Were you embarrassed to tell them?

778
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,600
I'm paying for your house,
living expenses,

779
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,062
and even her hospital bills.

780
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,482
But your wife doesn't even know I exist?

781
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,071
I guess I was a real idiot.

782
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,615
Plus, Hyang-mi,

783
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,869
you can't even speak English.

784
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,913
You can't do anything here
if you can't speak English.

785
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,874
What about you?

786
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,460
Did you forget
who helped you learn English?

787
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,839
You shouldn't be embarrassed of me.

788
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,551
You may be embarrassed of my job,

789
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:12,097
but that's how you were able
to study abroad.

790
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,392
I did all the dirty work in this shit hole

791
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,854
just so I could help you
live a magnificent life.

792
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,070
I don't need
an ungrateful brother like you.

793
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,325
Let's just cut ties with each other.

794
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,793
You guys can go ahead
and be together if you want.

795
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,004
But leave my kid out of it.

796
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:46,882
What?

797
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:48,842
Listen to me.

798
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,929
If you want to live with him,
just do it by yourself.

799
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,389
I won't let another guy raise my son.

800
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,896
So what's your point?
Are you going to take him from me?

801
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,357
You'll end up giving him to me.

802
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,154
My baby.

803
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,658
-My goodness.
-I'm glad you're here.

804
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:17,329
The heater was on at my place,
so he fell asleep watching baseball.

805
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,374
I walked him home, and I was wondering--

806
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,291
My dad--

807
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,543
I mean, Mr. Kang's inside.

808
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,213
And so is Mr. Hwang.

809
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,758
Can you please take him?

810
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:33,512
I have something to say,
but I don't want him to hear it.

811
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:35,597
Ma'am...

812
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,225
I didn't know his dad came by so often.

813
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,102
I had no idea.

814
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:43,021
Ma'am.

815
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,691
I mean, Ms. Kwak, you're mistaken--

816
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:50,696
Ma'am, I've never been
disrespectful to your daughter.

817
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,658
I know your daughter is precious.

818
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:57,244
But Yong-sik is also a precious son to me.

819
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:02,457
So I can't just leave
when I know that Yong-sik is inside.

820
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,793
Dongbaek.

821
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,755
Pil-gu wants to become an MLB player.

822
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,258
Can you help him achieve that?

823
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,761
Do you know how much it's going to cost
to support him?

824
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:20,809
Are okay if Pil-gu ends up
living a pathetic life like you?

825
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,150
His school friends call him 2D1M

826
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,444
because he has one mom and two dads.

827
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,864
-What?
-If he lives with you,

828
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,741
he'll be a 2D1M whose mom runs a bar.

829
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,160
But if he lives with me,

830
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,329
he'll at least get a chance
to live a better life.

831
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,005
You're a real jerk.

832
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,800
You're thinking of taking Pil-gu
away from her?

833
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:58,138
You know what?
I get that you like Dongbaek.

834
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,018
I believe that you really do.

835
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,353
But let's be realistic here.

836
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,272
Can you really raise my son?

837
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,441
I already told you
that he's not your son.

838
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:12,569
What can you even do for my kid?

839
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,655
You obviously can't love him
more than I do.

840
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,365
But what about the other stuff?

841
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,910
Can you work your ass off
for a kid who isn't yours?

842
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,328
-Jong-ryeol.
-And money...

843
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,038
-Hey!
-Do you even have money?

844
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,085
You crazy punk.

845
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,754
You idiotic fool.

846
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:35,342
You dumb punk!
Why are you even listening to him?

847
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,428
Mom.

848
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,020
BAEKDU MARINATED CRAB

849
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,773
Why did you follow us here?

850
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:52,609
I don't like you anymore.

851
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:54,820
-I hate you.
-Mom!

852
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,196
What? You darn punk!

853
00:51:57,155 --> 00:52:01,034
It hurts me so much
to see you get treated that way!

854
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,329
Mom, what do you know?
You don't even know anything!

855
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,413
I know enough.

856
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:09,292
That guy who's always on TV
is Pil-gu's dad.

857
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:12,921
Meanwhile, she's dating you
while she lets him come by whenever.

858
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,590
My gosh, you're totally mistaken!

859
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,884
This fool is just letting it slide.

860
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:19,678
Ms. Kwak.

861
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,597
You're making my son
endure so many hardships.

862
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,933
How do you think that makes me feel?

863
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,230
My gosh.

864
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,402
I bought matching pajamas
because they're newlyweds.

865
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,779
I'll just have to wear them.

866
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,326
But the thing is, Grandma,

867
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,455
I heard you can get treated for free
in Denmark.

868
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,543
To be honest,

869
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,921
I sent him money when I already knew that.

870
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,758
I just figured he urgently needed money.

871
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,554
I let myself get fooled
hoping he'd live a happy life.

872
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,308
Let's just cut ties with each other.

873
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,228
You can't say I was mean.
I did the right thing.

874
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,565
I should help him out

875
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,151
so he can cut ties with me.

876
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,031
You know what I mean, right?

877
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,827
You know that he's a little dumb.

878
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,538
Hyang-mi.

879
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:34,628
FORGET-ME-NOT

880
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,385
I told you to wear socks.

881
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,679
You don't want to catch a cold.

882
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,515
You'll catch a cold as well.

883
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:54,689
He was dumb and too affectionate.

884
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,570
So I had no choice

885
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,740
but to help him cut ties with me.

886
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,827
He should live a happy life
with his family.

887
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,122
He deserves a decent life.

888
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:17,295
Hye-hun deserves to live a decent life.

889
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,983
BAEKDU GRANDMA MARINATED CRAB

890
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,661
This is so unfair for my son.

891
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,748
Why does it have to be so hard
to raise a child?

892
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:58,044
Do you think I stayed quiet
because I was okay with everything?

893
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:00,046
I'm sorry.

894
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:04,009
I knew it'd hurt my son
if I was hard on you.

895
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:06,970
That's why I couldn't mistreat you.

896
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,557
Ms. Kwak, I know

897
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:15,562
that you were putting up with a lot.

898
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,398
But I keep messing up.

899
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,067
You guys keep doing whatever you want.

900
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:24,988
So I'm going to do the same
and live however I want as well.

901
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,783
I'm sick of holding my anger
and pretending like I'm okay.

902
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,161
I had no idea about Pil-gu's dad.

903
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:37,625
Ms. Kwak, I haven't been
seeing him all this time.

904
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:43,173
You'll always be involved with him
because of Pil-gu.

905
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:47,802
And I could obviously tell
that he still has feelings for you.

906
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,181
Dongbaek, this is not right.

907
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:54,559
Why are you hurting my son like this?

908
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,895
I'm sorry, Ms. Kwak.

909
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,980
Don't do anything to apologize!

910
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:03,735
I won't let my son live a difficult life
just because he loves you.

911
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:07,989
Yong-sik was born after his father died,

912
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,618
so he's especially very dear to me.

913
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,789
I had to endure all sorts of hardships

914
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:21,544
just so I could let him live a happy life.

915
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:26,674
But now, you're going to make him
share your troubles?

916
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,260
I'm sorry, but I can't let that happen.

917
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,645
Don't make him feel sorry for you

918
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,731
with that pitiful look on your face.

919
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,360
And don't smile at him
with that pretty face of yours.

920
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,404
Just leave Yong-sik alone.

921
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:51,574
Will you please stop
getting involved with my son?

922
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,878
BAEKDU GRANDMA MARINATED CRAB

923
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,923
Dongbaek.

924
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,884
Are you okay?

925
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,555
Today was a long day.

926
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,684
Why? What happened?
Was my mom harsh on you again?

927
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,602
Did she hurt your feelings?

928
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,982
Ms. Kwak's probably devastated right now.

929
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:32,782
So you should go inside
instead of following me today.

930
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:38,371
No, we don't do late-night deliveries.

931
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:45,086
Actually, never mind.
I'll deliver it for you.

932
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,296
Where?

933
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,256
Okay.

934
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:54,971
Okay.

935
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,681
Thank you. Bye.

936
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:01,769
I still need to finish my job for the day.

937
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,023
You're making a delivery?

938
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,568
Mom, I think we should start
selling stir-fried squid and pork belly.

939
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,028
It's really popular.

940
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,280
Where are you going with your puffy eyes?

941
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,866
Why are you trying to act so strong?

942
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,367
Just go home and get some rest.

943
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,495
I need to keep myself busy.

944
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,414
If I closed early every time I cried,

945
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,500
I couldn't have paid for
Pil-gu's academy.

946
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,543
My gosh, you're unbelievable.

947
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:29,047
You're tall and pretty
because you didn't take after my looks.

948
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,216
But why are you living like me?

949
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:34,552
Let life give me its best punch.
I still won't collapse.

950
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,139
I shouldn't have come.

951
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:43,436
I should've just killed myself
instead of seeing her live like this.

952
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:48,858
I'm practically on my way
to get myself killed.

953
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,946
Even if Dongbaek's foolishly nice,
she still won't forgive me.

954
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,578
But what can I do?
I have nowhere else to go.

955
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:08,044
I guess having a home
can be really dangerous.

956
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,509
STIR-FRIED SQUID AND PORK BELLY
ONE SERVING

957
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:17,262
CAMELLIA

958
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:22,141
She's so annoying.

959
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:23,935
My gosh.

960
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:28,481
My gosh, that darn wench.
Mi-sun is a real bitch.

961
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,735
Move.

962
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,950
Why would you make a delivery
when you can't even start it?

963
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,119
You're going instead?

964
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:44,330
And from now on, tell them
they need to order two servings or more.

965
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,624
This is just one serving.

966
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,751
Even coffee shops
don't take single orders.

967
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,673
People who live alone
also deserve to eat this.

968
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:57,844
You're in no place to worry about that.

969
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,223
Are you crying?

970
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,685
Why aren't you asking me any questions?
Are you seriously dumb?

971
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:10,148
My gosh, you're so pathetic.

972
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:14,068
Why are you crying? You couldn't even
run away with 30 million won.

973
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,446
You should be beating me up right now.

974
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,115
Why do you keep humiliating me like this?

975
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:21,576
Both our lives are shitty.

976
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:24,037
But why are you always so...

977
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:30,793
What? Are you going to treat me
like I'm younger than you now?

978
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,837
You're older than me, aren't you?

979
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:36,341
My gosh, I knew it.
It was such an obvious lie.

980
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:40,178
You weren't loved by your parents,
and the world was never nice to you.

981
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,640
Why are you always so generous
when you've never been loved?

982
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:45,433
Why do you have such a big heart?

983
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,482
Did you take my bracelet?

984
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,736
Germanium is worthless.
Plus, that bracelet is so old.

985
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,572
I wanted to remember you.

986
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,164
I didn't want to forget you.
That's why I took it.

987
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,007
I LOVE ONLY YOU

988
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,175
CAMELLIA

989
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:21,219
You did a nice job of naming this place.

990
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,139
Your life will become better
thanks to the meaning of camellia.

991
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,063
All flowers have good meanings.

992
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:34,023
There are some
that have unlucky meanings.

993
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,901
Do you know what a forget-me-not means?

994
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:39,737
A forget-me-not?

995
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:45,243
It means "Don't forget me."

996
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,622
Don't forget me, okay?

997
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:54,961
I got abandoned
by both my mom and brother.

998
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:57,755
But I want you

999
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:00,967
to remember me.

1000
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,304
That will at least give my life
some meaning.

1001
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,773
What's wrong, Hyang-mi?
Did something happen?

1002
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,400
What's the matter?

1003
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,241
Have some stew and alcohol ready for me.

1004
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:26,617
If it tastes good,

1005
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,871
I'll do everything I can

1006
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,457
to pay you back before I leave.

1007
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:10,870
Why isn't she back yet?
Is she lost?

1008
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,135
Hello, this is Camellia.

1009
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:28,971
What?

1010
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:30,890
Do you make deliveries?

1011
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:32,892
Deliveries?

1012
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,938
ALARM

1013
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,816
-Are you going to come
-What? Hello?

1014
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,025
this time?

1015
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:45,488
Hello?

1016
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,573
Hello?

1017
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,960
Estimated time of death,

1018
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,338
between 10:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.

1019
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:39,667
She obviously ran away.

1020
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,253
I wonder if Hyang-mi went to Copenhagen.

1021
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:45,089
The director of the Academy
and Gyu-tae were like brothers.

1022
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:47,758
Don't dig into Hanbit Academy.
It'll cause a mess.

1023
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:49,927
If you made that delivery
at that hour...

1024
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:53,222
She walked on eggshells her whole life.
Why should she feel sorry?

1025
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,975
Liking you more doesn't mean
I owe you anything.

1026
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,269
You should meet someone
who has a stable life

1027
01:04:58,352 --> 01:04:59,437
and doesn't have a kid.

1028
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,940
I want to live a comfortable life now.
Let's just end this.
