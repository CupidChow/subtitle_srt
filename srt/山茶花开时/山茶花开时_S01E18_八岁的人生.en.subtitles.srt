00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,810
LIFE OF AN 8-YEAR-OLD

2
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,438
Why are you already being a handful?

3
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,065
Are you hitting puberty?

4
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,818
You're one to talk.
It's you who's being a handful.

5
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,571
Whatever.
I said no and my answer is final.

6
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,281
Do you only care about yourself?

7
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,658
What about what I want?

8
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,619
What is it that you want then?

9
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,750
Did you ask for my opinion
when you gave birth to me?

10
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,378
If I'm okay not having a dad?

11
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,968
Did you ask how I felt
when you started to date Yong-sik?

12
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,804
Did you ask me if you could?

13
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,891
But this guy
is getting divorced.

14
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:44,395
It'll be the three of us.
Me, him, and the baby.

15
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,150
He'll set up an arcade
and send me to the Major League.

16
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,781
Do you agree to a DNA test?

17
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,367
Can...

18
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,203
I refuse?

19
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,746
FORENSICS

20
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,250
I'll do it.

21
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,627
-I should cooperate.
-Right.

22
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,757
Please open up.

23
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,386
Why aren't any of the clocks working?

24
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,059
Someone's in here.

25
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,477
He's my father.

26
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,648
Why is he sitting there silently?

27
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,026
-He can't move.
-Sorry?

28
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,987
He can't walk.

29
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,783
I see.

30
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,661
-Do we collect his sample, too?
-Hey!

31
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,456
We're sorry, sir.

32
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,256
If one more dies,

33
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,759
they'll be scared out of their wits.

34
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,309
Is it okay to lock the door
when he's inside?

35
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,312
I'm worried that someone will go in.

36
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,692
It's a scary world out there.

37
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,653
He's right.
My mom can't walk properly either

38
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,363
because of her sore hips.

39
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,783
It really takes a toll
on the family members.

40
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,329
GARBAGE

41
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,039
ONGSAN SANITATION

42
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,876
My strategy is always to be
quick to attack.

43
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,836
All right, let's go!

44
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,548
And everyone in Ongsan is on my side.

45
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,509
Why did you have to come?

46
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,137
No wonder Ja-yeong isn't here.

47
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:45,266
Did she really get you out of here?

48
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,393
You don't have to come back?

49
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,479
If it weren't for Ja-yeong,

50
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,565
the police would've run all over me.

51
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,943
Thankfully, the snobby cow is still loyal.

52
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,696
Your aunt in Daejeon wants to set you up

53
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,865
with a school art teacher.

54
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,243
Save it. I'm not remarrying.

55
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,912
As my punishment for hurting Ja-yeong,

56
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,165
I'll die as a lonely old man.

57
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,918
You disgraceful imbecile.

58
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,630
Can't it be anyone else but her?

59
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,049
Why ask when you can't
bring us back together?

60
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,426
Gyu-tae, wait. Stop.

61
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:25,056
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

62
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,016
Where are you going?

63
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,352
I found my calling.

64
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,354
What...

65
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,398
PARK HEUNG-SIK

66
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,071
SUSPICIOUS ARTICLES

67
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,824
What the hell is all this?

68
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,867
It stinks.

69
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,577
Go and open the window.

70
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,913
Leave the door open, too.

71
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,125
What are you doing in a closed space?

72
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,546
-Are you not selling glasses anymore?
-Business has been bad.

73
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,883
I hear he became a cop
after catching a fugitive.

74
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,594
Goodness. So what?

75
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,764
Are you thinking of applying
after catching Joker?

76
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,391
This is what I'm meant to do.

77
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,439
Chief, I heard we got Joker's DNA.

78
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,900
Can you use the back channel again

79
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,069
and give this to your friend at the lab?

80
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,154
Give this to him.

81
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,865
I put him in a tough spot, you know.

82
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,535
He had to write up an apology
because of the steering wheel.

83
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,122
There is no such thing as a perfect crime.

84
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,207
We just didn't dig deep enough.

85
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,046
So we'll dig, dig, and dig again

86
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,756
to find definitive evidence

87
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,008
so that he'll have no place to escape.

88
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,597
-What's this?
-Still,

89
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,641
Dongbaek said
she didn't recognize the guy.

90
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:55,897
Those mishaps in people's memories
let these snakes get away with crimes.

91
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,191
How can Dongbaek
recognize a guy right away

92
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,777
in such a situation
when he even had a cap on?

93
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,237
It's like when my dad
was caught for gambling.

94
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,574
I couldn't recognize him on the news
because of the cap he had on.

95
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,747
He reported his truck missing

96
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,957
and Dongbaek didn't recognize him.

97
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,502
I bet he's proud of himself right now,

98
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,963
but he can't fool me. No way.

99
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,717
He seems like the type
to have high self-esteem.

100
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,928
He can't fool me either.

101
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,352
You're doing this
because you're upset with me, right?

102
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,021
You really want to move to Seoul?

103
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,023
Jun-gi and I won't be there, you know.

104
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,318
But my dad's there.

105
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:51,953
I lived with you for all these years.
I should get to live with Dad as well.

106
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,624
Why do you look so gloomy?

107
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,377
Do you always want me to grow up
without a dad?

108
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,590
It doesn't have
to be that way for me, though.

109
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,096
Right.

110
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,056
You're right.

111
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,144
Just because I don't have a husband
doesn't mean you can't have a dad.

112
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,438
Why did I never think of that?

113
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,073
While walking under
the same torn umbrella,

114
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,452
I must have depended on him
in some ways, too.

115
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,163
I must've felt guilty as well.

116
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,957
I guess that's why I got upset
with his decision.

117
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,378
Really?

118
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,507
You're going to send him away?

119
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,387
Only until Joker is caught.

120
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,602
You know,

121
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,397
I didn't mention this
because it would only scare you.

122
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,024
POLICE

123
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,400
But I'll be straightforward.

124
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,611
I think that Heung-sik...

125
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,155
is Joker.

126
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,075
I'm about 85 percent sure.

127
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,705
No, it's not him.

128
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,584
Besides, weren't you adamant
that Mr. No was Joker?

129
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,088
Dongbaek, look into my eyes.

130
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,883
Would I let him get away?

131
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,639
I'm curious, though.

132
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,893
Why do you do that thing with your eyes?

133
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,981
Anyway, just trust me. Okay?

134
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,528
I'll catch Joker in no time

135
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,156
and bring Pil-gu home.

136
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,797
POLICE

137
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,124
CAMELLIA

138
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,379
What kind of weirdo orders
stir-fried squid and pork belly out here?

139
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,521
Because of the accident,
Hyang-mi was late.

140
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,117
During that time, he lost control

141
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,202
and forgot to be cautious.

142
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,375
His tic that was gone for a while
started again,

143
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,881
and he mistook Hyang-mi for Dongbaek.

144
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,896
She was stabbed once in the neck.

145
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,607
There weren't any defensive wounds.

146
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,276
She didn't see the attack coming.

147
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,236
I'm curious, though.

148
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:58,282
Why does he stuff sawdust
in people's mouths?

149
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,076
Who knows?

150
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,080
I found something even weirder this time.

151
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,707
It's about this big and bright yellow.

152
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,210
-Bright yellow?
-Yes.

153
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,254
There's no distinct shape,
and it's a bold color.

154
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,091
I honestly can't figure out what it is.

155
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,219
Why did he stuff it in her mouth?

156
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,472
He didn't stuff it in her mouth.

157
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,265
The victim swallowed it herself.

158
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,315
That yellow thing was found in her throat.

159
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,654
To be lodged in there,

160
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,365
it would take more force
than someone shoving it in.

161
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,956
It indicates that the victim
voluntarily swallowed it before dying.

162
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,917
CAMELLIA

163
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,130
Then she was alive until that moment.

164
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,925
If an artery was slashed,
she would've died instantly.

165
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,219
However, it only nicked her vein,

166
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,513
so she would've bled out slowly.

167
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,056
80B6033

168
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,891
She stayed alive for about 30 minutes.

169
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,561
I wonder

170
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,938
why Hyang-mi swallowed that.

171
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,278
I think she was leaving us a message.

172
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,999
ONGSAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

173
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,800
Chung-jae went to the Philippines.

174
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,094
Just consider it as the same thing.

175
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,222
You want to study abroad?
Were you always this ambitious?

176
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:50,478
I have to play in the Major League
to buy you a stir-fried pork diner.

177
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:56,150
Hold on. Must I sell stir-fried pork
even after you join the Major League?

178
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,448
Are you crying again?

179
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,951
If you cry too often,
people will walk all over you.

180
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,914
Jun-gi's mom doesn't cry
even when she hits her toe on a door.

181
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,464
What are you going to call that model?

182
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,216
You won't call her Mom, right?

183
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:21,884
Are you insane?

184
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,432
ONGSAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

185
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,371
You just jumped right in.
Don't I even get a hug?

186
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:51,956
I'm not a baby.

187
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,337
Don't be like that.

188
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,256
Crying here will only make us feel bad.

189
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,843
We'll get going.

190
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,184
Call me as soon as you get there, okay?

191
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,103
You said that about 100 times.

192
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,857
I'm getting a headache now, so get going.

193
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,414
So much for kids being clingy.

194
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,292
He didn't even look back once.

195
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,651
Must you cry your eyes out like that?
You're making me feel bad.

196
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,322
Why did you pretend
to be so cool about it?

197
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,616
I'm not leaving because I want to!

198
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,410
Then why are you leaving?

199
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,246
It's not like I'm kidnapping you.

200
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,083
If I'm going to be anyone's burden,
it'll be better to be yours.

201
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,585
What?

202
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:23,631
You were able to marry that model
because you were childless.

203
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,093
Mom can now marry Yong-sik for all I care!

204
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,223
Is that why you're coming with me?

205
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,975
Why is everyone getting married?

206
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,562
Aren't I enough for you guys?

207
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,441
Why do you just keep
marrying other people?

208
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,792
Anyway, if Sang-mi stays here again,

209
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,669
I'll kick you out with her.

210
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,256
Mu-ok,

211
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,052
people say that your daughter
is an attention seeker.

212
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,637
They say it's almost an illness.

213
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,933
Her father never gave her
the attention she needs,

214
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,851
which is why she seeks it elsewhere.

215
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,691
How can she not crave love
when her father's this way?

216
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,651
What?

217
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,361
What did you say?

218
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,739
If she's not a minister or an accountant,

219
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,907
she's not your child?

220
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,076
I'm fine being ostracized, but her...

221
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,453
Shit.

222
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,956
What did you just say?

223
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,959
This wouldn't have happened
had you raised her well.

224
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,212
Okay, fine. It's my fault.
I'm the one to blame.

225
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,673
I should be beaten
to a pulp for this, right?

226
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,054
Mom, stop.

227
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,724
I'm not off to die, you know.

228
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,185
I'm just moving to another apartment
in the complex.

229
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:03,772
Sang-mi.

230
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,358
All right, fine. I won't argue with him.

231
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,820
Being divorced twice isn't anything
to be ashamed about these days.

232
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,238
Just leave him if you want.

233
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,283
Don't live for me, and do as you want now.

234
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,328
I can carry this myself.

235
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:22,416
Why are you being this way?
Are you showing off your strength?

236
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,004
All right. You can carry them.

237
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,548
Why fold so easily like that?

238
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,427
Are you in debt to me?
Is that why you're being my mom?

239
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,932
Stop being intimidated all the time
because of me.

240
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,185
That annoys me even more!

241
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,270
Hand it over.

242
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,123
Mom...

243
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,381
What did my baby ever do wrong?

244
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,884
If there's anyone to blame, it's me.

245
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,681
Children,
even after receiving nine things,

246
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,059
ask for one more.

247
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,904
Parents are heartbroken
when they don't have one more to give

248
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,489
even after giving ten.

249
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,867
Even though parents
keep giving and giving.

250
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,712
Hey. My gosh.

251
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,548
You...

252
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,594
They always feel like
they're in debt to their children.

253
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,555
Why did you change the lock combination?

254
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,807
Was it to keep me out?

255
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,019
So one leaves and one crawls back in?

256
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,647
Pil-gu handed me the baton.

257
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,774
Really?

258
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,320
When did you meet him? What did he say?

259
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:16,780
Move.

260
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,331
This isn't a place
for you to come by when you please.

261
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,126
You leave then come back,
leave then come back.

262
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,254
Is this some sort of test?

263
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,507
Have you been to the doctor or what?

264
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,719
Why are you so annoying?

265
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,512
Have you had dinner?

266
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,390
Did you eat when you abandoned me?

267
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,861
Must you do this?

268
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,654
What?

269
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,741
You want to kick me out
so Dongbaek can move in?

270
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,746
-I can't watch that.
-Do you live with me for others' sake?

271
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,167
You're the party at fault here
and you can't ask for a divorce.

272
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,211
You're the one who kept asking for one.

273
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,422
I only asked.
You're the one with another son.

274
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,049
Keep it down, will you?

275
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,385
He knows everything anyway,
so why should I?

276
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,553
-Hey.
-What?

277
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,890
Enough is enough.

278
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,016
Shut it.

279
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,440
I don't know if you'll like it.

280
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,318
Here.

281
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,571
All right.

282
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:48,580
Is one bill a day
enough allowance for an eight-year-old?

283
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,250
I'm not up to date on the market price.

284
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,049
10,000 WON

285
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,260
YEOKJAM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

286
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,182
It's your first time having a dad,

287
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,185
but it's my first time
having an eight-year-old, too.

288
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,523
Let's just think of this
as an adjusting period.

289
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,110
Sure. I'm good with that.

290
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,780
Also,

291
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,784
the model lady will stay here for now.

292
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,952
That's fine, too.

293
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,330
I see. All right.

294
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:36,128
By the way, your sister
is at my mother's house,

295
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,005
but she'll be back tomorrow.

296
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,757
I guess that's fine with you too, but--

297
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,052
Does she stay in different homes often?

298
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,345
What?

299
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,973
Well...

300
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,935
She stays at my mom's
and then at Jessica's mom's...

301
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,187
I feel bad for her.

302
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,483
She's ugly and is in diapers,
but hops from place to place.

303
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:10,120
Do you think of yourself that way, too?

304
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:14,833
Sure. I lived with my mom,
and now I'm living with my dad.

305
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,427
Do you usually sleep alone?
Since it's your first day, maybe...

306
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,847
Right. I guess sleeping together
would be weird.

307
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,894
Can I lock my door when I sleep?

308
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,783
How on earth do you comfort
a 34-year-old daughter?

309
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,536
Gosh, I have no idea.

310
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,419
It's just me.

311
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,545
-Why?
-What?

312
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,671
-What?
-Why?

313
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,550
You want us to sleep together?

314
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,305
-That's weird.
-Tell me about it.

315
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,057
What...

316
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,735
How can you abandon a child?

317
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,657
Even though mine's with his father,

318
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,077
I'm worried about

319
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,247
whether he's sleeping all right

320
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,874
or if his nightstand
and humidifier are on.

321
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,794
So how could you abandon me?

322
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,637
How can you live after abandoning a kid?

323
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,602
You're this upset
when Pil-gu's gone temporarily.

324
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,314
But I abandoned my kid.

325
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,318
The day I left you,

326
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,697
I went crazy.

327
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,050
Do you want me
to pat your back or something?

328
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,927
My bed's too small.

329
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,141
Stop weeping and just go to sleep.

330
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:41,438
Even without his humidifier,
he's safer over there.

331
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,817
You can bring him back
once Joker is caught.

332
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,489
A kid needs a mother
more than all the money in the world.

333
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,911
You made me an orphan when you knew that?

334
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,123
If you give up your child

335
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,834
because you can barely meet ends,

336
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,588
you become dead inside.

337
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,380
Don't die, Mom.

338
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,638
Stop yapping and go to bed.

339
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,394
That kidney or gallbladder,
whatever it is... I'll give you mine.

340
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,062
Hey!

341
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,314
What?

342
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,025
I didn't want to come back
because I know you'd say that.

343
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,736
I'd rather die

344
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,990
than take that
from the daughter I gave up.

345
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,075
It's my gallbladder to give.

346
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:21,371
Who are you to tell me what to do with it?
Why do you care?

347
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:25,125
You should hate me. You should loathe me.

348
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,502
Why would you give it to me so easily?

349
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,379
It's not because I like you.

350
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,717
I can hate you all I want
while giving you what you need.

351
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,261
If you die because I don't give it to you,

352
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,305
how do you think I would feel?

353
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,018
Why is everyone in this household
too good-hearted?

354
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:47,772
My heart breaks whenever I see you both.

355
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,650
Why did you grow up to be so kind?

356
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,529
No one will acknowledge you
or be nicer to you for your kindness.

357
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,241
Whatever. Stop nagging and just don't die.

358
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,787
I want to stop saying goodbye to everyone.

359
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,709
Goodness. I thought I could die in peace

360
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,629
after seeing you,

361
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,090
but I really can't bring myself
to die now.

362
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,303
Yes, so just take
my gallbladder or whatever.

363
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,430
Why would I take your gallbladder?

364
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,849
It's my kidney. The kidney, you idiot.

365
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,321
You know what?

366
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,406
It's science.

367
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,701
There's a research result that says

368
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,996
the accuracy of a lie detector
is as high as 94 percent.

369
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,098
Mother.

370
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,351
I don't like cake.

371
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,978
Gyu-tae likes it.

372
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,232
Why do you keep calling him by name?

373
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,861
He addresses me by my name
when he's with my mom

374
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,279
even though I'm older.

375
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,324
How fair and square of you.

376
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,744
I can't believe I have
Judge Judy for a daughter-in-law.

377
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,874
It seems like you came to say something
you don't want to with that cake.

378
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,710
But that's not necessary.

379
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,046
I had my own way of venting
whenever you were mean.

380
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,758
Well, I guess you weren't the type
who never talked back.

381
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,636
And compared to other mother-in-laws,

382
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,432
I was a really easygoing person.

383
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,892
Mother?

384
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,311
It's not that you were easygoing.

385
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:55,608
Come to think about it,
I got my revenge every single time.

386
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,778
What? What revenge?

387
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,948
Something that you would know.

388
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,909
What? What is it?

389
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,786
Tell me!

390
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,205
What revenge is that?

391
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,799
To whom would I vent the stress
that I get from you?

392
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,681
Whenever you gave me stress
that was the size of a ping pong ball,

393
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:30,185
I threw a volleyball at Gyu-tae.

394
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,646
He must've been as tired as me

395
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,899
whenever the holidays passed by.

396
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,485
I was hysteric for at least a week.

397
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,406
When I got stressed out by you,
of course, I took it out on your son.

398
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,743
I'm sure you know that
because you've done it, too.

399
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,287
You know that's only natural.

400
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,915
Are you trying to get back at me?

401
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,584
You're saying that
if I criticize you,

402
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,545
my son would end up
dealing with all your wrath?

403
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,549
You're determined
to make me explode, aren't you?

404
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,261
You stab me, I stab Gyu-tae.

405
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,389
Then Gyu-tae would get scared of me.

406
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,975
Then you would stab me again.

407
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:17,398
We were all just victims
in that stupid vicious cycle.

408
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:22,612
I really hope you get
a daughter-in-law like you, okay?

409
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,248
Do you always pack
what you need by yourself?

410
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,499
Mom, one second.

411
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,174
Pil-gu hasn't been
able to mingle very well.

412
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,348
Did you lock the door again?

413
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,559
Why do you keep doing that?

414
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:55,436
He looks as embarrassed and anxious as me

415
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,188
whenever I had new classmates.

416
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,150
Pil-gu's tiny little heart
is anxious, too.

417
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:05,113
Anyway, I saw her. Rebecca.

418
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,950
Did you say hi to her? How was it?

419
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,577
She's bald, but she's a girl.

420
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,121
They keep putting a ribbon on her head.

421
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,749
Pil-gu's voice keeps getting smaller.

422
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,797
So? Did you make any new friends?

423
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,674
How many new friends did you get?

424
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,342
The kids here are really weird.

425
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,970
They don't go to the mountain
to see a beetle.

426
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,848
They get one delivered to their house
and raise it.

427
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,059
-They're really weird.
-Really?

428
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,479
I thought he didn't take after me.

429
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,691
I'm off to earn money.

430
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,069
It's supposed to be scrambled eggs.

431
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,280
I'll try harder tomorrow!

432
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,574
I can't drink milk.

433
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,997
But he keeps taking after me.

434
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:01,002
He keeps feeling self-conscious,
and he keeps getting gloomy.

435
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,797
AVOCADO, ZUCCHINI, MACKEREL, SALT

436
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,011
Mom.

437
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,597
When did I start talking?

438
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,976
You barely started speaking
after you turned two.

439
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,437
You really stressed me out

440
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,898
because it took you forever to speak.

441
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,611
Pil-gu started speaking really late, too.

442
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,781
But someone said

443
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,826
a single parent's child
tends to begin speaking later.

444
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:38,081
The mother is the only one who speaks,
so they don't get much stimulation.

445
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,917
After I heard that,

446
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,545
I carried him on my back and went out

447
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,507
every single night.

448
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,886
I kept going around
the entire neighborhood saying,

449
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,431
"Say hello to that auntie.
Say hi to that granny, too."

450
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,686
I went around talking to everyone
like some crazy woman in town.

451
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,982
But no matter how much I tried,

452
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:09,362
people kept saying all kinds of things
just because I'm a single mother.

453
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,489
Goodness.

454
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,867
People just can't keep
their mouths shut, can they?

455
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,371
I could ignore whatever they said to me,

456
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,332
but here's the thing
that I hated hearing the most.

457
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,130
"Goodness, I feel bad for the kid.
That poor kid."

458
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,259
Those inconsiderate jerks.
They won't feel as bad as the mother.

459
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,886
Why do they blabber
like they know everything?

460
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,514
I really didn't want
to hear them say that,

461
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,349
so I brought him up into a bright kid.

462
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,437
But no matter how much I try,
he must be my son.

463
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,232
He keeps taking after me.
It's frustrating.

464
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,449
Hey, feed her some dumplings.

465
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,534
Okay.

466
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,283
I don't plan on becoming an evil stepmom
in fairy tales or on the news.

467
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,953
But I don't have enough energy
to be superficial either.

468
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,914
Let's just live comfortably,

469
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,084
as if this is a share house.

470
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,627
Okay.

471
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,838
So you can ask me for food
without feeling bad.

472
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,592
Just think of me
as a cafeteria lunch lady or something.

473
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:55,760
Okay.

474
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,179
And tell your dad if you need anything.

475
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,139
We're not close.

476
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,853
He keeps asking if I need anything
whenever he sees me,

477
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,897
so I don't want to talk to him.

478
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,483
Then you can tell me or something.

479
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,276
I'm pretty cool about things.

480
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,907
But I heard the lunch ladies
went on a strike.

481
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,535
Right. It's tough to make a living.

482
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,086
After Pil-gu went away,

483
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,339
Dongbaek seems like an alien
who's pretending to be her.

484
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,008
No dumplings again?

485
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,136
You didn't have them yesterday, either.

486
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,139
The owner isn't in the mood
to make dumplings.

487
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,435
Dongbaek, soy sauce. Dip it in soy sauce.

488
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,772
I don't want to.

489
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,693
Why? You're not in the mood
to dip it in soy sauce?

490
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,404
Mom, just set a date
for the operation already.

491
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,030
There's no way I'm doing that.

492
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,284
If I don't agree to get an operation,

493
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:05,079
no doctor or even a god can come
and take your kidney.

494
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,373
Mom.

495
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,752
I have to catch Joker
and give Hyang-mi a funeral, too.

496
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,339
I still feel like

497
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,343
Hyang-mi would walk out of the kitchen
with some beer in her hand.

498
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,096
Pil-gu went to Seoul only a few days ago,

499
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,890
but I can't even taste this dumpling.

500
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,061
Things are tough for your daughter, Mom.

501
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,814
I'm bad at saying goodbyes.

502
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,067
So stop torturing me
and set a date already.

503
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,153
Let me just give it to you.

504
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,654
Don't make it sound so easy.

505
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,663
She grew tired over
the continuous blows life threw at her.

506
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,917
CAMELLIA

507
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,585
Onions aren't that great nowadays.

508
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:58,299
She became completely lethargic
as if she dropped her soul somewhere else.

509
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,135
I can't help it, I guess.
Just give them to me.

510
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,720
No, we want different ones.

511
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,181
-These things are barely onions.
-It's just a few.

512
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,183
-Give them back.
-Let's just take them.

513
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,476
I'll take them.

514
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,772
I couldn't do anything to fill up
Pil-gu's empty space, not even an inch.

515
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,065
-Goodbye.
-Okay.

516
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,191
Dongbaek!

517
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,780
My gosh.

518
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,490
You stepped on dog poop.

519
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,118
People should clean up
after their own dogs!

520
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,246
You need to pick up this dog poop!

521
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,290
No one would feel great
after stepping on dog poop!

522
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,667
Darn it.

523
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,544
Dog poop is just dog poop.

524
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,255
Why are you so out of it?

525
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,090
You should watch out for dog poop.

526
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,719
She didn't cry or smile.

527
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,514
She seemed like she lost her soul.

528
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,403
CAMELLIA

529
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,029
Do you know

530
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,534
which line in TV shows
makes me turn the channel?

531
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,953
I wouldn't know.

532
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,248
"We're breaking up because I love you."

533
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:17,128
There's nothing more pretentious
and cheaper than that.

534
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,171
Why would you break up
when you're in love?

535
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,048
You should make sure to hold onto them.

536
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:25,177
It's like saying, "I'm hungry,
but I don't feel like eating."

537
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:30,725
That just means they aren't hungry enough.
They still have time to pick and choose.

538
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,727
I'm hungry.

539
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,438
I'm practically starving.

540
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:38,357
There's no reason to make
cheap excuses like that.

541
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,777
Just be honest and say, "I like you,

542
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,030
but I don't like your background.

543
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:48,284
I don't want all these other things
that come with you. No, thank you."

544
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:51,078
Why do they make excuses
and say, "I loved you"?

545
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:58,711
I'm not saying, "I like you, Dongbaek,
but I can't accept Pil-gu."

546
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,921
And it's not my style

547
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,549
to break up with someone
when I still like her.

548
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:07,261
So... Will you please
stop removing those stickers?

549
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,471
You keep doing that.

550
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,225
CAMELLIA

551
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,186
You'll never break up?

552
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,521
Never.

553
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,777
Then let me leave my will with you.

554
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,240
They must've been like Romeo and Juliet,
not mother and son.

555
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,576
She's completely out of it.

556
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,163
She wouldn't be thrilled
to get rid of her burden, you know.

557
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,833
Okay, smarty.

558
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,712
Ms. Kwak.

559
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,465
Stop lying around.
Get up and shell some beans.

560
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,426
Every family has its own issues.

561
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,637
I'm sure he didn't suddenly go to Seoul

562
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,806
because he got sour over what you said.

563
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,015
Goodness.

564
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,685
There's no point
of making all those offerings

565
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,813
if I can't be a real adult.

566
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,733
I broke a kid's heart at 70 years of age.

567
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,527
He's a kid.

568
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,237
He'll forget it soon.

569
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,531
It'll stay with him for life
because he's a kid.

570
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,325
I scratched on a cement
that hasn't hardened.

571
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,785
How am I to make up for that?

572
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,162
That'll stay with him for life.

573
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,415
I knew you weren't capable.

574
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:21,210
All of us only pretended
like we were scared of you,

575
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,295
but you're just too kind-hearted.

576
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,173
There's no way you can kick out
Dongbaek and Pil-gu. Never.

577
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:29,844
So what?
Do you expect me to let them marry?

578
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,348
Stop giving me advice
when I'm the one who's about to die here.

579
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,307
Darn it.

580
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,684
Hey.

581
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,062
Okay, I get it.

582
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,856
You should go now. Please.

583
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,115
My goodness.

584
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,868
Goodness.

585
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,538
Yes, Chief Byeon. I'm on my way back.

586
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,498
Did Byeong-rae of NFS call you?

587
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,749
NFS TEST ANALYSIS

588
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,502
Just ask him to run ours through first.

589
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,297
He has it. He has the result.

590
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,845
How's the kid doing at their house?

591
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,308
Is he doing all right?

592
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,102
Yes, I guess so.

593
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,354
What about you?

594
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,946
I don't even have to ask.

595
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,950
I thought I brought up Pil-gu,

596
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,119
but I guess it was the other way around.

597
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,289
I don't feel like

598
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,709
doing anything without Pil-gu here.

599
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,881
I must either be getting too old

600
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,549
or have gotten possessed.

601
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,969
I have no idea why I said that.

602
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,847
I should really watch my mouth.

603
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,852
How could I say that you should
at least be without a burden like him?

604
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:07,816
I'm sure that had a huge impact
in his heart.

605
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,528
How am I supposed to make up for that?

606
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,114
Did you tell him

607
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,284
that I should be
without a burden like him?

608
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,045
You...

609
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,590
You don't know?

610
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,175
CAMELLIA

611
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,595
He should tell his mom
when he hears something like that.

612
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,722
What's wrong with that kid?

613
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,725
Why did he get brokenhearted
without telling you?

614
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,353
You're an adult. Why did you do that?

615
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,528
How can you of all people say that to him?

616
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,988
Dongbaek.

617
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,949
Of course, I didn't do it on purpose.

618
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,994
A burden? Come on, Ms. Kwak.

619
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,832
Why should he hear something like that?

620
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:08,043
I tried so hard
to never let him hear something...

621
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,753
Something like that...

622
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,255
He's a kid.

623
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,216
I'm sure he'll forget it soon.

624
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,885
I'll treat him even better
to help him forget.

625
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,430
The ladies around my town
told me I was my mom's burden

626
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,181
when I was only seven years old,

627
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,017
and I remember it to this day.

628
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,775
You can never make up for that.

629
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,154
He'll remember that for life.

630
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,370
You made a mistake.

631
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,374
How will you make up for that?

632
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,419
You like to be generous,

633
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,255
but you can't bear
to stay indebted, right?

634
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,510
Ms. Kwak.

635
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,305
IN FRONT OF HEUNG-SIK'S STORE

636
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,223
It wasn't him.

637
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,603
It wasn't him.

638
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:12,858
They rubbed every corner
of Heung-sik's mouth

639
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,903
with a cotton swab,
and it still wasn't him.

640
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:19,281
Then that DNA test is probably wrong!

641
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,410
I know it's Heung-sik!

642
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,081
Do you have something against him?

643
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,709
Do you think I'm being emotional?
I'm basing this on evidence.

644
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,463
Just take a look at the facts!

645
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,758
Who installed the security camera
at the bar?

646
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:43,305
He was also the one who cleaned
the building that caught on fire.

647
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,557
When you go in the other direction,
it's closed.

648
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:49,311
He knows all about that building,
and he was hiding there and watching me.

649
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,564
On top of that, he was the one
who fed the cats.

650
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:56,110
But they didn't detect any pesticide
from the cat food he had.

651
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,613
Yong-sik was curious to know
who fed the cats.

652
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:03,117
He probably stopped adding pesticides
because he knew I was looking into it.

653
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,663
A tiny hardware store has tons of tools
that can be used to kill people.

654
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:11,041
The wire that was used to kill
the skin therapist was there as well.

655
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,877
On top of that,

656
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,296
that truck was also Heung-sik's.

657
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,466
What more do you need?

658
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,468
Listen to me.

659
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,721
The composite sketch doesn't match,

660
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,974
and the DNA test
also came out as negative.

661
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,685
Science keeps telling us
that it isn't him.

662
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,565
-Do you know about science?
-My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

663
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:42,364
I know for a fact that it's Heung-sik!
I just know it, okay?

664
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,493
All the evidence is pointing at him!

665
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,870
Why can't you see that?

666
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:50,873
Are you a judge?

667
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,875
Do you think you're a judge?

668
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,044
Do you think you get to choose
who the culprit is?

669
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,266
That darn punk.

670
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:12,478
My gosh.

671
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,647
My gosh, come on.

672
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,817
Stop making me
do stuff secretly like that.

673
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:20,611
Why?

674
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:21,904
What's the matter?

675
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,157
One wasn't a match, but the other one was.

676
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,786
Where did you get that lock of hair?

677
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,252
Yes, we've confirmed the DNA.

678
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,338
I'll check where he is and get going.

679
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,048
Hurry!

680
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:44,301
I needed to think
why he stopped murdering people

681
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,637
instead of why he murdered them.

682
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,681
Joker stopped murdering people
five years ago.

683
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,017
And five years ago...

684
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,687
Around four o'clock today,
a man fell down a building

685
00:46:55,813 --> 00:47:00,234
trying to install the outdoor AC unit
for a shopping mall near the terminal.

686
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,697
ONGSAN HARDWARE

687
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,199
Five years ago,

688
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,035
someone got into an accident.

689
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,931
You've already killed

690
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,809
enough of my cats.

691
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,398
I told you not to bring home
any more cats!

692
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,942
What did you do to my cat?

693
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,819
I threw it down the building!

694
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,904
Every time you bring one,

695
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,365
I'll do the same thing
and throw it down.

696
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,741
Why are you crying?

697
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:54,204
People easily
tend to forget people's faces.

698
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:11,889
Some people are just hard to remember
regardless of how hard you try.

699
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,696
While he was away
in the dark for five years,

700
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,115
everyone had forgotten about him,

701
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,493
and everyone had excluded him for good.

702
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:40,042
What? Are you here to arrest me?

703
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:43,962
Yong-sik.

704
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:47,966
And everyone has parents of their own.

705
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:52,512
Yong-sik, I can...

706
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,265
I can take responsibility for everything.

707
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,224
I'm serious.

708
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:01,939
-Sir.
-Yong-sik.

709
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:06,068
Yong-sik, I promise...

710
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,278
I promise I'll always lock him inside.

711
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,823
I'll never forget to do that.

712
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,534
Yong-sik, please don't do this.

713
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,536
Let this go, just this once.

714
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:18,580
Let's go.

715
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,791
Yong-sik.

716
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,836
My dad...

717
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,007
is all I've got.

718
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,401
Sir.

719
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:49,861
Get up.

720
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:18,432
Contract workers in schools are
planning to carry on with their strike.

721
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,978
They're asking for a smaller gap
regarding the bonuses they receive.

722
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,355
They also want an increase
in their basic pay

723
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,983
and seniority allowance
based on the years of experience.

724
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,319
Seoul Office of Education
agrees with the need of change,

725
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,196
but they're showing different opinions.

726
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:38,535
WE WANT A WORLD WITH NO DISCRIMINATION

727
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,502
Do you know a first-grader
named Kang Pil-gu?

728
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,671
Do you guys know him?

729
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,173
He got transferred here.

730
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:53,925
-You mean Pickled Radish?
-He's probably in the cafeteria.

731
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,343
"Pickled Radish"?

732
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,230
Doesn't your uncle
live in Elegance Palace?

733
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,274
He lives with his uncle?

734
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,777
What's with your lunch
when you live there?

735
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,203
He apparently likes pickled radish.

736
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:25,123
I'm the best baseball player
among all of us.

737
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:28,293
Who cares what I eat?
I just need to join the Major League.

738
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,338
He even eats cup noodles
at the convenience store.

739
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,964
His mom must be really nice.

740
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:41,556
I had never seen my mom so angry before.

741
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,353
YEOKJAM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

742
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:49,773
Back then, I thought she was angry.

743
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,526
Get up.

744
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,156
-Get up.
-Why?

745
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,575
I don't want to go.

746
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:06,039
I don't want to go!

747
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,582
I'm not going to go!

748
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,460
But now that I think about it,
she was just sad.

749
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,837
I have training!

750
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,463
What's with you all of a sudden?

751
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,465
Are you going to live here?

752
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,466
Is there a problem?

753
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,552
I said I'm going to join
the Major League!

754
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,263
I want you to choose
between me and the Major League.

755
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,931
Why would you ask me to choose?

756
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:26,560
Pil-gu, I don't need you to become
an MLB player.

757
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,312
I would never swap you for Ryu Hyun-jin.

758
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,689
So I want you to choose.

759
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:33,108
Is it me or the Major League? Tell me.

760
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,944
-What do you want?
-Why won't you answer my question?

761
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,749
What's the matter with you?

762
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,294
Why do you keep walking on eggshells?

763
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,837
Why can't you be honest with me?

764
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,132
Who told you to walk on eggshells
and be shy about speaking up?

765
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,467
If you keep this up,
I'm not going to be your mom!

766
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,887
I might as well just leave!
I'll go ahead and leave!

767
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:05,765
To be honest,
I don't really want to be an MLB player!

768
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:10,437
Even if I go to the States,
I won't even be that happy!

769
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,147
Then why did you lie to me?

770
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,191
Why did you say you'll become
an MLB player?

771
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,859
What about you? Why did you lie?

772
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,277
When did I lie?

773
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,279
You told me that I'm all you need!

774
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,368
What kind of a mom gets married?

775
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,874
None of the other kids' moms get married!

776
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:37,380
Do you even know how it feels
to watch your own mom get married?

777
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,970
At least you get to marry
since you're an adult!

778
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,725
But I can't do that
because I'm a kid!

779
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,853
It's not like
I can go to the army, either!

780
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,440
I have nowhere to go!

781
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,696
This is so annoying!

782
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,033
Life is so annoying!

783
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,412
So hurry up and choose!

784
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,249
Are you going to come with me or not?

785
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,709
I'll go with you.

786
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,015
Dongbaek.

787
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,017
Wait. Where are you going?

788
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,769
How did you even come here?

789
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,284
I told you, right?

790
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:50,370
If they try to do something,
punch their nose. It's the nose.

791
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,296
Did you just punch my nose?

792
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,551
Did you know that Pil-gu eats

793
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,928
instant rice and pickled radish for lunch?

794
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:10,890
What?
I thought you applied for school lunch.

795
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:14,269
You don't get to say anything
regarding Pil-gu from now on.

796
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,437
You're out.

797
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,024
Dongbaek, if you keep doing this,
it'll only confuse him.

798
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,737
I don't need his uncle to worry about him.

799
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,490
Are you his uncle?

800
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:31,786
Were you worried he might get in trouble
if people found out he's your son?

801
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,581
How do you think I feel?
I can't even say I'm his dad.

802
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,207
Will you stop being emotional?

803
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,752
I won't let my son stay
at his uncle's house

804
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,880
and take instant rice and pickled radish
to school for lunch.

805
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,592
This is my first time.
You need to let me adjust to all this.

806
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,054
I'm not going to get swayed
by any of your bullshit anymore.

807
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,639
Listen to me carefully.

808
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:54,142
If you get involved in Pil-gu's life
one more time,

809
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:57,604
I'll file a paternity suit
and make the whole world find out,

810
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,606
so you'd better be prepared next time.

811
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,407
Dongbaek!

812
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,701
Pil-gu!

813
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:32,680
I was the one
whom I needed to destroy, not Joker.

814
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,894
Aren't you just sick and tired
of being intimidated all the time?

815
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:41,106
People keep acting up
because I'm nice to them.

816
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,901
I'm a person who's capable
of breaking someone's nose with my fist.

817
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,821
And I'm a fighter
who's able to protect my own kid.

818
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,407
Mom, you were like Conor McGregor.

819
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,700
Really?

820
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:56,454
I decided to become the strongest mother
in the world from now on.

821
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,377
THE SERIAL KILLER JOKER
GETS ARRESTED IN SIX YEARS

822
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,380
-What was your motive?
-Do you admit it?

823
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:07,549
-Do you admit to the charges?
-Over here!

824
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,175
-Wait!
-He said something!

825
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,718
Wait a second! What did you say?

826
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:13,138
-Can you say it a bit louder?
-You're so noisy!

827
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,143
Why is killing someone a big deal?

828
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:20,979
Stop causing a big fuss.

829
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:24,190
-Let's go.
-What was your motive?

830
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,900
-Please tell us!
-Why did you do it?

831
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,610
-Look over here!
-Wait!

832
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,364
Thank you.

833
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,996
It's apparently
an antisocial personality disorder

834
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,539
or something like that.

835
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,752
Who cares what goes on
in the mind of that psycho?

836
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,838
The most important thing

837
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:50,425
is the fact that we, the nice guys,
did our best to catch that jerk.

838
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,385
That's what this is all about.

839
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:56,264
Are you coming from a wedding?

840
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,560
You know, Parisians.
Even when there's a terrorist attack,

841
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:03,813
they still go to a cafe the next day
and drink coffee.

842
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:06,524
"There's absolutely nothing
you can take away from us."

843
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:09,444
That's what they're trying to show
as they drink that coffee.

844
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:10,820
Have you ever been to Paris?

845
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,244
You wanted to do an interview, didn't you?

846
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:24,209
I actually contributed
to this investigation, too.

847
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,252
Yes, I know.

848
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,091
Why isn't she picking up?

849
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:50,985
YONG-SIK

850
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,047
He's still such a baby.

851
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,720
Pil-gu has protected me all his life.

852
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,639
Mom, I caught a camel cricket!

853
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:23,101
-Mom, look.
-My gosh, just throw it outside!

854
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,228
-Look at it!
-Pil-gu, just throw it away!

855
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:28,314
Mom, you can go to the bathroom now.
You can poop now!

856
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,985
I'm sorry.

857
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:40,827
Pil-gu saved me by coming to this world.

858
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,538
And as he grew up,
he became a fighter to protect me.

859
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,331
Why do I need to protect you?

860
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,542
You should be protecting me.

861
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,544
I was becoming a little girl.

862
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,590
We won't be living together
once I grow old and get married, right?

863
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,258
But he was becoming an adult.

864
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,384
Isn't that how it is?

865
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:57,510
Grandma!

866
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:02,223
I didn't know that little kid was
just putting up with me.

867
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,727
I betrayed him and was busy being in love.

868
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,064
My gosh, Dongbaek!

869
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,317
What took you so long
to answer your phone?

870
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,485
My gosh, seriously.

871
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:18,573
I'm sorry.
I couldn't answer the phone earlier.

872
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:19,949
Did you see the news or not?

873
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:22,160
Tell me! Hurry up!

874
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,662
Thank you so much.

875
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,333
I would've been scared all my life

876
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,543
if it weren't for you.

877
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,796
I'll head over to your bar right now.

878
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,508
-So you'd better compliment me.
-No, don't come to the bar.

879
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:42,472
I'll meet you at the place
where I first fell for you.

880
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:44,849
What?

881
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,317
Dongbaek!

882
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,451
My gosh, why is he always
smiling like that?

883
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:10,541
ONGSAN

884
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,135
Is this where you fell for me?

885
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,848
What was that kiss for?

886
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,102
When I saw you sitting here,

887
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:32,939
you have no idea how emotional I became.

888
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,402
Back then, my heart fluttered like crazy

889
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,947
just by sitting next to you.

890
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:46,786
But now, we're close enough
to kiss each other.

891
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:50,957
This is practically

892
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,042
a miracle.

893
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,922
Why would you kiss me like that?
Seriously. That was so unnecessary.

894
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:02,677
What's the matter?

895
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,762
Is it because I kissed you?

896
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:08,683
My gosh, you used to kiss me first.
Why are you so shy all of a sudden?

897
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,894
My gosh, how am I going to do this?

898
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,526
What am I going to do?

899
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:21,404
I can't say it.

900
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:24,365
What? What's wrong?

901
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,200
Did something happen again?

902
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:39,922
My gosh, I can't...

903
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,008
I didn't want to cry
when I say this to you.

904
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:49,015
I'm so bad at saying goodbye.

905
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:01,402
Yong-sik.

906
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,323
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

907
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,659
What kind of nonsense
are you going to say this time?

908
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:20,838
My gosh, who dumps someone
and cries like a baby at the same time?

909
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:41,275
I don't want to hurt Pil-gu
just so I can be happy.

910
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:44,111
Does he hate me that much?

911
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:46,280
Is he totally against me?

912
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:49,492
I'd rather feel better if he said that.

913
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,035
But he keeps...

914
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,831
He keeps walking on eggshells.
He's starting to become like me.

915
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,754
Dating was never an option.

916
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,715
Pil-gu always comes first,

917
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:07,885
but I was being so immature.

918
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:10,721
It's okay.

919
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:15,726
I'll try harder and win brownie points.
Don't worry.

920
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,978
I thought...

921
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:20,189
things would work that way.

922
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:27,280
But that's just what we want.

923
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:43,546
Ever since

924
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,923
Pil-gu began talking,

925
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:48,968
he told me that he'll protect me.

926
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,514
And the fact that he thinks that way

927
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,850
makes me feel so sorry and troubled.

928
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:04,775
My gosh.

929
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,695
Why do you have to be...

930
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,740
so adamant?

931
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,744
Pil-gu's still a little kid.

932
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,247
What matters to me the most

933
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:22,293
is to make sure Pil-gu grows up
to be a happy and confident kid.

934
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,302
I thought timings and variables

935
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:33,971
were all just a bunch of bullshit.

936
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,435
I already knew what I needed to say

937
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:41,520
to make this kind Hulk give up on me.

938
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,484
I just want...

939
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:50,112
to be a mom.

940
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:53,741
I don't want to be just a woman.

941
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,495
I want to be happy as a mom.

942
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:05,878
My gosh.

943
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:11,050
You're so mean.

944
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,138
What am I supposed to say...

945
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,311
to that?

946
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:24,814
There's nothing you can do.

947
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:26,899
We'll just have to break up.

948
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:36,158
I didn't know how I was going to break up
with Dongbaek,

949
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:38,995
but I didn't know
how to hold onto her, either.

950
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:11,068
That's how my mom's
miraculous spring day came to an end.

951
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:17,992
And with her love and affection,
I finally grew up.

952
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:19,285
Yes, I ate.

953
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,120
Why do you always ask if I ate or not?

954
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:25,207
Yes, okay.
Mom, I'm a little busy right now.

955
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,917
So stop calling me.

956
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,713
Okay, I'll be right there.

957
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:08,918
What do you mean?

958
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:15,174
They're all edited. Those jealous brats
edited those photos!

959
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,052
She was awfully lonely.

960
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,222
Don't leave Dongbaek's side.

961
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,349
I must live with you for 20 years.

962
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:27,269
A death benefit won't make up
for all those years. So just live.

963
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:29,522
If you miss this chance,
you won't make it.

964
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:30,523
No, I won't do it.
