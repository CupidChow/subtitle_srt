00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:30,989
WHEN THE CAMELLIA BLOOMS

2
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,883
CAMELLIA

3
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,473
WHEN THE CAMELLIA BLOOMS

4
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:30,131
POLICE

5
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,801
Someone else was killed here
many years ago, you know.

6
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,511
Isn't it the prankster?

7
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,889
-Gosh, what are you talking about?
-Nothing happened for a while.

8
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:38,932
Is it starting again?

9
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,034
Keep out.

10
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:35,029
THE WOMAN WITH THE GERMANIUM BRACELET

11
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,901
What's going on?

12
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,778
-They're opening a flower shop.
-A flower shop?

13
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,655
Why open a flower shop in a food alley?

14
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,661
CAMELLIA

15
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,916
I wonder if they'll do well.

16
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,460
Ongsan is a tough place for newbies.

17
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,045
Have you seen the owner?

18
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,239
What? You think she's pretty?

19
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,867
-No, not at all.
-Pretty, my foot.

20
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,623
Close your mouth.

21
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,960
Oh, I'll do that.

22
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,129
Thank you.

23
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,673
She's a mom.

24
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,758
She must be a newlywed.

25
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,720
-What a pretty young mom.
-Yes, what a nice young lady.

26
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,613
-Are you going somewhere?
-Hello.

27
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,164
-She was swearing, wasn't she?
-Yes.

28
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,791
-Yong-sik must've caused trouble again.
-I'm sure he did.

29
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,586
I heard Yong-sik got stabbed.

30
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,672
-Is the kitchen this way?
-Yes, it's at the back.

31
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,468
-The water from the tap looks rusty.
-Okay.

32
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,097
I guess it didn't need windows
when it was a storage for dried seafood,

33
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,558
but it'd be nice to have a window
over there.

34
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,686
The place is 800,000 won a month
because there are no windows.

35
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,689
Still, I think it needs a window
because it's too dark in here.

36
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,984
When you rent this huge space for
such cheap rent, you're expected to pay

37
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,944
for any renovations out of your pocket.

38
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,115
You, as a tenant,
can take care of it yourself.

39
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,828
Let me tell you this about myself.
I love tenants who are self-reliant.

40
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,914
I see, self-reliant...

41
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,918
By the way,

42
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,670
where's your husband?

43
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,757
I need to talk to him about
the utility bills and the kitchen sink.

44
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,426
Does he work on weekends?

45
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,972
I'd prefer to speak to your husband
regarding the repairs--

46
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,432
I am self-reliant.

47
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,351
What?

48
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,479
You can speak to me regarding everything.

49
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,526
What's wrong?
Did Yong-sik get himself in trouble again?

50
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,445
-Did he beat someone up?
-Is he a thug or what?

51
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,991
Enough of that rice gimmick.

52
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,785
Make a talisman for me instead.

53
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,036
What do you want on it?

54
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,248
Help me quit this.

55
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,584
I've been taking it for the past 20 years,
which is a long time.

56
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,295
I can make a hundred talismans for you,

57
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,132
but even shamans can't change your fate.

58
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,801
Had Yong-sik been born in ancient times,

59
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,721
Joseon's entire system
would've been turned upside down.

60
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:15,935
You always seem to think
that my son would've been lowborn.

61
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,188
What I mean is,
I just think Yong-sik would've taught

62
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,607
all those useless aristocrats
a serious lesson.

63
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,110
Oh, dear.

64
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,820
Would his fate have changed

65
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,699
had I never asked him
to go to the bank that day

66
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,285
to pay the utility bills?

67
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,292
We need to check the accounts
for the third and fourth quarters.

68
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,341
This is Baekdu Marinated Crab.

69
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,301
Yes, where?

70
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,512
The police station?

71
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,514
Yong-sik is there now?

72
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,850
What? The bank?

73
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,530
You're such a troublemaker.

74
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,492
I heard it's on the news now.

75
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,289
When the armed robber
was threatening the bank employees,

76
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,543
a brave civilian started tussling with him
in an attempt to take him down.

77
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,087
The civilian pulled out
his insulated lunch container.

78
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,715
Despite the dangerous situation
where he could have been shot,

79
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,135
he fought the robber
without any hesitation.

80
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,222
The robber aimed the gun at him after...

81
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,683
Are you the hero of Ongsan or what?

82
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,394
I packed lunch
for your after-school studying hours,

83
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,354
not so you'd beat up
a bank robber with it.

84
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:31,988
Are you saying I have to pay
for that bank robber's dental treatment?

85
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,951
We call it excessive use of force, and
some might say it's a human rights issue.

86
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,787
Look, can't you see
that he's wearing his school uniform?

87
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,331
How could a bank robber
demand compensation

88
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,834
after getting beaten up
by a high school kid?

89
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,962
The thing is,
even though your son is only 17--

90
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,880
I get that he's a robber,

91
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,800
but look at this face.
I mean, just look at these eyes.

92
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,386
I'm sure he saw
the lunch container in my son's hands,

93
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,513
so he should've been careful.

94
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,726
Why let a high school kid break his teeth
when he had a gun?

95
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,395
And why must I pay for his treatment?

96
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,649
You moron, why are you eating this?

97
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,443
-I bet I'm the only woman...
-Jeez, Mom!

98
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:14,363
...in the entire country that has had to
pay for a bank robber's dental implants.

99
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,032
-Let go!
-Yong-sik's life itself

100
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,826
has been war against crime.

101
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,915
Mister,

102
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,126
did you lose your key or what?

103
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,504
Once, he caught a motorcycle thief
while peeing on the street.

104
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:47,188
Excuse me, sir. I just saw something.

105
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,689
I'm sorry.

106
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,858
What?

107
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,736
Gosh.

108
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,532
And why did he have to see a pickpocket
while driving his taxi?

109
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,669
Oh, someone was home.
I kept calling, but no one picked up.

110
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,754
-Unit 401, right?
-Yes.

111
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,589
This package is for you.

112
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,593
The dog is barking nonstop.

113
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,932
Why are you wearing gloves
in this heatwave?

114
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,063
-Are you sure it's for you?
-Yes.

115
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,107
Just a second. I forgot to check.

116
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,608
-Are you Kim--
-Yes.

117
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,193
-You're Kim A-reum?
-Yes.

118
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,113
-What?
-What?

119
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,615
What?

120
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,118
Jeez!

121
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,582
That young man beat him up...

122
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,836
Yong-sik, can you please call the police?

123
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,715
We're always here for you.

124
00:11:56,507 --> 00:12:00,636
When I got up there, I saw
that little piece of shit walking out.

125
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,388
Gosh, talk about good timing.

126
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:07,059
I just got a bad feeling the moment I saw
that little piece of shit.

127
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,354
Well, he's not that "little."

128
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,733
We take live ammunition
when we're arresting pricks like him.

129
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,736
But you keep catching them
with your bare hands.

130
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,488
It makes us look like losers.
Are you messing with us?

131
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,199
Will I receive another award?

132
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:27,747
RECOGNITION AWARD
APPRECIATION AWARD

133
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,707
Yong-sik will become what?

134
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,876
But why would he?

135
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,714
THE 243RD POLICE OFFICERS
APPOINTMENT CEREMONY

136
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,634
I just...

137
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,137
I just caught him because I saw him.

138
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,932
What did you think the moment you saw

139
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,392
the escaped convict?

140
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,438
Well...

141
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,940
Nothing, really.

142
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,233
You see,

143
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,777
I'm not the type

144
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,529
that thinks a lot.

145
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,156
When I see

146
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,658
a criminal,

147
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,911
my body reacts automatically.

148
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,704
I see, when you see criminals?

149
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,458
That's right.
I mean, the second I spot them,

150
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,710
my body automatically...

151
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,088
Gosh, that fool. Why is he saying
the same thing over and over?

152
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,842
I feel something bubbling in my chest,
and my body automatically...

153
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,137
You're probably confused as to whether
you should be happy about this or not,

154
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,473
but what matters is
that he's now a civil servant.

155
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,183
If Yong-sik couldn't join

156
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,229
the police force, he'd end up doing
something ridiculously stupid.

157
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,439
So I knocked. When the door opened...

158
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,107
Aren't you busy?

159
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,236
-You must have a lot of time to kill.
-I took today off.

160
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,946
Why did you take the day off?

161
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,240
I wanted to be here
at this historic moment.

162
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,951
They say that you're bound to poop soon
if you keep farting.

163
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,911
-He was wearing a hat like this.
-You see,

164
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,872
I knew this day would come
when Yong-sik caught the bank robber

165
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,207
with his lunch container.

166
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,918
-I thought he must be...
-Well...

167
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,631
Don't get too close to my son, please.

168
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,841
With the frying pan...

169
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,094
He insisted on working in Seoul,

170
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,305
saying he must date a woman
who was born and raised in Seoul.

171
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,683
That's why he moved there,

172
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:14,478
but he's still not married.
And why did he get his arm stitched up?

173
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:18,023
Why jump at someone holding a knife
when he had nothing?

174
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,233
Don't worry.

175
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:24,488
That temper of his will be tamed
when he meets the right person.

176
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:25,948
A girl?

177
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,992
Do you think he'll get married?

178
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,536
A rabbit

179
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,455
will meet a dragon.

180
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,334
My gosh, it probably means
that Yong-sik will soar high.

181
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,920
I guess he'll meet a girl
who's like an adorable rabbit.

182
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,548
No. What I'm saying is,
Yong-sik will meet a dragon.

183
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,757
What? Come again?

184
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,759
Yong-sik is a rabbit.

185
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,971
Jeez, are you drunk?

186
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,389
Then where is this dragon?

187
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,058
In the east.

188
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,144
Darn it. You say that all the time.

189
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,730
I don't even know which direction is east.

190
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,692
That way. That's east.

191
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,951
I came by to say hello.

192
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,413
I brought rice cakes.

193
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,041
CAMELLIA

194
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,792
I'm with you.

195
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,794
You definitely need a window.

196
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,172
How could a flower shop
not have any windows?

197
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,007
I guess you'll mainly sell camellias.

198
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,593
Oh, camellias...

199
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,970
I wonder if a flower shop
would do well on this alley.

200
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,096
Gosh, of course.

201
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,807
I buy carnations once a year.

202
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,225
Goodness.

203
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,354
It's actually not a flower shop.

204
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,271
What?

205
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,774
-It's a bar.
-What?

206
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,569
It's a bar called Camellia.

207
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,156
I see.

208
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:54,328
Are you opening a pub with your husband?

209
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,164
No, I'm doing it alone.

210
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,041
Alone?

211
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,336
-What does your husband do?
-Respect her privacy.

212
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,422
I don't have a husband.

213
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,840
You don't have a husband?

214
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,760
Are you divorced? Or are you a widow?

215
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,096
No, I've never been married.

216
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,723
Oh, really?

217
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,767
Then who's this?

218
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,602
Is he your nephew?

219
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,772
No, he's my son.

220
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,405
You can have a child
without getting married, you know.

221
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:30,948
I mean, it happens.

222
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,034
Right, it happens.

223
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,288
-Feel free to come by anytime.
-Yes, of course.

224
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,873
I love beer.

225
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,718
I'm saying, how could
a single mother open a bar?

226
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,346
Is there a law that forbids single mothers
from opening bars?

227
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,975
Then widows shouldn't be allowed
to sell marinated crab either.

228
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,602
I sell soju along with marinated crab,
you know.

229
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,855
You probably can't stand me.

230
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,899
No, that's not what I meant.

231
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,318
Is having a husband
something to be that proud of?

232
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,319
I never said that.

233
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,655
Stay-at-home husbands
are useless here in Ongsan.

234
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,908
All they can do is help out
at the parking lot.

235
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,368
This way.

236
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,663
It's still better than not having one.

237
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,170
I only speak the truth.

238
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,380
Chan-suk.

239
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,008
I want my money back.

240
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,885
Pay me back soon.

241
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,846
As soon as you can, okay?

242
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,607
CABBAGE

243
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,275
CAMELLIA

244
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,485
Thank you.

245
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:54,698
By the way, would it be possible
to only buy half a box of the cabbage?

246
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,492
Sorry?

247
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,038
-Nothing, never mind.
-It's not a flower shop.

248
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,916
Men are practically useless
here in Ongsan.

249
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,626
All they do is break bumpers.

250
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,846
Seung-yeop, what are you doing?
Get ready to open the restaurant.

251
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,139
DAUGHTERS' MARINATED CRAB

252
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,432
Hurry.

253
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,393
Why did my mom even have me

254
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,146
if she was going to give everything
to her daughters?

255
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,856
How many pineapples did you sell?

256
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,319
Not that many. I sold a couple.

257
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,113
MARINATED CRAB

258
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,197
MARINATED CRAB

259
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,032
Whether it's the recipe or restaurant,

260
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,618
it's handed down
to either daughters or daughters-in-law.

261
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,882
Get fried chicken on your way home.

262
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,259
The spicy one, right?

263
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,052
-Half and half.
-Okay.

264
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,012
When your wife is your boss,

265
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,764
you basically have to work 24-7.

266
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,823
Coming!

267
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,075
Who'd want to have drinks
at the restaurant

268
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,036
where they've been working all day,
smelling the marinated crab?

269
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,000
We don't even have a place where we can go
and relax with a couple of drinks.

270
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,215
But apparently, it's not a flower shop.

271
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,650
CAMELLIA

272
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,404
Have you ever seen
a newbie surviving here in Ongsan?

273
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,032
I'll be impressed
if she lasts three months.

274
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:03,202
CAMELLIA

275
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,871
Thanks to the joys and sorrows
of the people of Ongsan,

276
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,998
Camellia survived for six years.

277
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,083
CAMELLIA

278
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,437
6 YEARS LATER

279
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,606
CAMELLIA

280
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,994
What are you talking about?

281
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,540
I told you I'm at a funeral now.

282
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,048
How did it go? Nice.

283
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,844
SO DELICIOUS
I LOVE SOJU BOMBS

284
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,516
SUPER BASIC ENGLISH VOCABULARY
BASIC ENGLISH

285
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,063
ONGSAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL NEWSLETTER

286
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,148
Mom, have you decided
on your English name?

287
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,986
Do I have to attend
this counseling session?

288
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,946
All my classmates' moms are coming.

289
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,864
You're going to skip it again?

290
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,952
Is your teacher a foreigner?

291
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,954
Does your teacher only speak English?

292
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,623
What do you want your English name to be?

293
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,251
My English name?

294
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,628
Diana.

295
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,630
Let's go with Diana.

296
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,299
-Diana?
-Yes.

297
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:44,011
She was a queen of England.

298
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,097
Wait, was she a princess
or a queen consort?

299
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,934
Anyway, she was very stylish and smart.

300
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,979
-She looked very smart.
-Mom, do you want to look smart?

301
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,857
Dongbaek! Can we get more popcorn?

302
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,941
Of course!

303
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,115
You said you'd meet
Princess Diana in Seoul,

304
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:09,369
but you got demoted before you could
even meet the love of your life.

305
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,621
Why did you get demoted?

306
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,707
I got transferred here, okay?

307
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,209
Let's not call it a demotion, please.

308
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,669
Bullshit.

309
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,630
Why punch someone when you're a cop?

310
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,508
And why did you have to punch him
in front of cameras?

311
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,011
-Look over here.
-Over here!

312
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,596
-Is it true?
-Say a few words!

313
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,306
-Make a comment.
-Say something!

314
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,724
How do you feel right now?

315
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,476
Why did you kill your girlfriend?

316
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,521
She never behaved herself.

317
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,733
I hit her because she deserved it.

318
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,362
-What happened?
-Did he just smack him?

319
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,697
Just go, you prick.

320
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,115
Did you just hit me?

321
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,658
Why did you hit me?

322
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,036
Because you deserve it!

323
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,122
-Yong-sik! Stop.
-Calm down.

324
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,083
ABUSIVE MAN KILLS HIS GIRLFRIEND

325
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,043
WELL DONE,
I LIKE ABUSIVE COPS LIKE HIM

326
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,961
BUT THE RESULT WAS A DEMOTION

327
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,672
Do you think
you're an MMA fighter or what?

328
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,719
You see, I have no regrets whatsoever
regarding the knee strike.

329
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,805
Sure, whatever.

330
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,767
But I'm sad about moving back here
before meeting my Princess Diana in Seoul.

331
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,436
Why does he even like
Princess Diana so much?

332
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,773
My ideal woman

333
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,735
is someone who is smart,
graceful, and intelligent.

334
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,029
You know what I mean.

335
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,281
Simply put, someone

336
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:32,202
who looks like she always came in fifth
or higher on exams back in school.

337
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,621
That's the kind of woman
I'm talking about.

338
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,582
Are you hungry for intelligence?

339
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,669
Ideally, someone who lives in Seoul,
not in the countryside.

340
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,963
That vibe, you know?

341
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:46,091
Then why'd you get transferred here
before you could even date one?

342
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,384
The strange thing is,

343
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,679
women who are Seoul natives
aren't the only ones in the city.

344
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,472
-What?
-Strangely enough,

345
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:56,601
every woman I hit it off with
was from the countryside.

346
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,855
What's so strange about it?

347
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,441
Country bumpkins can recognize each other.

348
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,446
Gosh, come on.

349
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:11,283
I probably shouldn't say this
in front of the people from my hometown...

350
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,286
but in my case,

351
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,788
everyone thinks I'm from Seoul.

352
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,336
Okay, sure. Let's have a welcoming party.

353
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,506
There is a Diana in Ongsan too.

354
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,885
Gosh, I don't go to such bars
where the ladies are.

355
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,262
Goodness, that place isn't like that.

356
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,604
Are you really close to her?

357
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,856
Well, we are close...

358
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,484
like friends.

359
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,319
-Friends?
-Figures.

360
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,155
You're the biggest VIP here, Mr. No.

361
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:54,576
He's probably the only one
who drinks Chivas Regal in Ongsan.

362
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,827
Of course.

363
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,622
Hey, Dongbaek. I'll take another Chivas.

364
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,998
Oh, and you know...

365
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,920
Do you have any peanuts?

366
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,630
Do you want more peanuts?

367
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,633
Yes, I brought
prestigious assemblymen of our district,

368
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,968
so give me some peanuts on the house.

369
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,848
You must be close if you're asking
for something on the house.

370
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,852
Peanuts

371
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,064
are 8,000 won. I'll bring it to you.

372
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,652
Forget it. You can go.

373
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,575
I thought you two were friends.
I thought you were close to her.

374
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,414
Sir.

375
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:42,749
Yes?

376
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,834
Why do you call my mom "Dongbaek"?

377
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,380
Well, that's the name of this place.

378
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,507
Then do you call Jun-gi's mom "Crabs"

379
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,842
and Dae-seong's mom "Pork Belly"?

380
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,096
What? Wait a minute.

381
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,682
Then what should I call her?

382
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:02,352
She's the CEO here. Call her CEO.

383
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,146
What? Okay, fine.

384
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,567
And if you ever
speak casually to her again,

385
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,652
I won't give you free refills
on corn puffs.

386
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,700
I thought he might say he'll beat me up.

387
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,577
How did a softy like Dongbaek

388
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,495
give birth to a smarty pants like him?

389
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,790
He must have taken after his dad.

390
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,003
All right, Ji-seon.

391
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,880
You're eating so well.

392
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,716
Oh, yes. We...

393
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,593
We do it together. I help out a lot.

394
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,344
ABOUT YOUR BEAUTIFUL WIFE, MRS. KANG

395
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,887
I LOVE YOU, MY JESSICA

396
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,472
Come on, tell them.

397
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,268
Oh, yes. She's beautiful, really.

398
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:48,732
She always makes me say, "Do you
think looking pretty is everything?"

399
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,531
Do you want me to wash it?

400
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,285
Viewers have been complaining on the board

401
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,580
that you always pretend to eat
and never actually eat.

402
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,834
Do you have to film us eating this?

403
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,753
Let's cut it here.

404
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,761
UPLOADING

405
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,722
#BODYCHECK, #DIETER, #BUT_ATE_CAKE,
#I'M_MRS_KANG_JONG-RYEOL

406
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,444
How can you be so selfish?

407
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,116
If you're going to eat instant noodles,
eat it after I go to my mom's.

408
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,328
Do you have to eat it now?
And did you have to add the eggs?

409
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:46,748
I have to eat to go to train.
At least let me eat some instant noodles.

410
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,833
Gosh, you're so selfish.

411
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,961
Am I the one who's selfish, or is it you?

412
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,254
Your husband's an athlete.

413
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,340
How can you stop me from eating at home?

414
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,134
If you wanted a supportive wife,
why did you marry me?

415
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,803
I didn't ask you to be one.

416
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:03,306
Just let me be
when I try to cook for myself.

417
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,141
I never asked you to cook for me.

418
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,268
Do you think I married you
to cook for you?

419
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,145
No,

420
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,773
you married me to take pictures.

421
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,530
You're going from building 101 to 103.
You don't need a mask.

422
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:19,823
You aren't that famous.

423
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,159
Even the idol star who lives
in building 105 doesn't use one.

424
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,161
Tell me next time when there's a shooting.

425
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,414
If they come so suddenly, I won't do it.

426
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,832
Do you think they're stupid?

427
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,126
They already noticed that
we don't live together.

428
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,128
That's why you need to step up your game.

429
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,380
With what? My acting?

430
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,757
Jong-ryeol,

431
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,592
it's me, Jessica.

432
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,302
And what does that mean?

433
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,512
I'm a public figure.

434
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,974
Why are you a public figure?

435
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,310
Did you see that check mark
on my social media account?

436
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,105
I have 77,000 followers.

437
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,818
Right, you upload what you eat,
how you sleep, and how you wash up.

438
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,361
I'd follow you out of curiosity.

439
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,488
And...

440
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,824
will you please put on some clothes?

441
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,826
You must think those tights are sexy,

442
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,746
but it makes you look like
a black lollipop.

443
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,372
Why do you care if I get undressed?

444
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,292
I don't take off my clothes for you,
so mind your own business.

445
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,003
Or should I say, in your dreams?

446
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,591
Hey, all you are is pretty, aren't you?

447
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,342
That's all who you are.

448
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,182
Why does that kid cry so much?

449
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,226
"That kid"?
She's not someone else's child.

450
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,562
Is she?

451
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,573
Why is life so tough?

452
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,576
Why do I...

453
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,079
still feel like...

454
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,170
Daddy is the delinquent.

455
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,506
The delinquent.

456
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,478
What's wrong? Why are you sulky again?

457
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,275
What's wrong?

458
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,236
Really?

459
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,206
Ongsan Police Station
couldn't even catch Joker!

460
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,290
Wake up!

461
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,251
-Wake up!
-Good work.

462
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,252
Goodbye.

463
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,962
We cannot live like this!

464
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,548
What's with them?
Did Joker kill someone again?

465
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,757
-Wake up!
-Wake up!

466
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,218
-Joker has been quiet for five years.
-Wake up.

467
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,512
But someone made a movie on it
that drew 10 million.

468
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,763
A movie?

469
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,765
It's titled Don't Be a Joke.

470
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,600
-Oh, that one.
-Wake up!

471
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,727
Ongsan was recently known
for marinated crabs,

472
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,438
but five to six years ago,
it was infamous for Joker.

473
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,523
Wake up!

474
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,608
Our land prices finally began to soar,

475
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,194
and we almost got a new image
with marinated crabs.

476
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,863
Why did he film a movie

477
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,782
-with the Ongsan serial murder?
-Wake up!

478
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,119
They're going to ruin the marinated crabs
if they filmed the movie.

479
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,705
Why do you suddenly bring the crabs up?

480
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,374
How can he be so selfish about his movie?

481
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,293
What about my marinated crabs?

482
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,129
The director of that movie is a jerk.

483
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,089
Does that idiot hold a grudge against us?

484
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,884
Come on, Mom. Stop swearing.

485
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,135
Exactly.

486
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,680
So why can't they catch Joker to this day?

487
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,099
You're right.
Why can't you catch that petty killer?

488
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,351
He may look like a joke,
but he's not petty.

489
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,021
I mean, his name itself is a joke.

490
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,981
He's named Joker.

491
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,817
That psycho left a message
whenever he killed someone.

492
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,152
It said, "Don't be a joke."

493
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,529
And what does he mean by that?

494
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,948
He just randomly said, "Don't be a joke."

495
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,826
Should I catch him?

496
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,163
Chief Byeon, you still have the case file.

497
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,165
You were demoted because of that.

498
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,083
I wasn't demoted. I was reappointed.

499
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,003
Why would you take a look
at the case file for Joker?

500
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,088
Mom, it's me.

501
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,342
I have a certain power
to end crimes no matter where--

502
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,094
Forget that.
Go to Yeong-sim's garlic field.

503
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,055
Yeong-sim's? Why?

504
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,723
Okay, fine.

505
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,643
-You'll get sick if you leave it out.
-I can do it. I'll do it.

506
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,854
-My gosh.
-My goodness.

507
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,733
Anyway, what did you find
in her field? Money?

508
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,193
A body?

509
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,571
Her dog might give birth to puppies
any day. Take a look at that.

510
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,407
Why should I care
if a dog is giving birth?

511
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:35,703
The poultry farm's dog
apparently impregnated her dog.

512
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,790
You need to be sharp and decide
if the puppies belong

513
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,959
to the poultry farm or to Yeong-sim.

514
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,044
My gosh, we have to be sharp for nothing.

515
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,087
What did you say?

516
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,215
Do you think
Yeong-sim's property rights are a joke?

517
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,383
Forget that.

518
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,093
Now that I got demoted...

519
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,552
No, reappointed,

520
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,138
I'm going to go after Joker.

521
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,558
Hey, will you keep saying that?

522
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,728
It's not the time for me
to go around finding out the truth

523
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,480
about the birth of some puppies.

524
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,649
Then what time is it?

525
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,776
To catch Joker,

526
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,736
we should be like CSI: Miami.

527
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,197
How can you become someone in CSI?

528
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,865
Not even in your next life.

529
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,493
There's a place I always visit
when I go to a new town.

530
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,995
Go to Yeong-sim's place.

531
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:21,499
I always go to the hall of knowledge of
that town, the bookstore. But where is it?

532
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,543
Why should you go to a bookstore?

533
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,420
Chief Byeon.

534
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,466
Henry Ward Beecher said,

535
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,095
"Where is human nature so weak
as in the bookstore?"

536
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,515
Hey, do you have any idea
what that Henry something did?

537
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,352
He's a higher being,

538
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,354
a guy who has quoted sayings.

539
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,315
You should stop using famous quotes

540
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,652
and lurking around bookstores, okay?

541
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,737
Why not?

542
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,115
You are

543
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,535
a type who looks much cooler

544
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,789
when you get physical
instead of trying to use your brains.

545
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,292
You know, an upright person.
An upright style.

546
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,835
My goodness.

547
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:10,173
Man, it gets a bit too awkward
to bring this up myself.

548
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,594
People think I studied humanities.

549
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,306
Go.

550
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,641
You can go to the bookstore.

551
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,310
I'm serious.

552
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,432
Darn it, how are Koreans
supposed to investigate?

553
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,786
Just like what Henry said,

554
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,914
did the bookstore weaken my nature?

555
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,543
If I had met her
at a marinated crab store,

556
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,670
what could have changed?

557
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,297
No,

558
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,882
to be honest...

559
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,097
I was smitten by her

560
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,808
only because she was pretty.

561
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,174
I can't believe
there's a pervert at a bookstore.

562
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,307
Her historic first words...

563
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,896
shot Cupid's arrows into my heart.

564
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,778
PREGNANCY, FIRST TIME BREASTFEEDING

565
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,535
Excuse me.

566
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,787
My first historic words were...

567
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,624
I'm a bachelor.

568
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,921
I'm a real bachelor. A real one.

569
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,298
Oh, my shirt.

570
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,176
That could happen.

571
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,346
Oh, that's not what...

572
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,889
Not in that sense.

573
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,104
-He must be insane.
-Excuse me.

574
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,316
I'll put these right here.

575
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:22,740
Yes.

576
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,369
Here's my philosophy, so listen up.

577
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,996
It's not "No money, no service."

578
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,790
It's "No manners, no service."

579
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,125
She's so fluent.

580
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,669
And no peanuts for No Gyu-tae.

581
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,380
No Gyu-tae will
never get peanuts in his life.

582
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,132
Don't take appointments from him, okay?

583
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:49,141
HONG JA-YEONG LAW OFFICE

584
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,856
HONG JA-YEONG LAW OFFICE

585
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,695
Seung-yeop.

586
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,533
There's a law office downtown, right?

587
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,702
Why? Did you get in trouble again?

588
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,120
Is someone going to sue you?

589
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,623
If she can read English books,

590
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,792
she probably studied abroad, right?

591
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,546
Will someone who studied abroad sue you?
Kang Pil-gu! Keep your eyes on the ball!

592
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,508
I saw this lady today.

593
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,884
Is she pretty?

594
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,888
But she seemed like
she's way out of my league.

595
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,181
Is she pretty?

596
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,728
She's a lawyer.

597
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,354
A lawyer?

598
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,565
She's a lawyer, and she's pretty?

599
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:41,736
I think I met the real Princess Diana.

600
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,487
Princess Diana is going to sue you?

601
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,826
CAMELLIA, DONGBAEK

602
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,119
LAWYER HONG JA-YEONG

603
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,258
I didn't want to come all the way here,

604
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:08,387
but Mr. No won't pick up his phone,

605
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,348
and he won't give me what he owes.

606
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,640
You must be Dongbaek.

607
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,354
You don't have

608
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,356
any eye wrinkles.

609
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,066
Pardon?

610
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:22,943
THREE DAYS AGO

611
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,489
Don't you use tens of such products?

612
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:32,036
That's the most expensive one
with the least volume.

613
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,205
This is it?

614
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,999
-What?
-This is it?

615
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,668
Goodness.

616
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,004
Should I have bought you a handbag?

617
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:49,553
NOT FOR SALE

618
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:52,973
BUY 100ML, GET 20ML FREE!

619
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,393
For the first time,
my husband bought me eye cream.

620
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,686
But he gave the 100ml eye cream
to someone else

621
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,939
and gave me the 20ml free gift.

622
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,275
Team Doosan ended up
winning the first half of the game...

623
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,944
CAMELLIA, DONGBAEK

624
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,696
"Dongbaek."

625
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,283
I think I know
who got the 100ml eye cream.

626
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,160
Honey.

627
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,330
Do you know what I specialize in?

628
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,333
I'm a divorce attorney, you know.

629
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,377
So what? You want a divorce?

630
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,255
All I do at work is gather evidence

631
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,549
to prove that my client's spouse
holds liability.

632
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,219
Everything can act as evidence
starting from receipts

633
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,763
to navigation records.

634
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,350
Why are you telling me that?

635
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,479
Just in case you forgot what my job is.

636
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,233
I'm No Gyu-tae's wife.

637
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,485
Pardon?

638
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,198
Hello, ma'am.
This is my first time meeting you.

639
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,368
I rarely meet the tenants.

640
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,744
Right.

641
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:00,249
If I knew beforehand,
I would've brought some juice or...

642
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:04,962
By the way, don't you know
how to finish your sentence?

643
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,631
Pardon?

644
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,633
I noticed that you keep having trouble

645
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,302
finishing your sentences.

646
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,803
Did I do that?

647
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,723
I didn't realize--

648
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,600
See? You did it again.

649
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,310
Oh, I did it again.

650
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:20,644
I'm sorry.

651
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,937
You must think it's cute.

652
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:25,191
No, that's not what I think.

653
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,609
But...

654
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,945
My husband goes there often, right?

655
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,990
Seems like he goes there
five times a week.

656
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,242
Yes, well...

657
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:39,413
I keep telling him
that it's not good to drink too much.

658
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,874
So I told him not to come too often.

659
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,626
But he still shows up?

660
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,253
Why do you think so?

661
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,014
Should I tell him not to come?

662
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,643
No, be nice to him.

663
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,521
You should always smile
and be kind to him.

664
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,648
After all, that's your job.

665
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,070
I'm telling you to do your job.

666
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,200
Well...

667
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,119
It's not my job to smile.

668
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,502
What are you doing here?

669
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,671
Let's talk outside.

670
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,589
CONGRATULATIONS

671
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,716
-Hear me out here.
-My goodness.

672
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,804
-Thank you.
-Mr. No owns all the land

673
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,890
starting from the mill in the market
up until the mud flat.

674
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,394
I only own about five buildings.

675
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,980
And his cousin's sister's husband

676
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:49,984
and our superintendent are almost in-laws.

677
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,193
My goodness.

678
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,280
But what do you mean
they're almost in-laws?

679
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,366
Anyway, he's the most influential guy
in our neighborhood.

680
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:01,203
Your life will work out just fine
in this neighborhood

681
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,997
if you stay good friends with Mr. No.

682
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,750
-Thank you for this.
-No problem.

683
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:13,299
By the way, it sounds like
you run some kind of a business.

684
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,467
He and his wife
both have specialized jobs.

685
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,887
My gosh.

686
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,557
People call us the couple
who have specialized jobs.

687
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,893
My wife's an attorney.

688
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,020
She's an attorney?

689
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,564
Meanwhile, he runs--

690
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:33,319
You know how they say
the smartest doctors are eye doctors?

691
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,446
Studying the eyes of humans

692
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:38,866
is something that requires
a lot of education and intelligence.

693
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,409
Then you must be--

694
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,994
Yes, I'm an optician.

695
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,540
I see.

696
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,044
Then I'm guessing

697
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:54,173
all the attorneys in this neighborhood

698
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,261
or people who work in a similar field
would all be pretty close to each other.

699
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,638
They must all be colleagues.

700
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,473
Much closer than that.

701
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:07,102
People in Ongsan even ask my wife
to name their fourth-generation only son.

702
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,395
My goodness.

703
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,482
She's the most highly educated person
in our neighborhood.

704
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:14,985
This isn't something I say.
It's what other people say.

705
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:19,239
They say she's fit to be
the next first lady of Ongsan.

706
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:20,824
Oh, right.

707
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,828
He's going to become
the next governor of Ongsan.

708
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:27,039
He's practically a politician.

709
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,250
I'd love to hold a welcoming party
for our new neighbor.

710
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,794
-Goodness.
-That's not necessary.

711
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:34,421
But would it be low for a politician
to buy a cop drinks?

712
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,550
My goodness.

713
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,969
ONGSAN MARINATED CRABS

714
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:48,769
Why does she always go to the public bath
when she doesn't even have a husband?

715
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,604
-Hello.
-Hey.

716
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:55,067
Dongbaek, you must be happy
to earn so much money.

717
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,611
I heard the alumni
of Ongsan High School of Engineering

718
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,029
got together at your place.

719
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,450
They made a reservation last minute,
so it was really hectic.

720
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,911
Yes, I'm sure it was last minute.

721
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,955
They were supposed to come to my place.

722
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,790
But I guess I lost my customers to you.

723
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,420
I'm sorry.

724
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,381
I never intended on taking your customers.

725
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,842
I wonder why people always go to your bar.

726
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,345
Do you have a special business secret?

727
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,852
People always say they really enjoy
my stir-fried pork.

728
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,272
Then does that mean
my marinated crabs taste bad?

729
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,358
That's not what I meant.

730
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,153
Dongbaek, let's live ethically.

731
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:44,992
Let's not do anything
to embarrass our kids, okay?

732
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,999
NO GYU-TAE

733
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,468
Why won't she take reservations
when there's not a single customer here?

734
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,887
No manners, no service.

735
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,139
She doesn't want
to take Mr. Peanut's reservations.

736
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,223
What? "Mr. Peanut"?

737
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,642
You really need to stop
hitting on Dongbaek.

738
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,102
And stop obsessing over peanuts.

739
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,397
My gosh, she should be scared
of her landlord.

740
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,941
It doesn't matter
if you're the landlord or not.

741
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,777
You don't stand a chance against her.

742
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:23,197
She's a hippopotamus.

743
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,617
What would your kid learn from you?

744
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,829
You shouldn't do anything
to embarrass your kid.

745
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,249
-I...
-Yes?

746
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,293
I'm not ashamed.

747
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,295
What?

748
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,091
I didn't do anything to embarrass my son.

749
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,471
I'm not very well off,
and I raised him without a dad.

750
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,348
So I always feel sorry about that.

751
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,476
But I'm not ashamed.

752
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,897
I didn't do anything
to be ashamed of myself.

753
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,659
She's the only one who's still working.

754
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,119
Mr. No purposely created this gathering

755
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,705
to welcome you to the neighborhood.

756
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,960
Let her save her face.
Use this chance to introduce yourself.

757
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:22,548
Then why can't we just meet
at a barbecue restaurant?

758
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,300
I don't want to go to a hostess bar.

759
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,428
My gosh, it's not that kind of place.

760
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,932
You called her the Queen of Ongsan.

761
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,560
It's just a figure of speech.

762
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,228
To be honest,

763
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,813
it's because we have

764
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,606
no other place to go.

765
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,068
Did you just shit your pants?

766
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,529
Where can we go?

767
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,706
How about this place?

768
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,458
I wonder if my fate would've changed
if it weren't for this

769
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,793
peculiar neighborhood.

770
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:00,711
My gosh.

771
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,172
I thought the chief was joking
when he said there's nowhere to go

772
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,758
even though there are tons
of restaurants in Ongsan.

773
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,343
Let's just go here.

774
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,723
That's his sister-in-law's restaurant.
Can you pour drinks to your boss

775
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,516
in front of your sister-in-law?

776
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,227
I could understand that much,
so I let them off the hook.

777
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,730
But when I said we should go
to the whelk restaurant,

778
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,232
they said it's run by
the newbie's mother-in-law's friend.

779
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,109
He once got beaten up by his wife

780
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,653
for mentioning his first love there
after he got drunk.

781
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,115
It's always someone's
mother-in-law, sister-in-law,

782
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,034
or the best friend of someone's wife.

783
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,785
This place is filled with spies.

784
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,289
Would you drink at a place that
reports everything to your wife?

785
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,791
I really had nothing to say to that.

786
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:45,339
So I walked toward the eye of storm
thinking that this neighborhood

787
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,132
is still practically a clan.

788
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,218
We all have a good reason

789
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,638
for always coming here.

790
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,724
My gosh, what are you doing?

791
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,435
This is where our neutral nation stands.

792
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,814
CAMELLIA

793
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:09,196
-Come inside.
-My goodness.

794
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,909
My goodness, Mr. No. You're already here.

795
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:17,579
It's only right for the politician
to wait for the government officials.

796
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,084
This place is so tacky.

797
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,710
You're ready to be a politician.

798
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,296
-Sit down. Take your seats.
-Let's all sit down.

799
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,299
-Sit down.
-How's your business going?

800
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,843
-My gosh, it's all going well.
-Why won't this work?

801
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,222
My goodness.

802
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,850
-My gosh.
-Hyang-mi.

803
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:42,020
You could've killed us. You're practically
a terrorist for doing this.

804
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:45,482
Just leave her be.
She doesn't care about living a long life.

805
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,819
Guys who eat dog meat for nutrition,
smoke heated tobacco,

806
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,113
and cut down on alcohol
are always the ones

807
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,698
who end up dying in a car crash.

808
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:57,577
Plus, I don't think
I'll be living a long life anyway.

809
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,621
That's why I just live
in the present moment.

810
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,791
Is she supposed to be the Queen of Ongsan?

811
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,209
She's kind at heart.

812
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,211
Just make sure
you don't lose your lighter.

813
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,547
-What?
-She's a kleptomaniac.

814
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,756
A kleptomaniac?

815
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,842
She doesn't steal anything expensive.

816
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:15,012
But everything she sees
goes into her pocket.

817
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,181
But she's still kind at heart.

818
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,645
I want to go home.

819
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,028
Don't you have any hands?

820
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,450
I thought you were
going to pour me a drink.

821
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,535
That's not how it works here.

822
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,915
No, that's not what I meant.
It's just that she joined us.

823
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,959
She just likes to drink.

824
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,128
She does whatever she wants,
so don't mind her.

825
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,671
She'll leave after a few drinks.

826
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,009
Well, I guess that's why
she's called the Queen of Ongsan.

827
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,887
She does everything she wants.

828
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,388
It's not her.

829
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,100
I know this isn't the city,
but we have high standards too.

830
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,269
I'm younger and prettier than Dongbaek.

831
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,604
Show us your ID.

832
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:08,857
Hey, come on.
Dongbaek is the Diana of Ongsan.

833
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,401
"Dongbaek"?

834
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,934
Dongbaek, what's fresh today?
How about some small octopus?

835
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:47,354
No, but we have some fresh cabbages.
It's a thumbs up.

836
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,314
She's the Diana of Ongsan.

837
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:50,732
Isn't she beautiful?

838
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:54,694
The queen of my heart turned out the be
the Queen of Ongsan.

839
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,156
Hyang-mi, can we talk for a second?

840
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,699
Okay.

841
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,535
"A thumbs up."

842
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,747
Hyang-mi, your hourly pay is 8,500 won.

843
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,458
And that doesn't include the right
to sit with the customers

844
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,545
and pop their beer bottles
so you could have a sip.

845
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:16,299
I hired you as a waitress.

846
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,385
But you keep sitting down
with the customers.

847
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,303
This isn't that kind of bar.

848
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,555
Dongbaek.

849
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,558
If I don't even get
to drink alcohol for free,

850
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,103
why would I work here
and only get paid 8,500 won per hour?

851
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,110
Okay.

852
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,829
The woman I fell for isn't an attorney.

853
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,123
She isn't fluent in English either.

854
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,129
But I realized something.

855
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:00,510
Those weren't the reasons
why I fell for her.

856
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:06,266
I could only think of one thing
in my head.

857
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,687
She's pretty, and that's a fact.

858
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,274
Excuse me.

859
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:18,570
Have you ever lived in the city?

860
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,160
The academy just ended.
Buy some dumplings on your way home.

861
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,661
Okay, I'll be right there.

862
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:39,132
I should get going now.

863
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,300
Give me peanuts!

864
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,385
Peanuts.

865
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,306
Give me some peanuts for free
before you leave.

866
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,310
But the peanuts are--

867
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:51,978
What? They're 8,000 won?

868
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:57,817
Go ahead and say that one more time
if you have the guts to do so.

869
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,903
Gosh, he's so obsessed with peanuts.

870
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:03,698
Let me be frank here.
I'm the only person in this neighborhood

871
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,034
who buys hard liquor here.

872
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,494
I'm the only one.

873
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:12,332
I'm the only person who buys hard liquor,
and I'm also your landlord.

874
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,918
But you never once
gave me peanuts for free.

875
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,548
Mr. No, I'll get going now.

876
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,595
I need to get going.

877
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,723
Then have half a shot.

878
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,560
You never accept my drinks.

879
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:35,397
Mr. No, you're drunk.

880
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,400
Okay, fine. You know what?

881
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,200
If you drink this shot,
I won't raise the rent until next year.

882
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,414
You look down on me, don't you?

883
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,249
Why?

884
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,668
Because I'm not a governor?

885
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,629
Why? Why do you look down on me?

886
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,924
-Sir, I think you're drunk.
-No, I'm fine.

887
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,478
Don't raise the rent.

888
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,606
The cops here all heard what you said.

889
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,737
The alcohol tastes sweet.
I really wanted a shot today.

890
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,364
Thank you, sir.

891
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,326
You see?

892
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,412
It's so nice to see you smile.

893
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,789
Just think of me as a hometown friend.

894
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,876
You should sometimes
serve peanuts for free,

895
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:39,419
have some drinks with me,

896
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:43,214
and give me a smile every now and then.
I mean, how nice is that?

897
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,969
-Mr. No.
-Yes?

898
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:54,768
The whelks are 15,000 won,
the stir-fried pork is 12,000 won,

899
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,436
and the conches are 8,000 won.

900
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:01,316
But that price doesn't include
your right to touch me or my smile.

901
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:02,942
What?

902
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,445
I...

903
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:06,738
only sell alcohol.

904
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,157
The only thing you can buy here

905
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:10,992
is just alcohol.

906
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,952
That's it.

907
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,759
CAMELLIA

908
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:29,511
My gosh, let's go now.

909
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,596
Hey.

910
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,433
You only gave me 85,000 won.
You're supposed to pay 93,000 won.

911
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:38,395
I'm not going to pay for the peanuts.

912
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,147
What is it with you and peanuts?

913
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,234
I definitely asked her
to give me peanuts for free.

914
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:47,028
So why are you asking me to pay for that?
I'm not going to pay.

915
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,363
I can't pay for that.

916
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:50,115
-My gosh.
-Hyang-mi.

917
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:53,493
Hey, Dongbaek.
I tend to hold a big grudge.

918
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:57,288
That's all I can pay you.
Just take it or leave it.

919
00:56:58,748 --> 00:56:59,999
Thank you, Mr. No.

920
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,544
Goodbye.

921
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:08,800
Mr. No, you drank a bit too much today.

922
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:12,262
I mean, come on.
The peanuts aren't the problem.

923
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:15,390
I always pay her with cash
for her own good.

924
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,308
I pay with cash, okay?

925
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:21,146
Don't be so harsh.
She's just trying to make a living.

926
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:24,858
The peanuts aren't the problem.
I have a problem with her sincerity.

927
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,869
-Excuse me.
-You see, I tend to be mean

928
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,163
to the people I like.

929
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,874
I never asked her to date me or anything.

930
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,917
I just asked her to be friends.

931
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:46,129
-Excuse me!
-But she's always so cold to me.

932
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:51,634
Give me 8,000 won.

933
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,180
Give me 8,000 won.

934
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,474
You should pay Dongbaek 8,000 won.

935
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,976
Are you drunk?

936
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,561
What's with you?

937
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,563
Even the constable is causing a fuss

938
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,691
now that he sees Dongbaek
treat me with disrespect.

939
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,068
Stop nitpicking
and just give me 8,000 won.

940
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:11,196
No, I can't.

941
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,072
I won't give you that money.

942
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:16,701
If you give me 8,000 won,

943
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,912
I promise that nothing will happen.

944
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:23,958
My gosh, you're so scary.

945
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,377
What are you going to do
if I don't give it to you?

946
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,088
What are you going to do
if I don't give it to you?

947
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:32,091
-Come on. Stop it.
-What will you do?

948
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,301
That's enough.

949
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,346
Hey, unclench your fist.

950
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,266
What's with that look in your eyes?

951
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:43,561
Not only did he clench his fist,
but he's even biting his lip.

952
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,189
It looks like you're about to hit me.
Well, go ahead.

953
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:49,526
Go ahead and hit me. Come on. Hit me.

954
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,319
Hit me!

955
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,293
You...

956
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,220
What...

957
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,430
Give that back to him.

958
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,016
That's stealing.

959
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,643
Did a police constable

960
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,813
just steal the future governor's wallet?

961
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:32,944
My gosh.

962
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:35,280
Hey, get over here!
You practically stole from me!

963
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,991
Hey! That guy stole from me!

964
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,492
I'm sorry for going home late.

965
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,912
Okay, I'll buy the dumplings and go home.

966
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,877
CAMELLIA

967
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:53,631
Dongbaek!

968
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,551
Wait!

969
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,518
-This is for the peanuts.
-What?

970
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:09,647
This money's from No Gyu-tae's wallet.

971
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,358
Why are you...

972
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,820
This money belongs to you.

973
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,160
You came back to give me this?

974
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,329
Yes.

975
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:26,664
Thank you.

976
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,543
But why did you...

977
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:32,670
My name is Hwang Yong-sik.

978
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:34,881
Oh, okay.

979
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,675
-I thought you were just pretty.
-What?

980
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,720
I thought you were just pretty.

981
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,390
But you're also really cool.

982
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:46,851
Me?

983
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:49,520
I became a fan
the moment you gave him a lecture

984
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,023
about the peanuts.

985
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,320
Did you drink a lot?

986
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,906
I don't know what to say right now but...

987
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,202
-Can I come back tomorrow?
-What?

988
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,622
Yes, sure.

989
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:10,375
I think I'll be here tomorrow
and the day after.

990
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,961
What a complete weirdo.

991
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,963
I think...

992
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,716
I think I'd want to come here every day.

993
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:20,468
Can I do that? Is that okay?

994
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:35,775
CAMELLIA

995
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,277
I LOVE ONLY YOU

996
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,060
POLICE

997
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,820
I feel like you always catch me
in my most embarrassing moments.

998
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:04,405
Please mind your own business.

999
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,407
I'm going to take legal action!

1000
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,993
If I was her guardian,
you'd be dead already.

1001
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:12,288
Are you starting to become curious
about your dad?

1002
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:14,957
-Not really.
-Why are you paying for him to play games?

1003
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:15,875
Dongbaek!

1004
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:20,046
Do you even know what kind of mess
Hyang-mi's been getting herself into?

1005
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,048
I sometimes feel like the neighbors

1006
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:23,966
are a bit too mean to me.

1007
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,219
Let's do "that."

1008
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:29,889
Is it okay if I side with you and Pil-gu?

1009
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,974
