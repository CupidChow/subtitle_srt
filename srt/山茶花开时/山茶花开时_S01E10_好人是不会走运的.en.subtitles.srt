1
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,272
Just tell them to bring it on.

2
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,150
I just adored her so much.

3
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,156
So I no longer...

4
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,334
You did it first.

5
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,503
I no longer wanted to be the nice guy.

6
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,690
CAMELLIA

7
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,567
The air seemed to stop moving,

8
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,654
and snowflakes seemed
to fall from the sky.

9
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,199
Nothing made sense.

10
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,380
The midwest coast area
had their first snow of the year,

11
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,048
two weeks earlier than last year.

12
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,926
Due to the cold air from the northwest,

13
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,263
unusually low temperatures
are expected to continue.

14
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:22,100
Steam is all you need to cook dumplings,
you know.

15
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,561
You don't have to boil them.

16
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,897
Forget fire.

17
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,360
Why don't we
just take it slow and be warm together?

18
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,239
Dumplings actually cook faster
than you think.

19
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,160
And the temperature between us
began rising abnormally high.

20
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,996
Being reckless and taking the leap

21
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,707
beats taking it slow
and seeing how things go.

22
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,585
Maybe that's
the ultimate winning strategy.

23
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:55,633
NICE PEOPLE CAN'T GET LUCKY

24
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,636
Yes, go on in. Watch the steps.

25
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,098
Wait, Dongbaek.

26
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,934
Well...

27
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,563
I like you.

28
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,985
I know. In fact, everyone in Ongsan knows.

29
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,320
Right.

30
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:22,869
Well, people say
that you shouldn't say it so easily.

31
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,040
But I don't think it's right
to save it for special occasions only,

32
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,417
just like how we only have beef
on special days.

33
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,920
Why? What do you want to say?

34
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,257
Well, you see...

35
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:42,222
I've gone past the stage
of just liking you.

36
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,099
I'm almost...

37
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,561
-I'm almost... I mean...
-Gosh.

38
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:53,149
Please don't. You don't need to say it.

39
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,984
No, I can do it. I...

40
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,488
I mean, it's almost...

41
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,699
I really...

42
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,495
Well, you know. It's almost...

43
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,833
What I'm trying to say is...

44
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,627
-Did you order chicken?
-Chicken...

45
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,006
-No, I didn't.
-Someone ordered it.

46
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:22,470
In-gu, that chicken...
You heard her saying she didn't order it.

47
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,763
Over here!

48
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,139
My gosh.

49
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,810
How long have you been standing there?

50
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,144
Why do you keep stuttering?

51
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,814
When did I...

52
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,110
Why are you shutting the door?
I'm coming in.

53
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,242
-I'm so difficult, aren't I?
-Gosh, no.

54
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,036
You're losing your confidence again.

55
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,914
I won't.

56
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,375
I won't let anyone bring me down.

57
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,752
I'll live however I want.

58
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,100
I'll show everyone.

59
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,979
I'll be reckless for a change
and live however I want.

60
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,566
You can turn your life around.

61
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,651
Your personality determines
how it will be.

62
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,862
If you act like a doormat,

63
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,156
everyone will walk all over you.

64
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,867
If you keep laughing,
you'll find things to laugh about.

65
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,493
She gets chatty when she's drunk.

66
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:32,874
In spring, I'll live like flower seeds
dancing in the wind.

67
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,794
In summer, I'll live like Pil-gu
on his first day of summer break.

68
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:41,215
In autumn, I'll get all melancholic
like a spoiled rich guy.

69
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,054
And in winter, I'll live like a dog
rolling around in the snow.

70
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,224
Then wouldn't life be
so peaceful and fun, Mom?

71
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,143
Be quiet. I can't hear the TV.

72
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,770
It'll be too salty.

73
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,192
I'll try to live
the rest of my life like that.

74
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,366
I'll seriously show everyone.

75
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,359
I'm just going to live my life

76
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,779
however I want to.

77
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,214
Hello.

78
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,260
We had our first snow yesterday.

79
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,345
-Yes.
-Yes.

80
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,140
The co-op meeting will be held
this month, right?

81
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:13,808
-Yes.
-Yes.

82
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,560
I'll be there. I promise.

83
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,854
-All right.
-All right.

84
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,074
I guess

85
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,035
she got a Botox injection or something.

86
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,580
Was she always that pretty?

87
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,291
She's never smiled like that before.

88
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,048
DOL COFFEE SHOP

89
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,259
I'll just do whatever I want.

90
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,893
How would I know anything
about the cat food?

91
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,769
I assumed someone
was putting it there.

92
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:03,399
So you've never seen anyone
actually putting the cat food there?

93
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,695
What is that?

94
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,992
What the...

95
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,374
DOL COFFEE SHOP

96
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,461
I want to start delivering my food
to customers as well.

97
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,675
Isn't this Mi-sun's?

98
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,512
She's very kind, you know.

99
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:37,141
She's closing down her coffee shop,
and she practically gave me this for free.

100
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,269
"Practically"?
So you gave her money for this?

101
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,689
She told me to just pay 300,000 won
instead of 500,000 won.

102
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,193
She bought this used motorbike
for only 150,000 won last year.

103
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,029
What?

104
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,535
You bought a used motorbike
for double the price. Gosh.

105
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,205
This is...

106
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,671
Gosh, why did you buy this helmet?

107
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,173
Mi-sun said that her sister, Mi-jeong,

108
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,968
completely broke her jaw
while riding a motorbike.

109
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,599
You at least know how to ride this, right?

110
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,061
Mi-sun said anyone
who can ride a bicycle can figure it out.

111
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,188
Do you know
her resident registration number?

112
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,109
She totally conned you.

113
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,236
My gosh.

114
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,286
Gosh. Oh, no.

115
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,080
Is this broken? How do I fix this?

116
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,334
Even though it was just an ember, Dongbaek
was doing her best to get the fire going.

117
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,460
And my fire

118
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,131
kept on burning fiercely.

119
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,054
I got the building owner's number.

120
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,434
How did you get
the building owner's number so easily?

121
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,980
Heung-sik used to clean the building,
you know.

122
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,567
And In-gu's snack shop was
on the first floor of that building.

123
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:14,530
Do you know who In-gu is?
He's my best friend

124
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,574
Cheol-gu's cousin.

125
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,244
Your connections

126
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,788
are more useful than the police database.

127
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,249
Gosh, cut it out. Hello?

128
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,460
I don't believe this.

129
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,796
So the building owner said
there's no other entrance?

130
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,757
That's right.

131
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,551
Apparently, no one ever visits
or goes into the building.

132
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,765
But this does look like
it was closed by someone.

133
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,226
OK AESTHETIC

134
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,063
ONGSAN SUBSTATION

135
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:54,362
So my mom said Pil-gu is
the only one in our class that has 2D1M.

136
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,446
What? "2D1M"?

137
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,699
Yes. D stands for Dad,
and M stands for Mom.

138
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,452
In other words,
he has two dads and one mom.

139
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,580
Then since Shin Chung-jae's
mom got remarried, he's also 2D1M?

140
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,415
Yes, we can say that.

141
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:11,212
And his surname might change
from Kang to Hwang soon.

142
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,511
Hey, fatty.

143
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,596
What?

144
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,683
Hey!

145
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:29,021
A fire during demolition is usually
caused by an electrical short circuit.

146
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,315
But you saw that earlier.

147
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,361
Don't talk nonsense
when you're not even sure about it.

148
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,570
What is it?

149
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,323
What did you see?

150
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:43,953
This guy said some nonsense
about the fire that broke out last week,

151
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,289
and now there's talk of insurance issues
and an investigation.

152
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,167
They're telling us to write a report.
My gosh.

153
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,170
Wait, was there a fire last week?

154
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,588
-Yes.
-Where?

155
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,216
Over there,
where they're building the underpass.

156
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,927
It was just a tiny fire, though.

157
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,722
A lighter and cup noodles
were found at the scene.

158
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,517
It looked like the fire was started
by a homeless person.

159
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,853
-A lighter?
-Yes.

160
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,898
The flames floated a little
both here and at the underpass.

161
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,860
-They floated?
-Yes.

162
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,154
If fire floats around
even when you spray water,

163
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,072
it means there's oil,

164
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,492
so we should look into the possibility
of arson first--

165
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,577
Hey.

166
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,873
You haven't seen enough fire scenes
to say things like that.

167
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,334
Hey, you punk!
Drop that attitude, will you?

168
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,252
You little...

169
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,883
POLICE

170
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,596
Look at this.

171
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,560
What is going on?
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

172
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,439
Who keeps filling that bowl with cat food?

173
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,192
Have you seen anyone filling that bowl?

174
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,570
Why do you keep asking about that
in this situation?

175
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,155
Do you want to feed cats, too?

176
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,743
I just think it's so strange.

177
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:10,539
Chief, even during the short time
I lived in Seoul,

178
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,167
I saw more cats around
than I did over here.

179
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,253
I rarely see any cats around here
for some odd reason,

180
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,423
but someone keeps filling that bowl
with cat food.

181
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,343
Don't you think it's strange?

182
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,179
Ready?

183
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,185
The Ligers players' wives volunteered
to make kimchi.

184
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,694
Who is that K mentioned in the tabloids?

185
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,113
-I heard it might be someone in our team.
-Who?

186
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,699
Who knows? It's so embarrassing.

187
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,410
A mistress? Come on, this is 2019.

188
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,079
That's disgusting.

189
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,373
It's not even someone in LA.

190
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,208
She's in a remote country town.

191
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,252
In Chungcheong Province, right?

192
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,713
-Yes, Ongsan. It's known for marinated--
-Fuck.

193
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,059
ONGSAN ELEMENTARY COMES IN SECOND

194
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,728
Gosh, there are so many parents here.

195
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,487
Gosh.

196
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,493
What happened to your face?
Tell me what happened.

197
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,452
Let go.

198
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,664
Did someone hit him?
Do kids bully him? Is he an outcast?

199
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,212
Mom, you did call him 2D1M.

200
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,715
You never said I shouldn't tell anyone.

201
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,348
Hey, why did you fight with a friend?

202
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,767
What if his parents press charges
or something?

203
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,145
He started it. He called Pil-gu 2D1M.

204
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,855
What?

205
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,065
What about that nickname?

206
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,320
There's nothing wrong with your pals
calling you by a nickname.

207
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:11,410
Hey, it's just a nickname.

208
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,871
I'm sure it doesn't mean anything bad.

209
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,082
How can I make
an eight-year-old boy feel better?

210
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,668
My nickname is Ten Million Jong-ryeol.

211
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,296
Have you been mocked
by ten million people?

212
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,050
You had no reason
to make your friend's nose bleed.

213
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,260
Where did you get that temper from?

214
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,095
I didn't mean to say that.

215
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,349
Tame that temper of yours, or you'll have
a tough time in the military.

216
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,392
Two dads and one mom.

217
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,311
That's what 2D1M means.

218
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,067
He started teasing me by calling me 2D1M.

219
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,613
He also said I'm now Hwang Pil-gu,
not Kang Pil-gu.

220
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,910
And I can't even punch him on the nose?

221
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,829
He got what he deserved.

222
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,791
I had to punch him!

223
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,129
Hey.

224
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,006
You!

225
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,718
Come here. Get your butt over here!

226
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,684
Kids, look. You need to get along
with your friends

227
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,520
and study hard to enjoy
a delicious buffet like this.

228
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,314
And what else? Right, Santa Claus
will reward you as well.

229
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,857
Am I right or not?

230
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,651
You guys are listening, right?

231
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,194
Where are the chicken skewers?

232
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,740
Pil-gu, you should stop
calling Dae-seong a fatty.

233
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,866
Dae-seong, you too.

234
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,578
Tell your mom that
she shouldn't say things like that

235
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,373
-I see barbecue short ribs! Guys, hurry!
-in front of you...

236
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,505
Do you want some short ribs, too?

237
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,799
No, I don't want it.

238
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,759
Have this. It's good.

239
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,978
Is your gum torn? Let me see.

240
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,024
-Gosh, let go.
-Stay still, you little rascal.

241
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,237
You need to get that snaggletooth treated.

242
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,822
No way.

243
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,074
The sooner you do it, the better.

244
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,909
I said, I don't want to.

245
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,620
If you get braces when you're older,
it'll look bad.

246
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,206
You won't be able to eat dried herring
or drink alcohol.

247
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,584
Have you ever had dried herring?

248
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,211
You'll get addicted once you taste it.

249
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,796
It's in season now.

250
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,221
Hey, why are you suddenly
bursting into tears?

251
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,015
I'll never eat dried herring!

252
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,268
And I hate barbecue short ribs.

253
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,395
I'll never get braces.

254
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,775
I don't like you, either.

255
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,696
I hate everything.
Why do you keep talking to me? Why?

256
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,954
Why?

257
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,290
This kid...

258
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,462
Why did you bring me to this buffet?
Why did you side with me?

259
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:11,882
Why?

260
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,635
He knows.

261
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,684
KANG PIL-GU

262
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,020
Why...

263
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,658
NEW MENU
DUMPLING HOT POT, DUMPLING SOUP

264
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,618
You've fallen for him.

265
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,703
A stir-fried pork restaurant
is turning into

266
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,872
a dumpling place
because Yong-sik likes them.

267
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,291
No, I like dumplings, too.

268
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,961
I said that
you have to keep playing hard to get.

269
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:53,173
Men go crazy for women
who don't like them.

270
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,635
You're not strategic at all.

271
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,263
Why must I be strategic?
Life is complicated enough.

272
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,765
I won't even bother
if I have to be like that.

273
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,852
Why can't you play hard to get
if you're so cool?

274
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,480
Why would I play hard to get? I'm lonely.

275
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,859
I'm lonely.

276
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:17,030
I have no family or friends. I've been
an outcast all my life, you know?

277
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:21,034
I've been lonely for a long time.
So how could I play hard to get?

278
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,369
It'd be a total lie.

279
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,956
You're just too honest sometimes.

280
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,126
You see,

281
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,505
I think I can be honest with Yong-sik.

282
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,301
He's a nice guy.
I'm comfortable around him, you know.

283
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,553
Still, you shouldn't trust him completely.

284
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,847
Guys like him who fall in love quickly

285
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,266
just fall for women easily.

286
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,394
Who knows? He might fall
for another woman in the near future.

287
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,024
If Yong-sik saw me before he met you,

288
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,610
he'd practically be in a coma by now.

289
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,740
Sure.

290
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,535
Shall I try borrowing some money from him?

291
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:08,498
I think I can borrow 100,000 won from him
every 5 minutes.

292
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,044
What?

293
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,380
I didn't tell you because I knew
you were going to look at me like that.

294
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,092
Four fires broke out

295
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,346
before Joker murdered people.

296
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,560
They were all small fires,
so it didn't cause any trouble.

297
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:33,398
But the day when the big fire broke out
at the bathhouse,

298
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,109
the first victim was murdered.

299
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,780
You should've told me this sooner.

300
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,284
My gosh!

301
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,494
My goodness.

302
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,206
HANBIT ACADEMY

303
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,875
If the sign was damaged,
they should've taken it down.

304
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,672
We almost got hurt.

305
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,132
And what if there were other passersby?

306
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,884
My gosh.

307
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,220
No, actually...

308
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,350
We might be able to catch Joker
at this rate.

309
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,269
What?

310
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,062
Look.

311
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,231
I guess it used to be there.

312
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,275
What?

313
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,360
Oh, the academy?

314
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,822
Didn't you read in the report that
there was an academy there?

315
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,906
No, not that.

316
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,617
Look at that over there.

317
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,204
That mark means there used to be
a security camera.

318
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,965
The security camera at Camellia

319
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,926
left the exact same mark
when it was taken down.

320
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,727
That's how Suk-hui ended up becoming
the youngest assistant madam ever

321
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,186
at the age of 24.

322
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,482
I guess she was considered
incredibly competent in that field.

323
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,569
And the thing is, she only drinks vodka.

324
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,656
Because she started downing
shots of vodka since she was 24,

325
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,534
her liver couldn't handle it.
So she ended up with cancer.

326
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,288
Think about how upset I must be,
as her friend of ten years.

327
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,127
Freelancers like Suk-hui have no income
when they're bedridden.

328
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,048
So what can I do? I have to help her out.

329
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,676
Hyang-mi, you're such a loyal friend.

330
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:29,389
It's kind of you to raise funds
to help your high school friend.

331
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,891
She didn't go to high school.

332
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,976
What?

333
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,982
Why are you even listening to her story?

334
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,942
I can't believe you're nodding

335
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,071
when she is asking you to lend her
100,000 won to help her friend.

336
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,492
Her friend, Suk-hui, is rich now.

337
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,370
You know where Nonhyeon is?
She has a karaoke lounge there.

338
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,997
No. She owns a karaoke bar, not a lounge.

339
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,123
Yong-sik.

340
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,752
You've been conned
out of your money before, right?

341
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,838
Yes, I'm sure of it.

342
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,133
I don't even know
why his mother is so proud of him.

343
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,190
Because you're my dad.

344
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,026
I know you're my dad.

345
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,488
That's why you got this for me.

346
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,119
So what do you...

347
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,871
I mean,

348
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,584
how do you feel?

349
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,880
Do you want me to be honest?
Or shall I be polite?

350
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:48,343
Frankly,
you're not exactly the polite type,

351
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,096
so you can just tell me
how you feel honestly.

352
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,558
I never met you before,

353
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,811
so I never missed you.

354
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,316
And I'm not that excited to have met you.

355
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,863
In a way,
I feel like I was happier last week

356
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,657
when I didn't know that you're my dad.

357
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,162
Why is that?

358
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:17,998
Do you not like me?

359
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,875
It just feels

360
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:22,836
a little weird.

361
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,963
What's weird?

362
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,591
You're like

363
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,676
Superman.

364
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:31,845
What?

365
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,181
Chung-jae's dad's business went bankrupt.

366
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,059
His parents divorced because of debts.

367
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,022
Your batting average is 0.280,

368
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,109
you live in an apartment,
and you adore your daughter.

369
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,280
It's weird, that's all.

370
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:55,785
Right.

371
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,164
Pil-gu,

372
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,751
if I had known about you,

373
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,879
I would've done the right thing--

374
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,047
No.

375
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,674
I'm talking about my mom.

376
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,012
Why did you leave her all alone?

377
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,725
That was so cheap of you.

378
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,564
Dad.

379
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,863
I hated even hearing the word "Dad."

380
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,075
Seven-year-old boys
don't usually watch the news.

381
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,411
The cartoons are all childish.

382
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:42,457
It is impossible for it
to be done individually...

383
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,709
It's not because I missed my dad.

384
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,545
I just didn't want my mom to cry.

385
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:50,006
So thrilled to see him, I laughed

386
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,927
And called out "Dad"!

387
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,722
But unlike other days

388
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:02,060
Dad looked a little sad

389
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:06,189
Is something wrong?

390
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:10,360
Are you worried about something?

391
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:14,406
Did something happen

392
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:18,243
That you couldn't control?

393
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,247
Dad, cheer up

394
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,375
-I wasn't able to watch the cartoons
-We're here for you

395
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,085
or sing the song.

396
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,254
Dad, cheer up

397
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:33,550
-You made my mom cry over 100 times.
-We're here for you

398
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,512
Dad, cheer up!

399
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,142
So I'm saying

400
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,561
I've never liked my dad.

401
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,524
I don't want the latest smartphone

402
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,902
or a feast at a buffet.

403
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,659
I don't want Superman

404
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,663
for a dad.

405
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,436
Have you seen a lawyer daughter-in-law

406
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:30,023
who buys grilled eels
for her mother-in-law and her friends?

407
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,068
Gyu-tae never had the brains,
but he was lucky with girls.

408
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,905
How could an engineering school graduate
get a wife who passed the bar exam?

409
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,950
She was the one who chased after my boy.

410
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,704
I'm not interested
in your son's happy marriage.

411
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,583
So, must I pay alimony
to my daughter-in-law?

412
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,127
Wait, I want a consultation first.

413
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,714
The rental contract I received
said they'd give me the money.

414
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,636
Please call my office
and make an appointment.

415
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,934
I have responsibilities as an attorney

416
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:09,312
and can't give you advice
without knowing all the facts.

417
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,356
I was just on my way home

418
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,608
when Mother asked me over to pick her up.

419
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,404
I had no idea I'd be grilling eels

420
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,198
or offering my legal services for free.

421
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,786
I think the surprise event
should end here.

422
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,999
-But you--
-I'll meet you outside once you're done.

423
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,418
But...

424
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,010
Hey, Kang Pil-gu.

425
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,853
CAMELLIA

426
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,441
Leave it.

427
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:58,111
Why does a boy who can't even wear his
belt properly have so much on his mind?

428
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,947
I'm almost a teenager next year.

429
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,032
Soon, I'll beat a high school senior.

430
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,828
You can act all rough and tough then.
Meanwhile, you're still eight.

431
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,788
Enjoy the buffet,

432
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,999
take the latest smartphone you were given,

433
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,418
and don't make a grown man cry
by acting mature.

434
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:19,299
You're a kid,
so you can cry at a restaurant.

435
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,302
But crying at my age
is absolutely humiliating.

436
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:27,891
So stop driving me crazy
and just be an eight-year-old boy.

437
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,186
Cry your heart out
and hate me all you want.

438
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,607
And then forget things
from time to time as you go.

439
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,470
Yong-sik.

440
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,723
Oh, right. Hi, Dongbaek.

441
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,266
Where are you off to?

442
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,899
I bought groceries to make dumplings.

443
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,444
Right, dumplings.

444
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,072
I was thinking about
adding it to the menu.

445
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,073
Come for a tasting.

446
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,742
Wait, hold on.

447
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,953
Well, Dongbaek,

448
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:33,498
how about we do that tasting tomorrow?

449
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,542
Why?

450
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,504
Well, you see,

451
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,798
it's not a good time.

452
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,094
Why? Is Kang Jong-ryeol there?

453
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,726
Are you just going to
avoid him every time?

454
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,856
Well, it's not like that.

455
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,151
There's also Pil-gu.

456
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,197
You truly are considerate.

457
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,950
You're treating him
even better than I do as Pil-gu's dad.

458
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,995
That's not the case.

459
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,165
I just see myself in Pil-gu.

460
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,921
When I was young,
I was jealous of people with dads,

461
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:27,260
even if all they did was drink
or loan money from others.

462
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:32,473
I hate that Kang Jong-ryeol comes around,

463
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:40,440
but Pil-gu might not feel the same way.

464
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:44,777
See?

465
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,406
It's hard to date a woman with a kid.

466
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,875
You cried earlier, didn't you?

467
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,336
Why did you cry?

468
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,881
You'll know once you see

469
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,507
your own kid cry.

470
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,597
Pil-gu.

471
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,101
Don't grow up so fast.

472
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,479
You don't have to.

473
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,247
This is the right thing to do.
The man is his father.

474
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,292
Right? I can't do anything about that.

475
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,012
Jeez, step aside.

476
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,307
My gosh.

477
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,477
You're always seeing
a doctor about your back.

478
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,812
Why would you pick this up?

479
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,272
You're not young anymore, you know.

480
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,235
I never asked for your help.

481
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,988
Darn him and that temper.

482
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,283
Will you stop meeting Pil-gu?

483
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,870
He's shy. He doesn't like people
acting overly friendly.

484
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,750
You don't know your son at all.

485
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,794
I know him better than you do.

486
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,339
Don't talk rubbish
and take your money with you.

487
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,427
-He knows.
-Knows what?

488
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,847
He knows.

489
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,058
He already knows that I'm his dad.

490
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,029
You should've called me
if the lights were out.

491
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,156
Why didn't you
go to Dongbaek's for dinner?

492
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,991
Why did you come here instead?

493
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,410
It's not like I didn't want to come by.

494
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,579
You told me to stay away.

495
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,583
You never listen to me,
and now you're suddenly so obedient.

496
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,837
You think you're too good
for my food, don't you?

497
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,799
Your mom's job is to ask if you've eaten

498
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,802
and you just go about

499
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,890
saying you won't eat my food, right?
You're so annoying.

500
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,392
-So where's my meal?
-I have none to spare for you.

501
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,702
Mom, don't carry those
with your bare hands.

502
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,537
You weren't born with oven mitts on.

503
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,586
GO, KOREA

504
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,300
Mom,

505
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,053
didn't I tell you to throw that out?

506
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:01,390
Why do you still have a t-shirt from
the 2002 World Cup?

507
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,267
That's what I wore back then.

508
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,144
It's a perfectly good t-shirt.

509
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:10,775
There's a wardrobe full of clothes
that you used to wear.

510
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,778
I bet you're wearing the shoes
I told you not to wear.

511
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,363
Jeez, you are.

512
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:20,409
Mom, why are you wearing sneakers
that I wore in school?

513
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,954
You begged me for a pair
from an expensive brand,

514
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,455
but you just left them behind.

515
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,374
Those are too big for you.

516
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,252
My toenail fell off
so big shoes are comfortable.

517
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,087
Why did it fall off?

518
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,923
Why didn't you do anything about it?

519
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:37,009
Why are you yelling
in the middle of your meal?

520
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,427
Just keep eating!

521
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,933
The radish kimchi is ripe,
but you wouldn't come to eat it.

522
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,185
What am I supposed to do

523
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,604
if you don't come to eat
what I made for you?

524
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,483
Mom.

525
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:56,404
Why are you wearing my old clothes
and old shoes

526
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,906
instead of buying new ones?

527
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,951
Saving all that money for your child

528
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:06,122
is the same as putting a nail
through his heart.

529
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:12,753
Do you know what'll happen
if you keep wearing that t-shirt?

530
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,338
Well,

531
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,966
after you die,

532
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,887
my heart will ache every time
I see this red t-shirt

533
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,222
during the World Cup season.

534
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,517
So please

535
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,103
stop breaking my heart

536
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:34,025
and spend some money on yourself. Okay?

537
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,739
Do you land on your face all the time?

538
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,075
Why do you keep getting injuries?

539
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,954
I met my dad today.

540
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,666
Ten Million Kang Jong-ryeol of the Ligers.

541
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,462
You said that there's
no such thing as freebies.

542
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:59,091
He gave me abalones
and offered me the latest smartphone.

543
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,179
Could he have been more obvious?

544
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,147
Pil-gu, you see...

545
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,656
I don't know how to put this. Hold on.

546
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,990
You don't have to say it.

547
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,746
I'm just telling you
that I know everything.

548
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,456
Why?

549
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,708
You know,

550
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:37,755
when I lied about scoring
over 50 points on the math quiz,

551
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:42,009
I kept dreaming of you finding
the quiz paper

552
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,053
that I got 47 points on.

553
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,557
My stomach started to ache
and I couldn't sleep.

554
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,813
I thought that
you'd feel the same way right now.

555
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:58,234
So I'm just telling you
that you got caught.

556
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,159
Are you all right?

557
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,287
Stop asking me that.

558
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,457
You already keep giving me a headache.

559
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:22,425
Life is still unfair
even though I'm trying hard.

560
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,679
We're always guilty
when it comes to our kids.

561
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,767
Helena, use this as a rag.

562
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,273
Why? You like this t-shirt.

563
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,860
He wants me to throw it out, so I should.

564
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:45,281
He's been driving nails through my heart
for 30 years,

565
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,992
but he can't stand me putting one in him,

566
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,827
so what else can I do?

567
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,872
My boy's heart aches because of me

568
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,875
and that hurts more than anything else.

569
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,510
-Motherly love is always great,
-I got it.

570
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,721
but it's not always
shown in the right way.

571
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,097
Gosh.

572
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:14,060
I'm practically serving
my lawyer daughter-in-law.

573
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,437
Mom, just enjoy your meal.

574
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,107
Giving out some legal advice
was nothing to get testy about.

575
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,402
-I don't like it. You have it.
-Mother.

576
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:28,657
Do you or do you not
like that I'm a lawyer?

577
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,869
-What?
-You always show me off

578
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,788
to your friends,

579
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,457
but you hate that
I'm more competent than him.

580
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:40,127
What kind of a daughter-in-law
do you want me to be?

581
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,838
Goodness. You're at it again.

582
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,092
I get really annoyed with you

583
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,719
every time you act so smart like this.

584
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,680
There's no man who'd be fond of that.

585
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,392
No wonder you're still childless.

586
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,019
Mom, just go home.

587
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,314
You intimidate Gyu-tae like this
all the time, don't you?

588
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,359
No wonder he's been
lacking energy these days--

589
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:06,404
This jerk's lack of energy
has nothing to do with me.

590
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,947
What? This jerk?

591
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,950
How dare you address
your husband like that?

592
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:14,829
Well, that husband of mine
was daring and shameless enough

593
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,497
to have an affair.

594
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,836
If it were an obedient
and successful woman,

595
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,546
you could've traded her with me.

596
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:24,713
You...

597
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,925
You're spewing nonsense yet again.

598
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,760
-She's a bar hostess.
-Is this true?

599
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,974
You shouldn't have provoked her like that.

600
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,144
You're just like your father!

601
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:42,189
Since I'm a lawyer,
I've been thinking long and hard.

602
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,985
The normal legal procedure
just isn't enough to subside my anger.

603
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,611
It's Ongsan.

604
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:52,241
The baseball player Kang Jong-ryeol
goes to Ongsan three times a week.

605
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,703
I'm the source of that Ongsan rumor.

606
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,122
-I'm the one who spread it.
-Really?

607
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:02,543
I got drunk and told the reporter
of the weekly sports magazine.

608
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,254
Hey, if Kang Jong-ryeol sues you,

609
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,381
you'll get arrested
for spreading that rumor.

610
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,884
I didn't start it.
I also heard it from someone.

611
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,429
The real source was my friend in Ongsan.

612
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,514
She used to be my best friend in Garibong.

613
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,725
She's taking a break there.

614
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,979
-She stole money and fled, didn't she?
-No, she's just taking a break.

615
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,358
Nak-ho.

616
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,655
I didn't know
you also get your hair done here.

617
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,618
Your best friend

618
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,370
is in Ongsan right now?

619
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,750
It's not like you're going to help me
get that money.

620
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,543
I'm hanging up.

621
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,170
INTERNATIONAL CALL

622
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,772
Why would she leave the money here?

623
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,195
People like her
are the reason why traitors exist.

624
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,502
She seems to be the dumbest one.

625
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,808
COPENHAGEN GIRL WISHES
TO SEND YOU A MESSAGE

626
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,396
"Ongsan Elementary School."

627
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,856
"Ongsan Elementary School."

628
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,526
Ongsan Elementary School?

629
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:53,862
What is this?

630
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,074
What is Ongsan?

631
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,743
DESTINATION
ONGSAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

632
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,789
Hey.

633
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,585
My mom invited you over to our house.

634
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,503
She'll serve you pork belly.

635
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,881
Why? Because she called me 2D1M?

636
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,009
Yes, I think so.

637
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,888
Then tell her I'll be there tomorrow
by 4:30 p.m. after training.

638
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:20,931
Okay.

639
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,982
You can go first, Jun-gi.

640
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,867
Is he having an affair
with a teacher or something?

641
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:42,828
My goodness.

642
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,372
Gosh, he startled me.

643
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,045
What do you want?

644
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,797
-Why did you try to open my car?
-I was mistaken.

645
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,466
I'm sorry.

646
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:06,935
Hey.

647
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:11,815
Do you know me?

648
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:15,694
No, I don't.

649
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,531
Then why did you do that?

650
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,242
I mistook your car for someone else's.

651
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:24,995
Are you sure

652
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,207
we never met before?

653
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,592
Pil-gu!

654
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,436
It's her. Superman's young bride.

655
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:51,855
It's her.

656
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,733
Kang Jong-ryeol's sunshine.

657
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,905
What's this secret folder?

658
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,031
SUMMER, 2017

659
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,117
Why would you look
at my social media page?

660
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:06,161
Did you ask me to go get water
so you could look at my phone?

661
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,373
You're angry that I looked
at your page?

662
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,460
It's all from the past.
I don't go on there anymore.

663
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,753
I forgot that I had those.

664
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,338
Don't lie to me.

665
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,298
It automatically logged in.

666
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,259
Have you been looking at her photos?

667
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,639
What's in that folder named "Sunshine"?

668
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,016
Give me that.

669
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,226
-My gosh.
-Give it to me.

670
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,649
Is she your sunshine?

671
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:40,195
And after that,
I even found out her name. Dongbaek.

672
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,615
It's that darn Dongbaek,
the girl he always looked for

673
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,534
every time he got drunk.

674
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:48,579
And...

675
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:08,599
I must protect him.

676
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:24,698
This isn't a place where you can
just barge in whenever you want to.

677
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,701
I guess he's here
to show off his new car to you.

678
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,374
Pil-gu, let me deal with this situation.

679
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,170
Should I go with you?

680
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,048
I'm a strong woman now.

681
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:46,345
Remember what I always told you.
If someone makes you angry...

682
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,430
Yes, I know.
I should punch them in the nose.

683
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:05,072
CAMELLIA

684
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:08,325
What's gotten into you?
You never say hi first.

685
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:14,081
-Your wife, Jessica, was here.
-What?

686
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,458
She was in front of Pil-gu's school.

687
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,425
I don't even know
what I'm doing right now.

688
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,682
Hey.

689
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,645
Can you call a chauffeur service
on your way back to Seoul?

690
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,146
Why?

691
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,067
Do you want to have a drink with me?

692
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,612
Yes, let's have a drink.
But not at my bar.

693
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:49,700
I don't want to go there, either.
There's a psycho.

694
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,832
Grandma, I want
black bean instant noodles!

695
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,917
What are you looking at?

696
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,546
I was thinking about having some abalone.

697
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,175
-Don't eat it.
-What?

698
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,139
Keep being a joke, and you'll die.

699
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,349
Gosh, I won't be a joke.

700
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,143
I told you, didn't I?

701
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,688
I'll do anything for Dongbaek.

702
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,569
By the way,
why do you act like you have dementia?

703
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,206
My mom left with Mr. Kang Jong-ryeol.

704
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,210
Oh, really?

705
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,632
That idiot.

706
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:48,967
What's with that lame reaction?

707
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,062
This might make you feel uneasy.

708
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,814
I already feel like crap.

709
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:10,447
After I broke up with you and had Pil-gu,
I lived my life like a walking corpse.

710
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,661
I may seem pathetic to you right now.

711
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:19,081
But I'm trying really hard
to live a proper life.

712
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:26,380
So don't make me look pitiful again.

713
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,841
I can be a single mother,
but never a mistress.

714
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,760
Who asked you to be a mistress?

715
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,220
Just wait until--

716
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,847
No, I'm never going to wait for you again.

717
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,566
Are you going to wait
until she comes back?

718
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:47,985
Oh, well...

719
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,195
I guess so.

720
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,872
You're very gentle.

721
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:04,835
Pardon?

722
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,337
You're very gentle,

723
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:11,091
kind, and you have no temper.

724
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,468
Oh, I guess so.

725
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,430
Is it because he's the dad?

726
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,057
Are you being nice
because he's Pil-gu's dad?

727
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,644
Ma'am, you knew?

728
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,897
Then why don't you
just let them get back together?

729
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,816
Why bother making things so complicated?

730
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:33,905
You see, I...

731
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,283
I trust Dongbaek.

732
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:40,412
I know she'll make the right choice
for herself, so I'm just--

733
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,456
If you'll watch from afar,
just give up.

734
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,834
You're being way too generous

735
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,336
and kind for no reason.

736
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:49,796
It's not sexy.

737
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,426
Go ahead and wait until she returns.

738
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,137
But she won't return.

739
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,556
She won't return if you just wait.

740
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,810
The guy who protects the girl
can't beat the guy who tries to steal her.

741
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,239
You should just go ahead
and live your life.

742
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:19,743
That's all you need to do.
You're free to do that.

743
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,080
Well...

744
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,875
There's something
I've always wanted to ask

745
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,919
but felt too scared to do so.

746
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,007
Why did it have to be Ongsan?

747
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,220
You

748
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,556
waited for me, didn't you?

749
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:46,103
Ongsan.
That's where I want to live once I retire.

750
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,146
Let's raise our kid there in the future.

751
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,190
Is that your hometown?

752
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:52,609
No, but I wish it were.

753
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:53,819
Why?

754
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,613
I lived there for a bit
when I was little.

755
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,616
And that place is really peculiar.

756
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,619
The people there are like a clan.

757
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,705
The entire neighborhood is really weird.

758
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,250
When it's time to eat,
you just go to anyone's house.

759
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:11,837
Then they add another spoon on the table
without asking any questions.

760
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:17,050
That kind of stuff is
really natural there.

761
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:18,969
The entire neighborhood

762
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,222
-is like a family.
-A family?

763
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,683
They're not really that nice,

764
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:28,186
but they give you a very warm feeling.

765
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:37,571
Yes, I came here because of what you said.
And you made me settle down here.

766
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,615
But is there a problem with that?

767
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,288
That was way before you even got married.

768
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,958
And it wasn't even two years
after we broke up.

769
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,169
Let's say I did wait.
What's wrong about that?

770
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,379
So did you really wait for me?

771
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,558
I was foolish enough
to have tons of false hope.

772
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,188
I'd search the web
to see how you're doing.

773
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,398
And when I heard you broke up
with some singer,

774
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:17,861
I'd look down the alley numerous times.

775
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,782
When Pil-gu got pneumonia

776
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:26,786
and I was practically out of my mind
sitting next to him in the ER,

777
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,165
I wanted to call and ask you for help.

778
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,501
I wanted

779
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,005
to tell you how scared I was.

780
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,553
But I didn't do any of that.

781
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:47,390
So you have no right
to interfere in my life.

782
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,606
Do you think I had a blast
after we broke up?

783
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,442
I missed you like crazy.

784
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:02,113
I couldn't stop thinking about you,

785
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,366
but I just endured it.

786
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,912
And I thought that was
just the way to live.

787
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,210
Why can't you cut me some slack?

788
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,922
I was only 27 back then.

789
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:24,135
I would never have let you go like that
if I was 37.

790
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,270
I'm glad to hear that
although it's a little late.

791
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,314
I really wanted to hear those words
in the past.

792
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:39,109
That's why we should start again.
Let's start over.

793
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:43,738
But we're 34 now.

794
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:49,828
And I'm no longer the 20-year-old Dongbaek
that you used to miss.

795
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,039
Dongbaek.

796
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,667
I know it's sad.

797
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:58,086
But we can't go back.

798
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:20,191
ONGSAN NOODLES

799
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,162
My gosh.

800
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,790
POLICE

801
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:42,130
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

802
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,307
Damn it.

803
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,310
I'm starting to get angry.

804
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,859
You don't look like a cat-lover.

805
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,489
Yong-sik was curious to know
who kept feeding the cats.

806
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:15,789
By the way...

807
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,250
What more do I need to do?

808
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,587
Should I get a divorce and beg?
Will you take me back then?

809
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,966
No, I won't take you back.
Hurry up and call a chauffeur service.

810
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,763
Is this because of that cop?

811
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,350
Do you trust him?

812
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:42,190
Doesn't he remind you of me
when I was 10 years younger?

813
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:47,070
When I heard you were sick,
I even ran away from an away match.

814
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:48,113
I was just like him.

815
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:53,284
I'd overreact every time I was happy
and act based on my emotions.

816
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,204
Why do you trust people so easily?

817
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,964
Did you just confess your sins?

818
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:10,051
Just because you're a jerk
doesn't mean everyone else is a jerk, too.

819
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:16,182
I guess he isn't as dumb
as I thought he'd be.

820
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,648
You may be a real scumbag,

821
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,276
but you're still Pil-gu's dad.

822
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,610
What? "A scumbag"?

823
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:31,489
And I think I've shown enough respect
for that.

824
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:32,949
But

825
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,828
eating noodles with her here

826
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,582
is where that respect ends.

827
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:44,502
You really should stop
being so clingy now.

828
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,671
Who do you think you are?

829
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:49,132
Why are you keep getting involved
like this?

830
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,551
Me? I'm an active player.

831
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:52,886
What?

832
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:56,181
I'm sure you already know
that you can't beat an active player,

833
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,266
no matter how good you were in the past.

834
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,937
Right now, I'm the guy that's next to her.

835
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,397
And Dongbaek

836
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,151
likes me, not you.

837
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,029
Don't think of Dongbaek and Pil-gu

838
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:13,823
as something you can take back.

839
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,950
What a complete freak.

840
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,579
Hey, who do you think you are
to talk about my son like that?

841
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,915
Dongbaek.

842
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,667
Listen to me carefully, okay?

843
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,589
From now on, don't ever eat noodles
with Kang Jeong-ryeol again.

844
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,717
Don't drink with him one on one.

845
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:36,554
And don't ever let him enter your bar.

846
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,141
I don't want you to be indecisive

847
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,602
and act wishy-washy.

848
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:44,354
I hate that kind of stuff.

849
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:45,939
Just don't do it.

850
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,151
And I personally think

851
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:53,363
I have the right to say this to you

852
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,074
considering what we did together.

853
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,786
What did you do? What did you guys do?

854
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:06,417
And I'm a guy who can get really jealous.

855
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,296
So come here and hold my hand.

856
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:11,798
This is unbelievable.

857
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:17,303
Hurry up and get over here!
Hurry up and hold my hand!

858
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,017
Let's go.

859
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:28,731
Damn it.

860
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,613
You'd better get your act together
from now on.

861
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,740
I'm going to do things my way now.

862
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,077
Are you going to stop being the nice guy?

863
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,288
My gosh, I'm done with that.

864
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:46,124
From now on,
I'm going to live as I please.

865
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,960
Are you finally getting your act together?

866
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,297
Since we settled that issue,

867
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,842
how about we go to that corner
and kiss each other?

868
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,552
-Hey.
-Gosh.

869
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,515
You look so happy.

870
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,476
No, things are a mess these days.

871
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,771
-What?
-Joker is right under my nose.

872
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,399
The contract for my bar is about to end.

873
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,318
My kid's dad is being a jerk.

874
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,404
And Pil-gu even found out about his dad.

875
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:26,164
My goodness.
Then why do you look so happy?

876
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:31,794
But what's weird is
that I smile a lot these days.

877
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:37,258
It's not the situation that matters.
I guess it's whom you're surrounded with.

878
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:38,801
My gosh.

879
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,388
I'm really happy these days.

880
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,352
I like you, Yong-sik.

881
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,608
Dongbaek, you should

882
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:56,569
close your bar early today.

883
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:02,367
My gosh, wait. Look at this.

884
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,540
She keeps getting prettier.

885
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,378
I guess her life is getting better.

886
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,758
I wonder if I'll get to be loved

887
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:23,429
by someone like that
once I go to Copenhagen

888
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,686
and live a life like my pretty name.

889
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,417
No.

890
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,169
She can't be dead.

891
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:12,562
Choi Go-un.

892
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,605
IDENTIFICATION CARD
CHOI GO-UN

893
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:15,982
Do you recognize her?

894
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,571
That's her real name.

895
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,821
You're going to watch Pil-gu's match?

896
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:04,864
Are you crazy?

897
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,866
You don't know
because you're new here.

898
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,701
She's an orphan.

899
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,661
It sucks to feel intimidated.

900
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:12,872
You raised Pil-gu with so much love.

901
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,791
So I'm sure he's different.

902
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,627
Mom! Mom, I'll hit a home run!

903
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,924
-Hey!
-Who's that kid?

904
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,384
It was a little weird.

905
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:26,928
He had a huge gambling debt.

906
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,765
You'd better be careful.

907
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:33,935
If you run into Joker, just shoot him.

908
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:37,021
