1
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:30,655
WHEN THE CAMELLIA BLOOMS

2
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,883
CAMELLIA

3
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,306
WHEN THE CAMELLIA BLOOMS

4
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,977
I LOVE ONLY YOU

5
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,899
CAMELLIA

6
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,696
I see she's having a fun life...

7
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,991
That kind of makes me quite annoyed.

8
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,639
-It's you again.
-What?

9
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,848
Weren't you here before?

10
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,435
You were covering your face with
a black hat and wearing a weird T-shirt.

11
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,563
I work here part-time.

12
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,441
I see. Go on in, then.

13
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,152
You're leaving? Don't you want to come in?

14
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:55,156
Well, don't mind me.
Go on in and start your shift.

15
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,158
It's just odd, you know.

16
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,911
I'd call you a customer
if you just went in.

17
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,163
Those who lurk around
fall under two categories.

18
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,084
They're either here to borrow money
or because they miss someone.

19
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,967
There must be a reason
you can't go into Dongbaek's diner.

20
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,888
You're a skilled saleswoman.

21
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,143
Yong-sik, do you have any idea

22
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,104
how much you're flustering me?

23
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,026
Dongbaek.

24
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,863
Dongbaek. You know Kang Jong-ryeol, right?

25
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,740
I wonder why Superman
keeps coming back here.

26
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,465
I don't think I can finish this.

27
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,884
This is the small size.

28
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:04,684
Nothing has changed in the past ten years.

29
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,761
Excuse me. I asked for
another bowl of rice earlier.

30
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,221
We're cooking more rice now.

31
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,433
What a pig.
Did he starve for days or what?

32
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,526
-Where's the kid?
-What?

33
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,695
I hope you feed him,
even if you're busy dating.

34
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,614
Where is he? It's getting late.

35
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,203
Have you ever raised
an eight-year-old kid?

36
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,248
-What?
-Do you know how busy eight-year-olds are?

37
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,961
I sell stir-fried pork to make sure
Pil-gu gets everything he needs.

38
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,631
Just go watch dolphin shows
with your dear daughter.

39
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,425
Don't make a fool of yourself
after all these years.

40
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,053
You watch that show?

41
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,181
But you said you even forgot my face.

42
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,476
They air reruns of that show all the time.

43
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,311
Ouch, it's so hot!

44
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,273
Are you all right? Gosh.

45
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,317
I'm fine.

46
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,238
Excuse me.

47
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,286
KANG PIL-GU

48
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,537
TO HWANG YONG-SIK, BE HAPPY!

49
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,206
Mr. Kang.

50
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,669
I know all your... What's that word?
Chants. I know all the chants.

51
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,839
One, two. One, two, three, four.

52
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,551
Jong-ryeol, go, Jong-ryeol

53
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,263
-Score a hit today, Jong-ryeol
-Was this Dongbaek's type?

54
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,306
Jong-ryeol!

55
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,267
-See? I know the whole chant!
-Jong-ryeol figured him all out

56
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,935
at their very first encounter.

57
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,355
I told you.
I wasn't just saying it to be polite.

58
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,899
I'm really your...

59
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,777
I'm a huge fan of yours.

60
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,363
-Right. I can see that.
-Yes.

61
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,740
He's seriously a fan?

62
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,409
Dongbaek. You know
Ten Million Kang Jong-ryeol, right?

63
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,037
No, I don't. I hate baseball.

64
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,788
What?

65
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,957
Still, how could you not know that?

66
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,625
-What's "Ten Million"?
-What?

67
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,170
Oh, I guess you ladies really don't know.

68
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,923
He led a crowd of ten million.

69
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,216
Hence the nickname.

70
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,802
Was that about ten years ago?

71
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,262
At the WBC finals...

72
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,140
It was Korea versus Japan.

73
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,226
During the Korea-Japan match
at the WBC finals,

74
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,188
he was standing there all spaced out
instead of running

75
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,065
to the third base from the second.

76
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,067
We totally lost to Japan
because of this guy.

77
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,569
Right after that...

78
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,905
My gosh.

79
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,573
He gained ten million anti-fans.

80
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,825
Hence the nickname,
Ten Million Jong-ryeol.

81
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,327
See? I know everything about you.

82
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,496
Sure.

83
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,915
Accurately speaking,
that was eight years ago.

84
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,125
What?

85
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,087
Was it eight years ago?

86
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,215
Hold on.

87
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,218
I heard you went to my elementary school
for a year as well.

88
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,804
We went to the same school,
and we're from the same town.

89
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,431
He should get some peanuts on the house,
don't you think?

90
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,600
No, I never offered.

91
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,645
Who are you to tell me
to give him peanuts on the house?

92
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,898
I guess you two aren't that close
after all.

93
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,566
Well...

94
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,946
Three seconds, okay?

95
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,864
CAMELLIA

96
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,082
Can I use this as my profile photo?

97
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,253
Sure, go ahead.

98
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,130
Thank you.

99
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,466
By the way, Yong-sik.

100
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:10,012
You didn't join the force
with your police exam scores, did you?

101
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,308
Please visit us again

102
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,895
next time you're in Chungcheong Province.

103
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,732
All right. You're talking
as if you own this place.

104
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,402
My gosh, this is like my business.

105
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,655
I mean, I'd like it to be.

106
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,867
He's just a country bumpkin.

107
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,245
How should I put this?

108
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,330
You seem down-to-earth.

109
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,958
"Down-to-earth"?

110
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,336
Yes. You seem pretty chill and easygoing.

111
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,256
-Your guy friends must really like you.
-Yes, they do.

112
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,343
I think a lot of ladies will find
that quality very charming.

113
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,263
"Very charming"?

114
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,432
They say mutts lot cuter
than purebred dogs.

115
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,394
In this world full of jerks
who have nothing but good looks...

116
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,481
a down-to-earth bumpkin is a real catch.

117
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,947
You're referring to me, right?

118
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:26,005
THE COUNTRY BOY

119
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,010
Are you serious about
escorting me every day?

120
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:36,098
I should at least escort you
to and from work every day.

121
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,893
As the charming...

122
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,230
As a police officer, I mean.

123
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,693
If you think about it, the words
weren't suddenly scribbled there.

124
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,905
Joker didn't kill me five years ago,

125
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,573
and it'll be harder to kill me now.

126
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,868
Why? Is it because I'm by your side?

127
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,038
No, because I'm a single mother.

128
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,625
It takes determination
to raise a boy all by yourself.

129
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,753
I'll be able to take on Joker one-on-one.

130
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,047
I survived the encounter,

131
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,758
and Joker quit killing after meeting me.

132
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,886
A weapon?

133
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,471
One was found at the scene?

134
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,182
It's the first time Joker
left a weapon at the scene,

135
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,017
but that's not all.

136
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,978
-Is it Joker?
-Is there a note?

137
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:22,937
There's a survivor.

138
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,523
A woman was alive at the scene.

139
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,441
Detective, any words?

140
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,943
Do you have any prints?

141
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,079
It's obvious that Joker was startled.

142
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,626
This woman must've caught him off guard.

143
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,892
Can you stand up?

144
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,614
You act tough, but I know you're scared.

145
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,326
Have you ever seen Joker?

146
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,493
What?

147
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,872
Others have only seen
stuff about Joker on TV,

148
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,499
but I even heard
Joker cough right in front of me.

149
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,668
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared.

150
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,838
I still get headaches and indigestion

151
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,131
when I dream of that day.

152
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,592
You even have dreams about that day?

153
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,763
Do you know what that is?
It's called PTSD.

154
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:44,143
To be honest, I got goosebumps
when I saw the note on the wall.

155
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,855
I shouldn't have told her.

156
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,860
If it alarmed you, why not
close the diner for a few days, and...

157
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,111
That's not necessary.

158
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:58,783
Back when the entire neighborhood
knew that I witnessed Joker,

159
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,535
I didn't close the diner for even a day.

160
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,873
Why should I be scared of some lunatic?

161
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,292
There's nothing Joker can do to me.

162
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,586
"You had better stay away."

163
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,422
I've been showing Joker that
for five years.

164
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,847
The people of this neighborhood
are not so bright, are they?

165
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,141
They don't see your claws.

166
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,393
My claws?

167
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,520
Yes.

168
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,023
Dogs that are scared
are the ones that bark.

169
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,858
Those that are easily scared

170
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,194
pick fights while trembling with fear.

171
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,907
At first sight, you may seem like a loser.

172
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,536
But truth be told, you are bold and brave.

173
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,375
I don't think I've ever heard that before.

174
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:55,673
Even though I've been
talking about protecting you,

175
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,591
I know better.

176
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,971
You're not the kind of woman
who needs saving.

177
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,976
Up until I was about 10,
I used to beat boys up.

178
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,856
Actually, it's what makes you seem

179
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,733
sexier.

180
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,193
Are you insane? My gosh.

181
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:26,120
CAMELLIA

182
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,051
I can't just keep calling Heung-sik
to unclog the drain.

183
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,557
How is this any better
than being homeless?

184
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,341
Should I ask Dongbaek
if I can occupy a room?

185
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:27,097
If she knows that
all the deposit she paid is gone,

186
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,017
even someone like Dongbaek would go nuts.

187
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,480
When will I make 100 million won
at this rate?

188
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,566
When will I be able to go to Copenhagen?

189
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,084
I want to go skiing, too.

190
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,587
I respect you.

191
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,383
Respect?

192
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,511
Respect?

193
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,389
Respect...

194
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,191
What's this?

195
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,863
No Gyu-tae, a man with a heart
clearer than Ongsan crabs' insides.

196
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,741
I am the people's servant
who knows their reeds.

197
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,331
Needs.

198
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,293
What now?

199
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,254
You know the people's "reeds"?

200
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,173
Are you talking about
a reed field or what?

201
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,217
It's "needs," not "reeds."

202
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,511
The public's needs.

203
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,222
Not reeds, but needs.

204
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,057
Damn it.

205
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,726
-If you don't know--
-What?

206
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,103
Just use Korean words.
I already told you this.

207
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,316
Why are you reading my profile anyway?

208
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,278
Why read it, darn it?

209
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,197
As your wife, am I not
allowed to read your profile?

210
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,158
It's a typo.

211
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,911
Needs, okay? I know how to spell it.

212
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,203
Spell it then.

213
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,456
Whatever. Just correct the word.

214
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,919
You don't even respect me, do you?

215
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,462
What?

216
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,173
My own house is a prison for me
mentally and physically.

217
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,842
It's your fault that we were
never able to have a son

218
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,010
to carry on my bloodline.

219
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,971
Yes, of course.

220
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:36,185
I'm 99 percent sure that it's only a joke.

221
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,608
-What's this?
-What now?

222
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,742
Hyang-mi!

223
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,620
Did you burn this off with a lighter?

224
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,705
This is a non-smoking zone.

225
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,752
Chief?

226
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,172
It's really nothing, right?

227
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,591
Oh, right.

228
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,053
Joker was almost like a trend back then.

229
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,641
I should erase it. It just creeps me out.

230
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,685
Dongbaek,

231
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,896
-did you--
-It's nothing.

232
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,566
It's nothing at all.

233
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,905
It's better not to get scared
by something so frivolous.

234
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,283
So don't fret over it.

235
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,123
Why do you both seem uncomfortable?

236
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,542
-What?
-Nonsense.

237
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,128
No way.

238
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:50,551
Pil-gu shakes his legs like that
after he secretly goes to the arcade.

239
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,970
What is it?

240
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,392
Why is that...

241
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,397
Dongbaek...

242
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,067
the security camera outside works, right?

243
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,701
So someone came in the night

244
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,786
and burned off that memo?

245
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,666
Would anyone but Joker
be crazy enough to do this?

246
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,669
Let's not jump to conclusions

247
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,504
and check the security footage first.

248
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,214
We'll move strategically

249
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,550
while considering
Dongbaek's safety as a priority.

250
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,010
When did you become the Chief?

251
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,970
Whether it's really Joker or not,

252
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,723
someone broke into her diner.

253
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,183
Why are you getting worked up?

254
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,268
Have you been to Yeong-sim's place?

255
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,354
Enough with Yeong-sim already!

256
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,608
Did you just yell at your chief?

257
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,903
You're really being disrespectful!

258
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:56,283
Sir, you're a police chief.
How can you have such a big mouth?

259
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,327
You could've said it was nothing,

260
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,954
but you just had to ask her
about the security cameras.

261
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,206
Fine.

262
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,251
You're the only one who cares
and is competent.

263
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,295
Unbelievable.

264
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,340
I barely built her confidence up again,

265
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,551
but you just had to scare her.

266
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,262
You...

267
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,265
Why scare someone with doe eyes?

268
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,892
Doe eyes?

269
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:26,230
Korea is a constitutional state, you know.

270
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,357
Everyone has the right

271
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,694
to sell stir-fried pork without
having to feel threatened.

272
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,154
What is it?

273
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,449
You...

274
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,286
What? Okay, fine. You're right.

275
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,957
Gosh, look at you.

276
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,416
Unbelievable.

277
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,087
You're finally a true police officer.

278
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,464
Look at your sense of duty!

279
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,884
Doe eyes...

280
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,220
Doe eyes?

281
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,305
Chief,

282
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,976
you didn't join the force
with your police exam scores, did you?

283
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,822
I'm not just going to sit back
if he attacks me.

284
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,615
Aren't you scared?

285
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,409
No, I'm brave.

286
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,036
I'm brave, so why would I be scared?

287
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:27,124
You really have balls, don't you?

288
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,294
You'll understand once you have kids.

289
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,713
Your child's tuition

290
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,132
is scarier than some killer.

291
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,639
Mom, let's go.

292
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,141
But you're not done eating.

293
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,227
Why don't you eat as much as you used to?

294
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,733
You'll be tired the first day,
so you'll go to bed right away.

295
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,320
The next day, we'll have a friendly match
with Qingdao Elementary School.

296
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,655
And the next day,
we're off to an amusement park.

297
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,075
ONGSAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

298
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,077
Be too chatty,
and it's off the table, got it?

299
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,329
-Yes.
-Yes.

300
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,748
-Answer me louder!
-Yes!

301
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,541
Now, enjoy your snacks.

302
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,353
I hear you're not going
to China with the others.

303
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,900
Why not?

304
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,027
I don't want to.

305
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,404
Why not?

306
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,865
Even without the off-season training,

307
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:46,078
I'm still better at baseball
than Jong-gu in the fourth grade.

308
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,833
Really? You're better than Jong-gu?

309
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,212
Everyone tells me that I was born a star.

310
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,302
Besides, it's not even training.

311
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,471
They're off to have fun.

312
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,975
Going to Qingdao will be nice.

313
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,435
You'll eat lamb steaks and
go to an amusement park.

314
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,062
Well, 480,000 won

315
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,648
is enough to enjoy

316
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,733
all of that here.

317
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,530
With 480,000 won,

318
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,199
I can play 1,000 games at the arcade

319
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,077
and maybe even visit the US.

320
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,789
My mom wouldn't have to sell
48 dishes of stir-fried pork.

321
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,004
-Are you kidding me?
-Losers.

322
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,048
Who goes to training camps anyway?

323
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,259
Why is everyone going?

324
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,636
Are you saying that you won't go

325
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,431
because it costs 480,000 won?

326
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,725
Those who are going are losers.

327
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,227
I'll never be one of them.

328
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,986
Don't tell me you starve yourself, too.

329
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,196
Sir, could you look this way?

330
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,906
Please smile.

331
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,034
-Sure.
-This way, please.

332
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,370
-Can you look this way too?
-Looking good.

333
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,705
This way too, sir.

334
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,125
Could we get a big smile? Great.

335
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,419
Can we get another smile? Thank you.

336
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,505
Let's look at that camera.

337
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,924
-Be natural, please.
-Smile!

338
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,176
Sure thing.

339
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,845
ONGSAN VOLUNTEER CLUB

340
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,181
-Can we get another big smile?
-Sure thing.

341
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,935
-All right.
-That's nice.

342
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,480
Right. He's the best.

343
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,565
Why the hell is he doing this?

344
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,401
He wants to be nominated
as a candidate, that's why.

345
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,570
You're all doing great.

346
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,410
Was I drunk? Am I that old?

347
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,080
I didn't ask you to carry me like that.

348
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,873
Unbelievable.

349
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,918
I was just being a loyal member, sir.

350
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,586
I bet it was for the camera.

351
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,713
Not exactly, sir.

352
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,424
Making it seem like we're close

353
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,759
won't get you a nomination.

354
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,553
I'm busy looking out for myself.

355
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:13,225
I've been meaning to
invite a masu salmon place to you.

356
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,185
I only take my close friends there,

357
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,853
and it serves sushi as well as stew--

358
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,188
You're so ridiculous.

359
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,401
Why would you invite
a masu salmon place to me?

360
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:28,031
How do you expect to do politics
when you can barely speak proper Korean?

361
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,662
How you married a lawyer is beyond me.

362
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,331
Let's go.

363
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,876
I'm sorry, sir.
Jeez, must I endure this humiliation?

364
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,963
Gosh, I just made a small mistake.

365
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,966
A true leader would never
humiliate people in public like that.

366
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,803
This is exactly why
I want to get political power.

367
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,931
Shit.

368
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,100
Damn it.

369
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,771
No, I'd rather not show you.

370
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,984
I know you were humiliated,
but don't take it out on us.

371
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,235
I'll never show you.

372
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,945
Come on.

373
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,823
There's no need for this.

374
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,826
You're abusing government authority
to invade my property.

375
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,203
Why must I show you
my building's security footage?

376
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,080
Do you have an arrest warrant?

377
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,124
Do you want to be arrested?

378
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,834
Why would we arrest you?

379
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,587
Jeez, it's like talking to a wall.

380
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,256
What do you mean? There's no wall here.

381
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,676
I didn't mean it in the literal sense.
Unbelievable.

382
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,096
Get going, will you? Just wait over there.

383
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,974
He's someone I'll never get along with.

384
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,732
Why? Did someone get mugged on the street?

385
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:48,236
No, it looks like
someone broke into Camellia.

386
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,114
They broke in after the place was closed,

387
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,074
so Dongbaek is fine.

388
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,077
Well, you know...

389
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,499
-what about...
-Nothing was really stolen, either.

390
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,876
No, not that. You know.

391
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:04,711
What about Hyang-mi?

392
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,089
Do you only care about whether
Dongbaek is okay?

393
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,217
She's completely fine.

394
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:14,346
So can you give us the security footage?

395
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,475
I still can't show you that.

396
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:23,396
Come on, don't be so stubborn.
You're going to show it to us anyway.

397
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,898
I mean,

398
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:26,983
you know.

399
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,781
It's a fake.

400
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,700
What?

401
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,789
There's no reason to put up
a security camera on such a street.

402
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,959
We just put up a fake camera.

403
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,839
Gosh, Chief Byeon. Do we have to continue
to talk to a guy like him as officers?

404
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,800
"A guy like him"? What's wrong with me?

405
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,426
Who are you to judge me?

406
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,345
Is your life nothing but fake?

407
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,723
It may be a fake, but it's effective.

408
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,351
He bought bread, milk, and ribeye.

409
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,895
So you need to stop writing

410
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,982
malicious comments about
Kang Jong-ryeol on the internet, okay?

411
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,108
-Yes.
-Yes.

412
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,693
-Louder!
-Yes!

413
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,445
-Good.
-Do you like ribeye?

414
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,448
Why do you keep talking to me?
I can't focus.

415
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,158
Do you know how expensive it is?

416
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,452
I need to know if you like it
at the very least.

417
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,454
Are you going to pay?

418
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,332
Then what?
Did you think I would make you pay?

419
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,961
Then instead of ribeye...

420
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,050
ONGSAN MARINATED CRAB

421
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,511
I can't believe a kid like you
loves marinated crabs.

422
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,514
I always eat there for free.

423
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,642
The grandma swears a lot,
but she's a nice lady.

424
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:51,192
A constable isn't someone who figures out
the parent dogs of someone's puppies.

425
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:55,113
Yeong-sim is determined to kill you
because you never came around.

426
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,450
Gosh, sitting around
peeling garlic during lunchtime

427
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,909
isn't in my job description.

428
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,580
Ms. Kwak, I brought
all these customers here.

429
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,583
-I brought them.
-What's going on?

430
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,253
Goodness, Mr. Kang. What brings you here?

431
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,255
-Goodness, we meet again.
-Mr. Kang.

432
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,340
Yes.

433
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,344
I brought him here. Ms. Kwak,
get his autograph and put it on the wall.

434
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,638
-All right.
-Ms. Kwak, I'm here too.

435
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,808
Seung-yeop. Why do you
drag around kids in a huge group?

436
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,976
Are you the Pied Piper?

437
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,062
Eat up.

438
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:33,193
Pil-gu, here. Eat up.

439
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,781
Why did you join us here?

440
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,616
I'm going to pay for my food.

441
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,535
Shouldn't you be
out on patrol or something?

442
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,497
Police officers have to eat, too.

443
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,416
Right, you should eat.

444
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,670
And I'm the restaurant owner's son.

445
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,714
-I'm the restaurant's...
-Do you want soda?

446
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,759
-No.
-...successor. I'm the successor.

447
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,637
-But I have to split it with my brothers.
-I see.

448
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,726
You don't like carrots?

449
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,311
No.

450
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,023
Wait, do you not eat cucumbers either?

451
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,443
How did you know?

452
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:24,160
Hey, you need to eat everything
to grow taller.

453
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,997
See? You're the smallest one here
because you're a picky eater.

454
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,291
He'll grow later on.

455
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,002
He'll become at least 180cm
once he hits high school.

456
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,215
How do you know that, Mr. Kang?

457
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,302
I just meant that
some kids grow up slowly.

458
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,182
Do you want more rice?

459
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,227
No, I'll eat his food.

460
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,312
-Did you say you're done?
-Yes.

461
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:52,981
Wait, that's...

462
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,116
I know it's a kid's food...

463
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,703
but you're really easygoing.

464
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:11,750
The baseball club couldn't go on
the school trip because of training.

465
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,503
We call it an off-season training,
but it's more like a trip for the kids.

466
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:20,717
Why don't you send
all of them to the off-season training?

467
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,635
I'll cover the cost.

468
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,180
Wait, what? Why?

469
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:29,142
You know, it's kind of like
giving a scholarship.

470
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,772
I knew it. Your alma mater is
the best place to go back for votes.

471
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,399
Why did you offer to carry my bag?

472
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:37,984
What?

473
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,862
I'm just making an excuse to go there,
so don't mind me.

474
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,073
Pil-gu, do you bat left-handed?

475
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,158
Mom!

476
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,789
Mom! I'm going to China.

477
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,334
-What?
-They'll let all of us go on scholarship.

478
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,669
So I can go, too. This is amazing.

479
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,087
The off-season training?

480
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:02,133
Yes, Ho-jun in the fourth grade and I were
the only ones who couldn't go,

481
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,301
but we can go, too.

482
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,888
We're going to go to an amusement park
and have lamb, too.

483
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,473
What else would we do?

484
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,809
Pil-gu, did you want to go?

485
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:14,437
-Of course. I'll even ride a plane.
-Then why did you say you weren't going?

486
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,898
It costs 480,000 won,
and you have no money.

487
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,902
-Of course I do.
-You always say,

488
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,988
"I don't have any money at all."

489
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,658
I didn't really mean that.

490
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,285
You don't have to worry about that
at the age of eight.

491
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,037
That Kang Jong-ryeol guy must be insane.

492
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,331
-What?
-He's covering the whole cost.

493
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,667
CAMELLIA

494
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,773
I said I'll help out,
not do the whole thing by myself.

495
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,488
Don't put it in there.

496
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,408
Dongbaek, isn't this container
your best friend's?

497
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,119
Yes, I left it there
to take it back to her.

498
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,124
Dongbaek must have a friend
in the neighborhood.

499
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,501
She does.
The toughest woman in the neighborhood.

500
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,173
She sounds dependable.

501
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,477
Pil-gu, are you that happy?

502
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,480
You're getting everything wrong,
yet you're humming.

503
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,400
Yes, I don't even have to
play games at the arcade.

504
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,154
Pil-gu, you can go to the arcade.

505
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,323
I'll let you go three times in a month.

506
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,410
Are you also happy
that I'm going to China for free?

507
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,080
No, it feels awful.

508
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:57,999
Why?

509
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,752
I want you to just think about

510
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,004
ditching your academy
and going to the arcade.

511
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,882
I don't want you to think about

512
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,885
how many pork dishes I have to sell
to make 480,000 won.

513
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,475
If you become all grown-up
when you aren't even 140cm tall,

514
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,227
I would feel guilty, wouldn't I?

515
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,357
When am I going to slice
all of the radish?

516
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,859
Do you all battle to see
how much kimchi you can make?

517
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,319
Who's going to eat all this?

518
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,530
If we share a box each,
it'll be gone in no time.

519
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,617
Sharing your kimchi with everyone is
the fun in making kimchi.

520
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:37,205
If you're going to share,
share it with everyone.

521
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,165
Don't leave out the outcasts.

522
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:42,335
Why would I give it to an outcast?
I don't give any to people I hate.

523
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,629
I won't give it to people
who got on my bad side.

524
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,883
That's for your eldest brother,
that's for your second brother,

525
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,802
and that's for my bestie.

526
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,805
Your bestie? You have a bestie?

527
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:58,017
Why? Am I not allowed
to have a best friend?

528
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,520
Gosh, this town loves to have besties.

529
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,522
Who? The lady at the rice cake place?

530
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,399
DONGBAEK

531
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,067
Dongbaek.

532
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,657
Dongbaek is coming.

533
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,338
-Hop in.
-Why?

534
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:31,551
-It looks heavy.
-It's right around the corner. Forget it.

535
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,596
Come on, just get in.

536
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,563
Goodness, you've got the best manners.

537
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:46,524
You don't always
have to fill it up with food.

538
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,863
Ms. Kwak, how much do young
radishes cost? Aren't they expensive?

539
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:55,533
It's 7,000 won for a bundle.
Might as well call them golden radishes.

540
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,702
Gosh, but you gave me so much.

541
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,414
You haven't met my youngest son, have you?

542
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,915
Hey, where is he?

543
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,252
Helena, where did he go?

544
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:07,920
I have no idea.

545
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,426
I'm sure she knows how to speak politely,
but she keeps doing that.

546
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,471
Do you mean your youngest son
who recently came back?

547
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,764
Yes.

548
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:21,267
But it looks like he ran away
while cutting the radishes.

549
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,936
-He ran away?
-I think so.

550
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,773
It's his specialty
since his agricultural high school days.

551
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:30,359
What? Why are you telling her
stories from that time? Wait.

552
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,321
He never studied
and ran off all the time since then,

553
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,823
and reached his peak
as the bottom of his class.

554
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,617
He got the worst grades? Goodness.

555
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,786
Yes, exactly three times.

556
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,706
My gosh, what's with her?

557
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,458
I believe that

558
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,711
being in last place is
as tough as being in first place.

559
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,298
But he's always like that.

560
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,801
His life is either all or nothing.

561
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,056
The men of Ongsan
must tend to be that way.

562
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,225
Why? Is someone else like that, too?

563
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:07,146
Well, there's this guy
who has recently been coming to my place.

564
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,735
He reminds me of a grizzly bear.

565
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,072
Don't get mixed up with men
who are like bears.

566
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:19,242
They're too tacky. You can never fix that.

567
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:26,582
But among bears,
Winnie the Pooh is sort of cute, right?

568
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:31,462
Anyway, you put on a dress for once.

569
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:35,800
Is it too short? You can see my knees.

570
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:39,178
Don't worry about other people
and dress cutely like a vixen.

571
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,930
A vixen?

572
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,516
Then you can get married to some guy

573
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,727
who's nice and healthy
and says you're beautiful.

574
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:51,315
You're saying that again.
I have enough in my hands with Pil-gu.

575
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,360
A single mother
is a burden to Pil-gu, too.

576
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:58,990
And you can't live your whole life
only living as Pil-gu's mom.

577
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,868
They're only your dear children
while they're with you.

578
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,705
Once your children get married
and leave your side,

579
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:09,292
you'll be like an empty shell
like Du-sik and Gyu-sik's mom.

580
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,545
So even if you might get divorced,
you should get married.

581
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,465
It's a lonely journey to live as a widow.

582
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,223
You could have just come in.
Why did you tell me to hop in?

583
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,059
I heard someone broke in there.

584
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,854
No idea. Someone apparently
came in or something.

585
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,064
But the diligent Dongbaek
won't take a day off.

586
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,442
Then do you

587
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,694
have respect for Dongbaek, too?

588
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,571
What?

589
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,157
Who else in Ongsan do you respect?

590
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,493
-Respect?
-Do you have a few men that you respect?

591
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,996
Respect, my ass.

592
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,665
If I had even three men in my life
that I respected,

593
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,293
I wouldn't be living my life like this.

594
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,883
If you're bored,
open up the glove compartment.

595
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,760
Why?

596
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,432
What is this? You're making me anxious.

597
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,603
Notes are meant to be opened and read.

598
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,026
I didn't pick it up on the way here.

599
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,987
I made a single payment for that
with my credit card.

600
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,280
Take a day off and go.

601
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,199
With whom? You?

602
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,243
If you want to go separately,
that works, too.

603
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,496
-Just you and me?
-If you want me to drive, I will.

604
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:32,208
But if you want to get there
by taking the bus, that works too.

605
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,836
Did I just sound kind of cool?

606
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,215
Gyu-tae, what is this ticket
for water skiing?

607
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:46,514
What do you think? Skiing is just skiing.

608
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,307
Skiing.

609
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,018
I mean, it's not kissing.
We're just going skiing.

610
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,396
Do I have to be so innocent
to go water skiing?

611
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,856
Kissing? Did you just make a dad joke?

612
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,316
Kissing?

613
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,444
What in the world am I saying?

614
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,572
Skiing. Skiing, skiing,

615
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,324
kissing, kissing.

616
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,077
-Are you flirting with me?
-What?

617
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,163
Why are your ears burning up
in front of me?

618
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,332
That's kind of cute.

619
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,218
-Dongbaek, this way.
-No.

620
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,263
I really don't want you to come now.

621
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,975
Okay, then. I will follow you
about five steps behind you.

622
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,645
No, I don't want you to be

623
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,940
within 500m of my reach around the market.

624
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:45,865
Well, technically speaking,
the market is barely over 400m long.

625
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:49,744
Don't you think 500m is a bit too much?

626
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,204
Yong-sik.

627
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,416
Have you ever lived your life
as a single mother

628
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,418
who runs a restaurant
that also sells liquor?

629
00:38:58,919 --> 00:38:59,920
Pardon?

630
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:05,259
If you did, you would know how awful it is
to have everyone talk about you.

631
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,263
I am

632
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,225
not a single mother with an infant.

633
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,020
Pil-gu is really quick with things.

634
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:20,024
I just let you follow me around
because you made an excuse saying that

635
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,692
you're doing it as a police officer.

636
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:27,198
So I hope you can
also respect me as a mom, Yong-sik.

637
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,329
Sure.

638
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,044
Wait, Dongbaek.

639
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:48,135
If a man and a woman
secretly get involved with each other,

640
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,472
it can start a rumor and hearsay.

641
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,895
But if I just say directly, "I like her.

642
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,439
I like her so much.

643
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,359
I don't care what you say,
I like Dongbaek so much.

644
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,612
And liking this amazing woman is...
That's...

645
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,031
Yes, that's my pride!"

646
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:13,702
If I do that, no one will say a thing.

647
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:16,956
I believe

648
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,585
that it's a better way of showing manners.

649
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:28,092
Come to think about it, I was never...

650
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,015
Should I go there
if it's your colleague's wedding?

651
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,394
How am I going to introduce you?

652
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,896
It'll be too troublesome
if a scandal breaks out.

653
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,487
I was never the pride of someone.

654
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,299
Why does he keep grinning like that?

655
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:18,434
Yong-sik, stop pretending like
you're there to eat injeolmi.

656
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:19,768
Go on over there.

657
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,233
My gosh, he left as soon as I told him to.

658
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,444
It's 8,000 won?

659
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,530
Why did it get so expensive?

660
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:33,824
Do you want it or not?

661
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,578
From what I heard,
it normally costs 7,000 won.

662
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,955
Then go buy it somewhere else.

663
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,541
We're the only ones
selling young radishes around here.

664
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,251
But...

665
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,463
These young radishes are very mysterious.

666
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,925
My mom told me that she bought them
for 7,000 won yesterday.

667
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,344
So why are you asking her for 8,000 won?

668
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,846
You're totally ruining the market economy

669
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,015
through monopolization.
It's an economic offense.

670
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,518
I get that you like her.

671
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,144
But you can't do this to someone

672
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,396
who used to take care of you
since you were young.

673
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,940
What? An economic what?

674
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,485
We were talking about young radishes.
Don't change the subject.

675
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:12,738
Sometimes I get confused
if Yong-sik's a police officer in Ongsan

676
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,990
or a bodyguard for Dongbaek.

677
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,617
Exactly.

678
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:21,622
Yeong-sim's always
waiting for Yong-sik to show up.

679
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:26,460
But Yong-sik's always busy
following Dongbaek around.

680
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,045
That darn Yeong-sim.

681
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,422
You can't do this to us.

682
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,342
We're the ones who raised you, you know.

683
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:37,346
Your mother will get heartbroken
if she finds out that you're doing this,

684
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,973
you naive little punk.

685
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,891
-I was just--
-No, it's okay.

686
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,561
I'll come back and buy them next time.

687
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,437
But...

688
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,317
You'd better not try to rip her off again.

689
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,237
I'll buy all the young radishes
before you do.

690
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,032
Yong-sik.

691
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,828
I just want to pay 8,000 won
for young radishes.

692
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,329
Things were better in the past.

693
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,915
You know those ladies over there?

694
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:08,377
If I get new shoes or a perm,
they're already gossiping about me.

695
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,714
They think I'm trying to seduce you.

696
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,091
Dongbaek.

697
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,720
Do you care if Ms. Jeong
gets a pair of new shoes?

698
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,598
Starting from your perm to your shoes,

699
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,392
why do you think they're so interested
in everything you do?

700
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,354
Are you going to say
it's because I'm pretty?

701
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:30,649
No.

702
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,279
That's a given.

703
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,781
My gosh, I knew it.
I'm so sick of that line.

704
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,950
It's because you're...

705
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,495
What do you call it?
You're the celebrity in Ongsan.

706
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:47,666
The fact that they're so interested
in how you live

707
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:51,503
shows how much you stand out
in the neighborhood.

708
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:55,090
Gosh, you don't even know
how popular you are.

709
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,926
No wonder you don't get me
being upset about the rip-off.

710
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:02,181
How can you be more stupid than I am?

711
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,434
I got good grades up until fourth grade.

712
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,478
Then why don't you know how I feel?

713
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,773
Even the dogs in our neighborhood know.
Why are you the only one who doesn't?

714
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:14,234
Why do you always end a conversation
with a love confession?

715
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,403
I guess Dongbaek really is charming.

716
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,907
Yong-sik seems to have fallen
head over heels for her.

717
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,702
I thought I was watching a soap opera.

718
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:27,081
Yong-sik looked like he'd attack us
if we did anything to Dongbaek.

719
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,501
I thought Yong-sik was
only interested in soccer,

720
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:31,877
but he's quite the romantic.

721
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,837
My gosh, Yong-sik.

722
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,923
Are you badmouthing my son?

723
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,424
Gosh, you startled me.

724
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,386
Did Seung-yeop go around telling you guys?

725
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,013
Did you hear about it?

726
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:48,143
Will you just leave him be?
Just let him take care of himself.

727
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:53,399
-You're really going to leave him be?
-Yong-sik can be very cunning.

728
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,566
What?

729
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:58,153
I thought he was a complete fool
who knew absolutely nothing.

730
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,906
But it turns out
that he's a man of great ambition.

731
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,367
First, he flirts with a lawyer.

732
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,286
And then, he says he wants
to take over my restaurant.

733
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,206
-Do you have some fresh rice cakes?
-Yes.

734
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,334
-Let me make him some rice cake soup.
-The rice cakes are inside.

735
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,920
-What lawyer?
-She's totally mistaken.

736
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,548
She's mistaken, right? A lawyer, my ass.

737
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:18,799
How much would you like?

738
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:22,052
You acting like this
will only humiliate me.

739
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,473
They'll think of me as a cunning brat
who seduced a bachelor.

740
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,935
I don't want people saying that about you.

741
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,521
Then what do you think you need to do?

742
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,857
Do I really need to teach you
like I teach Pil-gu?

743
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,611
If anyone makes a fool out of you,
I'll teach them a lesson.

744
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,990
But I obviously shouldn't do that.

745
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,491
That's exactly what I'm saying.

746
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,911
Can you at least pretend
like you don't like me?

747
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:53,876
But every time I try to hide my feelings,
it just doesn't work.

748
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,590
It's always better to be honest.
Don't you agree?

749
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,925
I'm not brazen enough to lie.

750
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,469
And I think it's way worse

751
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,097
to try cheap tricks while
pretending to be indifferent.

752
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,600
That would make you seem more like a joke.

753
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:14,730
You see,

754
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,316
I'm going to do things my way.

755
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:20,736
What do you mean by that?

756
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,865
Why are you making that expression?

757
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,579
I'll make sure that

758
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,665
no one in Ongsan says
you're the one hitting on me.

759
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,210
No one will be able to call you
a cunning brat.

760
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,921
I'll make sure of that.

761
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:42,549
Yong-sik.

762
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,635
Where are you going?

763
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,137
Yong-sik!

764
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,770
-Ms. Park!
-My goodness.

765
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,688
Why did he just yell?

766
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,775
Dongbaek isn't trying to seduce me!

767
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,527
I'm the one trying to seduce her!

768
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,445
No...

769
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,782
Hey, you'd better get going.

770
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:10,160
Dongbaek asked me to stay
400m away from her.

771
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,120
But I just can't stop liking her.

772
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:15,165
I'm the one trying to seduce her!
I'm the cunning brat!

773
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,125
Okay, I get it. Now, get going.

774
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:20,170
Yong-sik, I'll sell the young radishes
for 7,000 won.

775
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,298
-Stop yelling and come with me.
-Let me go. Stop it.

776
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,385
It's not like we did anything
to be ashamed of!

777
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:29,221
We're not committing adultery!
We're not cheating on someone!

778
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,182
I like her! That's all there is to it!

779
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,894
I like her, okay? I like her!

780
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,323
Yong-sik threw a fit
and confessed his love for me.

781
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:49,658
And pretty soon...

782
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,452
You guys keep telling me
that you practically raised me!

783
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,748
Then you should like the woman I like!
Don't you agree with me?

784
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,380
What are you saying?

785
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,841
You like who?

786
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,429
Mom, what were you doing in there?

787
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:11,930
"Mom"?

788
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,019
"Mom"?

789
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:20,314
And pretty soon,
I was going to lose my best friend.

790
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,401
From the untouchable Ms. Kwak
to the uncontrollable Yong-sik.

791
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,906
The person I could depend on
was slowly changing.

792
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,706
You said so yourself
that I'm either all or nothing.

793
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,042
I decided to put in my all for Dongbaek.

794
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,262
You should stay and drink with me.

795
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,222
Who are you going water-skiing with?

796
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,558
Why are you drinking all of a sudden?

797
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,560
What about the co-op gathering?

798
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,562
I can't go there.

799
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,648
No one has my back anymore.

800
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,197
If I were in her shoes,
I wouldn't have liked it, either.

801
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,116
Who would like Dongbaek?

802
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,453
Then you should close the bar early today.

803
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,455
I'll see you later.

804
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,291
Be careful.

805
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,549
I guess you won't be drinking alone.

806
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,400
Why did you pay for his training fee?

807
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,486
Why would you make a kid
worry about 480,000 won?

808
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:55,492
Do you really have to be nosy
about my life like that?

809
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,787
You might not understand
because you're successful,

810
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,414
but things are different for me.

811
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,541
Why? Because all you do is run a bar?

812
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,960
Let me ask you.

813
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,170
Why does it have to be a bar?

814
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,339
You know this place
doesn't suit you, right?

815
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,259
It does suit me. I'm good at what I do.

816
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,844
Did you get scammed or something?

817
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:17,764
What made you want to sell alcohol?

818
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,683
You encouraged me.

819
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,810
What?

820
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,353
Every time I cooked for you,

821
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,272
you'd always say the same thing.

822
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,774
Why do you always crave alcohol
every time you eat?

823
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,152
How can I resist alcohol
when the food is so good?

824
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,822
Every food you cook
makes me crave alcohol.

825
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,366
You make the best side dishes for alcohol.

826
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,172
That was the first time
I ever heard anyone tell me

827
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,340
that I'm the best at something.

828
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,843
You're driving me crazy.

829
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:58,096
We all make a living
doing what we're good at.

830
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,141
You play baseball
since that's what you're good at.

831
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:05,187
And I make the best stir-fried pork,
so I run a bar.

832
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:09,107
I mean, come on.
Was I that important to you?

833
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:14,571
Was I important enough
to influence you like this?

834
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,158
I didn't have any friends or family.
What you said mattered that much.

835
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:21,328
If I knew you were going to do this,
I wouldn't have said that.

836
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,747
You're seriously making me go crazy.

837
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,628
Will you just leave me alone?
I'm just trying to make a living.

838
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,964
Why do you sell alcohol?

839
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:34,758
Tell me the truth.

840
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,468
To be honest, it's because...

841
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:42,390
I earn 3,500 won
every time I sell a bottle of soju.

842
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:47,229
I didn't learn much,
and I'm only good at cooking.

843
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:49,064
Plus, I need to raise Pil-gu.

844
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,483
There's not much to think about.

845
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,195
I'll do all the hard and dirty work.

846
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,864
And when Pil-gu enters the MLB draft,

847
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,075
I want to give him
a bankbook filled with money.

848
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,830
Then I'd be able to call that
a successful life.

849
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,128
You could've at least lived a good life.

850
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,256
There's no need to get upset.

851
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:17,300
You continue to live your life,
and I'll do the same with mine.

852
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,888
Then why are you still
wearing that bracelet?

853
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:27,352
This... This is just a habit.

854
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:28,812
It's good for my health.

855
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,859
If you were going to live like this...

856
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,863
you should've just stayed.

857
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,281
Or you should've...

858
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:43,785
at least made sure I'd never find you.

859
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,831
The fact that we met
really isn't a big deal.

860
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,792
We just met by coincidence.
Nothing has to change.

861
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,170
Just ignore me and keep going your way.

862
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,839
Would you be able to do that
if you were in my shoes?

863
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:59,009
I just found out
that you're raising my son.

864
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,636
Just pretend I don't exist.

865
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,430
You've been living fine until now.

866
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:06,558
What are you talking about?
I was never fine.

867
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,143
I'm so sick of things.

868
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,491
I still think about you, too.

869
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,206
People can't just forget about each other.

870
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,041
What's the point of trying to forget?

871
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,919
If you suddenly come to my mind,
I just think of you

872
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,463
and continue to live my life.

873
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,300
It's not like we're going to meet again.

874
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,054
And it's not like I can do anything...

875
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,556
if you pop into my head.

876
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,768
We just need to live our lives
without doing anything embarrassing.

877
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,229
Forget all that nonsense.

878
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,566
Now that I saw you living like this,
how do you...

879
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,278
How...

880
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,700
How do you expect me to ignore you?

881
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,207
Do you know

882
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,960
why they call me Ten Million Jong-ryeol?

883
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,130
The day I zoned out and couldn't run

884
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:23,385
from 2nd to 3rd base was March 12th, 2012.

885
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,182
Seriously.

886
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,185
I'm so sick of this.

887
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,820
CAMELLIA

888
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,995
She should at least be living a good life.

889
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,414
She's so damn nice.

890
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,836
Why can't she live a good life?

891
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,059
My gosh, what brings you here?

892
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:14,769
You should go inside.

893
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,107
Did you drink here?

894
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:23,236
No, I didn't drink. I can drive.

895
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,655
That's not what I'm concerned about.

896
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,701
I asked you because I wanted to know
why you came here again.

897
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,833
Do I need to answer that question?

898
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,379
Why are your eyes red?

899
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,965
That's really none of your business.

900
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,720
The thing is, I feel...

901
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,057
I feel...

902
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,060
really uneasy for some reason.

903
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,276
Let me tell you one more thing, then.

904
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,820
Don't mess around with Dongbaek.

905
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:08,656
"Dongbaek"?

906
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:12,660
You don't need to make things worse
by constantly hitting on her.

907
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,622
She already has a tough life.

908
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,476
How am I going to face Ms. Kwak now?

909
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,853
You shouldn't come here anymore.

910
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,147
Did you cry?

911
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:48,655
Did you cry?

912
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,991
Yes, I did.

913
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,620
I should cry if I feel sad.

914
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,207
Why did you feel sad?

915
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,752
It was the alcohol.

916
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,171
I lost my best friend,

917
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,299
and I feel like a joke.

918
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,011
Why did you cry?

919
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,016
Because

920
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,103
I felt so embarrassed of myself.

921
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:22,772
My life...

922
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,568
is so embarrassing.

923
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,745
My life is so ridiculous.

924
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:43,293
Back in school, I was the only orphan.

925
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,505
And now, I'm the only single mother
in the neighborhood.

926
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,008
I'm the only one

927
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:52,427
who makes her son worry about 480,000 won.

928
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,765
I also want to live a nice life,

929
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,353
but the world keeps being so mean to me.

930
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,773
It keeps humiliating me.

931
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,283
Dongbaek.

932
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,454
Don't act like you're weak.

933
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,708
You're an orphan and a single mother,

934
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:26,336
so people might go around

935
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,297
saying you're living an unfortunate life.

936
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,091
But let's be honest.

937
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,719
You're really lucky.

938
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:39,766
So much for being lucky.

939
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,894
You may be an orphan and a single mother,

940
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,605
but you managed to raise Pil-gu so well,

941
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,608
and you even run your own business.

942
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,405
You don't blame others
or live a cheap life.

943
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,658
On top of that,

944
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,496
you still manage to stay
so kind and diligent.

945
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,374
That's how you live.

946
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:09,045
People should respect you
and compliment you for that.

947
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:14,217
For the first time in my life,
someone complimented me.

948
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,262
If anyone else were in your shoes,
they would've lost it already.

949
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,848
No one has the right to badmouth you.

950
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:23,560
Dongbaek.

951
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:25,770
In this entire neighborhood,

952
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:27,939
you're the strongest,

953
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,108
the most strong-willed,

954
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,318
the most magnificent,

955
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,404
and the most

956
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,531
admirable person I know.

957
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:47,166
My gosh, why are you doing this to me?

958
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,298
Don't say that kind of stuff to me.

959
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,968
I'm trying so hard to hold it in.

960
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,763
Every time I hear someone take my side,
I can't help but...

961
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:08,730
Don't take my side. Don't compliment me.

962
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:09,772
Just don't.

963
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,944
Stop saying I'm pretty.

964
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,904
Stop saying you're proud of me.

965
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:20,575
I've never heard anyone say that to me.

966
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,620
So it makes me feel...
It makes me feel so weird.

967
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:32,170
I'm trying so hard to stay strong.
Why did you make me cry?

968
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,348
You say that, but you're just going to...

969
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,683
I'm not like Kang Jong-ryeol.

970
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:49,812
I don't care who Pil-gu's dad is.

971
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,690
I promise...

972
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,485
that I will never

973
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:57,612
make you...

974
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,281
or Pil-gu cry.

975
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,663
I'll remind you every day

976
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:11,250
what a great person you are...

977
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,879
so that you'll never forget.

978
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,258
So...

979
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:21,886
stop your nagging...

980
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:26,140
and just accept my compliments.

981
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,604
Yong-sik, you really should be careful.

982
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,691
What if I really end up

983
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,944
liking you?

984
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:49,205
What will you do then?

985
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:02,427
Can a person be another person's miracle?

986
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:16,774
She could help me out a little.

987
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,153
But she really isn't doing anything.

988
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:02,653
I don't know about anyone else,

989
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:05,281
but I won't do anything you don't like.

990
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:06,741
If Dongbaek keeps provoking me

991
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:08,284
-and I end up losing it...
-Ma'am.

992
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,203
I'd want to be straightforward with you.

993
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:14,207
My mom likes you.
You guys are best friends.

994
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,543
No one likes Dongbaek.
Who in the world would like me?

995
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,463
Shouldn't you be training?
Why do you come every day?

996
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,673
Who keeps throwing this away here?

997
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,927
Why can't you ask them for cooperation?

998
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,471
I'm going to catch Joker.

999
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,014
I'll catch him and let him know

1000
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:32,183
that he messed with the wrong person.

1001
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,394
