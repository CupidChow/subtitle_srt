1
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,729
AMBULANCE

2
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,193
Joker, who returned after five years,
killed Hyang-mi.

3
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,032
Shit.

4
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,494
I can't believe Dongbaek's missing, too.

5
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,413
This is driving me nuts.

6
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,790
Dongbaek...

7
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:23,708
is alive.

8
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,251
What?

9
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,801
Hyang-mi came to Ongsan two years ago,

10
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,344
and this...

11
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,345
DON'T BE A JOKE

12
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,764
...is the note Joker left for Dongbaek.

13
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,351
He began all this to get her attention.

14
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,521
She can't be dead already.

15
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,733
What about Hyang-mi, then?

16
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,611
Did he kill her just to scare Dongbaek?

17
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,825
Who knows?
He could've killed her just for fun

18
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,162
or for a certain reason.

19
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,207
Hyang-mi said

20
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,459
she had seen something.

21
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,587
You don't look like a cat-lover.

22
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,341
Yong-sik was curious to know
who kept feeding the cats.

23
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,764
I'm curious...

24
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,102
Is it fun to feed cats on the street?

25
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,521
I like cats, too.

26
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,234
It's cold.

27
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,820
It's chillier today.

28
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,034
So how many rooms do you have at home?

29
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,620
The weather's chilly now,

30
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,874
so it's too cold to sleep at the bar.

31
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,836
You go around feeding homeless cats.

32
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,007
Just think of me
as another cat without a home.

33
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,720
No one knows where I live.

34
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,682
Dongbaek thinks I'm renting a place.

35
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,894
Even if I die on the streets,

36
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,022
no one would give a damn about me.

37
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,778
Are we already here?

38
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,532
Is this the back gate?

39
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:40,386
The floor must heat up nicely
if it's enough to dry the chilies.

40
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,682
Are you sure I can stay here sometimes?

41
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:54,525
People can't find out
all my deposit money is gone,

42
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,780
so can you keep my staying here a secret?

43
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,036
Gosh.

44
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,210
What's...

45
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,921
with these marks?

46
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,763
My gosh.

47
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,224
Is someone else here?

48
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,464
Jeez, where does she keep her stamp?

49
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:40,340
THE HERO APPEARS AT THE LAST MINUTE

50
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,760
Why are the pickled radishes so small?

51
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,179
Have you even seasoned the rice?

52
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,474
-Mom, is your nose bleeding?
-What?

53
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,517
-I see something red.
-Is my nose bleeding?

54
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,977
You must've picked your nose.

55
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,854
-Unbelievable.
-Mom, stop that!

56
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,899
-That's really dirty.
-Just shut up and eat.

57
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,489
What's with the gimbap, though?

58
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,826
He's the cleanup hitter today,
so I should go and see the game.

59
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,661
What are moms for?

60
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,456
You're going to watch Pil-gu's match?

61
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,041
Are you coming?

62
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,586
Mom, are you crazy? You can't.

63
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,922
I can't even go, so why should you?

64
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:25,301
Is that why you're wearing
that pendant like some kind of rapper?

65
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,428
I'll pack some gimbap for his teacher

66
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:30,056
and help Dongbaek score points
with his teammates.

67
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,974
Calling him Dongbaek

68
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,894
and pretending to be all nice
won't work, you know.

69
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,687
I'd like the afternoon off today.

70
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,398
-The bar--
-I can't allow it.

71
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,858
-You're not going anywhere.
-The ends!

72
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,611
Eat the ends.

73
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,655
BASEBALL PLAYER K
HAS A MISTRESS

74
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,241
Damn it.
I can't stay with Kang Jong-ryeol.

75
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,492
I just can't.

76
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,411
If people link that to Jong-ryeol,

77
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,038
I'd rather die than hear the whispers.

78
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,748
Look at my hands trembling.

79
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,875
Is she young and pretty?

80
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,919
It's a crime if she was younger
than me.

81
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,964
-Is she pretty, then?
-Shit.

82
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,590
I don't know.

83
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,509
I guess she is pretty.

84
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,847
For the time being,
play dumb and stay quiet.

85
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,517
Why should I do that,
especially in this day and age?

86
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,352
I'm not telling you
to bear with it.

87
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,813
We should wait
for the right time to end this.

88
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,565
-What?
-Why divorce him now

89
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,650
and only get what he offers?

90
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,360
You need definitive proof

91
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,280
so that you can take everything
that jerk has.

92
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,074
You want me to divorce?

93
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,160
You don't have a way
to provide for yourself.

94
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,287
How do you expect to raise your kid alone?

95
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,456
Alone?

96
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,958
How can you stay married to that dirtbag?

97
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,003
Anyway,

98
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,048
stay quiet for now.

99
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,342
You need evidence to divorce him.

100
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,887
Then what about Mrs. Kang Jong-ryeol?

101
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,555
What?

102
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,893
What about Mrs. Kang Jong-ryeol?

103
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,355
Tonight at 7 p.m.,
don't forget my facial mask.

104
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,191
Limited amount, discounted price.

105
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,860
I'll see you tonight
on Mrs. Kang Jong-ryeol Beauty.

106
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,780
Is being Mrs. Kang Jong-ryeol her job?

107
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,492
-It's her life's work.
-Who's this nobody?

108
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,577
They hit the nail on the head.

109
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,207
They're right.
Even I don't know who I am anymore.

110
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,797
Do both parents usually attend the game?

111
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,342
They mostly do. Why do you ask?

112
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,014
But Dongbaek said she wasn't coming.

113
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,600
The kid will be all alone again.

114
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,478
How am I supposed to be
okay with that? Damn it.

115
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,403
What now?

116
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,907
-Put on the facial mask.
-No.

117
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,951
I got pimples the last time I put one on.

118
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,620
Besides, I thought
we were getting a divorce.

119
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,747
Zip it and just put it on.

120
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,958
Can't you just live a quiet life?

121
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,169
Stop making a fuss about selling stuff
through your social media page.

122
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,379
What should I do, then?

123
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,049
How can I make a living?

124
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,385
What?

125
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,471
Who are you texting?

126
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,684
Why are you refusing
to put on the facial mask?

127
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,853
Wait, hey...

128
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,945
What about my facial masks?

129
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,490
What should I do with them?

130
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,493
Why are you suddenly being like this?

131
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,288
The company wants you advertising it, too!

132
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,041
It's just a silly little thing
I'm selling,

133
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:48,004
but the company doesn't want a photo
of just me alone.

134
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,923
They want a photo with you using it, too.

135
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,094
A nourishing mask for me
and a hydration mask for you.

136
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,139
Three shots together and one shot alone.

137
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,891
I already signed the contract,

138
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,352
so why won't you participate?

139
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,901
I feel like crying, too.

140
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,539
I wonder where Hyang-mi is.

141
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,416
It isn't like her to be late.

142
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,337
Dongbaek,

143
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,507
you should go to Pil-gu's game.
Why are you sitting it out?

144
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,094
You haven't seen him
play a game before.

145
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,763
Aren't you curious?

146
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,726
Just go to his game.

147
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,646
You can't make good food
when your mind is elsewhere.

148
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,400
My nickname as a child
used to be "the orphan."

149
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,698
That's what I was called
instead of my name.

150
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,159
Kids would just refer to me as the orphan.

151
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:05,206
I don't think the kids
knew how cruel it was, though.

152
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,832
They were just being kids.

153
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,880
But what good will it do to Pil-gu
if people find out

154
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,173
that I'm his mom?

155
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,511
The fatherless boy.
The son of the bar owner.

156
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,346
I don't want him to hear that.

157
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,767
Just go.

158
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,895
Don't stick around making her feel bad
and go.

159
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,193
Why do schools like gimbap so much?

160
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,195
I hated days that required them.

161
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,665
A THOUSAND WON

162
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,268
You know how my mom
runs a successful restaurant.

163
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,564
She's too busy
to find the time to make gimbap.

164
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,733
She's the owner, you see.

165
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,236
Enjoy.

166
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,738
Alright.

167
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,489
Don't eat so fast.

168
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,869
Try this, too.

169
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:26,996
Here.

170
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,207
Why don't we ask her
to join us for fruits?

171
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,959
Why are they sitting apart?

172
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,296
Leave them.
It's best not to be seen with them.

173
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,215
We have a Maria
and a forget-me-not in one class.

174
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,427
What do you mean?

175
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,554
You don't know
because you're new here.

176
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:47,391
One of them comes from
the Angel Maria Orphanage.

177
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,560
She's an orphan.

178
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:53,814
Also, do you know the alley
behind the industrial area?

179
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,275
There's a windowless bar named
"Forget-me-not".

180
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,610
She's the owner's daughter.

181
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,029
She says her mom owns a restaurant.

182
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,530
She's a pathological liar.

183
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,825
You know how sly and manipulative
kids like they are.

184
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,836
You can lower your hand.

185
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,757
No one in our class is a thief.

186
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,092
Hye-in, please check your bag again.

187
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,970
This week's assistants,
come to me after cleaning.

188
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:29,225
Also, numbers 17 and 22...

189
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,060
Follow me right away.

190
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,023
Are you two done?

191
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,037
CONFESSIONS
I DIDN'T STEAL THE MONEY

192
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,748
You know the two kids
from broken families?

193
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,583
They always seem so dark.

194
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,920
One seems like
there's a ghost hanging over her head

195
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,630
and the other's already screwed up.

196
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,510
I would never steal someone's milk money.

197
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,349
Even when I found
a coin in the playground,

198
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,852
I didn't pick it up.

199
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,772
The thief went to talk
to the rabbits again.

200
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,899
They are her only friends.

201
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,693
Was it really her?

202
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,486
She's an orphan.

203
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,656
Without proper parental guidance,
orphans become thieves.

204
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,159
It's why the bar owner's daughter
keeps lying, too.

205
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,495
Why don't we find her
and get the money back?

206
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,164
It's your money she took.

207
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:36,917
Hey!

208
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,460
Did you see it?

209
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,962
Did you see her take the money?

210
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,631
Did you see any of us do anything bad?

211
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,593
Prejudice only ties you down.

212
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,637
It prevents some from doing better

213
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,640
and makes some become rebellious.

214
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,396
Her eyes were always so sad.

215
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,525
Being the school orphan was bad enough.

216
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,613
I can't make Pil-gu
be called a son of a bar owner.

217
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,160
Only well-off parents can afford
to let their children do sports,

218
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,912
so they all live in luxury.

219
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:17,374
I don't want Pil-gu
to be embarrassed because of me.

220
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,753
It sucks to feel intimidated.

221
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,428
Pil-gu isn't the same as you.

222
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,723
You didn't have a mom--

223
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,144
You didn't have a mom,

224
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:42,566
but Pil-gu has a mom
who's always been by his side.

225
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:46,612
Also, you raised Pil-gu with so much love

226
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,239
that he grew up to be a healthy boy.

227
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,033
So I'm sure he's different.

228
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,747
So stop arguing with me on this
and go to his game, okay?

229
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,793
If I were Pil-gu, I'd be more embarrassed
if you're not there.

230
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,672
Moreover, I know you want to go.

231
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,715
You really do.

232
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:09,885
Right?

233
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,777
Mom, are you wearing that to the game?

234
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,827
Wait, are you going somewhere?

235
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,789
I completely lost it since I slept
on a warm floor for a change.

236
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,863
I can't believe you came, too.
Who's going to peel the onions?

237
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,990
How's that important?

238
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,118
You should know since
you've been ostracized your whole life.

239
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,454
It's best to have
as many people as possible.

240
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,331
We need to make up
for him not having a father.

241
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,669
I just wanted to quietly watch the game,
but we stand out so much.

242
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,006
Hyang-mi, can you at least
ditch the headband?

243
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:33,469
Dongbaek, we might seem really horrendous,

244
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,597
but we're actually
the hottest girls in the area.

245
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,265
It's why everyone's glancing at us.

246
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:42,102
You just look like
you're cheering for the Blue Team.

247
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,480
Well, Ongsan can't handle my beauty.

248
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:50,611
Mom, please take off the hat.
It even has a flower on it.

249
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,992
Ongsan Elementary School

250
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,203
-Ongsan, Ongsan
-Dongbaek, you're actually here.

251
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,121
Hello.

252
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,456
-Hi.
-Hello.

253
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,666
Hello.

254
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,127
Go and join them if you want to.

255
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,048
Her son plays baseball.

256
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,887
I knew this would happen.

257
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,931
Didn't you bring anything?

258
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,933
Bring what?

259
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,860
She's new to this kind of event.

260
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,366
Why can't they keep it simple?

261
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,618
Who needs a drone
at a kid's baseball game?

262
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,330
Take some photos.
They're all you're left with.

263
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,540
Right.

264
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,292
Mom, over here!

265
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,044
Mom, I'll hit a home run!

266
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,046
Watch me, okay? Don't look away.

267
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,506
All right.

268
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,049
-Let's do it.
-Good luck.

269
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,426
He's thrilled.

270
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,720
Just look at how happy he is.

271
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:01,932
Let's do this!

272
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,476
Two, two, three.

273
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,186
She should've come earlier.

274
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,938
GO, SEOKDAE ELEMENTARY
BASEBALL TEAM

275
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,900
Everyone thinks they can be a coach.

276
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,903
They have Park Yong-gil coaching?

277
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,369
I asked that TV show to film my son.

278
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,872
I don't know if they'll come, though.

279
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,333
I really hate kids who want to get ahead

280
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,877
by using their parents.

281
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,671
-You know how I am.
-Of course.

282
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,256
Anyway,

283
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,676
his mom is here
to record him playing today.

284
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,845
Just be a good umpire today.

285
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,724
It's only a friendly match
between young kids.

286
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,936
Of course. I'll make sure
to be very impartial.

287
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,315
Hold on a second. Doesn't your family
run a short rib restaurant?

288
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:55,068
I should bring my juniors over
for dinner sometime.

289
00:19:55,152 --> 00:20:00,824
You know how I taught Kang Jong-ryeol
and Ryu Hyun-jin, right?

290
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,381
Gosh, they're playing really dirty.

291
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,550
How is that a strike?

292
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,344
Pil-gu, get back.

293
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,722
Pil-gu, you listen to me.

294
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,517
You're a baseball player,
not some martial arts specialist.

295
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,020
Being patient is all part of the game.

296
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,940
If you want to stay patient,
you should stick to math.

297
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,404
Should I unleash him and cause a ruckus?

298
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,866
Pil-gu, let's go.

299
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,244
ONGSAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

300
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:05,931
Heroes...

301
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,771
show up at the last minute.

302
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,815
KANG PIL-GU

303
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,109
It's Pil-gu. It's his turn.

304
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,737
My gosh. I've never seen him play before.

305
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,531
Goodness.

306
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,493
My gosh. Pil-gu!

307
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,329
He seems like a professional.

308
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,709
Yong-gil's son isn't a big deal at all.

309
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,794
You're Jong-ryeol's son.

310
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,559
-Yes!
-What?

311
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,562
Nice. Good job.

312
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,315
-How is that a strike?
-Even I can tell that it's not.

313
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,692
-That bastard.
-My gosh.

314
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,246
Nice.

315
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,581
Are you kidding me?

316
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,416
Good job!

317
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,210
How is that a strike?

318
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,796
Anyone can tell that was a ball.

319
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,466
He's only been throwing them
outside the zone.

320
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,468
Kid, do you want to leave?

321
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:25,969
Shall I make you?

322
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,671
My gosh.

323
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,340
Oh, dear!

324
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,092
Gosh.

325
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,304
Time!

326
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,390
Gi-dong, are you kidding me?

327
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,810
That was deliberate, and you know it.
Is this how you teach kids?

328
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,618
Pil-gu!

329
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,883
SEOKDAE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

330
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,553
ONGSAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

331
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,434
PARK HYEONG-JUN

332
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,210
Someone needs to break them up. My gosh.

333
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,714
Pil-gu has a knack
for punching people's noses.

334
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,340
He knows how to fight.

335
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,843
This is why kids' games are entertaining.

336
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,054
They start fighting before you know it.

337
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,181
Get lost!

338
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,768
Kids like him should be banned
from playing sports.

339
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,189
If you teach these delinquents,
they'll get in fights during games

340
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,232
and bring disgrace to baseball players.

341
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,692
It was a ball. You were lying.

342
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,195
That boy threw the ball at me first!

343
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,988
Did you just say, "that boy"?

344
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,991
Hey! He's in third grade!

345
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,619
How can you be so rude to an older boy?

346
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,371
He's the rude one,
and he's the delinquent.

347
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,582
You little jerk.

348
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,875
Hey, you!

349
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,877
-Hey, you!
-Isn't that umpire

350
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,670
the jerk who comes to our restaurant?

351
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,881
He's unbelievable.

352
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,758
Shall we go and fight?

353
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,016
-Isn't that Kang Jong-ryeol?
-Yes.

354
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,602
Damn it.

355
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,187
-What?
-Look at him.

356
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,189
It's Kang Jong-ryeol.

357
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,780
Mom, put your belt back on.

358
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,281
And you, stop cussing.

359
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,957
He'll probably call her Dongbaek
and be rude as soon as he sees her.

360
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,171
-Calm down, man.
-I get it. Move aside.

361
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,089
Hey, you.

362
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,925
Aren't you going to apologize?

363
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,468
Tell him that you're sorry.

364
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,387
Yong-gil, you need to stop too.

365
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,597
-It's a kids' game, and you're an adult.
-Hey.

366
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:01,226
Look at how he's glaring at me.
Look at him!

367
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,270
Don't you know who I am?

368
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,314
He threw that ball at me first,

369
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,775
and he stuck out his tongue first!

370
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,112
-Goodness, stop.
-No, move aside, man!

371
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,040
-Let me go.
-Calm down.

372
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,835
-My gosh.
-Excuse me, sir!

373
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,087
You can't enter the field.

374
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,630
The hero...

375
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,045
The hero always

376
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,089
appears at the last minute.

377
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,890
Hey! Do you come here
to stick out your tongue at others?

378
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,100
A good boy shouldn't play like that.

379
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,103
Do you think you should
hit a friend with a ball?

380
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,605
Should you or shouldn't you?

381
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,940
Are you insane?

382
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,525
How dare you hit him?

383
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:36,946
Then what about you?
How dare you touch someone else's kid?

384
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,324
What? Is he your kid, then?

385
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,327
Yes! He's my kid!

386
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,043
He's so cool.

387
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,965
-Can you sign this, too?
-Why is he... Seriously?

388
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,592
Darn it.

389
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,302
Can you sign this, please?

390
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:06,017
Why did you hit my kid on the head? Why?

391
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,269
When did I hit him?

392
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,230
-Didn't you?
-You did, too!

393
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,607
-I didn't hit him.
-You didn't hit him?

394
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:13,900
I have a drone.

395
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:19,072
My high-resolution drone camera filmed
the entire situation.

396
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:22,701
Should we take this down
to the police station? Should we?

397
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:27,288
Yes, fine. Go ahead. Call the police!

398
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,541
I'm right here! I'm a police officer!

399
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,335
The best.
The best police officer of Ongsan!

400
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,506
Should I write up a report
about you abusing a child?

401
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,718
Should we play the footage
at the police station? Should we?

402
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,094
Yes, we should. Let's do it.

403
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,263
Dad, he hit my nose.

404
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,389
Be quiet.

405
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:48,017
If your kid is precious to you,
other people's kids are precious too.

406
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:52,105
How dare you hit my kid's head?

407
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:55,024
My head hurt so much.

408
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,154
Don't you lay a finger on Pil-gu.

409
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,030
If you do, I'm going to kill you all.

410
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,908
I'm a man with a drone.

411
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,769
Coach.

412
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,395
Oh, thank you.

413
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,108
Did you really take half a day off?

414
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,570
I've never been absent all my life,

415
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,239
so I can do this just once.

416
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,117
Where did you get this?

417
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,243
Gosh.

418
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,413
You can't film anything
with a tiny little camera like that.

419
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,957
You need to take the full shot
of the entire game.

420
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,922
This was pretty expensive.

421
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,966
I told you not to worry. It's all good.

422
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,846
Hey, Jong-ryeol. My dear Kang Jong-ryeol.

423
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,766
I guess he came to see me today.

424
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,143
Goodness, Mr. Kang. I'm a huge fan.

425
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,898
Come on, I practically brought him up.

426
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,650
-Stop touching me.
-What?

427
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,444
Is your son going to play baseball?

428
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,196
What?

429
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,159
Don't. You know how delinquents are
when it comes to sports.

430
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,371
That's not the way
to talk about your senior's son.

431
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:34,123
Ongsan's number three, Kang Pil-gu,
is a kid I'm training.

432
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:38,086
If you lay a hand on him again,
your son's future will look gloomy.

433
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,839
I have connections
in the baseball world.

434
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,925
So if you lay a hand on Pil-gu again,

435
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,220
no middle school in this area will draft
Park Yong-gil's son.

436
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,640
Let's have some manners, all right?

437
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,644
-What's with that...
-Oh, and lastly,

438
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,106
I brought myself up.

439
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,404
-Hey, Pil-gu. How's your thigh...
-Mr. Hwang!

440
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,497
-Mr. Hwang!
-Pil-gu.

441
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,124
-Hey.
-Mr. Hwang.

442
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,586
Mr. Hwang, can you come with me
to see my friends?

443
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,630
My gosh.

444
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,258
Why? What is it?

445
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,677
Do they want an autograph
from the police officer?

446
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,846
No, they want to see the drone.

447
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:34,225
They kept begging me to let them see it.

448
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,478
And Jun-gi even bought me a soda.

449
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,817
Oh, really? They want to see the drone?

450
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,906
Pil-gu, it's a bit expensive,

451
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,783
and what if it gets broken

452
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,828
-when they touch it?
-Can't we see it?

453
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,998
Really? Because it's too expensive?

454
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,420
Okay, then.

455
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,801
Okay. But not everyone.

456
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:12,263
Only those kids who've been good to you.

457
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,349
Well, about ten.

458
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,685
Pick out about ten of them.

459
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,482
Just ten kids. You can bring ten.

460
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,567
Ten? Ten of them?

461
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,527
Who should I bring?

462
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,696
Hey, guys, come over here.

463
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,791
You and Pil-gu seem to be
on the same level.

464
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,294
I'll end up showing it to everyone,

465
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,381
but things like this give power to men,

466
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,926
and it's kind of exciting, too.

467
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,138
I guess that's how dads play with boys.

468
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,100
I just held him in my arms
and comforted him, that's all.

469
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,937
I've never seen Pil-gu look so excited.

470
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,107
Thank you so much, Yong-sik.

471
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:11,197
Pil-gu loves to play with me.

472
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,832
He's so cute.

473
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,418
The three of them may look great,

474
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,921
but Ms. Kwak would be heartbroken
to see them like that.

475
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,550
I think they might tell Ms. Kwak
that you were here.

476
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,385
-What are we going to do?
-My gosh.

477
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,555
So what? He's not anyone special.

478
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,432
She has a mom, too.

479
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,435
She's not in her right mind right now.

480
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,478
Mom. Mom, where are you going?

481
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,779
-This is really good.
-Thank you.

482
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,073
I thought he was from a rich family
or something.

483
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,410
If she has three groups at 2:30 p.m.,

484
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,288
it's nothing special at all.

485
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,083
What's so bad about having a kid?

486
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,334
It's ridiculous.

487
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,503
When it comes to looks,
he should be thankful.

488
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,173
Why is she muttering all to herself?

489
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,051
Marinated crabs are just crabs.
Why did she make a set menu?

490
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,470
Gosh. It's so pretentious.

491
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,389
These so-called good restaurants are
all frauds.

492
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,396
Lady, are you talking to me right now?

493
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,482
I'm not just any old lady.

494
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:32,111
Well, if you aren't just any old lady,
then who are you?

495
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,741
You aren't very sharp.

496
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,250
I'm Dongbaek's mom.

497
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,130
So it's complete nonsense in my eyes.

498
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:57,011
No matter how low Madonna goes,
she wouldn't date someone like him.

499
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:06,479
Hey, Helena, didn't people say
that she has dementia?

500
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,649
I have no idea. I'm a foreigner.

501
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,192
Hey.

502
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,194
Look at this.

503
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,196
There are no security cameras.

504
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,782
If there were any,
we would've gotten them already.

505
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,951
The police aren't idiots.
They won't miss that.

506
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,912
They all went to college.

507
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,414
But you know,

508
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:32,463
the case broke out
on June 29th, 2014. Right?

509
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,673
Look.

510
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:39,345
This banner says they're starting classes
for the 2012 college entrance exam.

511
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,058
But did people even go to this place?

512
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:47,562
What?

513
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,148
I have a feeling

514
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:54,777
that they put up that banner in a hurry
to cover something up.

515
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:57,947
And look at this.

516
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,117
Okay, Chief.
Do you know what a street view is?

517
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,911
I looked at the street view

518
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:08,457
of each year over and over again,
then some more.

519
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,419
You conducted
such an investigation by yourself?

520
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,547
Okay, look.

521
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,216
Look at the street view
from the year 2012.

522
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:22,847
You don't see anything
on the wall of the academy. Right?

523
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:27,351
But look at the one from the year 2013.

524
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,021
Now, look. Here.

525
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,857
Something is sticking out, isn't it?

526
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,236
-You're right.
-Right?

527
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,240
Look at this. This thing.

528
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:45,244
If that's not a security camera,
what could it be?

529
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,372
Madonna, the world-renowned artist.

530
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,543
She was born in 1958
and has two kids,

531
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,255
but she dates a model
who's 30 years younger.

532
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,593
People call her a witch and a cougar,
and all kinds of nonsense.

533
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,595
-Is she allowed to be by herself?
-No idea.

534
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,890
But it's because she's great.
She just stands out.

535
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,685
She's so pretty
that all the other women are jealous.

536
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,853
What can she do?

537
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,565
What's wrong with
living an extraordinary life?

538
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,870
What's her history?

539
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,164
Is she from the US?

540
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,000
An Americano?

541
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,127
That's coffee.

542
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,505
HANBIT ACADEMY

543
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,093
It does seem like a security camera.

544
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,095
RESTRICTED AREA

545
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,766
Okay, then.
I'll head over to the real estate office.

546
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,145
Hey, man.

547
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,815
-What's up?
-Take this gun.

548
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,442
Make sure you always keep a gun with you.

549
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,902
Why?

550
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,823
If you run into Joker,

551
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,449
just shoot him.

552
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,119
Don't try to use your hands and feet!

553
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,372
My gosh. Goodness.

554
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,583
Hey, you're supposed to shoot
a person with a gun.

555
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,711
Don't use it to beat up a person.

556
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,755
I know that already. What's with you?

557
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,466
There was a place called
Hanbit Academy over there.

558
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,886
Do you notice or hear anything
odd about that place?

559
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,347
It was a little weird.

560
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,184
I didn't see any kid going in there
for a long time,

561
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,563
but the sign stayed up there
for two years.

562
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,525
The director of Hanbit Academy had
a huge gambling debt,

563
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,278
but one day, he somehow

564
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:46,073
paid a year's rent at once.

565
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,163
Do you know the current phone number
of the director?

566
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,749
No, I have no idea.

567
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,503
Gyu-tae probably knows him.

568
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,922
Gyu-tae... No Gyu-tae?

569
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:06,093
Yes, they were pretty close.
They hung out together often.

570
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,352
No Gyu-tae is at the end
of every single trail.

571
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,314
SELF-SERVICE WATER

572
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,945
Hey, I heard you aren't moving.
I mean, miss.

573
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,657
It's not that I'm not moving.
I'm not leaving Ongsan.

574
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,244
I'm looking into a shop
near the alley with sushi restaurants.

575
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,624
But it's still Ongsan,
so it's all the same.

576
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,922
Then let me be frank with you.
Let's make a deal, please.

577
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:49,136
I'll extend the contract
without increasing the deposit.

578
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,681
Then you can

579
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,768
get rid of Hyang-mi in return.

580
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,270
-What?
-I honestly want to

581
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:02,525
burn down the entire mountain
to catch that little bug,

582
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:06,487
so will you please kick her out?

583
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:15,371
SIGNED BY CHOI HYANG-MI

584
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,832
-Here.
-Alright.

585
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,794
You need to check off the box

586
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,463
that says it's not phishing
to send money abroad.

587
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,383
It is phishing.

588
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,510
It has been ruining me for life.

589
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,055
I mean, you can always find
another part-timer.

590
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:36,058
No matter who it is,
it has to be better than Hyang-mi.

591
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,062
She's just an outsider,

592
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,189
so she'll run off whenever she wants.

593
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:45,192
If she runs off, I can't help it.

594
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,861
But I don't want to kick her out.

595
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:48,737
What?

596
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,990
I'll move with her.

597
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,033
What? Why?

598
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,911
Is she your family?
Is she a family member?

599
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,789
-Why can't you fire her?
-Because I hired her.

600
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:02,251
Why did you even hire
someone like her in the first place?

601
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,627
Why?

602
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,505
I hired her because I thought
she was fit for the job.

603
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:10,634
Let me give you a word of advice.

604
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,513
You'd better be careful of her.
Okay?

605
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,599
She's...

606
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,351
CAMELLIA

607
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,315
He must be head over heels in love.

608
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,775
I can't believe he's here again.

609
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:40,664
The normal legal procedure
just isn't enough to subside my anger.

610
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,426
Why would you drive like that in an alley?

611
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,431
I'm sorry.

612
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,226
I almost killed you.

613
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:03,896
Get in.

614
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:05,940
Why?

615
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,192
"Why"?

616
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,739
Did you just ask me why?

617
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:22,122
The smartest and dumbest person in Ongsan
are sitting across from each other.

618
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:27,086
She doesn't even make me want to beat her.

619
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,803
I don't even have the will to fight.

620
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,347
Should I pressure her?

621
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,350
My mind became very clear,

622
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,061
and I found a way to save myself.

623
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,192
She has a bigger voice
in the household than Gyu-tae.

624
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,318
Hey.

625
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,947
Do you know what a marriage is?

626
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,951
I heard enough to know a lot about it.

627
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:02,871
Now, it's time for you
to act all possessive as his wife.

628
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,416
I'll tell you what it is.

629
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:09,962
I picked Gyu-tae
because I thought he was a gold ring.

630
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,966
But as time went by, I realized
that he isn't even worth a brass ring.

631
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,884
But what's worse is

632
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:19,680
that his mother thinks
I married a diamond ring.

633
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,849
She thinks he's a big deal.

634
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,938
I could completely ruin Gyu-tae's life.

635
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,482
Or I could take everything from you

636
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:33,152
including the 14K earring you have

637
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,862
by filing a lawsuit against you.

638
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:38,490
But that won't even scare you that much,

639
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,743
and it won't be any fun for me either.

640
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:45,080
Yes, you're right.
It won't benefit anyone.

641
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:46,707
Yes, I know.

642
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,753
So instead of having fun by yourselves,

643
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,422
why don't we all enjoy a happy ending?

644
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,316
Aren't you coming?

645
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,693
Why? Do you want me to go?

646
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,237
Should I send it by delivery?
Come and take your money.

647
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,710
You'd better be careful of her.

648
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,296
She's

649
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,258
a bloodhound when it comes to money.

650
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,930
Why don't you open it?

651
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,516
Open it.

652
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:49,561
The fact that you're looking at it
means you're already suspicious.

653
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:54,066
I would never steal someone's milk money.

654
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,873
Aren't you going to open it?

655
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,377
No.

656
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,546
I don't need to check.

657
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:17,631
Kleptomania is incurable.

658
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,885
It's not that your habit of stealing
gets worse with time.

659
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,887
You just steal whatever you see,

660
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,473
and it's just in your nature.

661
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,312
Hyang-mi isn't like that.

662
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,566
If I say she isn't like that,

663
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,943
that's just who she is.

664
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:47,244
I'm a hundred percent sure now
that I saw you steal that teaspoon.

665
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,247
My gosh. You even stole a teaspoon?

666
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:54,585
You feel like a blessing to me.

667
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:59,131
It seems like my husband finally met
the love of his life.

668
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,884
Why are you looking at me?

669
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,052
Why are you looking at her?

670
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,388
All we did was go skiing together.

671
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,391
See? We just went waterskiing as friends.

672
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:12,478
We didn't do anything to cross the line.

673
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,396
You don't get to decide the line.

674
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,734
I know my place.

675
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,612
I'm no match for her.

676
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:25,657
And I instantly realized that I might die
if I do anything to cross her.

677
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,995
If you agree to take Gyu-tae away from me

678
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,916
and everything else
that comes along with him,

679
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:36,668
I'd be more than grateful.

680
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:42,049
You guys should try to work things out.
Why are you asking me to--

681
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,802
You know when you're
inevitably destined to do something?

682
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,262
It's your turn.

683
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,264
I'll give him to you.

684
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,311
You talk as if he's an object.

685
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:58,565
I think my life will get better
once I get rid of Gyu-tae.

686
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,151
I trust that you'll help me out.

687
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,782
Gyu-tae doesn't have the guts
to do anything.

688
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,162
You've got to be kidding me.

689
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,998
Gyu-tae can't be Joker.

690
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,584
It's not Gyu-tae.

691
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:22,089
This is exactly why
I don't trust the police.

692
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,218
Hear me out here.

693
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,930
He bought a building at a low price
because of what happened.

694
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,140
And he was also...

695
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,101
Thanks.

696
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,145
And he was also really close

697
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,983
with this suspicious guy
who was the director of the academy.

698
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:46,071
All the arrows are pointing at him.

699
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:50,617
The fact that they were close
can't really act as evidence.

700
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,743
But...

701
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,579
He's close with everyone.

702
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,164
He calls my husband his brother,

703
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:59,668
and he calls her pathetic husband
his soul mate.

704
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,587
Why would you call my husband pathetic?

705
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,589
You're the only person
he isn't close with.

706
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:07,885
Don't target him as the suspect
just because you don't like him.

707
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,511
I'm not targeting him.

708
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,638
He may be petty and narrow-minded,

709
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:15,017
but he can't kill anyone.
Everyone in the neighborhood knows that.

710
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,143
-Of course.
-Of course.

711
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,606
Then who could it be? Darn it.

712
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,358
Who do you think is Joker?

713
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:28,071
Just eat some grilled pork.
You're not smart enough to figure it out.

714
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,409
-My gosh.
-But what's with the windows?

715
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,580
Why are the windows covered
with cardboard boxes?

716
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,833
-What boxes?
-Right there.

717
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:43,045
I don't know if they're boxes,
but the windows are completely covered.

718
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:43,962
What?

719
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,215
You can tell by the light
that comes out of one window.

720
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,552
This is what my husband does
when he plasters walls.

721
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,678
Oh, really?

722
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,514
Maybe he covered the windows
so the kids could stay focused

723
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,309
instead of getting distracted
by what's outside.

724
00:48:57,392 --> 00:49:00,520
An academy isn't a prison cell.
Who would go to someplace like that?

725
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:05,025
Maybe he covered the walls
to prevent people from looking inside.

726
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,779
What? He didn't want people
to look inside?

727
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,532
Why? Was he hiding something
in the academy?

728
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,619
-That's what you need to figure out.
-Exactly.

729
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,538
That place isn't an academy.

730
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,083
It was always closed.

731
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:28,632
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.
What is this place?

732
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,636
I really hate it when I need
to use my brain too much.

733
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,012
My gosh, seriously.

734
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:37,307
Hey, why do you keep
scratching your fingers?

735
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,558
It's disgusting.

736
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,103
It might be infectious.
You should see a doctor.

737
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,481
You might infect Dongbaek.

738
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,528
Love can transmit all kinds of diseases.

739
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,279
My goodness.

740
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:55,993
Hey, I wired all the money I had.

741
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,788
Where do you expect me to get more money?

742
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:08,005
She shouldn't have hired me
in the first place.

743
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,425
I'm just an incorrigible brat.

744
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,813
HIRING A PART-TIME WAITER

745
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:25,772
CAMELLIA

746
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,692
2 YEARS AGO

747
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,861
I'm surprised to see a bar like this here.

748
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,370
DECEMBER 2015, APRIL 2016

749
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,091
CAMELLIA

750
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:56,219
FORGET-ME-NOT

751
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,858
FORGET-ME-NOT

752
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:17,908
CAMELLIA

753
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,411
Excuse me.

754
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,957
Excuse me.

755
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,922
I saw a sign saying
you're hiring a part-timer.

756
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,883
Use this to dry your hair.

757
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,551
Thanks.

758
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,932
I guess you look quite common.

759
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,975
It feels like we've met before.

760
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,644
I feel the same way.

761
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,229
Pil-gu, let's eat.

762
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,190
Sit down. You should join us.

763
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,236
Join you?

764
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:56,905
You want me to eat with you?

765
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:03,537
Hey, I told you numerous times
that this is your cup.

766
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,956
Why do you keep using ours?

767
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,833
My gosh, seriously.

768
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,255
You won't get sick
just because we use the same cup.

769
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,427
Pil-gu, tell her to start eating.

770
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,972
Hey, I'll give you the bigger piece.

771
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,313
I'm thinking about working at Camellia.

772
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,775
Hey, I got a place for you
so you could work right away.

773
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,402
You can't just cancel last minute.

774
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:40,073
If you ever get a call from Nak-ho,
tell him you cut ties with me.

775
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,785
Dongbaek's just an ordinary person.

776
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,829
You get paid by the hour there.

777
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,665
Have you ever gotten paid by the hour?

778
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,959
Gosh, I don't care.
I want to give it a try.

779
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,294
Why?

780
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:55,839
I'm tired.

781
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,633
I'm just exhausted.

782
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,433
We all have our ways of living.

783
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,060
Your old life will come looking for you.

784
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,822
You can only order food at this hour.

785
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,543
Do you really want to die?

786
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,339
I knew my old life would eventually
come looking for me again.

787
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,258
Hyang-mi.

788
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,345
You can only order food at this hour.

789
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:56,483
Hyang-mi.

790
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,986
I want to sell alcohol, not humans.

791
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,530
How horrible is that?

792
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,117
I want you to be considerate
and cooperate with me

793
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,703
so I won't have to cross that line.

794
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:13,541
But you're just way too easy.

795
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,378
So I'm kind of contemplating right now.

796
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:19,339
Why do you think I'm easy? I'm not easy.

797
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:20,382
You're easy.

798
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,592
You're the easiest person on earth.

799
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,220
You don't have any parents or friends.

800
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:30,892
No one will notice even if you disappear.

801
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,144
I told Suk-hui to report you

802
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:35,522
to the cops if I ever happen
to go missing.

803
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,400
Hey.

804
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,820
I know this place is in the countryside.

805
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,906
But how do you think
I managed to find you here?

806
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,078
She spilled it for two million won.

807
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,997
My gosh, she really has no loyalty.

808
00:54:55,917 --> 00:55:00,005
Do you finally get where you stand now?

809
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:05,844
Even if you're found dead tomorrow
by the lake,

810
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,472
the cops will have no one to contact.

811
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,350
They might not even be able
to identify you.

812
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:13,935
Even worse,

813
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:18,273
you won't even have anyone to hold
a funeral for you. That's where you are.

814
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,741
Did you go to Yeong-sim's place?

815
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:31,202
No, I'm too busy to go there these days.

816
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,538
Yeong-sim came because of the same symptom

817
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,290
after spraying pesticide.

818
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,126
So I thought you helped her out.

819
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,837
It looks like an infection
you get from pesticide.

820
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,801
I never even touched pesticide.

821
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,096
I probably ate something I shouldn't have.

822
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,932
Then why would you only scratch your hand?

823
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,684
It means you touched something.

824
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,896
The fact that only your fingers itch

825
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,482
obviously means you touched something.

826
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,198
Did I touch something
I usually don't touch?

827
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:29,177
It's weird that this place has no cats.

828
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,473
But someone keeps refilling the cat food.

829
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,770
So what should you do?

830
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,483
You should come with me.

831
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,277
You need to work for me
for the rest of your life.

832
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:52,075
I guess I can't escape my fate.

833
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,911
Okay, pack your things and come outside.

834
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,121
But not now.

835
00:56:56,955 --> 00:57:00,083
I'm working on something right now,
so I'll go once I get my money.

836
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,629
Did it sound like I was making an offer?

837
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,256
Did it?

838
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,844
What do you want?

839
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:14,013
The only friend I ever had
sold me out for two million won.

840
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:17,434
-I have nowhere else to run.
-Cut the crap and come with me.

841
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,937
You need to willingly come...

842
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,444
Hyang-mi.

843
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,447
You really should cooperate.

844
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,992
If you die with no family or friends,

845
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,077
it'll be really sad.

846
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,595
What do you want?

847
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:55,972
Why are you sitting there?

848
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,726
So I can be next to Hyang-mi.

849
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,484
Gosh. This place is full of dumb brats.

850
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:12,864
By the way, Hyung-mi does have friends.

851
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,826
If anything happens to her,

852
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,996
the first thing I'm going to do
is report you to the cops.

853
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:26,461
Hey.

854
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:30,798
I didn't know you had
such a powerful friend.

855
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:35,386
Will you stop
rubbing her shoulder like that?

856
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,472
This isn't her shoulder.

857
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,974
I own this body.

858
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,519
It's all mine.

859
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:46,606
Every time my life turned into a mess
and tried to bring me down...

860
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,318
Just go over there
and peel the bellflower roots

861
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,529
while I'm being nice.

862
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,784
Get lost while I'm being nice.

863
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,661
What?

864
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:01,955
No one ever protected me.

865
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,294
I told you to get lost.

866
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,633
This girl is starting

867
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,261
to get on my nerves.

868
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,517
Honey, come on.

869
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,021
You got it all wrong.

870
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,650
Nothing happened between us.
Will you please listen?

871
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,404
Please trust me--

872
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,039
So what if you didn't have sex?

873
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,709
Does that make you innocent?

874
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,380
Ja-yeong.

875
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,507
I will never

876
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,676
be able to forget this.

877
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:24,245
-Hey!
-Why did you go to a kids' baseball game?

878
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,456
Who's that kid?

879
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:32,503
I saw Kang Jong-ryeol
at a kids' baseball game today.

880
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,213
Hey! Let me go!

881
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:36,674
Let go of me!

882
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,926
Hey! Cut it out!

883
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:42,889
Hey! Let me go!

884
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,974
Let me go!

885
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:46,976
Let go of me!

886
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,481
Hey! Let me go! Stop it!

887
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,900
Hey! Come to your senses!

888
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:57,654
You fucking asshole! Let me go!

889
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:02,116
My gosh, you're driving me crazy!

890
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,537
Hey! Don't you know what I'm capable of?

891
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:12,168
You must've forgotten already.
Let me remind you.

892
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:13,252
Let me go!

893
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,300
I told you to get lost!

894
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,761
I have a bad temper!

895
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,389
She also has a temper! Everyone does!

896
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,853
The hero always appears
at the last minute.

897
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:33,606
And the big boss

898
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,194
appears at the last minute, too.

899
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,805
But you have a weakness now.

900
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:49,849
Don't mess with them.

901
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,893
We're strangers.

902
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:55,062
I told her that she could stay
in return for firing you.

903
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:56,481
But she rejected my offer.

904
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:59,442
Your son-in-law? Your husband?
We don't need him.

905
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:01,694
And go tell him to stop lurking around.

906
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,614
Will you please stop
getting involved with my son?

907
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:07,909
Send me the money right now.
It's kind of urgent for me, too.

908
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:08,993
Do you want to die?

909
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,912
I never really felt embarrassed before.

910
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:13,414
But you're starting
to make me feel that way.

911
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,459
So I have no choice
but to help him cut ties with me.

912
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:22,048
