1
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,267
Where are you off to?

2
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,436
There was a fire at the market

3
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,813
and Yong-sik was injured.

4
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,691
He was trying to save Dongbaek and...

5
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,241
FALL OF 1987, ONGSAN

6
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:22,540
Goodness.
Everything was burned to a crisp.

7
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,752
It's hard to tell it's even a body.

8
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,015
It must have been so hot.

9
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,521
The flames must have been

10
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,649
so hot.

11
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,657
Hwang Yong-sik.

12
00:01:56,658 --> 00:02:00,620
Deok-sun,
I paid 200,000 won for this name.

13
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,414
My baby!

14
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,966
I was a man destined
for greatness and longevity,

15
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,137
but the curse of the widow was greater!

16
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:24,894
My poor and unfortunate soul.

17
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,814
I just can't leave like this.

18
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,819
No,

19
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,113
but I should.

20
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,493
Mother, sister, I'll get going now.

21
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,663
Look after my family for me.

22
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,166
-My baby!
-No.

23
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,126
-My gosh.
-No, my son.

24
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,087
-No!
-Oh, no.

25
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,964
Don't go.

26
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,758
Mom, please.

27
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,305
Honey...

28
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,849
Yes.

29
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,934
It's me.

30
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,895
I should go now,

31
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,190
so why are you holding me back?

32
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,944
Why is my husband speaking

33
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,406
in a Jeolla Province dialect?

34
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,576
He's never even been there before.

35
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,872
Why are you lying to us?

36
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,709
You're not even my husband.

37
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,836
Deok-sun...

38
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,297
Why are you saying it's my fault?

39
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:39,052
How dare you say that my husband died

40
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,471
because being a widow is my fate?

41
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,098
How could you say that?

42
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,561
-No, stop.
-How could you...

43
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,731
She reopened it
before even finishing the 49 days ritual.

44
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,192
No wonder such a thing happened
to her husband.

45
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,652
She was fated to be a widow.

46
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,695
My gosh!

47
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,823
Shove off if you don't
want me to bite your head off.

48
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,450
Are you insane?

49
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,160
Should we all die grieving, then?

50
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,830
Is it better to just let
my three kids starve to death?

51
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,625
Your life seems so unlucky,

52
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,127
so we were pitying you.
We didn't say anything wrong!

53
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,630
What do you mean I'm unlucky?

54
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,425
Who are you to judge
the quality of my life?

55
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:20,885
Tell me.

56
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,930
-Do any of you have three sons?
-My gosh.

57
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,183
"How unfortunate. That poor thing."

58
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,852
Want to feel good about yourselves
by comparing me to you?

59
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,358
Then at least buy a meal here first.

60
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,569
Gosh, her and her temper!

61
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,447
Goodness.

62
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,034
You wait and see.

63
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,996
I'll keep living.

64
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,333
I'll do what I can to raise my boys.

65
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,928
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

66
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,810
-Mom?
-My boy...

67
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,937
Goodness.

68
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,689
Come on, Mom.

69
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:16,524
My gosh.

70
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,527
It must've burned.

71
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,362
It must've burned.

72
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,865
Mom, I'll be fine. Don't worry--

73
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,782
Excuse me.

74
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,120
What is going on with him?

75
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,039
-My dear boy...
-Ms. Kwak.

76
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,500
Goodness gracious.

77
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:39,756
Why would you need so many bandages?

78
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,049
This is...

79
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,508
-Look...
-Ms. Kwak.

80
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,136
You must've been startled.
I talked to the doctor--

81
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,017
-You should leave.
-Mom!

82
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,228
-You should leave now.
-Mom, please.

83
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,317
You have

84
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,904
never been this hurt before.

85
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,332
We are all molded
by what we experience in life.

86
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,214
Whether they were good experiences or not,

87
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,008
you can't stop them
from being carved into your skin.

88
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,221
Even though we hate hearing
how our fates are sealed,

89
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,059
we continue to be cowards.

90
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:43,069
MY MOM'S AGE LINES
"AND THAT IS HOW MY MOM AGED"

91
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,491
This was definitely arson.

92
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,743
Chief.

93
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,704
The market security cameras
are broken.

94
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,374
A piece of a lighter was found,

95
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,918
but it could be too small
to retrieve any prints.

96
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,548
Was it a green lighter this time, too?

97
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,850
ONGSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
EMERGENCY ROOM

98
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:21,732
YOU'LL KNOW ONCE YOU LIGHT A FIRE

99
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,996
There was a fire at the market.

100
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,874
Did you know that?

101
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,129
Dad,

102
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,715
please.

103
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,719
All right? Please don't do anything.

104
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,471
Please.

105
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,598
Okay?

106
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,104
She's alive.

107
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,234
What?

108
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,906
That's why you'll know
once you light a fire.

109
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,076
A human being will burn to death
but not a witch.

110
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,711
Here.

111
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,382
If you had time to pick up calming pills,

112
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,177
why not use that time
to look more presentable?

113
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,223
I can't believe you brought me
mismatched shoes. It's so embarrassing.

114
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,141
Just how frantic were you?

115
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,435
What about the fire? Was it arson?

116
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:41,938
Who knows?

117
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,691
Will Yong-sik's injuries leave a scar?

118
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,320
Who knows?
I need to keep checking up on him.

119
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,447
What? Are you coming back?

120
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:56,369
Why would you when his mother
thinks you're the devil?

121
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,747
Her son was injured,
so of course she hates me.

122
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,417
If we're being honest, I'm not exactly...

123
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,170
daughter-in-law material.

124
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,172
Why not? Because you were an orphan?

125
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,174
Because you have a son?

126
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,635
Besides, it's my fault
you became an orphan.

127
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,303
My gosh.

128
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,515
Why are you so confident?

129
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,851
So what if you have a son?
The world has changed and you're pretty.

130
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,437
Should you have killed yourself instead?

131
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,190
Should you have had an abortion?

132
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,986
How dare they look down on you
when you have nothing to be ashamed of?

133
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,613
Utter jerks. Can I pay the bill, please?

134
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,288
Mom, you're taking my side, right?

135
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,665
Jeez.

136
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,973
Let's go.

137
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,768
There was oil everywhere.

138
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,729
It was arson, right?

139
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,938
What if it was?

140
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,358
-That shouldn't be your priority!
-Unbelievable.

141
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,194
-Wait a second. Doctor?
-Yes?

142
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,031
Doctor, can you take this off, please?

143
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,577
What now? Are you selling me off
to the briquette vendor?

144
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,205
That's one strong grip you have.

145
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,295
I told you it hurts!

146
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,963
Say that again

147
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,715
and I'll kill myself.

148
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,676
What about him?

149
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,554
Mention him again and I'll abandon you.

150
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,640
I'll sell you off to the briquette vendor.

151
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,648
Was that man someone you know?

152
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,695
Please don't tell me you owe him money.

153
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,531
Why...

154
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,535
I'm glad you at least remember
who you owe money to.

155
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,747
How do you remember that?

156
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,168
Not knowing how your child feels
kills you inside.

157
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,297
-Just stay in bed.
-I need to go!

158
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,008
I'll make sure
that Joker doesn't hurt Dongbaek.

159
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,260
Knowing how they feel kills you, too.

160
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,679
It'll get you killed!

161
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,348
How can I stay in bed
when he went after Dongbaek?

162
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,599
-Come on!
-No.

163
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,772
That's why you've been all over this case.

164
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,401
Jeez.

165
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,152
Did this...

166
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,074
happen to you
while you were trying to catch Joker?

167
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,826
Was it all for Dongbaek?

168
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,954
Joker's after her?
When she's already that unlucky?

169
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,664
Mom!

170
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,137
Let's go.

171
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,602
I'm sorry, Coach.
I'm afraid I'll have to pass this season.

172
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,313
Why? Is it your shoulder again?
Are you hurt?

173
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,648
Are you scared?

174
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,067
No, I'm actually in solid condition.
It's just that

175
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,777
I might be banned from playing.

176
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,196
What? Have you done something?

177
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,364
No,

178
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,992
but I think I'm about to.

179
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,791
Keep your distance.
He's quick-witted, you know.

180
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,605
Kang Jong-ryeol, that fucking jerk!

181
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,611
Wait. What's that?

182
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,781
What...

183
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,456
No, sit still. Don't open the window.

184
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,543
How much for the side-view mirror?

185
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,379
Tell me. How much?

186
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,761
Home treatment increases
chances of infection,

187
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,264
but he just has to make his mother
worry like this

188
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,475
and come back here.

189
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,317
MOTOR BOATS

190
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,861
-Hello.
-Hello.

191
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,405
Did you see a woman wearing these

192
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,991
a few nights back?

193
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,410
No, I haven't seen those clothes before.

194
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:54,124
Then could we perhaps
check your security camera footage?

195
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,503
I'm sorry, but they haven't been working
since last week.

196
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,505
Jeez.

197
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,632
-Since last week?
-Yes.

198
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:08,597
So it went out
around last Tuesday or Wednesday?

199
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,808
That's right.

200
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,768
What? What is it?

201
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,606
What is it?

202
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,317
This is nuts.

203
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:24,530
The market security cameras
went out around that time, too.

204
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:25,906
What?

205
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,868
Damn it.

206
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,372
Do you still think
it was just an accident?

207
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,711
What the hell is this?

208
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,463
People throw out all kinds of stuff here.

209
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,599
Gosh, why did you buy this helmet?

210
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,233
If this is human blood,

211
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,404
then it came from the neck
and not the head.

212
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,741
-What?
-Chief.

213
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,703
Is it possible to get divers out here?

214
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,667
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell Dongbaek.

215
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,921
If Hyang-mi is dead,

216
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,383
then it happened when she went
on the delivery for Dongbaek.

217
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,554
Dongbaek wouldn't stop blaming herself.

218
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,474
Still, this could be Joker's doing.

219
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,477
She needs to know
so that she can stay safe.

220
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,025
I don't want her
to worry a single moment more.

221
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,696
You should've seen me when I told Dongbaek

222
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,115
not to go on deliveries.

223
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,201
It was pathetic.

224
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,288
Rather than her being careful,
I should just catch the bastard.

225
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,291
I just need to catch him.

226
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,505
Why must Dongbaek always live in fear?

227
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:08,634
Yong-sik, I know
how you act first and think later,

228
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,513
but you're no match for Joker.

229
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,264
I'll catch him.

230
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,684
I'm not going to stop until I catch

231
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,728
whoever it is
that's messing with Dongbaek.

232
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,900
OFFERING FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE

233
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,444
CAMELLIA

234
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,241
Mom, other people
live similar lives too, right?

235
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,203
Why are you curious about others' lives?

236
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,499
If others have it as hard as I do,

237
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,584
I'll feel less sorry for myself.

238
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,753
It's every man for himself.

239
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,047
Everyone has it hard.

240
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,220
Still, you didn't have a drunk father
or a cheating mother.

241
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,973
Is that supposed to comfort me?

242
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,396
You say it's the same for us all,

243
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,317
but who else has stopped making deliveries
because of Joker?

244
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,654
Should I catch that punk for you?

245
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,700
Just peel the garlic.

246
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,496
I told you I'd do
at least one thing for you.

247
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,125
-Then catch him.
-Should I?

248
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,420
Or should I kill him?

249
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,676
Mom, you don't have
any criminal records, right?

250
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,429
Right? You can tell me, you know.

251
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,196
It's easy to cover up
marital problems and an affair,

252
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,991
but having an illegitimate kid isn't.

253
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,660
If word gets out about it,

254
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,830
people will point fingers at you
wherever you go.

255
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,583
I'm not here for a lecture.

256
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,502
Just name a price.

257
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,047
How much do you earn doing this?

258
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,590
I'll pay that amount.

259
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,717
I'll pay what you earn for selling me out.

260
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,641
You're scared though, right?

261
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,937
You acting tough and all

262
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,772
can't hide that.

263
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,900
This naive attitude
won't help your pleading--

264
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,152
-Why would I plead with you?
-Then what?

265
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,154
Will you threaten me?

266
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,744
Well, one thing's for sure.
You're a true man,

267
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,788
but not a decent father.

268
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,023
Let's get a bite to eat--

269
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,197
I'm not trying to cover it all up.

270
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,868
Report my separation
and the possibility of a divorce.

271
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,245
I'll give you an exclusive.

272
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,500
Why?

273
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,713
So just leave the kid alone.

274
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,508
I'll pay whatever amount you ask,

275
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,304
so leave my boy alone.

276
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,849
At least make it sound more touching,
will you?

277
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,476
Just so you know,

278
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,479
rich and talented people like you
make me sick.

279
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,024
Sir.

280
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,651
If it's me you hate,

281
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,695
just go after me.

282
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,947
All this time,

283
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,159
I've done nothing for the kid.

284
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,371
He doesn't deserve this kind of shitstorm.

285
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,582
So,

286
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,127
please just mess with me alone.

287
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,631
I won't struggle

288
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,050
nor squeal.

289
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,510
I'll let you trample all over me,

290
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,640
so please...

291
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,100
leave

292
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,771
the boy alone.

293
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,527
Finally, you sound like a father.

294
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,156
Now, Mr. Kang, listen to me carefully.

295
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,492
When talking about payments,

296
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:48,247
you will accept my offer
with this look and attitude.

297
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,581
Okay?

298
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,379
What should we eat?

299
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,017
Wait, who exactly are you?

300
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,728
-What's going on?
-We'll talk elsewhere.

301
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,647
Who are you and why are you here?

302
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,524
-Me?
-Seong-hui...

303
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,942
Her daughter.

304
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:18,902
I'm her daughter.

305
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,905
Let's go. We'll talk somewhere else.

306
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,786
Are you the one who sent her here?

307
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:28,870
Sorry?

308
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,041
You abandoned your mom who has dementia,

309
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,169
and she sought out
the daughter she abandoned.

310
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,425
Dementia?

311
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,430
I guess you do have a sense of shame.

312
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,308
It'd be shameless to seek out the kid
you abandoned.

313
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:53,770
Mom?

314
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,611
Dongbaek,

315
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,614
take Pil-gu inside.

316
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:15,542
So you haven't been in touch
with your sister for a while?

317
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,253
Then,

318
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,381
does she have any relatives in Korea?

319
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,301
Does my sister owe money?

320
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,057
No, that's not why I'm calling.

321
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,393
You see, she actually...

322
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,146
could be missing.

323
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:39,775
Even if she owes money,
paying it isn't my responsibility.

324
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,319
-Right?
-What?

325
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,327
Like I said, she doesn't owe anyone money.

326
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:51,828
Right.

327
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:56,166
Still, you're her family,

328
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,586
so at least report her missing.

329
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,215
We can't make a thorough investigation
without a formal report.

330
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,216
You need to report--

331
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,677
CHOI HYANG-MI

332
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,432
Wait, are you still there?

333
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,602
What is your sister's date of birth?

334
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:16,978
Actually,

335
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,065
what's your date of birth?

336
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,817
Thank you.

337
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,196
Who uses their sibling's date of birth
as a pin code?

338
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,364
What did I tell you?

339
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,867
It means that her brother is all she has.

340
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:38,250
There hasn't been
any recent activity on her account.

341
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:45,132
One might think she was
a victim of voice phishing.

342
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,052
Everything she earned was wired overseas.

343
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,347
But the amount is...

344
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:57,018
The fact that she'd send
as little as 380,000 won

345
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,521
proves her love for him.

346
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,441
She always put him first.

347
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,699
That jerk was only worried about
whether Hyang-mi owed money to anyone.

348
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,452
What an ungrateful punk.

349
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,707
-This name is popping up again.
-Whose?

350
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,045
Why would his name pop up here?

351
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,592
See? Every path leads to one man.

352
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,595
SENT BY NO GYU-TAE

353
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,698
Hey, are you smiling right now?

354
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,826
Are you thrilled about the divorce?

355
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,245
Goodbye, then.

356
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,625
Don't go around
pretending as if you're the victim.

357
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,338
Mom, just go. This isn't my wedding.

358
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,424
Why did you follow me
on my way to get divorced?

359
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,887
To be frank, you're smart and poor,

360
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,014
but he's stupid yet rich.

361
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,059
You married him for that, didn't you?

362
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,895
Mother, I married him

363
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,397
because I liked him.

364
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,610
Ja-yeong.

365
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,321
Unlike how worn out I get
because of my strictness,

366
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,699
he seemed kind of cute
because of his honesty.

367
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,036
Then why did you divorce me? Why?

368
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,704
What a load of nonsense.

369
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,917
Would you have married him
if he didn't have any money?

370
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:48,171
It's kind of awkward
to mention this at this point,

371
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:52,008
but the least rich man I was set up with
was the son of a shipping company CEO.

372
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,928
And I'm more competent than you think.

373
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,763
Why would I be greedy

374
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,433
about that tiny amount of money
when I can earn that myself anyway?

375
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,477
What? "Tiny amount of money"?

376
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,273
Hey, then give back the house.

377
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:09,526
Well, we can think of that
as the price he'll pay

378
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,362
for the cost of living,
which I always covered.

379
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,283
Your son never paid
for our living expenses.

380
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,701
Unbelievable.

381
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,745
Hey, I'm glad you divorced her.

382
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,040
-I can't get any grandchildren from her--
-Mom!

383
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,960
I guess this is the end of us.

384
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:31,172
I hope you meet a daughter-in-law
who's obedient and loves money.

385
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,384
Are you trying to get back at me?

386
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,719
Hey, you!

387
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,471
So why did you follow me all the way here?

388
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,391
-Why are you blaming me?
-Who do you think you are?

389
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,102
Are you the heroine of my life?

390
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,647
Ja-yeong is my heroine, not you!

391
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:51,318
If you want to see me live my life,

392
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,945
you should just be a supporting role!

393
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,323
Hey! That little... Hey!

394
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,037
My gosh.

395
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,124
Ja-yeong is just unbelievable.

396
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:07,959
Goodness!

397
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:09,836
What?

398
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,130
Why is there gum here?

399
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,716
Gum? There's gum?

400
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,177
Ja-yeong wouldn't do such a thing.

401
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,055
Oh, gosh.

402
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,059
Goodness. You idiot.

403
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,771
Why did you have an affair with a brat
who puts their gum in a car?

404
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,066
-My gosh.
-Man, she's just...

405
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,120
BANPO HIGH CASTLE PARKING PASS

406
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,707
Pil-gu.

407
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,544
Has Grandma ever called you Pil-gu?

408
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,380
-No.
-No, right?

409
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,965
Not every day,
only when you aren't around.

410
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,468
What?

411
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,306
When you're around, she calls me Dongbaek,
but when you're gone, she calls me Pil-gu.

412
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,268
-Why?
-She doesn't have dementia.

413
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,481
She's actually the smartest
among the three of us.

414
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,859
-Who said that?
-Everyone.

415
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:16,903
Everyone says that.

416
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,072
-It'll be ready soon.
-Okay.

417
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,912
Hey, Dongbaek. You put on some weight.

418
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,289
Me? Did I gain some weight?

419
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,125
That rarely happens.

420
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,918
That's the power of mothers.

421
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,672
-Hey, you put on some weight, too.
-He did.

422
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:39,092
If you put a skinny-ass kid
back with their mom

423
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,802
for just a month,

424
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,595
they'll come out looking like a pig.

425
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,016
You two have chubby cheeks now
thanks to her food.

426
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,687
I hate this place
because she's too talkative.

427
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,358
I guess I never gained any weight
because I never had Mom's food.

428
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,903
Dongbaek, let's forget about
the rice cake soup.

429
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,197
Mom. Where are you going?

430
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,159
Can you hurry up?

431
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,577
Mom!

432
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,122
She definitely doesn't have dementia.

433
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,708
My mom was nothing like her. What a joke.

434
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,919
I don't know who's worse,
her mom who puts on a show,

435
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,088
or Dongbaek who gets fooled by that act.

436
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,884
She probably never saw
anyone who has dementia.

437
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,221
She didn't use any of this.
What's going on?

438
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,941
Why did she put these here?

439
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,067
ASPARAGUS, BLACK BEANS

440
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,534
Things did get easier for us
after she came.

441
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,456
Pil-gu, why do you think
Grandma came to our house?

442
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,125
To make us food?

443
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,257
No, I can talk. It's fine.

444
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,928
It's nothing serious.
So what did the doctor say?

445
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,224
Mong-sil needs surgery?

446
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,102
My cat got her gallstone removed, too.

447
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,103
Are you my daughter?

448
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,150
-No, it's nothing.
-Are you a gold digger's daughter?

449
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,028
Hang up.

450
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,114
Stop treating me like I'm invisible.

451
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,201
No, I'll call you back.

452
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,370
Okay.

453
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,794
Don't be so rude
while I'm talking on the phone.

454
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:43,466
Do you still think
I'm less than your pet cat?

455
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,218
Cats can be grateful.

456
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,135
Grateful?

457
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,429
For what?

458
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,725
I worked for your family as a maid
for ten years,

459
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,271
but you and your smart siblings
treated me like a gold digger.

460
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,358
Why did you come looking for me?
What do you want from me?

461
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,903
Don't be like that, Mom.

462
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,739
We're your legal children.

463
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,756
Goodness, I can't believe

464
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,759
you're washing your car now of all days.

465
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,844
SELF SERVICE CAR WASH

466
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,015
Do you have a crush on me?

467
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,851
Why do you keep following me around?

468
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,562
-It's because--
-You're suddenly washing your car?

469
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,690
Why? Do you have to
get rid of some evidence?

470
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:41,858
You're unbelievable.

471
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,986
Hey, you aren't supposed
to conduct an investigation like that.

472
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:49,699
You might as well ask him if he did it.
Why are you so straightforward?

473
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:59,584
Do I have to get permission
from a constable to wash my car?

474
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,588
Officer Hwang.

475
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,674
The political power in Ongsan
will change soon.

476
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,468
You should learn to behave.

477
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,679
I got rid of the gum
next to the passenger's seat.

478
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,767
My gosh, Hyang-mi is one crazy brat.

479
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,561
Why did she stick gum on my car?

480
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,980
But the stain on your steering wheel
won't come off.

481
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,565
There was a stain there?

482
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,990
Did you drive
with something on your hands?

483
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,825
Did I get something on this?

484
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,911
Isn't this

485
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,789
-blood?
-What? Blood?

486
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,295
Why would there be blood here?

487
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,048
You.

488
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,928
Why would there be blood here?
You're scaring me.

489
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,180
You probably picked your nose
while driving.

490
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,100
I never pick my nose!

491
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,434
Mr. No.

492
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,314
What were you doing
around 10:00 p.m. on the 24th?

493
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,655
Let's go and talk at the police station.

494
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,574
Why? Do I get arrested
for picking my nose while driving?

495
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,787
You're the only one

496
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,373
who benefited from the Joker case.

497
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,918
You're the only one who was close

498
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,587
with the director of Hanbit Academy
who went off the grid.

499
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,346
You're the only one who sent money
several times

500
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,557
to Choi Hyang-mi, who has gone missing.

501
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:41,769
And above all, you're the only one

502
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,939
who had blood on his steering wheel--

503
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,109
I probably picked my nose!
I just picked my nose.

504
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,694
Darn it.

505
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:53,114
You're at the end of every single trail.

506
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,283
Chief Byeon.

507
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:59,245
How much longer do I have to play along
with this detective act?

508
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,497
We can't get a hold of Hyang-mi.

509
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,291
Please do cooperate.

510
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:07,253
It's obvious. She probably ran away
with someone's money.

511
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,422
Why are you asking me about her?

512
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,508
We have nothing to do with each other.

513
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,844
Hey, man.

514
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,931
What did you do on the night of the 24th?

515
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,018
-Why can't you tell me?
-Hey, man.

516
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,396
-I had masu salmon! All right?
-Do you have an alibi?

517
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,564
An alibi?

518
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:27,982
My goodness.

519
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,525
Hey!

520
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,070
You can call my mother-in-law.

521
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,447
His mother-in-law runs

522
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,991
that masu salmon place
he always talks about.

523
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,204
Just tell him what you did on that day.

524
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,372
You don't have to raise suspicion.

525
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,334
I honestly don't remember. That's why.

526
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,128
I got completely wasted on that day,

527
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,214
so I don't even remember
how I made it home.

528
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,882
What is this about Hyang-mi?

529
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,492
I'm sorry, Mother.

530
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,123
Ja-yeong.

531
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,916
Enough.

532
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,754
She really isn't here, is she?

533
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:36,551
My dear Ja-yeong
is really not here, right?

534
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,929
She's not over there either, right?

535
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,306
She's not here. I told you.

536
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,143
Why are you looking for her here?

537
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,186
I'm sorry.

538
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,481
I'm human garbage.

539
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,987
-Ja-yeong.
-Take this and go.

540
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,114
Your chauffeur will be here soon.

541
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,787
Ja-yeong, I love you.

542
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:05,913
Goodness.

543
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,790
ONGSAN FISHING CLUB

544
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,018
How dare she look down on me?

545
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,982
This is all because of Hyang-mi.
If she didn't show up...

546
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,332
I'm gonna kill them all.

547
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,369
Hyang-mi.

548
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,456
Are you dead?

549
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,091
Darn it.

550
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,385
Gyu-tae.

551
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,096
Darn it. Can you catch that jerk?

552
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,890
No, first off, can you get me up?

553
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,227
You aren't dead.

554
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:57,984
Why?

555
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,986
Do you remember something?

556
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,489
You just remembered
the scene of your crime, right?

557
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,454
Is Hyang-mi really missing?

558
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,665
She didn't just run away?

559
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,543
There's no sign that shows
she's still alive.

560
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,546
She hasn't used any money,
and she won't pick up her phone.

561
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,090
Did you track her phone?

562
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,801
The Personal Information Protection Act
is very strict.

563
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,679
A substation can't just--
You don't know anything.

564
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,806
Let's go, then.

565
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,100
Where to?

566
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,769
The phone dealer shop
at the Ongsan Intersection is

567
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,187
run by my cousin.

568
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,524
He tracked down the jerk
who ran away with my money

569
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,651
by using the location tracking device.

570
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,406
Anyway, let's go.

571
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,078
Why is she here?

572
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,041
I don't think a human being
should be there.

573
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,544
Why is a person in the middle of the lake?

574
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,754
ONGSAN LAKE

575
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:00,921
Hyang-mi...

576
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,215
The last location can show up that way.

577
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:08,179
If you drop your phone in water,
the signal usually gets cut off.

578
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,557
But if you drop it when it's still on

579
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,353
or if the battery's taken out,
you can sometimes get the signal.

580
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,316
Maybe she threw her phone in there
and ran away.

581
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,486
How can she throw it that far?
She's not an athlete.

582
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,404
The duck pedal boat.

583
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,407
What if

584
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,326
she went out on a boat?

585
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,246
It might not be in the middle of the lake.

586
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,458
There's a margin of error.

587
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,378
Do you really think
Hyang-mi is in Ongsan Lake?

588
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,507
Why do you keep asking me? Darn it.

589
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,050
Yong-sik.

590
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,637
It's a huge deal
to get a diving team out here.

591
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,556
What will you do?

592
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,477
Darn it.

593
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,898
But it shows that she's there.
Do we just leave it like this?

594
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,660
Let's send over the helmet, the half-burnt
sweater, and the steering wheel

595
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,328
for a bloodstain examination.

596
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,540
Why would you send my steering wheel?
Do you think that's her blood?

597
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,960
Chief, can you keep looking for
any signs of life from Hyang-mi?

598
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,463
I mean, even if I find a spider at home,

599
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,715
I pick it up with a paper cup

600
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:30,594
and put it at the corner of my garden,
where it's connected to the mountain.

601
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,598
It's not just because of the superstition
about spiders making you rich.

602
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,561
It's because spiders
are precious forms of life, too.

603
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,981
Goodness.

604
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,568
Mr. No, are you crying?

605
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:50,990
I can't even kill a spider.
How can I do that to Hyang-mi?

606
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,410
-Darn it.
-Don't go anywhere.

607
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:57,037
If you go to an airport,
you'll be banned from leaving.

608
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,331
I'll request a warrant
so you can't run.

609
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,374
Please...

610
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,836
Why would you scare him like that?
He can't even kill a spider.

611
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,464
Get up. Come on.

612
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,967
-Calm down.
-Get in already!

613
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,844
I'll drive you home.

614
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,642
Why did he follow us here?

615
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,313
Chief, look at this.

616
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,523
Something definitely happened here.

617
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,109
I feel like he might really cry.

618
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,779
Did I kill her?

619
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,533
To be honest,

620
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,495
I actually did feel the urge

621
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,039
to kill her.

622
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,587
This is driving me crazy.

623
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,549
Why are the cops here already?

624
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,012
So what?

625
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,807
Did you kill her?
Or did you just want to kill her?

626
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,354
First, she asked me to book
a flight ticket for her.

627
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:08,067
Then she asked me for 500,000 won.
And then she asked for 300,000 won.

628
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,487
She was treating me
like I was some kind of a piggy bank.

629
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,988
So there was a time

630
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:18,619
when I really wanted to hit her hard
on her forehead.

631
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:23,332
So what's your point?
Did you kill her or not?

632
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:28,128
I don't think I would've killed her
even if I was really drunk.

633
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,548
Do you think

634
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:32,967
I could've killed her?

635
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,054
What is this nonsense?

636
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:41,433
You're about to turn yourself in
before we even start investigating.

637
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,227
Will you please calm down?

638
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,730
-Why are you taking the suspect's side?
-"Suspect"?

639
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,693
He may look clumsy and all,
but that might just be an act.

640
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,737
Hey, I've been working as a cop
for 20 years now.

641
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:56,115
People who break the law are pretty smart.

642
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,283
What?

643
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,704
Then why won't you tell me anything
about Hanbit Academy?

644
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,415
You said I'll cause a mess
if I dig into that.

645
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,834
-He said that?
-Yes.

646
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,795
Yong-sik.

647
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,007
Do you know about
the statute of limitations?

648
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,009
What?

649
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,678
Come to my store tomorrow.

650
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,974
Let me get a consultation
about the statute of limitations first.

651
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,476
Then I'll decide
whether to tell you about it or not.

652
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,040
It'd be nice if Dongbaek eats this

653
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,460
before he goes to school tomorrow.

654
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,671
-Mom.
-But I'm not sure

655
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,090
if this will cook by tomorrow morning.

656
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,054
Mom, you don't have dementia, do you?

657
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:04,892
Mom, why did you come?

658
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,020
Come on. Tell me.

659
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,106
Dongbaek.

660
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,234
I don't even want to know
why you abandoned me anymore.

661
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,236
At least tell me why you came.

662
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,572
I told you, didn't I?

663
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:24,286
I promised to do
at least one thing for you.

664
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,373
So did you do it?

665
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,459
Yes, I did.

666
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,044
What did you do?

667
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,348
You're starting to scare me, Mom.

668
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,477
You're more of a mystery to me
than my customers who are strangers.

669
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,148
I'll tell you everything.

670
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,694
-I was just waiting for the right time.
-No, it's okay.

671
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,864
I don't want to hear your story.
It's already pretty obvious.

672
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,951
I'm a huge idiot.

673
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,703
So I'll end up
feeling sorry for you.

674
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:15,462
I don't want to forget
how much I deserve to hate you.

675
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:19,633
So don't try to make me pity you.
I don't want to hear anything.

676
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,386
Dongbaek...

677
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,348
My gosh, that idiot.

678
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,643
Then you should tell me to leave.

679
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,396
Why can't you just kick me out of here?

680
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,817
ONGSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

681
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,987
My hand does sting a lot,

682
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:43,073
but you always come with me
to the hospital like this.

683
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,117
So it's not that bad.

684
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,954
It feels like I'm being cared for.

685
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:52,958
And it looks as though I'm the only person
on your mind these days.

686
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,461
Yong-sik.

687
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,423
You can act childish in front of me.

688
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:03,927
But please refrain from telling your mom
how much you like me.

689
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:04,970
Why?

690
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:09,349
It's quite natural for her
to hate me right now.

691
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,727
I'm going to tell her
I'm going to marry you.

692
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,939
What is the matter with you?

693
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,152
Why can't you be a bit more strategic?

694
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,197
You proposed yesterday,
so it's too early to tell her.

695
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,615
Dongbaek.

696
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:30,204
If I was calculative and strategic,

697
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:35,918
do you think the prettiest woman in Ongsan
would've fallen for me?

698
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:38,962
Gosh, whatever.

699
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,549
-I'm quite unusual.
-You really are unusual.

700
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,639
Since we're on the subject,

701
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,558
can you come to my house tonight?

702
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,523
Don't you live alone?

703
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:01,485
That's why I'm asking you to come.
I wouldn't have if my mom's there.

704
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,370
Dongbaek, for some strange reason,

705
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,498
you're both very pure

706
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,376
and sexy

707
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,753
at the same time.

708
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,047
I'm a nice guy,

709
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,676
but you keep making me
want to do bad stuff.

710
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,814
I'm a guy who has his own place.

711
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:44,111
I feel like we never took
full advantage of it.

712
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:48,365
And now that I proposed,
there's no need to hold back.

713
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,076
You must be crazy.

714
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,037
So you're coming over tonight, right?

715
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:58,000
How could you ask me to come over
so easily like that?

716
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,586
I really can't stand it anymore.

717
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,510
Then...

718
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:12,514
What time?

719
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,856
Don't you want to know
why I'm asking you to come over?

720
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:25,360
I'm old enough to know.
It'd be pretentious of me

721
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:28,363
to ask you why you want me to come over.

722
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,032
You're the one

723
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:34,036
who invited me over to your place.

724
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,246
Let's talk about it outside.

725
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,880
I mean, I obviously can't wash my hair
because I burned my hand.

726
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,632
Right?

727
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:51,136
We're engaged already,
so you can do that much for me.

728
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,600
I can't go over three days
without washing my hair.

729
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,479
Dongbaek.

730
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,983
Dongbaek, you must've really wanted
to come over to my house.

731
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,495
Excuse me.

732
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,083
Yes?

733
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:28,006
I think I saw you last time
when I was here with my mom.

734
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,136
Are you Ms. Jo Jeong-suk's...

735
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,349
You guys finally came together?

736
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,065
INTERNIST JEONG CHAN-GEOL

737
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,234
So my mom comes here

738
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,320
every Thursday?

739
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,533
Mom, where are you going?

740
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,034
I'll come back tomorrow night.

741
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,370
Go pick up Dongbaek later.

742
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,748
Mom, where are you going these days?

743
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,334
DOCTOR'S OFFICE

744
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,254
Please make sure
she comes three times a week.

745
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,884
Dongbaek, where were you?

746
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,225
Isn't that why you came?

747
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,519
Your mother told me that you know.

748
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,608
What's wrong? What is it?
Why do you look so out of it?

749
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,989
Let's just go.

750
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,250
You're making kimchi today?

751
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,799
You cooked beef bone soup, and now
you're making kimchi. You're so busy.

752
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,844
Why are the anchovies
still in the freezer?

753
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:58,388
Take them out.
I'll stir-fry them and put them back.

754
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,640
Why are you so busy?

755
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:02,684
Are you out of time?

756
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,442
Do you feel like
you should do stuff for me?

757
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:16,531
Mom.

758
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,501
Did you eat?

759
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,506
Let's go eat pork belly.

760
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,721
Why did you bring me all the way here
to eat meat?

761
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,814
What is it?
Is it because you want to talk?

762
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,235
Okay, fine.

763
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,987
Ask me what you want to know.

764
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,701
I'll tell you about Seong-hui,
the woman who came last time...

765
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:02,744
I'm not curious.

766
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,371
What?

767
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:08,834
I told you that I'm not interested in
how you used to live.

768
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:14,631
Excuse me. Can you give us a fork, please?

769
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,303
Thank you.

770
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,222
Mom.

771
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:32,107
We'd also like a soda, please.

772
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:38,238
Don't fill yourself up with rice.
Make sure you eat a lot of meat.

773
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,824
Should we also have some beef ribs?

774
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:55,255
Mom, wherever you go,
make sure you eat well.

775
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,716
People will like you if you eat well.
Eat up.

776
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,723
Can you give us a fork, please?

777
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,144
Here you go.

778
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,189
-Can we also have some soda?
-Sure.

779
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,735
Don't fill yourself up with rice.
Make sure you eat a lot of meat.

780
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:21,239
Should we also have some beef ribs?

781
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,284
Here.

782
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:31,041
Wherever you go, make sure you eat well.
People will like you if you eat well.

783
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:37,964
And I have a favor to ask you.

784
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,230
Eat up.

785
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:56,608
You told me to eat well
so people will like me.

786
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:00,737
How...

787
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,365
How do you...

788
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:05,492
How...

789
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,370
How do you remember all that?

790
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:11,873
How could I ever forget?

791
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,669
The pork belly we had the day you left me,

792
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,712
the menus you ordered that day,

793
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,966
and the stuff you said
as you ordered a soda and gave me a fork.

794
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,097
I even remember how you smelled that day.

795
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:31,142
I remember every single thing.

796
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,443
Do you finally understand how many times

797
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,696
I thought about that day?

798
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,367
I was younger than Pil-gu back then.

799
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,579
And I thought about the day
I got abandoned

800
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,915
over and over again.

801
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:10,640
But I can't believe
I'm still unable to hate you

802
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,184
even when you came back so late.

803
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,274
Mom.

804
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,486
Why did you really come back?

805
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:35,457
I would've at least felt sorry for you
if you told me that you were sick.

806
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:45,633
So are you going to get a checkup today?

807
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,094
Pardon?

808
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,307
Isn't that why you came?
Your mother told me that you know.

809
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,983
My daughter won't leave me to die.

810
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:07,155
She already offered to give me
one of her kidneys.

811
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:12,410
I'm sure she doesn't even need
to get a checkup.

812
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,663
She's my daughter,
so it'll be a perfect match, right?

813
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:17,791
Isn't that right?

814
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,425
Did you come to ask me for a kidney?

815
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:33,848
I can't believe you'd even want that
when you never even raised me.

816
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:46,653
But then again, I'm not even surprised.

817
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:50,323
Not everyone is brazen enough
to abandon their own child.

818
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,871
But you still could've decided to be
a decent person for a chance.

819
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:04,504
The stuff you said stayed with me
for the past 27 years.

820
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,049
But I'll return that to you now.

821
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:15,014
Why did you remember all that?

822
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:18,351
And...

823
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,312
I have a favor to ask you.

824
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,067
If anyone asks you
what my name is,

825
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,571
just say that you don't know. Okay?

826
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,240
Do it for me as a favor.

827
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,913
Mom, let me ask you one last favor.

828
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,041
If anyone asks you your daughter's name,

829
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,753
make sure you tell them you don't know.
Please do that for me.

830
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,559
PRIVATE TAXI

831
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:08,276
PRIVATE TAXI

832
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:00,745
Dongbaek!

833
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,831
Where were you?
You didn't even answer your phone.

834
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:07,210
-Yong-sik.
-What is it?

835
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,339
What's wrong? What's the matter?

836
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:15,510
I hate my mom. I hate my mom so much.

837
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:21,599
Do you really think my mom came
to ask me for that?

838
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,396
What kind of a mother is she?

839
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,523
She's so annoying.

840
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,027
What's wrong?
Did your mother ask you for something?

841
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,279
Did that annoy you?

842
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,199
No, that's not it.

843
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:44,038
My mom kept looking at me.

844
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:48,251
Why would she look at a person
who's leaving?

845
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,467
-Dongbaek.
-My mom...

846
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:00,013
My mom kept

847
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,348
looking at me.

848
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:08,938
I waited for her to come back
for 27 years.

849
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:12,734
What if...

850
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,570
my mom does the same thing?

851
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,577
What if she does the same thing?

852
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,759
Shove off if you don't
want me to bite your head off.

853
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,575
I cooked this for myself.

854
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:04,827
But we should share it.

855
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:16,172
If you want to breastfeed her,
you need to eat pig trotters.

856
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:17,507
Here.

857
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,258
There you go.

858
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,514
It's better when they're this little.

859
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:27,183
Things get chaotic
once they start walking and running.

860
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,894
Wouldn't that be better, though?

861
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:36,109
My gosh, let's wait and see
if it's really better for you.

862
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,155
Is she your first child?

863
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:42,865
Yes.

864
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,493
What about you?

865
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:48,371
This is my third baby.

866
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,710
You're running a restaurant

867
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:56,337
when you have two kids
and are pregnant?

868
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,339
You just wait and see.

869
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:02,051
Mothers are capable of doing anything.

870
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:07,598
What's her name?

871
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:11,436
Dongbaek. Her name's Dongbaek.

872
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,105
Dongbaek?

873
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:13,414
You should stop seeing her.

874
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,166
Mom, I proposed to Dongbaek.

875
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,835
I'm not even scared of fire.

876
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,171
We should live together.

877
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:24,675
We have to find Dongbaek's mom
and Hyang-mi.

878
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:25,968
And catch Joker now.

879
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,596
