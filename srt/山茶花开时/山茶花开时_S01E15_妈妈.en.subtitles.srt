1
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,771
Who is this bastard?

2
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:07,150
CAMELLIA

3
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,871
What now?

4
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,416
How do I catch this son of a bitch?

5
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,300
Dongbaek!

6
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,595
Where were you?
You didn't even answer your phone.

7
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,765
-Yong-sik.
-What is it?

8
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,019
What's wrong? What's the matter?

9
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,107
I hate my mom. I hate my mom so much.

10
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:53,196
Do you really think my mom came
to ask me for that?

11
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,575
What kind of a mother is she?

12
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,078
She's so annoying.

13
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,586
Here.

14
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,631
This isn't what revenge is.

15
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,592
How can it only be hurting me instead?

16
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,722
Getting revenge
should be satisfying for you.

17
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,684
Why are you feeling terrible about it?

18
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,980
Asking you for a kidney
after abandoning you?

19
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,858
You can't call that a mother.

20
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,862
Actually, you can't even call that
a human being.

21
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,239
How messed up is that?

22
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,245
Yong-sik,

23
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,832
are you cursing my mom right now?

24
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,751
Gosh.

25
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,588
Dongbaek.

26
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,721
It's impossible for you, Dongbaek.

27
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:01,806
What?

28
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,100
You...

29
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,186
I mean,

30
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,816
you have a system
that's far simpler and more innocent

31
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:15,320
than others,
so it's impossible for you to hate people.

32
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,911
Be more cutthroat in your next life

33
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,039
and just live as you are now
in this current one.

34
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,751
All right.
Where's this barbecue restaurant?

35
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,171
I hate my mom.

36
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,422
Gosh.

37
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,138
Her mother left the restaurant soon after.

38
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,390
He got her ID number
from the hospital.

39
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,936
He has to find Hyang-mi.

40
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,230
He has to find Dongbaek's mom.

41
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,232
He has to catch Joker as well.

42
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,859
He doesn't have it easy, does he?

43
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,989
Jeez. He got pepper-sprayed, stabbed,

44
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,492
and took out a fire with his bare hands.

45
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,495
I think it's safe to call him
Thanos of Ongsan.

46
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,708
All right, let's review the situation.

47
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,293
Well...

48
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,587
Hyang-mi went missing

49
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,298
and so did Dongbaek's mom.

50
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,221
That means Dongbaek
is all alone day and night.

51
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,306
Actually, she has Pil-gu.

52
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,851
Pil-gu doesn't technically count
as one person.

53
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,396
He's more like half a person.

54
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,149
This won't do.

55
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,071
My mom isn't around so we ordered in.

56
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,282
I'll call once we've eaten.

57
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,748
In-gu, are you still
stealing money from vending machines?

58
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,418
I'm done with that, you know.

59
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,378
Wait, what's with that face? Is it true?

60
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,838
-Yes, of course.
-Really?

61
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,047
Yes, really.

62
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,632
Is that so?

63
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,969
Then since I'm proud of you...

64
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,313
Bring me some chicken, too.

65
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,356
Jeez.

66
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,543
Oh, gosh.

67
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,255
My gosh, Dongbaek.

68
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,924
Are you on a stakeout?

69
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,595
How did you know I was here?

70
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,889
How did you know I ordered chicken?

71
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,142
We ordered in. I'll call once we've eaten.

72
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,519
Right, enjoy your chicken then.

73
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,189
Sure.

74
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,571
I thought you'd be hungry,
but I see you ate.

75
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,406
Right.

76
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,160
I never skip meals
even when I have enteritis.

77
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,703
Food is your source of energy.

78
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,250
Here.

79
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,756
Why do you keep giving me candy?
I've already had enough.

80
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,258
Eating this elevates your mood.

81
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,886
I thought it could give you energy.

82
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,683
Nothing's bringing me down, you know.

83
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,103
I even enjoyed some fried chicken.

84
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,818
I had an appetite for it
even after leaving my mom behind.

85
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,282
It doesn't make you a bad person.

86
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,535
That's just life.

87
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,453
Life isn't a soap opera, you know.

88
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,081
We can't stay in bed for days
whenever something happens.

89
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,083
That's why I'm grateful.

90
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,212
I would've stayed in bed for days
had I been alone.

91
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,966
Thanks to you, I keep on living my life.

92
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,679
You know how sometimes

93
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,807
you run on a secondary battery.

94
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,020
I still want to make sure my son is fed,

95
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,107
the fried chicken is tasty,

96
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,361
and I worry about
whether you've had dinner.

97
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:35,580
Anyway, Pil-gu comes first,
then the fried chicken,

98
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,124
and then it's me

99
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,960
who gives you the energy to live.

100
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,842
Dongbaek, I'm sure your mom

101
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,970
has eaten dinner too,

102
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,264
so don't worry.

103
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,767
No,

104
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,228
she wouldn't have.

105
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,647
There's no way.

106
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,277
It's what I learned as a mom.

107
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:11,032
The love you have for your children
can be terrifying.

108
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,412
The parents get their lives
sucked out of them

109
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,831
while the kids still manage

110
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,084
to eat a bowl of soup
at a parent's funeral.

111
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,051
How much will you sell this for?

112
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,179
I'm not selling anything.
There's barely enough for Yong-sik.

113
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,351
Even in Chinese,
"Mama" is the word for mom.

114
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,229
Mom, mama, mother...

115
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,980
Aren't they all similar?

116
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,691
It must be some sort of incantation.

117
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,995
I wonder if she froze the beef bone soup.

118
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:02,792
I guess that incantation makes us
live only as mothers

119
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,962
instead of just as
Deok-sun, Jeong-suk, and Dongbaek.

120
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,640
We become fools when we're called "Mom."

121
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,812
After devoting ourselves to our children,
we still want to do more.

122
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,986
MOTHER

123
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,700
This one boy of mine
is scarier than ten million of haters.

124
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,203
No alumnus has ever showed
this much support before.

125
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,539
These kids are a lucky bunch.

126
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:46,127
So in my opinion, I recommend
Cha Seung-u in sixth grade,

127
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,839
Kwon Jun-hyeong in fifth grade,
and Yun Ji-hyeok in third grade.

128
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,593
Must you only choose
from those in the upper grades?

129
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,886
Well, they've been showing
a lot of promise.

130
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,097
They're passionate,
and have well-off parents.

131
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,767
Why should I help someone study abroad
if they're already well-off?

132
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,313
ONGSAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

133
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,148
You're absolutely right.

134
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,067
How about Hong Ji-dam in fifth grade?

135
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,321
Never mind.
I choose Kang Pil-gu, the first grader.

136
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,864
Pil-gu?

137
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,241
I will personally support Kang Pil-gu.

138
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,288
Pil-gu's not a good choice, I'm afraid.

139
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,081
What do you mean?

140
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,167
I think the kid's a natural.

141
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,086
It doesn't matter if he's good.
He won't go.

142
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,672
He wouldn't leave his mom to go
to training sessions,

143
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,549
so studying abroad is not happening.

144
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,760
Just choose Pil-gu.

145
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,181
For some reason,

146
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,477
you seem really interested in him.

147
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,979
He's my student.

148
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,483
I'm the one who discovered him,

149
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,443
so I'll train him well myself.

150
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,153
I'm Pil-gu's father.

151
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,281
What?

152
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,078
I'm Pil-gu's biological father.

153
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:08,668
I'm putting on this show
to provide him with a good education,

154
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:13,005
so be a good man and coach,
and help me out.

155
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,010
I will make sure he makes it

156
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,554
to the Major League.

157
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,850
So I've been training
the future Lion King?

158
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,607
I'm not a kid, you know.

159
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,235
This won't score you any points.

160
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,113
You think playing games
would make me forget everything?

161
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,156
No way.

162
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,494
You know,

163
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,747
being with you
makes me want to see my father.

164
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,457
And stop coming to our school.

165
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,253
Kids are saying that
you've been fired from the Ligers.

166
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,424
Why do you hate me so much?

167
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,092
Give me one good reason.

168
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,301
How can I only pick one?

169
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,472
Yes, that's honest.
That's very honest of you.

170
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,188
That look right there.

171
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,816
I used to glare at my dad just like that.

172
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,818
You'll regret it someday.

173
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,945
I bet your father
still raised you, though.

174
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,490
Why are you always so logical?

175
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,160
How can you tell me to say just one thing?

176
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,536
You're so shameless.

177
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,748
Fine, then tell me everything.

178
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,000
I hate that you're on the Superman show.

179
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,209
That will be over soon.

180
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,545
You're with someone
who's always in tights.

181
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,672
Leave the grown-ups' business to us.

182
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,301
You have a baby who poops her pants,
so what are you pestering me for?

183
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,511
That pooping girl is your sister.

184
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,013
Also, why haven't you

185
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,474
apologized to me?

186
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,603
What?

187
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,605
Even when I'm sick,

188
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,316
Mom always apologizes

189
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,985
while making me pork cutlets.

190
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,946
However, you haven't. Not even once.

191
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,294
I really didn't know.

192
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,756
If I had known about you,
I would've been in your life.

193
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,676
We're given a one-minute time-out
if we don't do our homework

194
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,971
and a five-minute time-out
if we say we didn't know about it.

195
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,601
Then what should I do?

196
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,354
Do you want me to
sit in the corner for 100 minutes?

197
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,279
A crime scene always tells us something.

198
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,782
The person who called
for your cleaning services.

199
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,952
-That person must be the landlord.
-Gyu-tae probably knows him.

200
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,913
They were pretty close.
They hung out together often.

201
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,707
When you go from here,
you see this window open.

202
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,504
But when you go in the other direction,
it's closed.

203
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,214
ONGSAN TRANSPORTATION

204
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,676
Even serial killer Jeong Nam-gyu
showed up at his old crime scenes.

205
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,596
He coped during his hiatus
by reminiscing his killings.

206
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,684
Those who stink are prime suspects.

207
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,186
Don't dig into Hanbit Academy.

208
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,564
It'll cause a mess in Ongsan.

209
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,858
A crime scene always tells us something.

210
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,026
Come to my store tomorrow.

211
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,822
Let me get a consultation
about the statute of limitations first.

212
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,907
Then I'll decide
to tell you about it or not.

213
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,119
The person who runs away
is the suspicious one.

214
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,334
A crime scene always tells us something.

215
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,755
It could be laughing at me
for not figuring it out already.

216
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,177
Every case is affected by
current social conditions.

217
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,602
Consider the Ongsan golden radishes.

218
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,273
It's 7,000 won for a bundle.
Might as well call them golden radishes.

219
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,609
The radishes are super pricey,

220
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,945
so of course
there's a security camera near the field.

221
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,204
And there...

222
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,961
Hold on a second.

223
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,005
Actually,

224
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:27,301
I was wondering if I could check
your security camera footage.

225
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,469
Yong-sik!

226
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,805
-What's with him?
-Yong-sik!

227
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,224
Yong-sik!

228
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,976
Is that your name?

229
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,063
Yes, I'm Hwang Yong-sik
of Ongsan Substation.

230
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,439
Anyway,

231
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,149
it's the footage from the 24th--

232
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,443
Yong-sik, we think that

233
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,363
there's a reason to everything
that happens in this world.

234
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,990
Sorry?

235
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,201
If you consider everything that happens

236
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,453
as a result of something else,

237
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,330
it all seems reasonable.

238
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,548
You see, I learned that from my dog.

239
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,804
Yeong-sim.

240
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,225
Go to Yeong-sim's garlic field.

241
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,352
Why should I go
when a dog gave birth?

242
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,396
That darn Yeong-sim.

243
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,899
Yeong-sim is determined to kill you
because you never came around.

244
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,818
Stop it! I'm not going to Yeong-sim's.

245
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,404
Enough with Yeong-sim already!

246
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,280
Yeong-sim sent in a complaint.

247
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,992
She got irritable bowel syndrome
due to stress.

248
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,954
What you sow is what you reap.

249
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,000
If you wish to see the camera footage,

250
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,669
you can bring a warrant.

251
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,254
So the dog--

252
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,592
What all started with the dog

253
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,804
came to bite me in the ass.

254
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,349
Divorce these days is just a life choice.

255
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,435
It's true that
what goes around comes around.

256
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,811
I'm divorced myself.

257
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,106
Has my wife always been that cool?

258
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,150
Did she always laugh well?

259
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,277
A divorce attorney
who is divorced herself.

260
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,571
Is that good for marketing?

261
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,073
If I go to jail,

262
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,118
I won't be able to see that smile.

263
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,327
Doesn't it get lonely?

264
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,080
That's what I'm most afraid of.

265
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,335
I do get lonely. A lot.

266
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,549
However, I feel less lonely
than I did when I was married.

267
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,680
It's more lonely to live with someone
who's not really there.

268
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,683
Then...

269
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,895
My eldest aunt has a son

270
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,980
who is also divorced.

271
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,066
He has no kids and is an accountant.

272
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,443
Maybe you two could--

273
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,360
Honey!

274
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,532
Honey, I need a consultation.

275
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,831
Yes, I'm just... You see...

276
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,214
-Sorry?
-Why ask me where that woman is?

277
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,590
That woman?

278
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,301
Is she pretending to be in hiding now?

279
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,470
Did she tell you to call me?

280
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,182
Didn't you say she's your mother, though?

281
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:25,395
Yes, so please tell that dear mother
to stop putting on a show.

282
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,441
I will visit her in a few days
with a certification of facts.

283
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,901
A certification of what?

284
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,070
Hello?

285
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:34,780
What...

286
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,868
What has Mom been up to in her life?

287
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,957
-Dongbaek.
-Hello.

288
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,253
Will you be at
the committee meeting today?

289
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,839
Is that today?

290
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,092
This is on our agenda today,

291
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,762
so just make sure to agree with it.

292
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,181
Sure.

293
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,144
Why? Do you feel awkward to come?

294
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,899
Of course.
The committee head is Ms. Kwak...

295
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,988
You know what? Meeting her often
is the best way to bury the hatchet.

296
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,491
Seeing someone you dislike
acting all shy and awkward

297
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,784
is even more annoying.

298
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,037
Is that how I seem to you?

299
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,665
Just come by and
interact with her shamelessly.

300
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,209
It's hard to stay angry at those who do.

301
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,088
BAEKDU MARINATED CRAB

302
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,256
Mom.

303
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,429
You drank alcohol, didn't you?

304
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,514
You're injured and you're drinking?

305
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,017
I've been plucking radishes.

306
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,727
What radishes?

307
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,856
A certain Yeong-sim
just had to make a point.

308
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,611
Gosh, is this a duck or an ostrich?

309
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,655
This has been boiled for days.

310
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,616
It will speed up your recovery.

311
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:04,494
What does duck meat have
to do with skin regeneration?

312
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,580
When you had the mumps,

313
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,665
you recovered after eating duck meat.

314
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,502
You treat me so well

315
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,922
that I've never had to take a sick day.

316
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,303
Gosh, it kills me, you know.

317
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,598
You never got injured when I raised you.

318
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,017
Oh, please.
I have five scars at the least.

319
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,103
Yong-sik,

320
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,065
would you have saved me too

321
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,484
if I were in the fire?

322
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:39,488
Gosh. Do you even need to ask?
Don't tell me you're jealous.

323
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,075
Let me say this clearly then.

324
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,203
Don't ever save me
from situations like that.

325
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,706
If you do, I'll kill you myself.

326
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,500
Seriously?

327
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,044
Don't save Dongbaek either!

328
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:58,382
Cut ties with her now.
This is as far as you go.

329
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,010
Mom,

330
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,180
you liked Dongbaek.

331
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,557
No, you still do, right?

332
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,270
You like her as a friend
but not as a daughter-in-law?

333
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,272
Have you always been this shallow?

334
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,107
Yes, I have.

335
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,277
Ask anyone on the street.

336
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,780
There's not a mother in this world
who'd be fond of her son

337
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,366
running into fires and chasing a murderer.

338
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,577
I'm not asking for much, you know.

339
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,581
Mom,

340
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,710
I proposed to her.

341
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,883
Everyone's afraid of fires.

342
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,511
The heat was enough
to scare me off as well.

343
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,556
Still, even if I go back in time,

344
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,808
I'd gladly run in to save Dongbaek again.

345
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,771
Even the fire couldn't scare me off.
It proves I'm meant to be with her.

346
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:05,157
People's feelings don't change
that easily, do they?

347
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,869
The more you're like this,

348
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,040
the more I hate Dongbaek.

349
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,416
We're...

350
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,209
-Good.
-Agreed.

351
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,880
The first item on our agenda
is about the pineapples.

352
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,089
And the second...

353
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,968
So Dongbaek brought
some jujube fruits today.

354
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,305
Let's move on.

355
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:32,934
Ma'am, is there anything
you'd like to add?

356
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,154
The atmosphere is icy cold
now that the two are on different sides.

357
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,911
Gosh.

358
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,666
Nowhere else in the world.

359
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,878
We are the businesswomen
leading the Ongsan Market.

360
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,296
Ongsan Leaders!

361
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,548
Right, so who's against this?

362
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,425
-Not me.
-Not me.

363
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,344
-Then...
-You never know.

364
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,512
-What?
-What?

365
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,140
A unanimous vote
is out of the question again.

366
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,560
Dongbaek, do you even know
what you're against?

367
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,356
You're only agreeing
with what Deok-sun thinks.

368
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,941
Me?

369
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,567
She's quite political.

370
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,987
Tell us then. Why are you against this?

371
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,658
-Well, I--
-Tell us.

372
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,786
She doesn't even know
what we were talking about.

373
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,788
You were dozing off.

374
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,833
-Were you?
-Only my eyes were closed.

375
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,544
-Unbelievable.
-This isn't a school.

376
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,755
Enough with that lame excuse

377
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,092
and tell us
why you're against this matter.

378
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,472
Well, you see, I...

379
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,599
Who needs a reason?

380
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,102
She raised her hand because I nudged her.

381
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,104
So what?

382
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,480
-What?
-Gosh.

383
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,650
That means you were able to cast two votes

384
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,986
which goes against
the principle of democracy.

385
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,406
-Right?
-Exactly!

386
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,826
Well, if you're that annoyed,
get yourselves a best friend, too.

387
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,328
-What?
-Seriously?

388
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,706
Dongbaek, you really know
how to pick sides.

389
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:22,461
Just consider us two as a set.

390
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,838
You know, we're like...

391
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,215
That's enough. Just stop.

392
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:31,303
-We're like members of a girl group.
-What?

393
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,180
Thelma and Louise?

394
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,392
-A politician and her right-hand person?
-Come on.

395
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,686
More like a tyrant king and his concubine.

396
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,521
They're always like this.

397
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:55,368
You can all manage this by yourselves.
This old woman has no business in this.

398
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,205
You're the committee head.
You can't leave!

399
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,540
Come back here!

400
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,963
Ms. Kwak, could you stop avoiding me?

401
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,090
I want to get on your good side.

402
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,762
Getting on my good side isn't important.

403
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,639
What's important right now?

404
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,936
I don't have much,
and all I have is a kid.

405
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,647
I'm sure you aren't pleased with me, but--

406
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,689
No.

407
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:28,276
I hate this. I hate it.

408
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:33,031
It breaks my heart to even think
about Yong-sik bringing up

409
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,616
someone else's kid.

410
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:38,411
And I get heartbroken
when he gets hurt following you around.

411
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,917
So can you just cut me a little slack?

412
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,254
But Ms. Kwak,

413
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,550
I like Yong-sik. I like him a lot.

414
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:58,348
I like him so much
that I don't even know what to do.

415
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:04,563
He's such a warm guy,
and I don't ever want to be alone again.

416
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:08,149
Yong-sik is a very warm
and wholehearted kid.

417
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,859
That's how I brought him up.

418
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,655
I spent my entire life putting in

419
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:20,787
only pretty and good things in his eyes
while I looked at all the dirty things.

420
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:26,251
So why do you cast a shadow
in my child's eyes?

421
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,213
Am I a shadow in Yong-sik's life?

422
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,009
Nothing in this world can make him
stressed out if it wasn't for you.

423
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,431
There is no mother in this world
who would be thrilled

424
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,058
to see her son who lives in peace
date a girl

425
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,936
with an unfortunate life,
spending his life working for her.

426
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,532
So you tried doing everything
that these pathetic guys do

427
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,784
at least once.

428
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,331
As you know very well,

429
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,500
I like to be with people
and I like mingling.

430
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,669
That's not mingling.

431
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,548
No.

432
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,428
Then the statute of limitations is...

433
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,680
Forget the statute of limitations.

434
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,849
Why are you trying to
turn yourself in now?

435
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,312
I mean, it's...

436
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,356
Well...

437
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,858
I won't give you advice
if you keep stalling. Get out.

438
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:36,154
It's just that I have
all these various reasons.

439
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,238
Get out.

440
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,078
She's gone.

441
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,163
Who?

442
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,457
You know.

443
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,001
Her.

444
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,712
Hyang-mi.

445
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,259
She suddenly disappeared overnight,

446
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,470
so she's causing trouble for many people.

447
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,808
Was the case reported?

448
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,893
Is the police involved yet?

449
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,855
The case? What case?

450
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,817
Do you know something?

451
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,950
BYEON BAE-SU

452
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,079
Chief Byeon,
why did she suddenly bring it?

453
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,289
-Is this it?
-No idea.

454
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,667
She drove her truck here
and gave it to me.

455
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,794
What? My gosh.

456
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,423
Did she feel bad for making me work?

457
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,716
I don't know!

458
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,676
She just told me to tell you

459
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,429
to be a good son!

460
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,306
She said only that.

461
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,852
What? Ms. Park said that?

462
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,687
Yeong-sim.

463
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,022
It's me.

464
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,234
Baekdu. Kwak Deok-sun.

465
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,780
Did you make my son
pull out your radishes?

466
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,991
Yes.

467
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,077
I see.

468
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,331
Okay. I understand your situation.

469
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,877
Anyway, do you drive?

470
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:18,423
Okay, in that case,
make a recording of the security footage

471
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,049
and take it to the substation.

472
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,222
You made my son
who's suffering from a burn

473
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,142
work all day under the sun.

474
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,686
When he was slapped

475
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,607
by one of his seniors in the army,

476
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,778
I fried 300 chickens
and brought it to his unit.

477
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,406
Deok-sun always has Yong-sik's back.

478
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,158
Me, Kwak Deok-sun.

479
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:49,913
If you mess with Yong-sik,
I'll turn into a wild boar.

480
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,958
If you don't want your future
to be completely ruined,

481
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,084
Yeong-sim,

482
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,338
find your car key right this second.

483
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:04,302
If you think about it,
I'm the type that people just can't hate.

484
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,850
It was like that
back when I was in school and in the army.

485
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,769
And look at Ms. Park too.

486
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:19,234
People just can't seem to hate me
for a long time.

487
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,821
I guess I am

488
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,323
really likable.

489
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,409
Bullshit.

490
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,786
What?

491
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,622
Hey, look.

492
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,668
Doesn't that single headlight
seem like a motorcycle?

493
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:39,587
It's too dark.

494
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,386
Wasn't that bit too fast?

495
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,559
That car is definitely speeding.

496
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:56,187
Why is that person speeding
on a street like this?

497
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,944
Hey, can you see the license plate number?

498
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,029
I think

499
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,657
this is Kang Jong-ryeol's car.

500
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:08,992
What?

501
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:13,580
He drives a different car
every now and then to show off.

502
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,625
But why is Jong-ryeol

503
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,004
going after Hyang-mi?

504
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,299
Why are you asking me about her?

505
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,386
Then where were you around 10 p.m.

506
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,889
on the night of the 24th?

507
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,474
Mr. Kang.

508
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,436
You were in Ongsan, right?

509
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,440
Did you just say the 24th?

510
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,442
What about the 24th?

511
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,863
Is she dead?

512
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,783
Why do you think she's dead?

513
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,471
My goodness. You're insane.

514
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,515
Did you just become a pig?

515
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,936
You're going make a huge fuss
saying you have to lose all this weight.

516
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,564
Your dad will beat you to death
if he catches you drinking.

517
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,192
My gosh.

518
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,153
Sang-mi.

519
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,366
Mom.

520
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,327
I want to shoot that ad
for the water purifier.

521
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,497
You brat. The ad isn't what's important.

522
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:38,873
It is important.

523
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:44,045
I want to shoot that ad
and continue to live as Jong-ryeol's wife.

524
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,132
You're breaking my heart.

525
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,009
I want to stay in the spotlight.

526
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,221
I want to get attention.

527
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,394
I want people to see
that I live a great life.

528
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,981
Is that such a bad thing?

529
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,525
Am I really that guilty?

530
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,443
For whom?

531
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,862
Why do you care so much
about what others think?

532
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,573
If people don't say that I'm pretty,

533
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,827
I don't feel pretty.

534
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,205
If people don't say they're jealous,

535
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,374
I feel like

536
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,167
I'm a nobody.

537
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,631
It seems like Park Sang-mi is

538
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,761
nothing at all.

539
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,889
You and I are the same.

540
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:40,810
A girl who's dying for attention,
a girl who was never loved.

541
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,563
But I can't let people find that out.

542
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,567
That's why...

543
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:56,993
Then her phone showed up
in the middle of that lake.

544
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:02,373
What if something comes out
from Ongsan Lake?

545
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,418
Then what am I going to do?

546
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,798
Gyu-tae.

547
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,051
October 24th...

548
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:15,928
The 24th.

549
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:26,439
I hit her with a car.

550
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,025
PARK SANG-MI

551
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,444
OCTOBER 24TH

552
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:36,365
Then where were you around 10 p.m.
on the night of the 24th?

553
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,496
Ja-yeong, what am I going to do?

554
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,958
Dead bodies don't rise to the surface

555
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,919
that easily.

556
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,546
Yes, please speak.

557
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,424
Can you report someone for murder

558
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,969
only with suspicion?

559
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,308
Why do I have the feeling
that we have more than one suspect?

560
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,775
If Hyang-mi really died,

561
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,902
do you think

562
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,363
it was Joker's doing for sure?

563
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,533
Not everyone can kill a person.

564
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,494
There's a difference
between wanting to kill someone

565
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,579
and actually killing them.

566
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,625
-Wait.
-Yes?

567
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,002
-You little kid.
-Come on, stop it.

568
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,381
-Is the dive team searching the lake?
-Give them time.

569
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,009
Are you sure the lighter was clean?

570
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,304
Hey, if Joker was someone
who would leave his fingerprints,

571
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,682
we would've caught him six years ago.

572
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,269
Wait.

573
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,646
What if

574
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,816
the stuff found
on the helmet, the sweater,

575
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:56,154
and No Gyu-tae's steering wheel
is really someone's blood,

576
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,282
and if it's

577
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,118
really Hyang-mi's blood of all people,

578
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,330
what are we going to do?

579
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,086
What's with him?

580
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:16,382
ONGSAN DISTRICT OFFICE

581
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,092
I'm here to turn myself in.

582
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,580
You fraud.

583
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:17,360
TAKE LUNCH MEDICINE

584
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,908
CALL HISTORY
NONE

585
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,122
GALLERY

586
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:33,918
Why do moms love
taking pictures of flowers?

587
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:45,638
HELP IS NEAR

588
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,891
What? Where?

589
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,063
I found out that
the statute of limitations is five years.

590
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,859
That was June 29th, 2014, so...

591
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,070
Wait, June 29th, 2014?

592
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,448
That's the day when Joker killed Geum-ok.

593
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,993
What? Are you really Joker?

594
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,662
Hey, I told you that
investigations aren't done like that.

595
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,332
To be honest,

596
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,044
I was there that day.

597
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:24,260
Why do you keep ordering food here?
It's not a place for you to eat.

598
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,804
I went out to the intersection
and picked it up.

599
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,348
We have to eat something to do things.

600
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:33,811
JUNE 29TH, 2014

601
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,271
Don't dig into Hanbit Academy.

602
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,065
It'll cause a mess in Ongsan.

603
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,284
All right! I won!

604
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,286
Yes! My gosh!

605
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,916
-Yes!
-Be quiet.

606
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,344
What are you doing?

607
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,512
I told you not to open the window.

608
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:12,391
HANBIT ACADEMY

609
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:16,062
I didn't see any kid going in there
for a long time,

610
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,523
but the sign stayed up there
for two years.

611
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,569
OK AESTHETIC

612
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,492
Darn it.

613
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,870
-Hey! Turn off the lights!
-Turn off the lights!

614
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,040
-That idiot.
-Darn it.

615
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,259
This is from 2012.

616
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,887
That's not what's important.

617
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,681
Why would there be
a security camera at an academy?

618
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:57,853
If the police want to look at this,
it'll be the end of everything.

619
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,564
You and I will
get handcuffed then and there.

620
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,943
But I'm just a part-timer.

621
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,320
Sure, yes, good for you!

622
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,073
Hey, part-timer. Open it up.

623
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,117
The case broke out

624
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,412
on June 29th, 2014. Right?

625
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:20,501
This banner says they're starting classes
for the 2012 college entrance exam.

626
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,128
HANBIT ACADEMY

627
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,630
But did people even go to this place?

628
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:29,510
They put up that banner in a hurry
to cover something up.

629
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,851
You actually conducted
a legit investigation.

630
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,398
Okay, now.
Where's the director of that academy?

631
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,276
Where's that good friend of yours?

632
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,654
Chief, let's put him
on the wanted criminal list.

633
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,073
You guys

634
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,536
already have him.

635
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:58,998
You can't force anyone

636
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,126
to quit gambling.

637
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,341
Based on the double jeopardy clause,

638
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:13,471
you will not get charged again
with the same crime.

639
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,140
You don't say that
in situations like this.

640
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,976
A witness is guaranteed
a level of confidentiality.

641
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,020
Therefore, the information

642
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,899
provided to us by the witness
will not be revealed to anyone.

643
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,735
Hey, will you stop talking nonsense?

644
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,156
Is he your friend?

645
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,076
They're detectives.

646
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,871
You brought detectives?

647
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,081
Hey, it's okay.

648
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,542
-Are they really detectives?
-Calm down.

649
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:48,964
We were just wondering if you still have
the security footage from back then.

650
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,841
We promise

651
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,344
that we won't disclose
the source of the evidence.

652
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,138
Well...

653
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,601
It made me feel
very uncomfortable as well.

654
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,062
I thought it was just a burglar.

655
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,773
I had no idea that someone
got murdered that day.

656
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:06,690
What?

657
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,320
Then are you saying...

658
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:13,989
Yes, well...

659
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:18,661
I felt really uneasy about it.

660
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,080
So I couldn't delete

661
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,083
the footage of that day.

662
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:30,548
Gyu-tae, go to my wife's restaurant

663
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,216
and ask her for my laptop.

664
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,010
You'll find a movie folder

665
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,679
named "Whale Hunt."

666
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:39,640
That's

667
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,601
the footage.

668
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,437
MONKFISH'S MONKFISH

669
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,836
It's game over now.

670
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,713
Get ready for a promotion.

671
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,214
What did I tell you?

672
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,717
I won't give up until I catch him.

673
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,219
This is fun.

674
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:18,971
This is like Case Closed.

675
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,371
It's him! I got it!

676
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,124
This is our guy!

677
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,043
It's definitely him! I know it!

678
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,713
-But can you even recognize him?
-This is more than enough.

679
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,923
We're lucky that we have
this footage of him.

680
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,802
With the footage we have,
we can analyze his height,

681
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,972
physique, and the way he walks.

682
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,933
We'll be able to analyze everything.

683
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,728
What was the name of that show host?

684
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:11,106
Call Lee Su-jeong,
the show host of Unanswered Questions.

685
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,735
We have to analyze this footage.

686
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,363
Hey, it's time for us to report this.

687
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,614
Let's report this first.

688
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,452
Wait. There's someone else.

689
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,622
-What?
-What?

690
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,347
She said that kids should grow up
with flowers.

691
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,307
That's why she planted all these flowers.

692
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,435
And she was very kind
to everyone who came here.

693
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,897
I've never seen anyone like Ms. Jo.

694
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,235
My mom isn't a good person.

695
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,531
But I guess she knew
how her daughter was living.

696
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:05,911
A SHELTER FOR SINGLE MOTHERS

697
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:09,581
By the way, how did you meet my mom?

698
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:14,962
A sister from Ongsan recommended her to me
saying she's a great person.

699
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,296
Ongsan?

700
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:20,634
Ms. Jo used to do volunteer work
at a preschool

701
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,053
that was run by the church,

702
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,765
and she cared for the kids
like they were her own.

703
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,850
Did she work there

704
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,312
at the Saint Severus Preschool in 2014?

705
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,064
Do you know that place?

706
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,029
I really hate my mom.

707
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,494
Hey, Yong-sik.

708
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:53,167
There's something you need to see.

709
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:57,087
Why? Do you have another surprise for me?

710
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,217
I wouldn't be surprised even if my mom
turns out to be an ex-convict.

711
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,387
You have the footage of the culprit?

712
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,307
Yes, but...

713
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,227
There were two people.

714
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:15,939
PAINTING

715
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,038
Do you need something?

716
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,542
You guys have everything.

717
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:42,007
There are tons of things
you can kill people with.

718
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,931
You're Joker, aren't you?

719
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,359
Don't you remember me?

720
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,279
We met that night.

721
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:12,412
JUNE 29, 2014

722
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,206
Look at him. How cute.

723
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:17,125
Bye, Pil-gu. I'll see you after church.

724
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:22,923
He's so cute.

725
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,177
By the way, what did you say earlier?

726
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,347
-Who?
-Oh, I was saying that he really likes me.

727
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,142
Of course, he likes you.
Everyone in the neighborhood likes you.

728
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:38,146
If he doesn't like me,
why would he lend me his umbrella?

729
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:42,067
So just date him.
He's better than that singer you love.

730
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,528
Hey, don't you dare compare him
to Kim Gun-mo.

731
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,073
I don't get why I always
end up with jerks.

732
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,118
-Come on.
-One, two, three

733
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,786
Let's go.

734
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,877
Ms. Jo, your loved one is here.

735
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,673
Look at this.

736
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,843
Look at me.
You even know how to pick that up?

737
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,262
Why do you love Pil-gu so much?

738
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:16,226
Where else would I ever get to meet
an adorable kid like him?

739
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,981
I have a lousy life.

740
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,776
But thanks to you,
my Sundays are like heaven.

741
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:31,116
My goodness, even your baby hair
looks just like Dongbaek's.

742
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,953
Have you ever talked to your mom about me?

743
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:37,956
What do you think?

744
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,459
Do you think I could go and see her?

745
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,379
You're putting lipstick on.
Are you going somewhere?

746
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,884
I'm going to meet my daughter.

747
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,054
The weather's so nice.

748
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:55,182
I really feel like
I should meet her today.

749
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,436
Are you planning to go somewhere nice
with your daughter today?

750
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,522
My daughter has a decent life.

751
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,859
She goes to get skincare treatment
every Sunday.

752
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,824
My gosh.

753
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,785
Maybe it's because of Joker.

754
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,037
More and more people are coming to church.

755
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,998
It's because everyone's anxious.

756
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:36,848
OK AESTHETIC

757
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,684
HANBIT ACADEMY

758
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,477
Why am I so nervous?

759
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,737
Come on.

760
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:54,574
Do you collect coupons
for this restaurant?

761
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,535
Yes, I collect them.

762
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,454
But why are my noodles so soggy?

763
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,500
What's with that person wearing a hat?

764
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,712
She's been there for a while.

765
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,381
Maybe she's too scared to come inside.

766
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,676
-Should I bring her here?
-Hey, forget it.

767
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,178
There's no point in accepting cowards.

768
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,140
They just end up causing a fuss
if they lose money.

769
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,434
I feel like you're talking to me.

770
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,075
LIKELY TO HAVE AN ACCOMPLICE

771
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,785
I thought there'd be an accomplice.

772
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,250
You recognize her, right?

773
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:51,048
It seems like she always stayed near you.

774
00:50:58,597 --> 00:50:59,598
So what?

775
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,477
You think you saw me that day?

776
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,277
Why do you think it's me?

777
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:16,406
If you wear a jacket
and a mask in midsummer,

778
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,242
do you think you become unrecognizable?

779
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,750
My throat's obviously dry
because I feel guilty.

780
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,215
My goodness.

781
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,303
I'm sorry.

782
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,558
You walked past me on a humid day,

783
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,770
but I could still smell the lacquer.

784
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:59,950
They say mothers were created

785
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,952
because God can't always be everywhere.

786
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:05,997
All mothers

787
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:10,043
can instinctively recognize people
who are going to harm their child.

788
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,878
OK AESTHETIC

789
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:19,010
Why is the music turned on so loud?

790
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,097
Excuse me, didn't you see a man go up?

791
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,975
-What?
-There was a guy wearing a hat.

792
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,269
No one came.

793
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,355
We're closing early
because no one's coming.

794
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,873
Maybe it's because of Joker.
More and more people are coming to church.

795
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:56,047
OK AESTHETIC

796
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:10,729
No.

797
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,063
OK AESTHETIC

798
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:27,078
I heard the fire alarm go off
along with the fire sprinkler.

799
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,956
And I think someone knocked on the door.

800
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,585
The fire sprinkler saved your life.

801
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,047
But that kind of coincidence never exists.

802
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:42,260
The cuckoo couldn't leave its baby
in the nest.

803
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,686
Where do you think my mom is right now?

804
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,315
That means

805
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,401
you didn't see me.

806
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,405
It's just because of that smell.

807
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,701
I heard you have dementia.

808
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,415
You think I didn't?

809
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:14,459
Of course, I saw you.

810
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,504
You were wearing a mask and a hat.

811
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:19,756
But I definitely saw you.

812
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,550
Your eyes.

813
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,303
Your brutish eyes.

814
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,518
Are my eyes...

815
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,023
really brutish?

816
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,067
You came to the bar,

817
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:44,155
and I knew the moment I smelled
that horrible lacquer smell.

818
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,576
The moment I saw you
put on a servile smile.

819
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,872
The moment I started to feel very uneasy.

820
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,542
That's when I knew it was you.

821
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:58,753
Heung-sik, you should eat before you go.

822
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,547
-Yes, you should.
-Okay.

823
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,591
Why would she give him free food?

824
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,846
I have a bad feeling about him.

825
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,392
But

826
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,186
it's all just a hunch.

827
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,150
That means

828
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,777
you never saw anything.

829
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:28,199
Yes, I have no evidence.

830
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,661
So the cops won't be able to do anything.

831
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,498
But you see,

832
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,502
I know that it was you,
and I have nothing to lose.

833
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,342
Even an animal can tell

834
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:50,180
who's going to harm its baby
from miles away.

835
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,224
And mothers

836
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,561
will do anything

837
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,939
for their children.

838
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,193
Don't mess with her.

839
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:08,406
I can do at least one thing for Dongbaek.

840
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:10,658
Whatever that is.

841
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:15,663
Dongbaek, are you okay?

842
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,874
Why are you so quiet?

843
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,876
I'm just a little...

844
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,046
Do you feel upset?

845
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:26,800
No, I feel okay for some reason.

846
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:31,221
I know it's a little weird,
but I kind of feel like I got promoted.

847
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:32,722
What?

848
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:40,105
I always felt embarrassed and intimidated

849
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,149
because I was an orphan.

850
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,693
It felt like even my mom
didn't want to be with me.

851
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:47,862
But

852
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:50,949
my life feels less pathetic now.

853
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,087
I always thought of myself
as an abandoned dog,

854
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:08,800
but it's as if I found a microchip
in my body after 27 years.

855
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:11,761
Yong-sik.

856
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:15,265
I guess I really did have a mom.

857
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,434
Yes, I guess so.

858
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,949
Hiding isn't going to solve anything.

859
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:37,245
She's doing exactly
what she did back then.

860
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,291
She disappeared right after she got
diagnosed with that illness.

861
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,918
And that's when I knew how lowly she was.

862
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,508
What's wrong, Mom?

863
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,386
Legally speaking, I'm your daughter.

864
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:58,141
We're a family.
That's why this was sent to my house.

865
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,644
You say I'm your mother,

866
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:05,106
but you didn't even let me come
to your dad's funeral.

867
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,274
Whatever.

868
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,818
At least try to have a conscience.

869
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,696
You used my dad's money to pay for this,

870
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,907
but your daughter's
going to receive the money?

871
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:16,284
Do you think that's reasonable?

872
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,703
INSURANCE POLICY

873
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,957
I never received money from your father.

874
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:27,921
Where do you think
she got her living expenses?

875
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:31,382
I'm pretty sure she always
asked my dad for money.

876
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,310
While I was living with your father,

877
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:45,438
I worked as a cleaning lady
to earn my own money.

878
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:50,318
None of your father's money
was used to pay for this.

879
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:55,365
I did this for my daughter.
I would never do anything so shameful.

880
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:58,660
I don't care.
Let's just see what the law will say.

881
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,745
We're still a family by law.

882
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,039
Can't I...

883
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,544
Can't I even give my insurance money
to my own daughter?

884
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:15,843
RECIPIENT: OH DONGBAEK

885
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:34,320
OH DONGBAEK

886
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,531
Do you have insurance?

887
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,576
Why do you want to know?
Did you sell insurance?

888
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:44,872
I know this lady who used to sell socks.

889
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,207
And after her husband died,

890
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,043
she moved into an apartment
with his insurance money.

891
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:52,839
Insurance money is the best.
You get an apartment just like that.

892
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,717
What's the use? You'll be dead anyway.

893
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,596
I'm sure the old man was happy.

894
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,641
He was able to repay his wife that way.

895
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,561
For 27 years,

896
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:10,440
I was never able to buy food
for my daughter. This is what that is.

897
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,318
I never once missed

898
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,488
a single payment for 20 years
even if I had to starve.

899
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:21,200
I was a horrible mother,

900
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,495
so I want to give my daughter
some money before I die.

901
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,205
Who are you to stop that?

902
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:30,126
Who do you think you are?
You have no right to do this.

903
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,297
My mom didn't come to ask for a kidney.

904
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:37,759
She came to give me her insurance money.

905
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,804
-Dongbaek.
-I heard she's sick.

906
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,975
You should talk to her
if you don't want her to go to jail

907
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,852
for being a gold digger.

908
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:51,230
My uncle's a prosecutor.
How dare she steal from my--

909
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:57,862
How dare you?

910
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,073
You crazy bitch!

911
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,074
How dare you

912
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,035
call her a gold digger?

913
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,499
She's my mom.

914
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,127
Don't you dare talk about her like that.

915
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,768
What do you want?

916
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,438
Did you follow me to kill me?

917
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,409
It's nice to have someone worry about me.

918
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:11,621
I like Dongbaek so much,
and that's why it hurts.

919
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,080
I should let him know.

920
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:16,209
The criminal always comes back
to the scene of the crime.

921
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,376
So you hit Hyang-mi.

922
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,337
A dead body of a woman in her 30s

923
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,631
was found in Ongsan Lake this afternoon

924
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,050
with a note by a serial killer
from 5 years ago.

925
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:27,053
Come with us. You're a suspect
of Choi Hyang-mi's murder.

926
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,846
Don't do anything from now on.

927
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:32,099
I think my friend left it there.
I'll go pick it up.

928
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,353
Dongbaek never wrote down her phone number
on her motorcycle.

929
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:37,688
