00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,309

SAFETY RULES

00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,107
ONGSAN FIRE DEPARTMENT

4
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,734
Okay, that'll be all.

5
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,531
It doesn't matter how deep the water is.
You're bound to get hungry.

6
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,329
That apartment costs a fortune.
I can't let it get auctioned away!

7
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,873
I said I can find the money!

8
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,834
You can't keep your dignity
when you're in dire need of money.

9
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,961
At the edge of Ongsan

10
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,214
Where Mount Ongsan's spirit lives

11
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,841
-Please bring us more.
-I'll bring them now.

12
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,221
Even if the world ends tomorrow,
I have to sell stir-fried pork.

13
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,682
Darn it, why did they win today
of all days?

14
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,103
-We will win
-Hey, quit it!

15
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,022
Will you take that flag from him?

16
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,607
Did the principal go insane?

17
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,984
Why did he give the school flag
to the soccer club?

18
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,029
The only thing
to ease the pain of yesterday

19
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,699
is perhaps the pain I feel today.

20
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,579
Hey, will you just hop in the car?

21
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,457
Forget it. Why do you keep following me?

22
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,836
I'm not a guy who begs people.

23
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:12,048
Kids your age should go crazy
and want to take pictures with me.

24
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,633
You probably aren't their dad.

25
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,720
Things are already tough enough for me
without you adding to it.

26
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,973
Can you please cut me some slack?

27
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,601
I got you the Dinos Blade Triple Note.

28
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,814
You're so annoying.

29
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,693
Don't try to earn my favor with a top.

30
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,864
A top is a top, and you're you.

31
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,449
I'm good at drawing lines.

32
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,162
Okay, sure you are.

33
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,750
Hey.

34
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,629
I have something to say to you.

35
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,091
Can you focus for a second?

36
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,468
Just say it.

37
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,220
I don't spin tops with my ears.

38
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,936
Pil-gu, come

39
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,731
and live with me now.

40
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,615
I'm not good at beating around the bush,

41
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,742
and you're my first eight-year-old.

42
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,246
I'll be frank. Come and live with Dad now.

43
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:33,046
You can give me a chance
to get on your good side, can't you?

44
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,050
You already lived with your mom,
so if you give me a chance,

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,636
you might

46
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,931
end up liking me,

47
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,476
and you might end up liking the girl

48
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,979
who poops lying down too.

49
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,564
Why? What's wrong?

50
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,525
What?

51
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,197
Why are you suddenly unpacking?

52
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,492
I don't want the backpack either.

53
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,082
Pil-gu!

54
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,257
Pil-gu.

55
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,927
My mom is my mom, and the top is the top.

56
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,012
Why can't I stay with her?

57
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,058
I won't change her
for hundreds and thousands of you.

58
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,730
And I hate you the most in this world now.

59
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:48,121
Goodness, those animals.
Why did they all swarm in today? Right?

60
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,874
-But on a day like this...
-It's better to be busy, right?

61
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,627
I had the best sales today in this month.

62
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,171
My gosh.

63
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,175
It feels like that novel, One Lucky Day.

64
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,095
Mr. Kim pulled his rickshaw,

65
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,722
and Dongbaek sold stir-fried pork.

66
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,225
Life is so cheap.

67
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,602
Hey, Dongbaek.

68
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:20,528
I'll find your mother soon.
Don't you worry about anything.

69
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,035
Yong-sik, once you find my mom,

70
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,329
tell her that I'll never forgive her.

71
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,501
She made me...

72
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,629
She abandoned me at an orphanage,

73
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,550
made me buy gimbap for 1,000 won
to my school picnics,

74
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,470
made me have Pil-gu alone,

75
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,555
and recover from childbirth alone, too.

76
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,684
And now she's saying she'll die alone?

77
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,478
Isn't she so brazen?

78
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,325
That insurance money isn't enough
as an apology,

79
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,412
so tell her to come quickly
and live by my side.

80
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,332
Tell her to just stay alive by my side.

81
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,797
-You have to tell her once you find her.
-Okay.

82
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,508
SWITCHING OFFENSE AND DEFENSE
(FEAT. ONE WHO STEPS ON THE ACCELERATOR)

83
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,478
My son threw out his backpack somewhere.

84
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,651
My mom is gone.

85
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,405
I'm out of it, but my hands keep moving.

86
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,615
You're one tough brat.

87
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,202
You ran your business
and started packing, too.

88
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,456
We can live life...

89
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,750
Son Heung-min takes the ball.

90
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,294
Son. It's Son. He scores!

91
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,005
...because we're almost in autopilot.

92
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,299
He's good.

93
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,849
What is it?

94
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,143
Are you too excited to sleep?

95
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,898
You won't forget about me because
your trip to China is so nice, right?

96
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,861
Do you forget all about me
when you like Mr. Hwang so much?

97
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,827
I have a headache.

98
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,539
I can't go to sleep
because of my headache.

99
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,337
I can't go out tonight.

100
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,673
WHY? IS SOMETHING...

101
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,800
Pil-gu suddenly became a baby.

102
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,094
OH, I'LL WAIT...

103
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,514
You should go home, Yong-sik.
Your mother would be worried, too.

104
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,437
All right, fine.

105
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,064
You have no idea until you become a mom.

106
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:07,278
That your mom spent every single night
filled with worries.

107
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,990
Why won't he have
the pear and bellflower juice?

108
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,368
Is it that tough to have this thing?

109
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,537
Why does he always make me beg?

110
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,916
Your child has the best of you.

111
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,961
He's always the winner,
and I'm always the loser.

112
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,714
Man, that's so cheap.

113
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,676
Why does Mom never sleep?

114
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,055
Wasn't she just brought here?

115
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,641
We should find her guardian fast.

116
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,310
It's a wonder she held out
with numbers like these.

117
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,146
She must be awfully determined.

118
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,066
Why can't she even be ill?

119
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,532
She's always worried and concerned.

120
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,871
Hey, you. Get up. Wake up.
Your dad will kill you once he finds out.

121
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,373
I'm not scared.

122
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,960
-You aren't scared of him?
-I'm not scared of anything at this point.

123
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,753
And what exactly is this point?

124
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,130
-Did your life suddenly end?
-Get out!

125
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,385
Get up. Just get up. Get up, will you?

126
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,011
-Why?
-Hey.

127
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,681
Look at me, okay?

128
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,683
Look at me.

129
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,478
Tell me more
about what you told me yesterday.

130
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,278
I hit her with a car.

131
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,322
I don't know. I don't even remember.

132
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,200
Why did you get your car fixed?

133
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,829
I saw it in the garage.
What do you mean you don't know?

134
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,835
Sang-mi, why won't you tell me?

135
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,796
You lied about going to Hawaii
and took out your thigh fat

136
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,465
to put in your breasts,
and you ended up telling me that.

137
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,259
Why won't you say anything?

138
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,310
Mom.

139
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,021
What am I going to do?

140
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,484
It was that day.

141
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,320
Wasn't it?

142
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,865
So where are you right now?

143
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,783
I'm going to kill them all!

144
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,633
I'm going to kill them all.

145
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,676
This secret won't be leaked

146
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,304
if this crazy brat stays quiet.

147
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,222
It's just her who needs to be gone.

148
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,685
It's a fee that the famous Jessica
has to pay for her fame.

149
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,189
You need to do your best
to keep my mouth shut.

150
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,650
That's why I did my best
and got rid of her.

151
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,665
Oh, no.

152
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,590
WRONG PATTERN, TRY AGAIN

153
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:29,313
No, I'm sure. The camera's flash went off.

154
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,607
Yes, hurry up and look into it.

155
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,693
One second.

156
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,195
PARK SANG-MI

157
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,988
Never mind. Keep talking.

158
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,866
Hyang-mi.

159
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,870
Are you dead?

160
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,839
Darn it.

161
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:56,799
Gyu-tae.

162
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,760
Darn it. Can you catch that jerk?

163
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,304
No, first off, can you get me up?

164
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,641
You aren't dead.

165
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,643
What? Do you wish I was dead?

166
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,062
-No, no.
-Give me your hand!

167
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,939
Right, my hand.

168
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:20,740
Get me up.

169
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,828
Hey!

170
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,247
Someone is coming.

171
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,378
Excuse me.

172
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,592
Hey, you just hit a person, didn't you?

173
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,178
Who is that?

174
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,512
Ma'am?

175
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,932
Ma'am? Are you drunk?

176
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,268
Are you...

177
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,272
Goodness, you can't get in a car
that was just wrecked.

178
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,318
If you make a move
before the insurance company gets here,

179
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,653
you'll lose a lot of money...

180
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,406
Hey, lady. Hey, you!

181
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,575
That was a hit-and-run!

182
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,827
Goodness.

183
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,627
Darn it. My gosh!

184
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,090
Tie your hair, will you?
You're scaring me.

185
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:21,717
Yes, what?

186
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,428
Why do you care where I am?

187
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,307
What?

188
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:29,767
You hit what?

189
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,895
Can't you hear me? I hit a person!

190
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,022
I hit a person with your car!

191
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,566
Did you see the license plate?

192
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,654
I'm drunk.

193
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,864
You're completely useless!

194
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,783
You're only good at eating peanuts.

195
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,159
Gosh, that hurts.

196
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,704
Anyway, did you actually
get hit by that car?

197
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,542
-If she didn't, I'll say she did.
-Hey, get a hold of yourself.

198
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,462
Self-injury fraud ruins the traffic law!

199
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:02,716
I fell trying to avoid her
coming at me, didn't I?

200
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,346
Then why are you putting that on? Why?

201
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,890
I have to go deliver.

202
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,352
You can't make a delivery like this!

203
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,063
Stir-fried squid and pork belly is good
when they're mixed.

204
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,982
He'll probably guess it got mixed a bit.

205
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,902
It's not the delivery that matters.
I'm talking about your condition, idiot!

206
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,238
You're covered in blood and sweat.

207
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,199
The guy who'll get the food
will be shocked, too.

208
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,618
This is my first delivery.

209
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,580
I can't cause trouble on my first attempt.

210
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,707
I have to pay Dongbaek back, too.

211
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,334
You actually know that
you have to pay people back?

212
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,295
I'll pay you back, too.

213
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,048
Just so you know, I'm going to be
a different person from tomorrow.

214
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:47,136
Forget your new self.
Your knees are all scraped now!

215
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,348
It's nonsense for you to deliver that now.

216
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,937
Hey, please!

217
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,355
CAMELLIA

218
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,569
Look at this.
Even this thing can be reset.

219
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,281
This piece of junk can still get started.

220
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,657
Why can't I?

221
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,746
If I try hard, I can do everything.

222
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,332
There's always another chance.

223
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,542
There's one for me, too.

224
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,386
People say you'll die
if you suddenly mature.

225
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,722
She might become a decent human.

226
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,359
Darn it. Where?

227
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,070
Where did you hit the person?

228
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,697
Where and whom did you hit?

229
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,326
It's a lie, isn't it?

230
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,416
You ran over in just ten minutes.

231
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,336
You were in Ongsan again.

232
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,713
Why are you suddenly here at this--

233
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,048
I came to kill her.

234
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,175
What?

235
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,344
Choi Hyang-mi said
she'll expose everything,

236
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,429
so I wanted to kill her first.

237
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,350
Why did you see her?
Why did you meet with her?

238
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,520
Jong-ryeol, I'm Jessica.

239
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,898
What about it?
What does that have to do with this?

240
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,317
I'm Jessica, Mrs. Kang Jong-ryeol.

241
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,278
An attention-seeker

242
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,532
who has no dignity
but a shit load of pride.

243
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,412
Are you

244
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,831
under the influence?

245
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,670
I was worried for a second,

246
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,757
but now I'm sure I did the right thing.

247
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,301
I was right to kill her.

248
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,556
You're putting on a show, right?
You're just trying to scare me, right?

249
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,433
Look around for the body.

250
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,310
Sang-mi, tell me what happened!

251
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,980
Choi Hyang-mi, Dongbaek, and even you.

252
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,190
I'll kill anyone who belittles me,

253
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,027
so don't provoke me.

254
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,238
Stink bombs like me tend to do more harm.

255
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,455
You can't just leave like this.
Sang-mi... Hey!

256
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,498
Hey!

257
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,710
Shit!

258
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,545
Damn it.

259
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,317
KNOWN FOR ITS STIR-FRIED PORK

260
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,921
My stomach hurts.

261
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,715
I don't know. It hurts a lot.

262
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,260
Did you go to the restroom?
Have you pooped?

263
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,263
First your back and now your stomach?

264
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:24,728
Are you afraid to go someplace
far from home?

265
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,689
Are you going to stay at home?

266
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,984
-You won't leave, right?
-Where would I go?

267
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,444
Jeez.

268
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,363
It'll only be four nights.

269
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,116
I'm coming from the airport to Ongsan.

270
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,954
Your bar, our house. Got it?

271
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,669
Do you feel like you won't see me again?

272
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,129
I put it in here.

273
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,799
I don't know. My tummy just hurts.

274
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,806
Way back in the day,
when Jang Bo-ram dumped you,

275
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,349
I didn't tease you about it.

276
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,061
You jerk. Why are you
suddenly bringing her up?

277
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:11,191
When you got drunk
and pooped on the jade mattress,

278
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,361
I didn't tell your sister about it.

279
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,363
So what?

280
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,614
What do you want?

281
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,869
Keep a close eye on him. Got it?

282
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,122
Lucky Pil-gu.
How many bodyguards does he have?

283
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,874
My gosh, that scared me!

284
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,419
Pil-gu, it's you.

285
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,089
I heard your back hurts. I wonder why.

286
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,926
Maybe your wings are trying to get loose.

287
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,640
It's a separation anxiety disorder.

288
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,561
Why would Pil-gu have such a thing?

289
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:51,690
When I picked Jun-gi up
from his grandmother's after a month,

290
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,733
he acted that way.

291
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:55,736
Maybe he was worried
that I'd send him away again.

292
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,406
He clung on to me wherever I went

293
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,576
and complained about
every part of his body hurting.

294
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,829
It was a separation anxiety.
It could manifest into depression.

295
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,094
Don't you get it?

296
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,102
How about hiring a short-term part-timer?

297
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,981
It'll be easier for you
and I'll be less anxious.

298
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,318
Hyang-mi will come back soon.

299
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,196
I feel like she'll return in no time.

300
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,242
Then I'll stop by during lunch hours.

301
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,454
-I'm closing the bar for the day.
-What?

302
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,875
Maybe it has to do with
sending Pil-gu off,

303
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,336
but I think
I'm coming down with something.

304
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,921
Hold on.

305
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,384
My gosh. You're burning up.

306
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,053
Let me take you to a doctor first.

307
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,640
I'd rather get some sleep.

308
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,226
Pil-gu's not home,

309
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,729
so I'll take this opportunity
to sleep in silence.

310
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,192
Dongbaek has been

311
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:23,198
like a boxer who stays upright
even after a few uppercuts.

312
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,788
Then I'll come by the house later.

313
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,457
My house?

314
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,002
Well, Pil-gu's not home.

315
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,383
I'm not thinking of this
as an opportunity.

316
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,260
Right, well...

317
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,555
I'm not a piece of trash.

318
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,807
We can leave it at that then.

319
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,227
What's your lock code?

320
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,692
I'll drop off some porridge and medicine
while you sleep.

321
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,324
I'm not a piece of trash.

322
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,912
It's two, five, eight, zero.

323
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,339
Where are you going?

324
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,426
Who sets a lock code
as two, five, eight, zero?

325
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,137
I really need to hurry up and catch Joker.

326
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,981
So tell me. Who on earth are you really?

327
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,984
How do you know him?

328
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,321
When I was a taxi driver,

329
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:48,283
I caught a happy slap robber, remember?
I met him then.

330
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,995
Was he the victim?

331
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:55,874
My gosh. That's quite a chance encounter.

332
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,251
It wasn't exactly like that.

333
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,882
Sir, I'm afraid
I just witnessed something.

334
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,342
I apologize in advance.

335
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,058
Over there. There. Over there!

336
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,976
-Where?
-Over there.

337
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,728
Where exactly is "there"?

338
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,313
CRIMINOLOGY PROFESSOR

339
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,899
His height is around 170cm to 175cm.

340
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,777
And he has a medium build.

341
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,862
Even I can tell that.

342
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,157
He doesn't walk with a straight posture.

343
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,536
His torso is slightly tilted forward.

344
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,704
That I can tell too.

345
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,376
You never caught onto that.

346
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,837
Tell him that you didn't.

347
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,839
I...

348
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:49,302
A criminal who doesn't
look around the area even once?

349
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,640
It means that he knows the alley
and where the cameras are placed.

350
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,808
Where the cameras are?

351
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,227
He walks as if he has a stiff neck.

352
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,398
He's right about the odd angle.

353
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,152
He knows where the camera is.

354
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,905
The weapon must fit in his pocket.

355
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,991
A wire used to hang up a frame?

356
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,868
Subconsciously,
we put what's important

357
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,328
in the side we're more familiar with.

358
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,706
He could be ambidextrous.

359
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,418
I see you're not just some random guy.

360
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,377
Anyway,

361
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,212
who exactly is this?

362
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,884
Well, you see,
there's a thief in the neighborhood.

363
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,846
Ongsan and picture frame wire?
It's him then.

364
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,016
What? Who do you mean?
Don't talk like you know everything.

365
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,392
Yong-sik,

366
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,854
keep it cool and don't be a joke.

367
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,858
We're not private investigators.

368
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,736
Is it wise
to be investigating off the books?

369
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,531
After we report it, they'll tell us
to talk to that man as well.

370
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,242
Besides, I lost trust in them

371
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,286
since we were told to check 260mm shoes.

372
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,081
Still, the scope of this case
is getting out of hand.

373
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,791
Jeez.

374
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,297
Dongbaek's mom was caught on camera.

375
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:12,010
The sole survivor. The legendary Joker.
A mother's love that beat a monster.

376
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,138
Do you think those high above
will let this slide?

377
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,558
They'll come at Dongbaek like hyenas.

378
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,896
Your life is over once the people
dig into your personal life.

379
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,481
Can you...

380
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,109
Can you really catch him?

381
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,780
Who caught the academy director?

382
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,532
Who got the camera footage?

383
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,243
Who got us a meeting with Kim Bok-jun?

384
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,869
Are you doubting me?

385
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,872
The fortune teller

386
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:45,460
-did tell me to be aware of a nutjob.
-You think I won't be able to catch him?

387
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,714
I think you will.

388
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,134
Then join me.

389
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,684
All right. I'll bet the rest of my career

390
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,311
on you.

391
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,648
Have me promoted or get me fired.

392
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,025
It's up to you now.

393
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,595
Dongbaek,

394
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:02,472
I'll get going now.

395
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,059
Are you asleep?

396
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,133
Dongbaek,

397
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,470
I know you're pretending to be asleep.

398
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,038
Don't argue with me and eat first.

399
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,334
What is it that I always say?

400
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,961
Food is our source of energy.

401
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,175
Is this how others live, too?

402
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,971
It's nice to have someone
worry about me.

403
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:15,230
Looking after one another
is truly a magnificent thing.

404
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,609
Don't be too moved yet.

405
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,236
I haven't even started.

406
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,534
No wonder how others stay strong
mentally and physically.

407
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,369
This was the reason.

408
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,164
Dongbaek.

409
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,502
Well,

410
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,798
I have no idea of the world

411
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,800
you have lived in so far.

412
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,761
From now on though,

413
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,473
consider your life
as a never-ending festival.

414
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,189
Like a spoiled rich girl,

415
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,859
as if it were meant to be,

416
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:07,198
I'll make sure that you can live your life
as immaturely as possible.

417
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,871
Did you have to put it like that?
It's annoying.

418
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,255
Rich girls...

419
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:26,259
An only child,
the youngest daughter, and such.

420
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,596
They'd come to school with neat braids

421
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,141
and in clothes that always smelled nice.

422
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,941
They'd buy new pencil cases so often

423
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,612
and flash those annoyingly sweet smiles.

424
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,616
All I could do was gaze at them.

425
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,705
I felt like crap,

426
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,625
but I envied their lives.

427
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,465
I wanted to live a life
that only knew of sunshine.

428
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,144
I have no idea

429
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,814
what this fragile woman had to cope with.

430
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,783
I like Dongbaek so much,

431
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,703
and that's why it hurts.

432
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,332
Gosh, it's salty!

433
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,974
Why the hell are you crying too?

434
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,811
And I'm supposed to depend on you?

435
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,079
Can you sleep?

436
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,043
I'm amazed by
how you're at ease in my house.

437
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:33,302
Being nervous is one thing,
getting sleep is another.

438
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,226
If you close your eyes, you can fall
asleep even on your first day in the army.

439
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,063
But this isn't that kind of a day.

440
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:47,191
Stop talking to me. I need to sleep.

441
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,621
But Yong-sik...

442
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,667
I thought you were sick.

443
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,711
Stop babbling and go to sleep.

444
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:11,049
That grasshopper lady...

445
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,094
Why are you bringing her up?

446
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,182
Well,

447
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,520
you have dated women
other than her, right?

448
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,737
Dongbaek, just so you know,

449
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,366
I have an engine of a four-wheel drive

450
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,078
and the manners of a sedan.

451
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:45,750
I wouldn't make a move on someone sick.

452
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,544
Whatever.

453
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,841
So don't make me out to be
a loser with no experience.

454
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,260
I am Hwang Yong-sik.

455
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,808
Why is there never
a middle ground with you?

456
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,936
How could I in this situation?

457
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,359
If...

458
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,445
this river isn't to be disturbed,

459
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,906
don't even dip your feet in it.

460
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:21,661
Don't bother tying your laces
if you're not going to finish the race.

461
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,830
Let's just stop talking now.

462
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,172
She was the one who ended up sleeping well

463
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,690
and I barely got any rest.

464
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,401
What a selfish woman.

465
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,528
So selfish.

466
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,372
The bastard keeps testing the waters.

467
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,213
I should let him know.

468
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:20,720
Provoke me

469
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,681
and you'll pay.

470
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,605
Gosh, it's hot.

471
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,070
It's so hot.

472
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,244
Yes, hello?

473
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,333
That's right.

474
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,792
Where?

475
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,546
Yes, that's mine.

476
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:05,097
I didn't know I left the scooter there.

477
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,267
Hyang-mi, seriously?

478
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:16,317
I think my friend left it there.
I'll go pick it up.

479
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:31,999
MEGA MALL

480
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,920
FOR LEASE

481
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,213
FOR LEASE

482
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:43,261
When what's familiar lets our guards down,

483
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,096
trouble happens.

484
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,146
CAMELLIA

485
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,860
It's like the universe
doesn't want me to make this delivery.

486
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,489
It doesn't matter if there were signs.

487
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:06,784
Dongbaek, just you wait.
I'll bring home the 6,000 won.

488
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:25,094
Why would she leave her scooter
at a place like this? It's so scary.

489
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,516
In the end, we pay
for not listening to the signs.

490
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,951
TO YONG-SIK:
I RECEIVED A CALL TO PICK UP THE SCOOTER

491
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:25,404
CAMELLIA

492
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,871
Did she really kill someone or not?

493
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,666
What's with the photo?

494
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,255
A crime scene always tells us something.

495
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,008
The criminal always comes back
to the scene.

496
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,761
What? Why?

497
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:52,306
I should've asked if he got
into an accident here instead.

498
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,766
So you hit Hyang-mi.

499
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,479
It was you, right? That's why you're here.

500
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,608
I drove into a telephone pole, that's all.

501
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,694
And then you came back
to take a picture of it?

502
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,533
She must really be missing.

503
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,203
Mr. Kang,

504
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,664
your car was caught
on a security camera nearby

505
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,332
and Hyang-mi went missing.

506
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,334
Please come down to the station.

507
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,045
You're a witness, for now.

508
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,047
She's missing?

509
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,633
Then she hasn't been found dead.

510
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,172
SOMEONE CALLED AND ASKED ME
TO TAKE MY SCOOTER.

511
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,174
You're going to sit there?

512
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,885
Why do you sit in the front seat?
It'll be awkward.

513
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,474
Then you'd better drive safely.

514
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:18,934
Am I your personal driver or what?

515
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,936
Let's get going. Let's go.

516
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,987
Well, I know

517
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,282
-I don't need to tell you this.
-Then don't say it.

518
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,370
But I'm going to tell you something
because I want to.

519
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,498
Are you giving me
a wedding invitation?

520
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,299
You're getting married?

521
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,302
I won't give you an invitation.

522
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,647
Good luck with her.

523
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,899
I wish you the best.

524
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,944
I'll obviously be good to her.

525
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,363
I'll be a lot better than you for sure.

526
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,156
So cut the crap.

527
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,576
You think this happened
because I loved her less?

528
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,291
I dated Dongbaek for six years
and thought of her even after we broke up.

529
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:26,877
Shut up.

530
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:31,131
Just because you like her that much
doesn't mean things will work out.

531
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,718
You need to overcome
all the variables and bad timings

532
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,137
and reach the home base
to get married.

533
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:42,434
Blaming it on variables and bad timings
is just your way of making an excuse.

534
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,272
I don't let unimportant things like those
have control over my life.

535
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:50,943
How many people do you think succeed
in marrying the person they love the most?

536
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,572
The reason people just
cope with their lives

537
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,532
isn't because they're no better than you.

538
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,701
Don't ignore how important timing is.

539
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,790
What's your point?

540
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,461
I'm just telling you to do a good job.

541
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,172
My specialty is to hit a walk-off.

542
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:17,303
And if the defense makes a mistake,
I'll make sure I grab that opportunity.

543
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:28,022
My gosh, she must really like me.

544
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,983
I guess I'm irresistible
seeing that she just sent me a message.

545
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,864
You should come to the bar tonight.

546
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:40,409
Someone called me to take my scooter,
so I'm going to go pick it up.

547
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,788
What is it this time?

548
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,250
Dongbaek

549
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,670
never wrote down
her phone number on the scooter.

550
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,611
ONGSAN POLICE STATION

551
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,530
-The receiver cannot be reached...
-My gosh, come on.

552
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,873
-A dead body of a woman in her 30s
-Yes, this is Ongsan Substation.

553
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,625
was found in Ongsan Lake today

554
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,044
with a note by a serial killer
from five years ago.

555
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,046
And so many people are in shock.

556
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,724
The victim turned out to be a lady
who was working in a local restaurant.

557
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,185
The cause of death
has not been disclosed yet.

558
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,813
However, the police will carry out
an investigation

559
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:54,358
with open possibilities
such as serial murder, copycat crime,

560
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,443
or a murder related to vengeance.

561
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:58,987
Hey.

562
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,450
Does this mean Joker was
really aiming to kill Dongbaek?

563
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,619
Why do bad things
always happen around her?

564
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,162
What's that supposed to mean?

565
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,498
-Just stay here.
-But...

566
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,041
-Wait.
-Come on.

567
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,713
Damn it.

568
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,427
Ms. Park Sang-mi.

569
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:23,929
Ms. Park Sang-mi.

570
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,394
I heard a woman died in Ongsan again.

571
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,062
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

572
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,487
Can you help me live?

573
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,199
HOTLINE

574
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,493
It's me, Hong Ja-yeong.

575
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,299
CHOI, A WOMAN IN HER 30S,
WAS FOUND DEAD IN ONGSAN LAKE

576
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,846
My gosh, can't you even eat by yourself?

577
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:10,934
You got divorced and lost your house.
Do you even have a hole in your chin now?

578
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,479
Will you please shave?

579
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,940
And why is your hair so messy?
Are you a primitive or what?

580
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,276
I'm so sick and tired of you.

581
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,750
Are you deaf?

582
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,130
Hello?

583
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,051
Yes.

584
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:47,513
What?

585
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,187
Okay,

586
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,314
I'll be right there.

587
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,900
What is it? What's wrong?

588
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,945
Did you cause trouble again?

589
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,742
A guy living in building 104
scratched my car while parking.

590
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,328
My gosh, you crazy punk.

591
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:13,956
Why would you answer the phone that way?

592
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,842
-Hello.
-Hello.

593
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:28,846
The citizens of this neighborhood
trust me so much.

594
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:32,266
I feel like my wife's living with me
because she needs someone

595
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,767
to throw out the food garbage.

596
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,938
Was the red stain
on my steering wheel cover really blood?

597
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,275
Why isn't Yong-sik coming to arrest me?

598
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,610
Does that mean it's not blood?

599
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,410
Sir, the garbage disposal
is on the first floor.

600
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,496
Oh, right. Thank you.

601
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,965
Mr. No.

602
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,886
Come with us. You're the suspect
of Choi Hyang-mi's murder.

603
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,929
-Let's go.
-You may remain silent,

604
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,472
but it's better for you to talk.

605
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,308
-Let's go.
-No, wait.

606
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,393
-Wait a second.
-What is it?

607
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:18,854
I can't breathe.

608
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,981
Hire an attorney
to get a chance to explain.

609
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,860
Then let me explain right now.
No, wait. Can I explain here?

610
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,695
-No, we need to go first.
-Let's go.

611
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,573
How could I have thrown her
into Ongsan Lake?

612
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:32,284
I'm not strong enough to carry her.

613
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,369
-Okay, let's go first.
-Get in.

614
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,178
Ja-yeong!

615
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,558
Why would you drift your car
in the apartment parking lot?

616
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:00,395
Aren't you supposed to accompany him?
Are you arresting him?

617
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,441
Do you have a warrant?
Do you have hard evidence?

618
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,194
I'm sorry, but who are you?

619
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,864
She's an attorney and my ex-wife.

620
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,574
What? She's your ex-wife?

621
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,952
That bloodstain you found
on his steering wheel

622
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,120
can't exactly be seen
as decisive evidence.

623
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,373
How did you know about that?

624
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,375
Is the judicial police

625
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,169
ignoring the principles
of voluntary investigation?

626
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,964
The person involved is currently
denying the accusation.

627
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,715
You don't have a warrant,

628
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,885
gave him no explanations,
and didn't even ask for his consent.

629
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:34,846
But...

630
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,933
Detective Kim Myeong-bae.

631
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,185
-You took out handcuffs.
-Well...

632
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,690
And Detective Oh Byeong-heon,
you took him by the arm.

633
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,484
Myeong-bae, why did you
take out handcuffs?

634
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,610
I just had them out.

635
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,279
You forced him to go with you.
This is an illegal arrest.

636
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:55,409
Was she always this amazing?

637
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:59,287
I want you to accompany him
with courtesy and respect.

638
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:03,875
You can investigate him for a maximum
of six hours. I'll be checking the time.

639
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:07,087
And from this moment on,
I'm going to be his attorney.

640
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:12,384
Oh, okay. You're being awfully considerate
for an ex-wife.

641
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:15,512
She may be my ex-wife,
but that doesn't mean she doesn't love me!

642
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,597
Love, my ass.

643
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,684
Then why did you drift your car?

644
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,520
That says it all.

645
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,065
It's because

646
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,651
I know for a fact that this jerk

647
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,195
is not capable of killing anyone.

648
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,326
They found the body.

649
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:39,911
That bitch

650
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,913
put batteries in the clock.

651
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,625
By the way,

652
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,128
what's wrong with this?

653
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:53,925
Oh, my gosh.

654
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,928
Is there someone else here?

655
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,812
Hello.

656
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,197
None of the clocks work properly
in this house.

657
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,531
Don't put batteries inside.

658
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:20,243
It's okay. I'm just doing this
to repay you for letting me stay here.

659
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,120
Don't do that. It's noisy.

660
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,873
-Do you keep it empty on purpose?
-Shut up.

661
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,462
Stop being so noisy.

662
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,133
That noisy bitch.

663
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,220
Why did you have to bring
that noisy bitch here?

664
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:42,974
You already brought home tons of cats.
Did you have to bring her home as well?

665
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,352
You've already killed

666
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,647
enough of my cats.

667
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,651
Don't do anything from now on.

668
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,446
Just stay still.

669
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,913
You think I didn't see you?
Of course, I saw you.

670
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:06,998
Your eyes.

671
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,335
Your brutish eyes.

672
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,379
You see,

673
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,923
I hate my eyes

674
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,761
because they look just like yours.

675
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,685
This is Dongbaek's most recent location.

676
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,937
My gosh.

677
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,189
How are we going to find her here?

678
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,068
Dongbaek!

679
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,030
Dongbaek!

680
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:55,630
Dongbaek!

681
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,406
CAMELLIA

682
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:18,588
MR. HWANG

683
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,423
NO SERVICE

684
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,938
Hello?

685
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:24,946
Hello? I'm on the first basement floor
of Mega Mall!

686
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:29,659
Yes, this is the first basement floor!
Please hurry up!

687
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:43,006
This is Mega Mall.
I'm on the third basement floor.

688
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:45,091
I found Dongbaek's scooter here.

689
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:05,070
YOU SHOULD'VE COME
SHE DIED BECAUSE OF YOU

690
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:08,907
EVERYONE WHO'S CLOSE WITH YOU WILL DIE

691
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:11,576
CAMELLIA

692
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:35,100
Hey, I'm surprised that you managed
to find my treasure box.

693
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,143
My gosh, these are all worth nothing.

694
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,813
Why would you steal stuff like these
and keep them here?

695
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:43,858
Hyang-mi, I used to wear these gloves
ten years ago.

696
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:47,195
Look at these pills. Just throw them away.

697
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:50,073
I don't know.
Everything you wear seems nice.

698
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:54,619
Don't steal stuff and hide them here.

699
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:57,163
You can just wear them and use them.

700
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,833
Dongbaek, if we're ever given a chance

701
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,044
to live another life,
I want to live as your daughter.

702
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:04,963
Then what about my life?

703
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:07,799
You nag at me all the time

704
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,884
and make me feel so annoyed.

705
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,887
That pisses me off
and makes me feel happy at the same time.

706
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:18,184
If you drink beer without asking
at someone's restaurant like that,

707
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,769
it's considered as theft.

708
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,980
Are you trying to tell me
not to cross a line?

709
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,650
I won't make you pay
since you're my family.

710
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:31,114
So don't get yourself in trouble
and make sure to always stay by my side.

711
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,284
I want you to stop stealing stuff.

712
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,162
I also want you to quit
smoking and drinking.

713
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,998
I'll even watch you give birth
to a pretty daughter like you.

714
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,793
So get that dumb look off your face
and don't feel lonely.

715
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,507
You only took two, right?
My gosh, seriously.

716
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,104
I'm cold.

717
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:07,734
Can you cook loach soup for me tonight?
I want you to make everything.

718
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,805
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

719
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,562
This is seriously driving me crazy.

720
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:28,690
Chief.

721
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,042
Look.

722
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,943
Hyang-mi is dead, isn't she?

723
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,040
Just like Geum-ok.

724
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,676
YOU SHOULD'VE COME
SHE DIED BECAUSE OF YOU

725
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,887
EVERYONE WHO'S CLOSE WITH YOU WILL DIE

726
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,847
What about my mom?

727
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:45,808
Did you find out where she is?

728
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:50,938
Dongbaek.

729
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:56,694
Pil-gu will be home soon.

730
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,238
Dongbaek has finally...

731
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,659
You know what?

732
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:06,079
I'm going to kill that bastard.

733
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,748
...stepped on the accelerator.

734
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,249
Hyang-mi

735
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:15,254
and Geum-ok didn't deserve
to die like that.

736
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:19,092
And she finally switched
from defense to offense.

737
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:25,139
He deserves to know
whom he just messed with.

738
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:30,687
I'll make sure

739
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,981
he gets punished by law.

740
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,777
I'm not going to run anymore.

741
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,947
I'll find him
and beat the shit out of him.

742
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,533
My gosh, Dongbaek.

743
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:48,121
You really shouldn't
think of doing something like that.

744
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,290
I saw him.

745
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:11,060
Mr. Hwang, I want you to sleep
at our place for three nights.

746
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:16,149
Do you get what I mean or not?

747
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,823
My mom can't even catch a moth by herself.

748
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,369
Is it hard for you to understand?

749
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,746
Why did you act up,
not knowing your place?

750
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,664
She said she knows who Joker is.

751
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,333
This is driving me crazy.

752
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,210
He doesn't know what he's doing.

753
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:20,213
A hillbilly who has no idea
is better than cunning detectives.

754
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,881
Don't make me regret my choice.

755
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:25,134
From now on, the base camp for
the Joker case is here,

756
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,677
Ongsan Police Station.

757
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,847
Joker could only act up
because he hasn't met me yet.

758
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:34,227
I'm showing my will to continue
the investigation by not answering.
