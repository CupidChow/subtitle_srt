1
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,769
-Yong-sik, just leave it there.
-Okay.

2
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,354
-I'll place it on the table.
-Okay.

3
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,529
What's with the light?

4
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,698
Maybe I need a sensor light--

5
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,425
I TOLD YOU NOT TO BE A JOKE

6
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,181
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU EVERY DAY
EVER SINCE THAT DAY

7
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,816
This is too sudden, Yong-sik.

8
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,486
Well, it's just that...

9
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,968
It's someone who knows.

10
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,681
He definitely knows this place.

11
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,893
From that side door

12
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,271
to the layout,
how to move around inside...

13
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,278
And even the camera.

14
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,907
He even knows
where the camera is.

15
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,744
He was able to move
within the blind spots

16
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:26,456
and do this on the wall
without even getting lost in the dark.

17
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,876
Well, the thing is though...

18
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,837
Wasn't the camera installed yesterday?

19
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,672
Is he a ghost?

20
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,384
-How could he figure it out in a day?
-It means...

21
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,971
he must be one of the people
that was here yesterday.

22
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,685
This prick must've been caught
on the camera.

23
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,606
We should be able to find him
in the footage

24
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,776
from before this happened.

25
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,614
Well, if that's the case...

26
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,075
We should...

27
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,245
We should report this
to the higher-ups first.

28
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,163
Well...

29
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,708
Whether this was done by Joker
or some psychopath,

30
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,920
we should preserve the scene first.

31
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,590
Gosh, so many people
visit this restaurant.

32
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,467
What do you think you can find here?

33
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,220
Do you expect to get
this guy's fingerprints or hair here?

34
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,556
Well, let's call Forensics first.

35
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,850
Gosh, Chief. Keep it down, please.

36
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,437
You want to call Forensics?
Shall we set up a police line?

37
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,357
Shall we call
all the reporters and detectives

38
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,318
and let them tell the whole country
about this?

39
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,780
You realize that this is where
Pil-gu eats and studies, right?

40
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,365
WITNESS MAY BE A PROSTITUTE

41
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,825
Oh, boy.

42
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,577
As for what we should do...

43
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,456
Gosh, hold on.
I need to do some thinking, too.

44
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,967
They called me a prostitute.

45
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,642
They said only filthy prostitutes
fall victim to serial murders

46
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,646
and that I should behave myself
since I managed to survive.

47
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,400
What kind of ignorant bastard
would say that?

48
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,653
No one's curious about the truth.

49
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,740
What they believe... becomes the truth.

50
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:29,203
Dongbaek, why have you kept
this stupid article all this time?

51
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,124
And why do you still remember
all those comments on the internet?

52
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,585
You're right. I still remember

53
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:40,256
all those comments
even though five years have passed.

54
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,094
Joker didn't kill me,

55
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,889
but people stabbed me over and over.

56
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,770
I don't want to go through that
ever again.

57
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,400
I'll make sure
you never have to go through that again.

58
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,529
I'm worried about Pil-gu, not me.

59
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,368
He browses the Internet every day.

60
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,414
If he ever comes across such comments,

61
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,335
he'll remember them
for the rest of his life.

62
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,422
I don't want him to carry
such an emotional scar.

63
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:34,727
We'll be able to narrow down the suspects
when we watch the footage,

64
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,439
and I'll catch who did this.
You won't get hurt at all.

65
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,401
Nothing will happen to you
because I'll catch that bastard.

66
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,071
You can't solve a case
just with determination.

67
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,781
Then what about those guys?

68
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,158
They're not even this determined.

69
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,787
They told us to find everyone with that
shoe size. What do you expect?

70
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,373
From Forensics
to the Investigation Unit,

71
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,709
they tried all sorts of things
but still couldn't catch the killer.

72
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,046
-This is driving me nuts.
-What?

73
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,965
Whose side are you on?

74
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,135
Shall we make a report?

75
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,220
Shall we set up a police line?

76
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,722
Damn it.

77
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,520
Hey, Hyang-mi will be here soon.

78
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,064
That thing.
What are we going to do about it?

79
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,030
Dongbaek, where are you going?

80
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:33,035
I'm worried.
I should go check on Pil-gu first.

81
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,871
Oh, right. You should.

82
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,039
Then I'll walk you home quickly.

83
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,791
Hyang-mi will be here soon, though.

84
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,837
Could you stay here
and finish up the paint job for me?

85
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,339
I can't let you go alone.

86
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,469
Then are you going to
follow me around all day?

87
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,432
I have to walk down
this alley alone at some point.

88
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,767
And I've been totally fine so far.

89
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,896
Then what about me?

90
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:07,737
If you're going to keep going everywhere
alone, what's the point of seeing me?

91
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,286
The thing is, the whole country
will hear about it if Hyang-mi finds out.

92
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,122
That paint job
is more important to me,

93
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,166
so please do it for me, Yong-sik.

94
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,006
Gosh.

95
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,050
All right.

96
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,012
Then I'll finish that up first
and call you.

97
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,597
Just stay home.

98
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,099
Why don't you close the bar
for a few days?

99
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,852
Say you're making renovations
or taking a vacation.

100
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,192
Let's keep it open.

101
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,277
What?

102
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,656
He'll probably want to see

103
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,867
what happened after what he did last night

104
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,619
as well as the look on my face.

105
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,373
I think he'll come today.

106
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,502
Dongbaek.

107
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,922
He's been watching me every day.

108
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,175
He'll want to see me even more today.

109
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,472
UNIFORMS, GOWNS

110
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,847
Dongbaek!

111
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,477
I said I can go home alone.

112
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,188
I'll just walk you home.

113
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,608
I can still find my own place.

114
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,818
No, I just don't want to let you go.

115
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,239
And I tend to be very clingy, you know.

116
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,160
Let's go.

117
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,093
Well, I'm going to catch that psycho.

118
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,679
You must've been very scared.

119
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,265
Why don't you get some rest at home today?

120
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,269
Back when I used to live alone...

121
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,605
What's that insect with many legs?
A centipede?

122
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,690
I used to freak out whenever I saw it.

123
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,110
I learned that you need to kill it
right away if you're really scared.

124
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,489
-What?
-If it hides while you scream,

125
00:10:56,572 --> 00:11:01,744
you'll be even more scared
because you won't know where it is.

126
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,288
Like that jerk who's been watching me
for five years.

127
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,002
So let's squash him right away.

128
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,631
Are you really okay?

129
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,468
You said I'm bold and brave

130
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,970
and that people bully me
without knowing my claws.

131
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,391
That's right. This is the Dongbaek I know.

132
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,185
I fell for you
because you can be quite gutsy.

133
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,897
-Mr. No.
-Yes?

134
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,903
The whelks are 15,000 won,
the stir-fried pork is 12,000 won,

135
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,571
and the conches are 8,000 won.

136
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,867
But that price doesn't include
your right to touch me or my smile.

137
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:43,828
What?

138
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,832
I only sell alcohol.

139
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,084
The only thing you can buy here

140
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,504
is just alcohol. That's it.

141
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:57,967
That's how it began.

142
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,513
Why would I close the bar?
I even bought halibut today.

143
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,392
That bastard can clown around
all he wants. I'll go my way.

144
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,937
At first, I fell for her
because of how gutsy yet calm she is.

145
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,606
After sending Pil-gu to school,

146
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,567
I'll marinate the halibut I bought today,

147
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,570
cut it up, make soup with it,
and sell it all.

148
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,530
That's my goal for today.

149
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,659
But now, that's exactly what makes me

150
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,078
-angry.
-I told you.

151
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,582
I haven't closed the bar once
for the past five years to show Joker.

152
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,083
I get angry because I feel bad.

153
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,128
And I get even angrier
because I feel guilty for no reason.

154
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,589
It's not like I'll let it slide
if he acts up now.

155
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,055
What?

156
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,731
It will get sweaty.

157
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,192
Why are you
clenching your fists so hard?

158
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,487
My hands are sweaty...

159
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:05,117
It's because you've been clenching
your fists for quite a while.

160
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,352
My gosh.

161
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,395
Dongbaek!

162
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,698
Dongbaek, some say
that Sirasoni was actually

163
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,659
a better fighter than Kim Du-han was,

164
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,286
but he never gained more power
because he had no minions.

165
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,457
You're like Sirasoni.

166
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,918
You can be very strong without any help,

167
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,129
but you now have a minion
who's always there for you.

168
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,219
No matter where you are,
if you seem to falter or struggle,

169
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:09,098
I'll come for you right away.

170
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,476
So unclench your fists, okay?

171
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,020
And stand tall.

172
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,442
And now, let's walk together.

173
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,198
Let's go.

174
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,080
-I have to hurry.
-Okay, let's hurry.

175
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:36,333
THE LYNX OF THIS AREA

176
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,804
Hey, I can't stop thinking
that I'm doing all the grunt work

177
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,056
while you investigate the case.

178
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,058
-Gosh.
-Hey.

179
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,020
First, identify everyone you see
in the footage.

180
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,565
And see if you can find out
which one of them

181
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,150
keeps looking at the camera.

182
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,612
Darn it. Have these people never seen
a security camera before?

183
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,866
Hey, why did she put up this camera?

184
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,118
-I don't know.
-I wonder why.

185
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,039
Gosh. Dongbaek has gotten scary.

186
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,836
If you're rude, I'll be rude.

187
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:32,723
KANG BYEONG-DU, GONG JIN-BAE,
KIM BEOM-RYONG, MOTHER

188
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:33,933
I'm exhausted.

189
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,895
"Mother"?

190
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,064
Whose mother?

191
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,610
Oh, Dongbaek's mother was in the kitchen

192
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,071
when the security camera
was being installed.

193
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:51,700
I'm just making a list of everyone
who was here that day.

194
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,119
-She was here?
-She works here these days.

195
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,372
She does?

196
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,165
Goodness.

197
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,751
Gosh, hold on.

198
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,712
Who else knew about
the security camera being installed?

199
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,006
But I have to say,

200
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,386
these things have been happening
since she came here.

201
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,347
What? That's nonsense.

202
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,516
That's such a far-fetched theory.

203
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,768
I understand she has dementia,

204
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,813
but how could she
to her own daughter?

205
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,148
Who knows?
She might have an ulterior motive.

206
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,066
What?

207
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,696
But you're sure that Dongbaek's mother
has dementia, right?

208
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,322
Sorry?

209
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:34,410
Well, my grandmother suffered
from dementia, too.

210
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,912
But she behaves very differently.

211
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:43,335
Well, she's wearing that bracelet,
you know.

212
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,506
And we all saw what she did
at our substation.

213
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,219
But if you really think about it...

214
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,610
She's not causing any trouble.

215
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,531
She's helping her out if anything,
don't you think?

216
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,535
Starting today,
I'll walk you to the academy.

217
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,579
So don't go anywhere alone, okay?

218
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,080
I never go alone anyway.

219
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,167
Grandma walks me to places every day.

220
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,835
What?

221
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,754
She even walked me to the arcade.

222
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,925
Mom, you shouldn't
walk around alone, either.

223
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,636
-If you lose your grip--
-Don't worry about me.

224
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,430
I never said I did.

225
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,974
Just worry about yourself, ma'am.

226
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,566
Don't eat the rolled omelet
I made for Dongbaek.

227
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,113
Mom, why do you keep calling him Dongbaek?

228
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,365
And you never made any for me
when I was little.

229
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,368
That woman is such a glutton.

230
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,373
Pil-gu, what other schools have
good baseball teams?

231
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,667
Dongjung in Seoul.

232
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,420
Everything is expensive in Seoul.

233
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,715
Hanseung in Daejeon is good, too.

234
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,425
Why do you ask?

235
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,136
Pil-gu, should we move?

236
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,222
Why?

237
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,767
I just want to raise you somewhere safe.

238
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,853
I don't think this town is that safe.

239
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,565
Mom, I'll be a teenager
before you even know it.

240
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,485
And Grandma said

241
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,946
kids don't listen when they grow up.

242
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:40,077
Dongbaek, I told you that
I can't pick you up later today, right?

243
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,831
Ma'am, can you please pick up
Dongbaek today?

244
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,044
His name is Pil-gu, not Dongbaek.

245
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,213
She'll pick you up later. Let's go.

246
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,506
Unbelievable.

247
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,222
Stop calling him "Dongbaek"

248
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,683
and acting like you're
the sweetest mom in the world.

249
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,726
Do you have regrets or what?

250
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,898
Well, let's be honest.
I bet you don't regret anything.

251
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,442
You were cold enough
to abandon your own child.

252
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,236
I'm the one with deep regrets.

253
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,405
Why the bank?

254
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,116
I have to look good.

255
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,206
You're not qualified at all.

256
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,585
Is there anything that can be used
as collateral

257
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,086
or anyone who can stand surety?

258
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:36,592
I'm a total low-income earner,
so I don't have such things.

259
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,801
Pardon?

260
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,720
SMALL BUSINESS LOANS

261
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,890
It's a low-income loan but
a low-income earner can't get it.

262
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,478
Please take your passbook.

263
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,192
What a humble account balance.

264
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,946
I only have this
even though I've been working every day.

265
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,950
Mom, look. I'm so poor.

266
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,498
Those born with a silver spoon
in their mouth live in a different world.

267
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,336
People like me who were born
with no spoon whatsoever

268
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,255
get nothing for free.

269
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,719
ONGSAN SUBSTATION

270
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,564
What's he doing?

271
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,027
It seems like a petty thief
broke into Camellia.

272
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,030
Does he really like Dongbaek?

273
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,991
Are you kidding me? He's crazy about her.

274
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,911
Did the owner of the mill
get double eyelid surgery?

275
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:50,666
This looks like him, but I'm not too sure.

276
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:55,045
Hey, you also need to write down the names
of the ones that aren't in the footage.

277
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,714
-Pardon?
-Write down the names of everyone

278
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,801
who knows about the security camera
being installed at Camellia.

279
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,136
Everyone you saw from the moment

280
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,723
you bought the camera to the moment
you finished installing it.

281
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,935
And if you've told anyone
about putting up the camera,

282
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,019
put their names, too.

283
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,772
Everyone from the beginning?

284
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,317
Yes. That store space is tiny, so anyone
can guess where the camera would go.

285
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,196
It'd obviously be one of the four corners.
You don't have to see it to know.

286
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,868
Everyone from the very beginning?

287
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:28,996
Dad.

288
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,165
Is the new security camera upstairs?

289
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,044
That's right. I saw him there.

290
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,638
Heung-sik politely apologized
to Camellia's landlord

291
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,266
for having to put nails into the wall,
which annoyed me.

292
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,812
Jeez, she drives me nuts.

293
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,022
He started to babble on.

294
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,566
The landlord is trying
to get things like this

295
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,820
because he doesn't want to use nails
and ruin the walls.

296
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,824
I can't believe the tenant
is hammering nails into the walls.

297
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:11,288
A prick with a shoulder fetish
keeps coming to that place.

298
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,040
What? A shoulder fetish?

299
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,334
How dare you.

300
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,627
He keeps asking for more peanuts

301
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,922
while tapping her
on the back of her shoulder.

302
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,885
We need to get that on camera
to put him behind bars.

303
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,511
Get out of my way.

304
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,430
Can we put this up?

305
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,015
Wait, don't talk to me.

306
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,352
My feelings are very hurt.

307
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,729
He was the first one I saw.

308
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,238
I had to say something
in this intimidating situation.

309
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:46,823
The thing is,

310
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:51,953
she usually tends to work
until late at night, so I thought--

311
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,331
I never said anything. You can go.

312
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,874
Go on your way.

313
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:57,834
Yes, I'm going.

314
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,087
I was surprised
that she was just letting me go.

315
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,713
Hey.

316
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,424
But she proved
she was an aggressive player.

317
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,384
My restaurant.

318
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,011
She rewrote my future,
right then and there.

319
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,388
I won't give it to you.

320
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,811
Why are you talking about that
out of the blue?

321
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,313
I'm just letting you know
that you're not getting it.

322
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,650
Your brothers can split it,
but you're not getting any shares.

323
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,778
Whatever. But why are you
bringing this up out of the blue?

324
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,072
Go install that security camera.

325
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:31,159
The security camera at my restaurant
is covered in bird poop,

326
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,620
but you didn't even bat an eye.

327
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,623
But you have to install that
at her bar as soon as you can.

328
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:41,420
Why did you let birds poop
all over that camera?

329
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,672
Is she supposed to block
birds' butt holes?

330
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,217
The last thing I heard
escaping their turf was that

331
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,927
birds poop even on the Blue House.

332
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,435
But another surprise was waiting for me.

333
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,728
My gosh, Ms. Hong.

334
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,522
What brings you here?

335
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,193
I said: "Are you here to see the building?
She's moving out."

336
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,279
I wanted to get her approval.

337
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:11,032
I'd like to install a security camera.
Actually, maybe two or three cameras.

338
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,284
Sure, go ahead.

339
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,872
She said Mr. No wouldn't be able
to say anything

340
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,166
even if Dongbaek hammered
a chisel into the wall,

341
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,334
and I told her where I stand politically.

342
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,588
If one person from your family
must become the governor of Ongsan,

343
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,506
I think it should be you.

344
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,300
I'll definitely vote for you.

345
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,054
Oh, are you headed this way?
You should get going.

346
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,682
Then I said goodbye
to our busy future governor.

347
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,352
That's how our governor should be.

348
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,772
I just came for a drink.

349
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,234
My husband is having an affair,

350
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,528
and I don't even have a friend
to drink with.

351
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,155
-Heung-sik.
-Yes?

352
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,449
Dongbaek!

353
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,536
Then I met someone I didn't want to see.

354
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,414
They're the suspects
I met on that journey.

355
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,249
HEUNG-SIK, RICE CAKE LADY

356
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:06,338
MOM, MS. HONG, KANG JONG-RYEOL,
HYANG-MI, DONGBAEK

357
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,138
I wrote them down,
but what's with this list?

358
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:20,185
Why? Do you feel exhausted
thinking about investigating all of them?

359
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,481
No, looking into them isn't the problem.

360
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,983
It's...

361
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,320
It's a bit...

362
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,280
LOANS FOR HOUSEWIVES

363
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,740
A LEGITIMATE LOAN BUSINESS

364
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,710
Joker is running amok.
My neighbors glare at me.

365
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,297
My landlord wants me gone,
but how can I go?

366
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,967
Skewered rice cakes are
still 500 won around here.

367
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,677
ACCOUNT STATEMENT

368
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,845
Why is everything so cheap around here?

369
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,807
I can't move
because housing is cheap, too.

370
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,309
Is this for your life insurance?

371
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,398
You should go your own way, Mom.

372
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,985
You should remember
if you have another child.

373
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,655
Or maybe you can go to a nursing home.

374
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,163
Nothing good will happen
if you stay with me.

375
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,791
The three of us will suffer together.

376
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:28,169
Wouldn't it be better
for you to suffer alone in peace?

377
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,716
You cause trouble if you suffer alone.

378
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,177
A fool will think of foolish things,

379
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,848
and a bad person
will only think of bad things.

380
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,895
If you suffer all alone,
become angry and desperate,

381
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,648
monsters can pop out of the mirror.

382
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,653
You're scaring me. What are you saying?

383
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,489
It's a bit

384
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:58,950
scary.

385
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,038
Goodness, you get scared?

386
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,666
I guess Joker does scare you a bit.

387
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,754
No, not that. Well...

388
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:15,425
It's that I know everyone so well.

389
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,263
No one on this list can kill someone.

390
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,020
No one would do that around here.

391
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,356
It must be an outsider.

392
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,900
What if it's not, though?

393
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:41,284
I would be less scared if it was
someone who had horns on their head,

394
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:45,246
but once we catch him,
I'm afraid he may be really ordinary.

395
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,168
I'm scared he might turn out to be
someone we all know.

396
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,546
It's frightening.

397
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,885
Everyone looks nice on the outside.

398
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,476
Be careful who you trust.

399
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,820
Mom, where are you going?

400
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,280
You told me to go.

401
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,868
Why? Are you afraid that I'll leave now?

402
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,707
I mean, if you're leaving,
you have to at least let me know.

403
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,750
You're not in good condition, either.

404
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,669
I'll come back tomorrow night.

405
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,963
Go pick up Dongbaek later.

406
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,466
Mom, where are you going these days?

407
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,939
CAMELLIA

408
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,660
Why did Mom have to
go out today of all days?

409
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,079
Hyang-mi said she'll be late today, too.

410
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,843
I got this notarized, too!

411
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,137
I told you to stop by
to put the delivery inside,

412
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,640
and you can't even do that?
This is your house, too.

413
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:12,852
My mom didn't ask you to write this.
You wrote this written promise yourself.

414
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,939
-Your mother brought it to me.
-What?

415
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,109
She wrote everything,
and I just stamped it.

416
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,529
Whatever, that's still your stamp.

417
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,948
You said you'd let me
go to graduate school.

418
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,326
Back then, Mother said,

419
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,496
"Park Sang-mi is now your wife,
not my daughter,

420
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,915
so you take care
of whatever she wants to do."

421
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,668
But you're barely my wife.
You're her daughter.

422
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,712
So what?
Will you pay with the alimony?

423
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,596
Okay, fine.

424
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,100
You can go to Milan or whatever.

425
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,268
But

426
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,604
at least leave after you wean Ji-seon.

427
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,648
Rebecca eats baby formula.

428
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,028
Forget it. You can take a box and go home.

429
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,196
I don't eat that.

430
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,991
Why are your fans so tacky?

431
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,909
They should give you some goods,

432
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,745
not salted seafood and abalones.

433
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,456
This is at least 100,000 won
at that Japanese restaurant

434
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,125
you love in Cheongdam-dong.

435
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,627
Just take a box and go home.

436
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,963
How many calories is it?

437
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,175
Never mind, I won't give it to you.

438
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,887
You won't get anything from me. So be it.

439
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,973
Let's just get divorced, then.

440
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,314
I TOLD YOU NOT TO BE A JOKE

441
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:24,192
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU EVERY DAY
EVER SINCE THAT DAY

442
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,989
Stop overreacting.

443
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,592
I loved hearing the sound of that bell.

444
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,428
Are you open?

445
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,304
But I became afraid of it.

446
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,515
You're open, aren't you?

447
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,809
Oh, not now.

448
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,353
It says you do lunch.

449
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,605
It was my most precious place.

450
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,150
Yes, but I'm not ready yet.

451
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,570
Can you come back later?

452
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,573
But I became scared of it.

453
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,586
Maybe I should have stayed with Seok-han.

454
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,171
Hey.

455
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:12,592
Don't you ever mention his name,
not even in your sleep.

456
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,634
It'll cause trouble.

457
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,262
My papers are clean, all right?

458
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,598
If we didn't register,
it's not a marriage.

459
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:22,018
You lived two years with him.
How is that not a marriage?

460
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:25,563
What about Jong-ryeol?
He dated an idol star,

461
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,565
an announcer, and everyone else.

462
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:30,401
So what? You're totally innocent
because he dated around?

463
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,530
Yes, I'm cool about it.
I understand his past, too.

464
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,492
I'm not liable for my past
before this marriage.

465
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,285
So I'm perfectly innocent.

466
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,411
You may not be liable,

467
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,289
but it's still a fraud.
How can you be innocent?

468
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:52,131
I need everything that
I can turn into cash quietly.

469
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,551
I'm not gambling.

470
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,638
I'm just trying to buy a building
in a rural area.

471
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,474
Find out what you can do and call me back.

472
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,560
WITHDRAWAL LIMIT REACHED

473
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,273
I'm trying to get my money.
What is this...

474
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,948
Here.

475
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,453
Would it get wet?

476
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,667
She'll never take the money
if I just hand it to her.

477
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,379
Why do I have to put up such a show
to give her my money?

478
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,173
Well, I should.

479
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,051
That's the least I can do.

480
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,475
Did you read the statement?

481
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,563
Then where did the eye cream go?
Who did he go to Yangpyeong with?

482
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,690
He went there with
the woman from his company.

483
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,108
What's this?

484
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,527
To be frank, our client
brought up the custody issue

485
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,154
to not hand over the alimony.

486
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:57,989
"Chungdae MT"?

487
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,034
Why is he paying for people's
membership training?

488
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,495
He loves to meddle with people's affairs.

489
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,290
We make our living
because of those who have affairs,

490
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,208
but at times, it sucks a bit.

491
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:12,962
-What in the world is he up to?
-Maybe having an affair makes you smarter.

492
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,883
Once someone has an affair,
they suddenly become so sharp.

493
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,760
That darned jerk.

494
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,891
MOTEL CHUNGDAE

495
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,642
THE BEST MOTEL IN KOREA

496
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,187
MOTEL CHUNGDAE

497
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,153
MOTEL CHUNGDAE

498
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,328
AWAY FOR A MOMENT

499
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:13,940
Hello.

500
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,361
It's really weird to see you here.

501
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,946
I was really startled.

502
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,448
Who are you again?

503
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,117
I just came to check.

504
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:31,374
You need at least 40 to 50 million won
as a deposit to go to Daejeon.

505
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,418
Do you have any money with you?

506
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,633
There are so many houses out there.

507
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,555
He's here again.

508
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,351
Are you really going to
buy a building in Ongsan?

509
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,813
You must have made a fortune
by playing baseball.

510
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,066
When will that building be ready--

511
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,444
Oh, Camellia?

512
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,239
She's the tenant.

513
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,787
-Don't you know me?
-Do you know me?

514
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,957
You're Ms. Hong. Mr. No's wife.

515
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,959
We met a few times before.

516
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,170
-We did?
-In Camellia.

517
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:19,588
I work there.

518
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,301
Oh, I think I saw you there
a few times before.

519
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:28,055
Why is a lawyer at a motel
in the middle of the day?

520
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,225
Well, I'm on business.

521
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,020
I used to live here.

522
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,650
-I see.
-I didn't have a place to live,

523
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,235
so my boyfriend let me stay here.

524
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,280
I see.

525
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,534
It looks like you were on your way out.

526
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:53,205
-So I should go on my way?
-Yes, sure.

527
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:01,839
Everyone always says

528
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,468
I should just go on my way.

529
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,057
They must all think I'm on the sidelines.

530
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,267
It makes me want to do bad things.

531
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,608
What is she saying?

532
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,571
You probably want to move out
for Pil-gu's education and all,

533
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:30,201
but you'll hardly survive in a city
with the money you have now,

534
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,579
unless you have someone
you can get money from.

535
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,082
I don't have anyone like that.

536
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,250
I'm sure he's still alive.

537
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,089
To be frank,

538
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,008
you raised that kid
all alone for ten years.

539
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,178
If you make him pay for childcare expenses
for the last ten years,

540
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,098
you might find a way out.

541
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,019
It's kind of cheap.

542
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,689
He's the cheap one
for running off after having a kid.

543
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,400
It's just what he owes.

544
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,444
Is that your so-called pride?

545
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,908
You're still a kid.

546
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,547
-What?
-Are you a kid?

547
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,717
You have to move out.
Will you live on the streets with the kid?

548
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,928
Why do you care
if you look cheap?

549
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,430
You're just a kid, aren't you?

550
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,851
That's not exactly why.

551
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,979
I don't want you to have a say

552
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,064
in my kid's life
after giving me some money.

553
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,569
Stop coming to Ongsan.

554
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:51,740
And don't look at Pil-gu with such eyes.

555
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,203
If I don't have to see him,
I really don't want to.

556
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,588
THE YOUTH BASEBALL LEAGUE:
ONGSAN ELEMENTARY COMES IN SECOND

557
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,678
I was supposed to give her abalone,
but I ended up talking nonsense.

558
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,849
Why can't I seem to talk nicely to her?

559
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,518
Why can't I just be honest

560
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,605
and tell her that I missed her like crazy?

561
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:45,878
This is a school! How could you let
a fire break out at a damn school?

562
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:50,174
Did someone smoke there?
Why did a fire break out in the warehouse?

563
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,302
What if my kid got hurt?
What if one of the kids got hurt?

564
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,721
But thankfully, no one got hurt.

565
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,307
They're eight-year-old kids!
Do you know

566
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,852
how harmful it is for them
to breathe in toxic gas?

567
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,979
How could you say no one got hurt?

568
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:10,319
To be honest, I don't really get
why I need to explain this to you.

569
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:15,699
Gosh, people might think you're
the chairman of the parents' committee.

570
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,784
Darn it!

571
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,249
Hey, Pil-gu!

572
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,918
Did you breathe in smoke?
How's your nose?

573
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,337
Do you feel suffocated?
Take in a deep breath.

574
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,839
-Leave me alone.
-Are you sure you didn't get hurt?

575
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,133
Let go of me. I'm busy.

576
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,803
Why do you always bother Pil-gu?

577
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,847
Why is an eight-year-old busy?
You're done with training.

578
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:42,309
-Are you guys going to play?
-I have a tutor lesson.

579
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,230
Oh, what about you?
Do you guys take lessons together?

580
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:47,940
No, I don't.

581
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,944
Why not?
Why don't you get private tutoring?

582
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,154
I need to go to the bar.

583
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,907
Why do you need to go there?
Are you going to wait tables?

584
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:57,992
To eat with my mom!

585
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,703
You're a kid!
Why would you spend time at the bar?

586
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,913
Why do you keep yelling at me?

587
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:04,415
My gosh.

588
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,042
You should go back to Seoul
and get some training!

589
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,087
My friends all think
you got fired from your team!

590
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,133
Pil-gu!

591
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,177
What are you going to eat there?

592
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:18,887
Look.

593
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,475
It says here that the plane ticket
to Copenhagen costs 787,800 won, right?

594
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,686
Yes, that's the cheapest one.

595
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,566
I'll think of this as a donation

596
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,985
and give you 800,000 won.

597
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,737
Just take this and leave.

598
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,033
-Gyu-tae!
-My gosh.

599
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:40,909
What are you doing here?

600
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,078
I saw your wife going to work earlier.

601
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,583
Hey, what about you?
Shouldn't you go to work?

602
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:51,337
You need to make 100 million won.
You need that money to leave Ongsan.

603
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,424
I might be able to leave faster
if you lend me money for my plane ticket.

604
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:59,053
If you keep lending like that,
it'll soon add up to 100 million won.

605
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:03,599
You're going to steal from me
to make that money?

606
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,311
Why are you doing this to me?

607
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,520
My gosh, stop it.

608
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:12,858
I mean, I didn't even do anything
to deserve this shit.

609
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,360
This is just bullshit.

610
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,655
Don't act so innocent.
You already thought of sleeping with me.

611
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,824
The fact that you attempted to cheat
is what matters.

612
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,994
People only care about
whether you cheated or not.

613
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,413
They don't care about how far you went.

614
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,790
Hey, come on.

615
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,209
Do you think I won't explain myself?

616
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:34,129
Who would people believe?
You? Or me, the next governor?

617
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,465
People only believe in facts.

618
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,342
They don't believe excuses.

619
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:49,561
You set that photo
as your home screen wallpaper?

620
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:53,440
You're the next governor whose insides
are as clear as the crabs in Ongsan.

621
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:57,361
If people find out you got blindsided by
a girl like me, they'll be disappointed.

622
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:01,990
You won't become the village head,
let alone the governor.

623
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:06,912
You're...

624
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,456
You're not stupid, are you?

625
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,751
Okay, I'll use it well for now.

626
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,463
"For now"? What's that supposed to mean?

627
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,383
Just use that to go to Copenhagen.

628
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,051
Just get out of here.

629
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:25,347
But you see, I ran into your wife
and said hello to her.

630
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,852
She came to the motel earlier.

631
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,397
Why was she there?

632
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,192
Why would a woman come to a motel?

633
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,569
It's either one of the two.

634
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,822
She either came to have an affair
or catch you having an affair.

635
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,120
Safekeep your phone or card details.

636
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,997
Your wife is a divorce lawyer.

637
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,333
If you become broke,
who's going to send me to Copenhagen?

638
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,923
YANG SEUNG-YEOP

639
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:08,348
It wasn't anything big.
It was just a small fire.

640
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:14,605
But someone caused a huge fuss
about how harmful toxic gas can be.

641
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,357
So I stopped the training
and sent the kids home.

642
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,359
Then where's Pil-gu?

643
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,654
He went to your bar.

644
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:26,658
He said he'll go on his own
because his grandma isn't coming today.

645
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,661
Pil-gu's at the bar all by himself?

646
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,706
Well, you're here, so he's probably...

647
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:41,131
When I saw the note
saying he's been watching me every day,

648
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,884
the first person
that came to my mind was Pil-gu.

649
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,846
Pil-gu!

650
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:59,608
The number you are calling is switched
off. You will be directed to voicemail.

651
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,571
Jun-gi's getting his tutor lesson.

652
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:06,990
I wonder where he went.

653
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,161
It means
he watched Pil-gu every day as well.

654
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,707
So I got even more scared
than I was five years ago.

655
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,712
Why are you looking at stuff
from five years ago?

656
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:25,175
You already checked all the dash cams
that were in front of Camellia.

657
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,177
And now, you're looking at this again?

658
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,388
I couldn't find anything.

659
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,099
This guy definitely knows
about the neighborhood.

660
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,601
What are you going to get
by constantly watching this?

661
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,771
Why are you watching this
over and over again?

662
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:41,358
The scene always tells you the truth.

663
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,821
It might be yelling, "Look over here!"

664
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,909
You really live your life
based on tenacity.

665
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,539
You should also keep hitting on Dongbaek.

666
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,166
Who knows? She might let you date her.

667
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,210
Pil-gu's gone!

668
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,005
-Dongbaek.
-He...

669
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,716
He isn't at the arcade or his academy.

670
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,760
He shouldn't be alone at the bar,
but he isn't there, either.

671
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,721
-What should I do?
-Your son's gone?

672
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,641
Dongbaek, calm down.

673
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,977
Pil-gu might've come back to the bar.

674
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,104
Let's go to the bar together.

675
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,024
Chief, check if we got any reports.

676
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,442
OK AESTHETIC

677
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:26,820
Hey, you know where
the supermarket is, right?

678
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,156
-Let's just go together.
-Okay.

679
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,282
My gosh.

680
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,378
Hey, here you go. Sit down and eat.

681
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,260
Do you know Chef Kwon at Seorae Village?

682
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:54,848
I personally asked him
to cook these abalones for me.

683
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,058
My gosh, here.

684
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:02,147
These abalones become really expensive
when Chef Kwon slices them

685
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,691
compared to when they're sliced
by a normal chef.

686
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,197
Have you

687
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,951
ever had this before?

688
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,287
They taste like whelks.
That's all they taste like.

689
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,580
My goodness.

690
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,248
They're nothing special.

691
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,295
Then why are you enjoying them so much?

692
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,382
Why are you giving me this?

693
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,719
-What?
-You made Jun-gi go home, but not me.

694
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:41,395
He had to leave for his tutoring,
and he needs to go on a diet.

695
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,605
Plus, you're smaller than him.

696
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:47,317
So I figured you should eat abalone
since it'll make you grow.

697
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,030
Apparently, I'm going to be tall
because my dad's tall.

698
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,369
Did your mom tell you that?

699
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,211
I'm going to send a box full of

700
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:09,047
really expensive abalones
to your mom's bar.

701
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:13,010
Don't give them to anyone.
They're for you and your mom, okay?

702
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:14,928
How expensive are they?

703
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,930
You wouldn't even know.

704
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,266
About 100,000 won?

705
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,770
It’s as expensive as withdrawing
as much money as you can

706
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,148
from five different cash machines.

707
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,275
CAMELLIA

708
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:31,695
My gosh, that's not where he'll be.
You should go inside.

709
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,405
Here.

710
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:40,162
Pil-gu doesn't go to the playground.

711
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:43,790
There's an arcade behind Ongsan High.
You should check there.

712
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,042
All right.

713
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,836
It's the fifth batter.

714
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,176
Dongbaek.

715
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,520
Pil-gu.

716
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,317
Where are you coming from?

717
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,737
Pil-gu, where were you?

718
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,948
I had some abalones with him.

719
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,455
-My gosh, Dongbaek!
-Mom.

720
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,373
-Are you okay?
-What's wrong?

721
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,958
Are you okay?

722
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,640
Pil-gu, don't ever come to the bar
by yourself again.

723
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,684
Okay? You can't be here by yourself.

724
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,489
Gosh, Dongbaek.

725
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,084
I want you to stop playing games.

726
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,087
Your cell phone turned off
because you play all day.

727
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,172
And one more thing.

728
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:17,467
I want you to call me
as soon as you're done with your training.

729
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,554
If you're so worried,
why don't you stay at the bar?

730
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,102
You're so worried about him,

731
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,771
but you were busy
spending time with someone...

732
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,735
My gosh, it's only the afternoon,
but you're drunk already.

733
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,196
Pil-gu, I'm sure you know this,

734
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:42,284
but some guys tend to become a little rude
when they get drunk.

735
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,165
My goodness.

736
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,547
Why are you bringing that back?

737
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,049
Will you please stop getting involved?

738
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,719
How long have you known Dongbaek?

739
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:04,764
We've had ten years between us.
And I'm Pil-gu's dad.

740
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,184
I can tell that he takes after me.

741
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:11,897
You're always going to be
a stranger to him. But I'm his father.

742
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,068
-You call yourself his dad?
-What?

743
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,154
Go ahead and tell him.

744
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,781
Tell your son what you just said.

745
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,242
Tell him you were gone for eight years

746
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,329
and you're married to a model
and that you have a daughter

747
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:30,790
regardless of ten whole years
you had with his mom.

748
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,045
You want to call yourself a dad,

749
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:37,964
but you don't care at all

750
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,259
about his scar.

751
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,054
You'd better stop acting up.

752
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,183
Just go and shoot your show.

753
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,812
Do you really think you can take care
of both Dongbaek and Pil-gu?

754
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,697
You just started liking her,
so stop acting like you matter.

755
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,742
Your heart may be fluttering right now,

756
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,328
but we have years between us,
and we have a kid.

757
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:13,917
Don't act so brave thinking
that your feelings can conquer everything.

758
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,637
Pil-gu, are you really not hungry?

759
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:29,015
Mom, please leave.
This is the ninth inning.

760
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,976
The ball goes to the left! Strike!

761
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,727
Come down if you get hungry.

762
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,437
He did it!

763
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,609
Look at him go! He did it!

764
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:44,614
He hit a home run!

765
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:51,329
CAMELLIA

766
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:54,416
WE'RE TAKING THE DAY OFF
FOR PERSONAL REASONS

767
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,340
You're scared of the bar, aren't you?

768
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,142
This is why I told you
not to open the bar.

769
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,146
You should take a few days off.

770
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,068
Do you think it'll get better
if I do that?

771
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,779
What?

772
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,032
To be honest,

773
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,160
I keep getting the creeps.

774
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:36,041
He wrote that he's been
watching me every day.

775
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:41,921
That means he was among the guests
that were laughing and having a good time.

776
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,591
What if I'm still scared

777
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,593
even after a couple of months?

778
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,268
I know this is a tacky place
with no windows,

779
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:58,563
but this was my first business ever.

780
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,942
This was literally my own world.

781
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,657
Starting from today,
you're a business owner's son.

782
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:13,036
You're a business owner's son.
Okay? You got that?

783
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:18,124
Let's open up a franchise in Jeju Island
if we succeed and become rich.

784
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,806
But now, I get goosebumps
every time someone opens the door.

785
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,392
What am I supposed to do now?

786
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:41,815
Dongbaek, you promised
not to get intimidated.

787
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:46,778
We'll beat the living soul out of him
like you'd catch a bug. Right?

788
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:53,952
I realized that things are different
when I'm alone.

789
00:56:56,329 --> 00:57:00,959
It means he's been watching Pil-gu
for the past five years as well.

790
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,047
PARK SANG-MI

791
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,887
SOCCER PLAYER KIM JIN-HYEOK
GETTING A DIVORCE

792
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,684
PARK SANG-MI

793
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:21,146
The same thing will also
happen to you pretty soon.

794
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,989
Gosh, I feel like shit.

795
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,159
Gosh, Dongbaek.

796
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:41,916
What a fucking joke.

797
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,049
Gosh, that startled me.
What do you want?

798
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:56,556
Why are you looking in my car?

799
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,559
Can I have your phone number?

800
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,270
-What?
-Give me your number.

801
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:07,942
-I'll just give you an autograph.
-Then can you give me your chat ID?

802
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:10,236
I said I'll give you an autograph.

803
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,907
I think it'll be better
to just give me your number.

804
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,328
Hey, how old are you?

805
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,663
You look older than Dongbaek.

806
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:22,457
Just give me your number.

807
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,167
No.

808
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:27,629
It's because I need to send you a photo.

809
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:30,006
Once you see that,
you'll want to contact me.

810
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,758
I'm not interested in your photo.

811
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:40,058
Should I just send it to a reporter?

812
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,853
I wonder how much I'll get for this.

813
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,986
It might be someone
that Pil-gu always greeted

814
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,280
in the neighborhood.

815
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,202
That's just so awful.

816
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:04,332
It's so scary.
So how am I going to raise him here?

817
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,544
Dongbaek broke down.

818
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,380
To be honest,

819
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,968
I don't have any guts,
and I'm not strong, either.

820
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,012
Do you know

821
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,932
what a loser I am?

822
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,186
Yesterday, I thought the same thing

823
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:28,982
I thought five years ago.

824
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:33,069
"Why me?

825
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,572
Why me again?

826
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:38,283
Why does it have to be me again?"

827
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:41,828
She tried so hard to stay strong,
but she eventually broke down.

828
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:47,917
I just want to live
a normal life with Pil-gu.

829
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,881
Is that too much to ask?

830
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:55,883
And I became

831
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,052
angrier.

832
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:01,723
I'm not a hero. I have absolutely nothing.

833
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:02,765
I'm...

834
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:06,269
I'm just really exhausted.

835
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,568
I think I tried too hard.

836
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,238
I can't do this anymore.

837
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:21,951
Dongbaek.

838
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:30,043
I don't need
to pretend like I'm okay, right?

839
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,046
It's okay

840
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,799
if I just run away, right?

841
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:50,271
Yes, of course. That's okay.

842
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,566
Dongbaek, it's okay.

843
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:01,783
Yong-sik.
I'm done acting like I'm okay.

844
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,246
I don't want to be Sirasoni.

845
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,667
I just want to hide.

846
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,378
I just want to...

847
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:15,380
Dongbaek.

848
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:19,092
I want to leave Ongsan.

849
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,406
Where did the sawdust come from?

850
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:45,827
Why did the fire break out?

851
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,789
I think someone smoked in the warehouse.

852
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,040
Hey, come on.

853
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,459
That's nonsense.
An elementary school kid smoking?

854
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,129
I couldn't find any cigarette buds.

855
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,258
But I found this.

856
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,557
It also kind of smelled
like paint thinner.

857
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,768
I don't know
if I should report this or not.

858
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,313
I saw this somewhere.

859
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,985
Someone used to carry this around.

860
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:04,739
I need to catch Joker
in order to keep Dongbaek here.

861
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:07,867
I need to catch Joker
in order to stop Dongbaek from leaving.

862
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,870
This place has been empty for ages.

863
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:14,165
I feel like that punk might
actually achieve something.

864
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:16,167
She held out for a long time.

865
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,461
If I were her,
I wouldn't have lasted a year.

866
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:21,172
She lost her one and only friend
because of a guy.

867
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:23,966
-No wonder she couldn't last.
-Yong-sik, that damn punk,

868
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,093
will even follow you to North Korea.

869
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:29,347
If I give up my career and come back,
will you please accept me?

870
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,143
You can't let someone have
control over your life like this.

871
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,436
Just do what you want.

872
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,605
Why are you always thanking me?
