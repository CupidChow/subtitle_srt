That night,

3
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,442
everyone saw her last moment.

4
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,407
The little rat made its way
to its own grave.

5
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,507
Let's do this.

6
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,157
Where are you right now?

7
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,909
You're dead!

How dare she look down on me?

10
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,634
That night,

11
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,266
everyone...

CAMELLIA

13
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,186
...saw her last moment.

14
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,023
Yes, in front of Camellia right away.

15
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,614
Why are you calling a cab at this hour?

16
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,073
Take the boy and head home.

17
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,159
I'd rather not see him
sleep out here again.

18
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:24,579
Where are you going?
Why do you keep going out?

19
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,082
Also,

20
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,668
please don't stay out too late.

21
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,512
And everyone...

22
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,056
Keep being a joke. You'll die.

23
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,142
-Even if you're found dead...
-Maybe I should just kill her.

24
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,938
The normal legal procedure
just isn't enough to subside my anger.

25
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,981
Gosh, it's not like
I can actually kill her.

26
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,608
I'm going to kill her.

27
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,693
They all have a motive.

-Hyang-mi.
-What are you doing?

32
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,741
Her deposit is already long gone.

33
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,288
My gosh.
What am I going to do with all this mold?

34
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,292
Hyang-mi took off with my deposit money.

35
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,046
I wonder if Hyang-mi went to Copenhagen.

36
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,883
-Hey...
-What the hell?

37
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,678
What on earth is going on?

38
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,014
It's about your hand.

39
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,057
What did the doctor say?

40
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:10,768
Is it fatal?

41
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,187
What? Why would I die?

42
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:18,192
The herbicide Gramoxone was found

43
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,486
in the cat food!

44
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,489
I said I already put ointment on it. Gosh.

45
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,615
GRAMOXONE

46
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,160
Now rub.

47
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,746
Even just touching it could be dangerous

48
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,248
and eating it leads to
a 90 percent fatality rate.

49
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,042
So tell me more.

50
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,295
Was the herbicide in all of the cat food?

51
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,630
Yes, almost. Check this out.

52
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:44,218
Out of the 14 samples you sent,
it was found in 13.

53
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,137
And the other one?

54
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,264
The sample you took from the cat lover.

55
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,600
That was the only clean sample.

56
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,561
What the hell?

57
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,939
It was actually a well-known poison.

58
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,859
It's what people used to eat
to commit suicide.

59
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,195
So many people died

60
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,782
that the company put all kinds
of warning labels on its bottles.

61
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,659
Is that why selling
the herbicide was banned?

62
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,620
Banned? When?

63
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,374
It says it got banned in 2012.

64
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,543
What the hell?

65
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,967
We really need to hunt down who this is.

66
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,387
Seriously? And do what?

67
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,181
Arrest the culprit for killing cats?

68
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,185
He used a lethal herbicide
that isn't sold in stores anymore.

69
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,106
Over the course of the past six years,
a total of five people died here.

70
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:43,986
And this sick bastard has been keeping
the herbicide in storage for seven years.

71
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,448
During that time,
he's been killing all the cats around here

72
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,495
by using that lethal herbicide
on cat food every day.

73
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:59,377
His diligence is frightening,
if you ask me.

74
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,255
That's why...

75
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,217
I must catch this son of a bitch.

76
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,845
His eyes...

77
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,598
Jeez, what's with those eyes again?

78
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:17,895
Dongbaek?

79
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,611
You must've crashed into a guardrail.

80
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,200
This won't go on my record
if I don't call insurance, right?

81
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,162
I'll explain later.

82
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:38,040
Excuse me, could you
wash the trunk separately later on?

83
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,125
Sure thing.

84
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,251
CAR WASH

85
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,210
Right.

86
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,548
What did they say?

87
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,342
Why did they call?

88
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,804
I canceled the water purifier ad.

89
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,683
If we get divorced,
we'll be charged with a penalty.

90
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,143
What right do you have?

91
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,979
Who are you to turn down my ad?

92
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,940
That contract included me too, you know.

93
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,443
The boy... is my son.

94
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,038
Pil-gu's my son.

95
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,958
If we get divorced,

96
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,337
I want to raise him.

97
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,047
Shut it.

98
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,217
You can take everything you want.

99
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,886
I was raising Ji-seon on my own anyway.

100
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,557
Nothing will really change.
We'll just be signing some papers.

101
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,938
How will nothing change?

102
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,024
Only for you, maybe.

103
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,694
It's not like we were a proper couple.

104
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,031
I can't even remember
when we shared a meal.

105
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,616
Those damned meals!

106
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,453
I want to eat, too.

107
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,997
But I can't because I'll gain weight.

108
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,542
Gaining weight means more haters!

109
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,586
-What?
-They said I'm a pig.

110
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,800
They said I live off your fame
and got fat from all the eating.

111
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,886
So what do you want me to do?

112
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,143
If I could,

113
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,649
I would've just drowned myself ages ago.

114
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,779
-Here you go.
-Right.

115
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,158
So Hyang-mi ran off
after stealing 30 million won,

116
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,369
but she came back briefly.

117
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,041
Maybe she had something else to take.

118
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,252
Well, she did take
the motorcycle with her.

119
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,088
Were there any reports of an accident?

120
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,132
Maybe on her route...

121
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,051
She obviously ran away.

122
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,346
You should file a theft report
instead of a missing persons report.

123
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,351
Would she have really done that, though?

124
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,733
Maybe she met Joker on her delivery route.

125
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,453
Just why? Why?

126
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,374
Yong-sik, are you mad at me?

127
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,710
Why deliver during such late hours?

128
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,087
Nobody told you to.

129
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,007
You just have to make me worry.

130
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:38,012
You thrive on worrying me to death,
don't you?

131
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,557
Should I stop deliveries then?

132
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,144
I'm just asking you
not to make deliveries at such late hours.

133
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,647
Then...

134
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,483
I should close early

135
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:54,153
and stop offering deliveries
so that you won't worry.

136
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,947
Should I stick to
just whatever you approve?

137
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,534
What? No, I...

138
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,455
You know how my life is.

139
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,625
It's never been easy.

140
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,544
Delivering food, getting robbed,

141
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,254
getting attacked by Joker?

142
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,216
That's part of my life.

143
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,803
My life, my situation,

144
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,430
and the ups and downs I've been through.

145
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,350
I'd like you to respect that.

146
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,521
Dongbaek,

147
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,774
you're not some idol singer, you know.

148
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,275
What about me then?

149
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,947
Should I just watch you from afar
and encourage whatever you do?

150
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,700
I'm exhausted, too.

151
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,622
You're exhausted?

152
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,714
Those who've never been loved
have foolish habits.

153
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,467
One should cling tighter
when they're anxious,

154
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,804
but they look for confirmation instead.

155
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,141
-That's not true.
-Even though you're anxious,

156
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,436
-you act as if you're unfazed.
-Come on. Where are you going?

157
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,437
Let go.

158
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,272
-We want confirmation.
-Let me explain!

159
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,399
I guess you don't love me anymore.

160
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,485
Let's just break up, then.

161
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,070
Dongbaek.

162
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,947
We end up ruining everything.

163
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:23,868
You're exhausted?

164
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,540
Meet someone
who doesn't exhaust you then.

165
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,669
You should meet someone
who has a stable life

166
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,129
and doesn't have a kid.

167
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,926
Dongbaek.

168
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,888
The fact

169
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,724
that I like you more

170
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,351
doesn't mean

171
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,438
I owe you anything.

172
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,651
So please don't

173
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,113
wield those words like a weapon.

174
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,832
Seeing how anxious I'm getting...

175
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:17,880
You should go.

176
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,220
It seems that I'm the one
who likes him more now.

177
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:30,976
THE END OF ALL THE FLIRTING

178
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,061
-Seong-min.
-Yes?

179
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,814
Check the security footage
at the terminal for Hyang-mi.

180
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,233
-And what's that thug's name again?
-Kim Nak-ho.

181
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,361
Right. Call him
and try and get some answers.

182
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:47,076
Dongbaek sure has
one of the unluckiest lives.

183
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,330
Seriously?
Stop saying that about her life!

184
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,333
I'm sick and tired of it.

185
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,004
If she was that unlucky,
how could she have met me?

186
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,299
You sure are confident about yourself.

187
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:06,470
Everyone in this world
babble about how unlucky she is.

188
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,557
I'll show you.

189
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,768
Showing everyone how happy she can be

190
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,896
will shut all those mouths up for sure.

191
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,484
Did you just refer
to my concerns as babbling?

192
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,864
So what should we do
to cover Hyang-mi's delivery route?

193
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,700
We'll take care of that.

194
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,077
Chief,

195
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,663
you go ahead and capture Joker.

196
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,915
-That's not what I meant.
-Whatever.

197
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,293
Chief, come on!

198
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:45,259
What good would her photos do
when we don't have any of them together?

199
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,552
Pil-gu's dad.

200
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,388
"Dad"?

201
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,533
Yes, Ongsan. Send some people there.

202
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:14,580
So she met Kang Jong-ryeol
and then Jessica.

203
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,040
That alone speaks for itself.

204
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,888
RECORDING

205
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,349
That's right. Go and meet up somewhere.

206
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,394
We need them both in the frame, okay?

207
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,330
If there aren't any witnesses,
I'd love to just run her off the road.

208
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,169
Are you crazy? Why did you use the flash?

209
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:03,837
It's dark, so...

210
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,965
Damn it.

211
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,736
It's a green light.

212
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,042
No one's coming.

213
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,629
Jong-ryeol's not here
and neither is the woman.

214
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,381
Exactly.

215
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,717
What?

216
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,052
Hold on a second.

217
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,139
Hey, kid! Shit.

218
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,810
KANG PIL-GU

219
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,729
How dare you scratch my car.

220
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,065
Sir, please.

221
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,067
He's the boy she was with.

222
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,156
Anyway, do you play baseball?

223
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,745
How's your mother-in-law?

224
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,580
Does she know?

225
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,623
Ja-yeong really wasn't there?

226
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,751
Mom, please.

227
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,045
I don't remember.

228
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,632
Did something happen yesterday?

229
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,510
I'm nervous for some reason.

230
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,306
Now is not the time
to get drunk like this.

231
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,641
You're about to lose your house!

232
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,978
Did you transfer the ownership?

233
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,439
Redevelopment isn't the problem right now.

234
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,399
Of course, it is!

235
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,860
My goodness. And that's not all.

236
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,030
If people find out
you got divorced for having an affair,

237
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:56,784
I'll just kill myself from all the shame.

238
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,580
If your reputation meant that much,
you should've been nicer to her, too.

239
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:05,250
I only held my head up high
because you have nothing compared to her.

240
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,503
I didn't want her to belittle you!

241
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,507
If that's the case, why do you put
your son-in-law on a pedestal?

242
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,342
Why?

243
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,636
The old sis is even worse than I am.

244
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,762
What?

245
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,432
My sister is here
and her husband's up here.

246
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,768
I'm smack in the middle,
but where's Ja-yeong?

247
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,270
Ja-yeong's way up here.

248
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,022
You bought her husband a car

249
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,108
because there's this much of a gap.

250
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,234
What about Ja-yeong?

251
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,694
She's way up here.

252
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,781
It's only fair that she gets the house.

253
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,449
Why you...

254
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,744
How could you have an affair
when you knew that?

255
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,163
-Unbelievable.
-It wasn't an affair.

256
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,797
YEONHA OPTICALS

257
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,424
Heung-sik's house, the skincare clinic,

258
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,677
the arson at Hanbit Academy,

259
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,178
and the green lighter.

260
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,848
Four arson cases and then a murder.

261
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,811
The director of Hanbit Academy
and No Gyu-tae were like brothers.

262
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,823
Hold on!

263
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,325
What are you doing?

264
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,245
Why are you at my place of business?

265
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,539
I'm here to question you.

266
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,916
Question me?

267
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,752
Mr. No Gyu-tae.

268
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,338
Hanbit Academy...

269
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,800
You know the director, right?

270
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,805
From what I hear, you're like brothers.

271
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,934
Do you have a warrant?

272
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,313
Should I bring one?

273
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,899
I know nothing.

274
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,109
I'm completely clueless.

275
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,946
Why can't you fit the key in the lock?

276
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,656
Are you flustered?

277
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,701
I caught you off guard, didn't I?

278
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,078
I did, right?

279
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,541
Your knees have gone weak. I wonder why.

280
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,544
I totally hit the nail on the head,
didn't I?

281
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,088
I rode a duck pedal boat!

282
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,884
-What?
-Have you been on one before?

283
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,595
Must I prove that I was on one?

284
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,972
Just leave me alone for fuck's sake!

285
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,809
My wife has left me,

286
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:32,064
so why should I bother proving
that I was on one?

287
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,403
Are you crying?

288
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,782
It's not like I said anything. Come on.

289
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,327
You...
Don't dig into Hanbit Academy.

290
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,996
It'll cause a mess in Ongsan.

291
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,543
Hello there, ladies.
We were hoping to ask some questions.

292
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,129
You see,

293
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,132
we were wondering
about the odd bar in the alley.

294
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,303
-What was its name again?
-Camellia?

295
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,846
Yes, that's the one.

296
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,724
That seems to be
the only bar in this neighborhood.

297
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,852
There's only one
so you can call it a monopoly.

298
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,066
Why is there a weird bar
in this nice and quiet neighborhood?

299
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:23,073
Anyway, there's also a weird lady there.

300
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,534
Who do you mean? Dongbaek?

301
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,412
So that's her name. Dongbaek.

302
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,124
Is she perhaps single?

303
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,210
I didn't see a husband anywhere.

304
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,255
She seems to have a kid, though.

305
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,424
You talk as if we're friends.

306
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,467
Do you know us?

307
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,929
-What?
-Why are you eating our rice cakes?

308
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,892
You had three while he had four.

309
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,769
I've been counting.

310
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,772
Aren't they for people to taste?

311
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:59,443
Do you think we're charity workers?
How naive do you think we are?

312
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,112
-What are you recording?
-That's...

313
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,073
Do you think people in rural areas
don't know technology?

314
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,409
My phone's actually better than yours.

315
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,911
Gosh, why was this on?

316
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,122
I must've pressed the wrong button.

317
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:15,167
I don't know why you're
asking about Dongbaek,

318
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,169
but she's not single.

319
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:19,713
She's not?

320
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,674
Her husband is a homicide detective.

321
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,928
He'll kill you if you get caught.
He caught a fugitive with his bare hands.

322
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,349
It seems like you're close to the family.

323
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,641
Are you friends with her?

324
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,562
People who have fun teasing their sisters

325
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,732
don't like it when others mess with them.

326
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,861
-Sisters?
-You can call us that.

327
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,323
The women of this neighborhood
are a collective unit.

328
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,202
If you don't want to get in trouble,
you should get lost.

329
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,038
Are your ears blocked or what?

330
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,209
Maybe you need us to punch
those ears open.

331
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,925
-We...
-Let's do this.

332
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,552
I feel like I was mugged.

333
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,513
Hey, go and withdraw some cash.

334
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,058
We came this far, so I'll just ask her.

335
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,104
Money always unlocks
even the most sealed lips.

336
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,821
Ja-yeong's back.

337
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,538
Where on earth has she been?

338
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,585
What should I say to her?

339
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,019
-You're home.
-And so are you.

340
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,689
Can I just pretend nothing happened?

341
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,693
Don't change. We'll be going out.

342
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,113
-Where?
-I already used your stamp on the paper.

343
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,954
APPLICATION OF DIVORCE BY MUTUAL CONSENT

344
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,581
Shit.

345
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,293
It's easier
since there's no custody battle.

346
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,758
I'm sure she's only trying to scare me.

347
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,761
Don't sit. We need to make it
before the court closes today.

348
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,973
Are we really getting divorced?

349
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,600
I don't put on shows.

350
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:46,234
I went to your mother's shop yesterday,

351
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,987
and she seemed to have no idea.

352
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,989
You're not divorcing her.

353
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,450
Since when did you care about
what she knows?

354
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,871
I don't want to. I can't.

355
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,332
This is too unfair for me.

356
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,210
It's not like I actually did anything.

357
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,337
If you hold me responsible for that,

358
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,924
then anyone who attends school reunions
should get punished, too.

359
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,801
Then you can sign the paper

360
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:15,180
and make it fair again.
You can date anyone you want.

361
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,601
Don't try to act so tough.

362
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,769
You...

363
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,981
You cried, too.

364
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,489
Your teardrops were

365
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,742
like a shotgun to me.

366
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,831
-Do you still play games?
-It's a metaphor!

367
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,501
Forget it.
Do you think you can avoid this?

368
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,088
-I'm a divorce lawyer.
-What about my governorship?

369
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,924
Don't you want to be
the wife of a governor?

370
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,135
What did I tell you
when I proposed to you?

371
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,639
I told you that
I'll make you the first lady of Ongsan.

372
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,599
-I did!
-Sure.

373
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,312
Here's my final advice
for old times' sake.

374
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,147
Stop chasing after a vain dream.

375
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,609
Don't go around
buying people drinks for nothing.

376
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,861
It's not a vain dream.

377
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:15,240
Everyone says they'll vote for me
whenever I see them.

378
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,368
I haven't seen anyone
who said they won't vote for me.

379
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,537
Okay, I get it. Get your ID card.

380
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,293
I'm friends with the current governor.

381
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,296
If you don't come out,
I'll tell him about your affair.

382
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,051
Is the other lady not here?

383
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,054
After the rumors broke out,

384
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,765
we made sure to check all the details
on the situation.

385
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,310
Even Mr. Kang and his wife
living separately.

386
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,937
Why did they have to live separately?

387
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,857
And we checked
that he has met with this woman.

388
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,109
What has Hyang-mi been doing?

389
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,570
And why...

390
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,907
did they take pictures of my son?

391
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,161
Let us just check the facts one last time.

392
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,706
You know who Kang Jong-ryeol is, right?

393
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,375
You've seen him, right?

394
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,963
We'll definitely compensate you
if you give us some information.

395
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,590
How do you erase this?

396
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,842
-What?
-How do you erase this?

397
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,636
Why are you touching my stuff?

398
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,554
Give it to me. Hey.

399
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,434
-You shouldn't take photos of the kid.
-What?

400
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,187
Why did you take his picture?

401
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,730
What's with you?

402
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,274
We'll blur him out if we need to.

403
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,693
We protect regular civilians' rights.
Give it back.

404
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,446
Who are you to protect my kid?

405
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,156
He didn't do anything.

406
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,413
You shouldn't have taken photos of him.
Pil-gu is just my son.

407
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,875
Is there something about the kid?

408
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,252
There is. Isn't there?

409
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,923
Are you insane?

410
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,176
Do you know how much this is?

411
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,095
Do you know how valuable my son is?

412
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,848
Don't mess with him. I'll kill you all.

413
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,311
They took pictures of him!

414
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,730
Who are you to mess with Pil-gu's life?

415
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,566
Hey, Pil-gu is your son.

416
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,861
Stop trying to be smart
and protect him with everything you have.

417
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,035
Those jerks.

418
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,132
A pork belly place
in front of a family court?

419
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,926
How ironic.

420
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:45,765
People don't usually order
just one serving of pork belly.

421
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,101
People who get divorced

422
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,438
can't even have pork belly.

423
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,065
Is it the punishment of life?

424
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,860
The light turned green.

425
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,115
I'm too hungry to sign the papers.

426
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,617
Don't try anything funny and go.

427
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,495
I'm not trying anything funny.
Let's have one last feast.

428
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,582
You're unbelievable.

429
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,254
Can't we even have pork belly together
one last time?

430
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,633
Even death-row convicts get
what they want to eat before they die.

431
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,097
What did I ever like about you?

432
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:38,026
You know what?
Honestly speaking, it's really unfair.

433
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,571
It's like I'm getting arrested
for tying my shoelace

434
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,198
under a plum tree.

435
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,950
It's "tying your hat string."
You got the saying wrong.

436
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:52,540
I am completely innocent
psychologically and physically.

437
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,752
I honestly didn't even hold her hand.

438
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,798
And Hyang-mi isn't even my style
to begin with.

439
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,592
Okay, let's say you only made an attempt.

440
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:06,012
Your attempted affair was
a decisive trigger, but--

441
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,306
Do you have to use
such difficult vocabulary now?

442
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,225
But it's all the same with us.

443
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,936
About eight or nine out of ten couples say

444
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,064
they can't live with one another
because of personality differences.

445
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,398
That's our case, too.

446
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,943
Darn it. No one has
a perfectly compatible personality.

447
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,904
Even a parent and a child
don't have compatible personalities.

448
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,157
How can you break out our family
over something like that?

449
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,659
Break up.

450
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:31,329
Not "break out." Break up.

451
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,748
This is why.

452
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,501
This is exactly why.

453
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,839
Did you ever show me your support
saying, "Great job, my husband.

454
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,465
Gyu-tae, you're the best"?

455
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,926
You always look down on me and ignore me.

456
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:49,764
People want to live with a wife,
not with the grammar police.

457
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,558
You looked down on me, too.

458
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,393
How could I, on such a noble attorney?

459
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,103
Correcting you isn't the only way.

460
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,188
Let's be honest.

461
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,609
We weren't infertile.
We were on birth control.

462
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,697
It has been years
since we lived like roommates.

463
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,616
Hey, why are you saying
something like that out here?

464
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,951
It seemed like

465
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:14,372
we lived together because we can't get
only one serving of food delivered.

466
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,460
You're a guy
who keeps saying wrong things,

467
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:23,131
and I'm a person
who can't live without fixing them.

468
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,135
So what can we do?
We have no other choice.

469
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,932
Let's both stop holding back.

470
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,688
Then can't we just

471
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,524
live together as you get your revenge?

472
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,817
I already got my revenge

473
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,028
through Choi Hyang-mi.

474
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,447
What?

475
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,289
Thank you.

476
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,137
What are you doing?

477
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:16,684
Hey, I actually thought you were cool
because you were the grammar police.

478
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,395
I have no idea why I became so petty.

479
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,814
-Open the door.
-But at first,

480
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,734
you thought I was cute
because I was so petty.

481
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,278
-Let's go back to the beginning.
-Open it.

482
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:28,947
Dear Ja-yeong.

483
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,115
I love you.

484
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,080
That jerk!

485
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,125
I LOVE ONLY YOU

486
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,013
She's just too pretty
for me to say anything.

487
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,766
She suggests breaking up
whenever she's upset.

488
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,270
Is she home?

489
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,400
Gosh.

490
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,526
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

491
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,321
Gosh, ma'am.
Are you coming back from somewhere?

492
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,823
You got flowers again.

493
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:13,866
Oh, yes.

494
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:19,872
I have to do my best
to get on her good side again.

495
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,292
She's not a kid.
She won't perk up over some flowers.

496
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,004
Why buy stuff you can't even eat?

497
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,797
This was a bit cheaper.

498
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,923
CAMELLIA

499
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,634
Hydrangeas cost only 3,000 won per bunch.

500
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,469
Forget getting those for 3,000 won.

501
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,432
Do you know how much you need
to support your family?

502
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,184
Are you rich?

503
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,228
Do you have any savings?

504
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:47,400
But I'm making an investment for my future
with these hydrangeas.

505
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,528
You're so innocent. You are.

506
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,613
You're so naive.

507
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,075
But for you to keep living so innocently,

508
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,911
your wife will have to be tough.

509
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:05,418
Still, I don't think happiness
is all about money.

510
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,712
Gosh, is that so?

511
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,175
There's no guarantee
that you'll be happy with money,

512
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,968
but it raises the possibility.

513
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,680
You can't get money with happiness,

514
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,059
but with money,
you can buy some happiness.

515
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,394
Right.

516
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,689
If a kid begs you for food
as soon as you wake up,

517
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,233
you end up abandoning them, too.

518
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,575
I'm hungry, Mom.

519
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,411
Will you please

520
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,414
stop feeling hungry? Please stop.

521
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:47,585
I'm hungry.

522
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,429
Please stop...

523
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,105
I just wish

524
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:11,567
my child could live with a full stomach.

525
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,154
I don't want her to keep worrying
about what others think.

526
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,990
But a nice guy like you is
always ambiguous.

527
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,620
Ma'am.

528
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,125
I won't let Dongbaek starve.

529
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,711
And she won't have to worry
about what others think.

530
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,004
How so?

531
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,590
What about your mother?

532
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,470
See that?

533
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:43,141
Nice guys never say anything.

534
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,478
Don't ever let my daughter
feel unwelcomed.

535
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,772
She walked on eggshells her whole life.

536
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,275
Don't let her feel intimidated.

537
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,319
Why are you making her feel sorry?

538
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,783
I'll slowly convince my mother...

539
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,077
With that vague attitude, just forget it.

540
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,789
You'll waste your life hesitating.

541
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,768
BAEKDU MARINATED CRAB

542
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,116
Mom! I'm going to...

543
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,079
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

544
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,373
-Great work.
-Great job, man.

545
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,463
Mom, why do you keep spending
the night outside?

546
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,008
Do you go out and come in as you please?

547
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:07,016
Mom, do you have another family?

548
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,644
Is there a man or another child?

549
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:13,022
Why are you asking so many questions?
Why? Did you miss me?

550
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,316
In your dreams.

551
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,984
You despised me,

552
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,029
but do you get curious and sad
when I'm not around now?

553
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,406
No way.

554
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,326
It's because both Hyang-mi
and you were gone.

555
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,121
I told you we had a reservation
for a school reunion.

556
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:33,542
The number you are calling
is switched off...

557
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,253
She turned off her phone.

558
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,089
Is she cutting me off
over just 30 million won or what?

559
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,257
She won't come anymore.

560
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,885
-What?
-Don't wait for someone who won't come.

561
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,681
How do you know?

562
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,266
We need the check!

563
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,268
-Yes, coming.
-Okay.

564
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,534
I was going to disown you
if you didn't come in tonight.

565
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,703
I know you're out of it,

566
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,789
but you aren't human if you
forget your dad's death anniversary.

567
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,625
Why is he out of it?

568
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,961
Hey, Gyu-sik. You're here.

569
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:20,381
Gyu-sik worked on a fishing boat,
and he always asked one question.

570
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,216
"How many times should I hit you?"

571
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,849
Why is he out of it?
Are you dating someone?

572
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,600
Du-sik does jujitsu.

573
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,687
Mom, does he act up nowadays or something?

574
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,565
Come on, I'm not a kid.

575
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,277
Maybe he really is dating someone.
He brought flowers.

576
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,238
Are you dating someone?

577
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,825
Then you should have talked to me.

578
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,327
I know everything.

579
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,662
Stop talking nonsense and get changed.

580
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:53,914
I am...

581
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,292
dating someone.

582
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:05,468
My goodness.
Yong-sik, you're all grown up.

583
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,886
Date a lot of people.

584
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,929
It's good to date a lot
before you marry.

585
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,224
Come on, he dated a number of girls.

586
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,018
He falls in love easily.

587
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:17,313
He used to have a crush
on Seung-yeop's sister.

588
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,899
He liked that shabby girl so much,

589
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,568
he went around catching beetles with her.

590
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,320
She's not like her.

591
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,739
Just go and get changed, will you?

592
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,033
He looks fine.
Stop telling him to get changed.

593
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,119
Anyway, is this serious?

594
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,454
What does she do?

595
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,165
-She runs a business.
-A business?

596
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,750
-Self-employed.
-Like a shop?

597
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:38,959
-Where at?
-Here.

598
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,127
-Here?
-Over there.

599
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,462
-Over there?
-What is it?

600
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,339
Just go and get changed, will you?

601
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,591
It's her. Dongbaek.

602
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,765
You know, Camellia.

603
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,850
She's the owner there.

604
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,402
-Oh, my umbrella. The umbrella.
-Sure, goodbye.

605
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,621
Are you a puppy or something?

606
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:20,251
You're about to run out
whenever you hear the bell.

607
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,253
What?

608
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,757
You get attached so easily.

609
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,844
If he doesn't come, just be cool about it.

610
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,888
You just keep waiting desperately for him.

611
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,433
Why are you so...

612
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,644
Yes, I'm that easy
because I've been lonely all my life.

613
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,439
It's great to have someone worry
and give me attention.

614
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,608
Are you attacking me?

615
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,738
Are you trying to say
it's because you were never loved?

616
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,034
People who grew up being loved

617
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,120
never seem to have a problem
dating anyone.

618
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,497
But for me, it's always all or nothing.

619
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:02,835
I always try not to fall in love
because I'm scared I might get hurt.

620
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,753
I act like such a loser.

621
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,047
But once I fall for someone,
I give him my all.

622
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,801
I know it's pathetic,
but that's just who I am.

623
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,642
Stop staring at the door
and just call him.

624
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,728
Tell him you're ready
to give him everything.

625
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,771
I'm holding back
'cause I have a conscience.

626
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:23,981
What?

627
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,401
Why does Yong-sik have to be so perfect?

628
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,447
I can't be honest about my feelings
because he's so out of my league.

629
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,283
BAEKDU GRANDMA MARINATED CRAB

630
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,410
You must be out of your mind!

631
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,038
If you were a kid,
I would've beaten you up.

632
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,414
You should think about Mom.

633
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,127
She runs a restaurant even to this day
so she can support you.

634
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,631
How could you be so ungrateful
and disappoint her like this?

635
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:53,093
I'd rather have you go around
catching beetles.

636
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,845
Of all the women you could date...

637
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,057
Does she keep hitting on you?

638
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,684
Is she being clingy? Is that why?

639
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,478
Watch what you say!

640
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,730
You've totally lost it.

641
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:07,149
Hey, don't glare like that!

642
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,986
Get out of here! Just scratch your name
off the family registry!

643
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,530
Just leave him be.

644
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,907
Just leave him be!

645
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,702
Yong-sik, just go home.

646
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,623
Mom, he's like this
because you always let him off the hook.

647
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:25,543
He's still so immature
because you still treat him like a kid.

648
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:29,088
You guys at least got to live
with your father while he was alive.

649
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,216
But he never got to see his father.

650
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,592
So don't be so harsh on him.

651
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:37,304
You should be more generous
instead of being so harsh.

652
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,307
Don't be so hard on him.

653
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,726
It really upsets me!

654
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,361
Stop crying!

655
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,994
I love Mom, and I love you guys, too.

656
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,955
But I can't do anything about
my feelings for her.

657
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,171
I can't stop my feelings.

658
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,098
Where are you going?

659
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,267
Are you going to the market?

660
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,019
What?

661
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,606
You're dressed up.

662
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,399
What do you mean?

663
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,526
Look at your shoes.

664
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:38,282
What do you know about market fashion?
You've never even been there.

665
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,619
-Wait up.
-Why?

666
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,287
Let me go with you.

667
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,944
GO TO THE MARKET WITH DONGBAEK
EVERY THURSDAY

668
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:32,461
I told you that I can eat breakfast
at the precinct station.

669
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,129
Why do you always pack me food?

670
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:37,383
You have to have mixed stew
the day after the memorial service.

671
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:42,513
My gosh, you really
didn't have to prepare so much.

672
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,976
Hey, don't talk back
to your older brothers.

673
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,770
They'll beat you up.

674
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,980
I have to leave early today.

675
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,484
I heard you go to the market
every Thursday morning

676
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,444
with Dongbaek.

677
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:02,491
I heard you guys sit in the back seat
of bus number three

678
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,159
and hold hands and stuff.

679
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,580
Everyone in the neighborhood is my spy.

680
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,085
My gosh, those ladies are unbelievable.

681
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,003
Do they think we're in middle school?

682
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:19,633
Why do they broadcast everything I do?
I'm over 30 years old now.

683
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,094
-My gosh.
-But...

684
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,596
don't go today.

685
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,016
Mom, I'm not a little kid.

686
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,644
You can't force us to break up.

687
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,521
I like Dongbaek a lot.

688
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,733
I dreamt of your father last night.

689
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,109
What?

690
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:40,028
It's been a while,
but I dreamt of him yesterday.

691
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,865
He came for his memorial service.

692
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,952
Your father was standing all by himself
in the middle of the market.

693
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,665
But he didn't look so happy.

694
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,210
Don't go today. Let's just eat together.

695
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,051
CHIEF BYEON

696
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,678
Why is he calling at this hour?

697
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,348
Hello?

698
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:11,727
What?

699
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:13,896
Ongsan Lake?

700
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,653
ONGSAN 2-RI BUS STOP

701
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:29,536
Dongbaek!

702
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,625
I wanted to arrive faster than you!

703
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:35,751
Dongbaek.

704
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:43,258
Ta-da. My mom bought
a box of carp extract for me.

705
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:47,054
And we should have some
since it's cold outside at this hour.

706
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,767
My gosh, seriously.

707
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,312
This is how clumsy I am.

708
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,070
Right.

709
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,531
It's not easy to wake up so early.

710
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,826
You can't always be consistent.

711
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,953
It's just how things are.

712
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,003
I hated having to ride the bus alone.

713
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,551
How many people are there?

714
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,138
How many people are you with?

715
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,724
I'm here by myself,
but I'm going to order two servings.

716
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,478
And I hated needing someone to eat with.

717
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,573
So it's been a while since I got
used to doing things by myself.

718
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,211
But now, I don't want to sit on my own.

719
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,716
It really sucks to become
used to something.

720
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,386
My gosh.

721
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,640
What's with all these fires?
They're starting to bother me.

722
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,851
This is the third fire.

723
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:19,313
You asked me to call you
if a fire broke out, so I did.

724
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,774
But the fire wasn't even
that big of a deal.

725
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:28,989
Wasn't there sawdust
at the academy building as well?

726
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,949
Yes, there was. I saw sawdust there.

727
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,954
I think I also saw sawdust
at the warehouse fire, too.

728
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:44,046
My gosh, it seems like
someone also burned a sweater.

729
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,932
This looks like Dongbaek's sweater.

730
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:57,893
What?

731
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,817
Chief, you told me there were
four fires before someone died, right?

732
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,071
My gosh, this is practically
a fake report.

733
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:13,325
The person who called made it seem like
someone was burning to death.

734
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:17,204
Who would make a false report for this
so early in the morning?

735
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,206
Chief.

736
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,669
I don't think I should be here right now.

737
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:29,424
Dongbaek, where are you?
Are you on the bus?

738
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,843
I'm on my way to the market. Why?

739
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:35,222
Are there a lot of people on the bus?
Is there anyone weird there?

740
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,934
So what if I see someone weird?

741
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,355
Where are you right now?
I'm on my way there.

742
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,359
I'm about to get off. Why?

743
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:50,612
ONGSAN MARINATED CRAB TOWN

744
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:54,366
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE WITCH
THAT DOESN'T BURN

745
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:57,536
-They're really fresh today.
-We're selling monkfish.

746
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:01,123
Why are you here by yourself?
Where's your boyfriend?

747
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,500
-I came alone today.
-My goodness.

748
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,170
I have an announcement for the owner
of Camellia in Ongsan.

749
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,007
Please come to the second floor
and take your receipt.

750
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:13,927
Dongbaek, don't forget your receipts.

751
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,388
-Paying taxes is no joke.
-I'll get going.

752
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,305
Okay.

753
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,191
Who put this note here?

754
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,193
ASK OWNER OF CAMELLIA TO PICK UP RECEIPT

755
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:33,613
ROOM 201: SALES OFFICE

756
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,157
-Hey.
-Hi.

757
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,496
ONGSAN SEAFOOD MARKET SALES OFFICE

758
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,627
Hello?

759
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:17,324
Has someone turned on the heater already?
The smell is giving me a headache.

760
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,034
-Hey.
-Coming!

761
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,293
Why isn't anyone here?

762
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,842
I'm getting a headache. Is it the heater?

763
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,011
This place needs some fresh air.

764
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:45,769
My goodness.

765
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:51,983
Oh, gosh.

766
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,326
-Look at that!
-Oh, my goodness!

767
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,328
-My gosh.
-What should we do?

768
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:05,956
-My goodness.
-Did you call the emergency center?

769
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:08,250
-What are we going to do?
-Oh, gosh.

770
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,053
What should we do?

771
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:31,523
YONG-SIK

772
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,948
Help!

773
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,075
My gosh!

774
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,287
Please help!

775
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,498
Oh, my goodness.

776
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,751
Is anyone outside?

777
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,839
Help!

778
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,841
Help!

779
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,886
Please help!

780
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:04,681
We have an emergency.
A fire broke out at Ongsan Seafood Market.

781
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:09,811
The fourth fire broke out on Thursday
at the marketplace.

782
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,526
Get out of here!

783
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:19,905
Get out!

784
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,200
Get out of here right now!

785
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,538
Go this way!

786
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,638
Dongbaek!

787
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:20,984
Dongbaek.

788
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:23,945
Dongbaek!

789
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,991
What's wrong with his hand?

790
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,744
He forced a burning door open.

791
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,620
This guy's crazy.

792
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:04,235
He's crazy. He's totally crazy.

793
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,113
Yes, her name's on the list.

794
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,741
But I need to check if it's okay
for people to visit--

795
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,743
-People can visit her?
-Pardon?

796
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:13,995
Can't you hear me?

797
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,247
She's not dead?

798
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,756
GRAMOXONE

799
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:28,593
The company put all kinds
of warning labels on its bottles.

800
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:36,935
Excuse me.

801
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,608
My goodness.

802
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,112
Oh, gosh.

803
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,449
Dongbaek.

804
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,374
Yong-sik... Oh my gosh.

805
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:01,459
Are you okay?

806
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,045
Oh my gosh. What do I do?

807
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:07,257
Your hand... Give me your hand.

808
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,970
Let me see your hand.

809
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,306
You're worried about my hand right now?

810
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,434
Let me see.

811
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:19,978
Show it to me.

812
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:22,355
Let me see.

813
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,111
My gosh.

814
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,030
Yong-sik.

815
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,451
Are you dumb? Can't you think properly?

816
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,454
You really don't know how to be careful.

817
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,832
Do you think you're some kind of hero?

818
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,793
Do you think you're invincible?

819
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,464
Why would you do this for me?

820
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,467
You really upset me so much.

821
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,635
I'm so upset.

822
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:08,860
I don't think...

823
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,698
I can do this anymore.

824
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:19,996
I'm exhausted.

825
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:24,751
I've had enough.

826
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,715
I can't even focus on work because of you.

827
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,762
You give me such a hard time.

828
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:40,767
I knew this was going to happen
because of me.

829
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:42,477
I...

830
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,691
want to live a comfortable life now.

831
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,112
Let's just end this.

832
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,375
I guess you're finally
starting to grow up.

833
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:09,754
Okay.

834
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,966
You should run away.

835
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,134
Yong-sik.

836
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,639
If you stay beside me,
my bad luck will rub off on you.

837
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,646
Let's stop...

838
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,191
all the flirting.

839
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:34,988
Let's end it.

840
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:38,866
And now...

841
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,082
Let's just get married.

842
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,721
I can't stop worrying about you.

843
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,725
I worry about you so much,
and it makes me so anxious.

844
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:05,643
And...

845
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,357
You're...

846
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,527
You're so cute.

847
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,447
I want to keep you by my side

848
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:20,116
for the rest of my life.

849
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,375
You must be crazy.

850
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,712
You think your bad luck
will rub off on me?

851
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:35,423
Dongbaek, you have no idea

852
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,051
what a lucky guy I am.

853
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:43,222
I'll give you all my luck.

854
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:46,184
You're nuts.

855
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,811
You've lost your mind.

856
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,902
At the age of 34, I got a proposed
by a guy for the first time in my life.

857
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:59,072
I wasn't even scared
to jump into a fire pit to save you.

858
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,282
So we should get married.

859
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,246
Come on. Let's get married.

860
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:08,748
What do you say?

861
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:13,836
I forgot that I had been a loser
who craved for affection my entire life,

862
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:15,963
and I fearlessly said it.

863
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,259
Yong-sik.

864
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,138
I love you.

865
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:30,395
I knew it.

866
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:53,770
This was definitely arson.

867
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,313
A piece of lighter was found.

868
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,190
Was it green again?

869
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,068
I'm going to stop whoever it is
that's messing with Dongbaek.

870
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:04,363
Did this happen to you
while trying to catch Joker?

871
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,240
-Was it all for Dongbaek?
-Mom!

872
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,202
Mom, you don't have dementia, do you?

873
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,454
You don't have
any criminal records, right?

874
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,456
You're starting to scare me, Mom.

875
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,458
I'm going to kill them all.

876
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,337
I felt the urge to kill her.

877
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,714
What were you doing
around 10:00 p.m. on the 24th?
