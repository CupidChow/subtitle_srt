1
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,267
BEST OUTFIELDER
KANG JONG-RYEOL

2
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,978
Golden Glove winner? MVP?

3
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,982
I was chosen as the youngest player
to win those awards.

4
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,451
You see,

5
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:21,664
having the world in the palm of my hands
so easily

6
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,710
made life seem too easy.

7
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,632
I thought that life
just went by easily like that.

8
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,511
Is one bill a day
enough allowance for an eight-year-old?

9
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,097
I'm not up to date on the market price.

10
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,391
I thought that kids
basically raised themselves.

11
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,186
How am I going to introduce you?

12
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,396
It'll be troublesome
if a scandal breaks out.

13
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,899
I figured

14
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,152
that people would always
stay by your side.

15
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,616
It's the same with marriage.

16
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,452
I didn't think marriage needed any work.

17
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,123
But getting punched in the face

18
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,210
woke me up.

19
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:13,091
Did you just punch my nose?

20
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,635
Fight with everything you have.

21
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,096
It turns out that

22
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,141
I've never fought for something

23
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,769
with everything I have.

24
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,814
It must be why

25
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,526
your dad's being punished.

26
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,001
He must be happy to be home, too.

27
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,628
After polishing off two portions,
he conked out.

28
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,465
He asked me

29
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,136
to wake him up at 6 a.m.
so that he can go to Jun-gi's.

30
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,472
Did he brush his teeth?

31
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,477
Of course. I can help him do that,

32
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,981
so you can stay out longer if you'd like.

33
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,900
What's this?

34
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,777
Gosh, you've become
a shopaholic these days.

35
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,282
Dongbaek, you can always stay the night

36
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,284
at sauna's if you want.

37
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,952
Joker was caught,

38
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:27,707
so you two can enjoy
some time alone as a reward.

39
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,001
Mom, Yong-sik and I broke up,

40
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,756
so enough with the nonsense.

41
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,800
Wait.

42
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,512
Did he break up with you?

43
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,806
Were you dumped?

44
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,850
I dumped him.

45
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,937
Why? Who are you to do that?

46
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,940
You two idiots
just broke it off like that?

47
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,525
Yes, just like that.

48
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,154
You know, it was simple.

49
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,740
There was no fuss.

50
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,785
We just quietly broke it off.

51
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,627
Well,

52
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,922
I know we broke up,

53
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,217
but I still couldn't let you

54
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,636
walk home alone.

55
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,973
There's no need to keep being a gentleman.

56
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,101
You should get going.

57
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,727
Right, then...

58
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,357
I'll get going.

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,236
I'm going.

60
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,126
What? Why are you back?

61
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,252
Dongbaek,

62
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,296
you see...

63
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,880
Well...

64
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,301
Call me if there's any trouble.

65
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,636
I'm always on your side.

66
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,681
Why would you say that?

67
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,100
Why would you be on my side anyway?

68
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,520
Joker was caught now,

69
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,689
so you...

70
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,650
You know,

71
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,737
live your life like you used to.

72
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,657
Shouldn't you tell me to be happy?

73
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,201
Why would I tell you that?

74
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,998
Even though I don't wish you happiness,

75
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:37,628
I know for a fact
that you'll be happy

76
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,965
since you are

77
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,470
awesome and beautiful.

78
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:56,022
Whatever you used to tell me

79
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,524
felt like

80
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,403
a good luck charm to me.

81
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,909
Because you encouraged me,

82
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,286
my life...

83
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,664
changed for real.

84
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,963
Thank you so much for everything.

85
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,765
Well,

86
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,101
you know...

87
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,938
It's...

88
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,691
really over, right?

89
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,074
I never had an amicable ending
with you and Jong-ryeol,

90
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,160
so I never knew that a goodbye existed.

91
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,666
Truth be told, it's more annoying.

92
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,335
He's too much of a catch.

93
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,422
Are you planning to stay single
your whole life?

94
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,842
You know, once in the past...

95
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,470
Maybe I was possessed or something.

96
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,307
Anyway, life was so exhausting

97
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,936
that I looked up how painful suicide

98
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,856
-by carbon monoxide poisoning was.
-What on earth?

99
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,860
I only looked it up.

100
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,612
Just then, Pil-gu suddenly

101
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,615
called for me.

102
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,412
It was the first time he said "Mom."

103
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,416
Oddly enough,

104
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,796
that single word took me from hell
and placed me in heaven.

105
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,760
He is a deity to me.

106
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,391
So I'm fine giving him my all
in this life.

107
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,853
Dongbaek,

108
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:00,980
you'll get lonely.

109
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,066
And loneliness can kill you.

110
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,902
As if I have the time for that.

111
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,077
CAMELLIA

112
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,497
Who gets over a breakup by making kimchi?

113
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,416
I may be crying inside,
but my hands are busy.

114
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,586
Mom, can you bring the radishes now?

115
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,549
Stay busy to confuse your mind.

116
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:35,389
Just like people do in TV series,
I'd like to let sadness take over me.

117
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,558
ONGSAN WATER AUTHORITY

118
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,936
Fictional breakups you see on TV?

119
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,896
Mister. Sir!

120
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,773
It's only a fantasy.

121
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,526
Where do you live, sir?

122
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,236
One stir-fried pork coming up!

123
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,822
The heartbreak might pull me down,

124
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,991
but my rent makes me get back up.

125
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,458
My ruthless and repetitive daily routine

126
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,044
keeps me sane.

127
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:16,514
You know,
Joker could very well be shorter than me.

128
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,268
I'm sure you're aware of the type.

129
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,604
He's just like a man
you'd see on the street.

130
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,565
Just an ordinary man.

131
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,995
Why did you insist on
going on the delivery run?

132
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,999
Why did you?

133
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,753
I can easily ride the scooter, too.

134
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,216
CAMELLIA

135
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,010
Gosh, this is awesome!

136
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,886
This is so much fun!

137
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,523
-Wait, how should I go back?
-Dongbaek!

138
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,191
Dongbaek!

139
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,402
-Dongbaek.
-Hyang-mi?

140
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,282
I see you can ride it now.

141
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,868
Are you aware
that you passed two bus stops?

142
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,704
I saw you from the intersection up there,

143
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,581
but you kept on riding this.

144
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:28,377
So did you follow me
all the way here on foot?

145
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,088
You're not so much of a klutz
like you think you are.

146
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,760
I can't believe you followed me, though.
You should've just stayed there.

147
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,928
I was worried you'd fall.

148
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,893
Why did you have to
go on the delivery run that day?

149
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,738
How am I supposed to live without you?

150
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,832
You should've rather stolen my money
and lived somewhere happily ever after.

151
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,629
Why did you come back?

152
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,346
LOVE MEMORIAL HALL

153
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,474
Mom, for some reason,

154
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,811
I feel like Hyang-mi's still alive.

155
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,649
You have to let her go
so that she can rest in peace.

156
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,113
Here.

157
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:47,373
Don't you even dream
about resting in peace in heaven.

158
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,963
If you die too,
I'll be grieving back to back.

159
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,424
You'll be killing me.

160
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,804
My head hurts more than my kidney
these days because of you.

161
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,975
Hyang-mi's gone now

162
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,936
and I even broke up with Yong-sik.

163
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,480
So can't you please stay by my side?

164
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:15,025
Let me tell you this again.
You're not giving me your kidney.

165
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,155
And let me tell you this.
You're not dying.

166
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,073
Live and pay off your debt.

167
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,868
How's that paying it off?
I'll just be in your debt forever.

168
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,286
Mom.

169
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,412
7 YEARS AND 3 MONTHS OF MOTHERHOOD

170
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,371
Mom.

171
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,500
I'm only asking because I'm upset,
but can we hold hands?

172
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,044
Did we never do this before?

173
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,631
You're a weird one, you know.

174
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,384
How can you even be fond of me?

175
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,472
I don't know. I just like calling you Mom.

176
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,558
So stop fighting me on this
and stay by my side.

177
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,233
Ms. Hong?

178
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,486
CAMELLIA

179
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,241
Aren't you open today?

180
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,832
I only ordered stir-fried pork.

181
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,629
Everyone thinks that customers rule,

182
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,547
but this is actually my kingdom.

183
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,133
I serve whatever I want.

184
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,845
That's why you never gave Gyu-tae
any peanuts?

185
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,806
Not even once.

186
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,433
I never gave him any.

187
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,688
How do you even laugh like that?

188
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,733
That smile you have...

189
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,778
is quite intimidating.

190
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,575
Do I intimidate you?

191
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,667
Some think that you can never be happy.

192
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,672
They find comfort
in saying how bad they feel for you.

193
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,882
But you smile quite easily.

194
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,468
And it's a pretty smile, too.

195
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,263
No wonder it's annoying.

196
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,265
Of course I'm intimidated.

197
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,271
Anyway, you should keep laughing.

198
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,608
Show everyone how happy you are.

199
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,736
Well,

200
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:27,616
I gave up on being openly happy
a long time ago.

201
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,326
Why is that?

202
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,957
What people think of me is their problem.

203
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:41,964
I used to think of happiness
as something like a test score.

204
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,511
I used to look up
at the scoreboard others made

205
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,973
and thought about where I stand.

206
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,684
No matter how hard I looked up though,

207
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,728
I couldn't find an answer.

208
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,148
So why would I stick around
looking for one?

209
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,526
I dismissed their scoreboard
as their own game

210
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,779
and scored my own life
based on my standards.

211
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:10,576
Being happy by my own standards
is all I need in life, right?

212
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,251
It seems like your heart
has its own flowerbed.

213
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,257
Meanwhile, I aced the SAT,
went to a prestigious law school,

214
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,427
but no flowers bloomed within me.

215
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,353
Could I bring a glass of my own?

216
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,064
Dongbaek,

217
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,442
is there any hard liquor
that Gyu-tae keeps here?

218
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,111
What was the brand again?

219
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,529
Ja-yeong, gosh.

220
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,032
How am I supposed to carry her home?

221
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,618
I've never been able to do that.

222
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,705
What should I have done then?
I couldn't let Ja-yeong stay here.

223
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,290
You're using her name?

224
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,213
It only took you a night
to become friends with her

225
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,591
when you're still formal to me
after all this time?

226
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,969
This is inverse discrimination.

227
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,929
It's reverse discrimination.

228
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,306
Anyway, enough with the nonsense.

229
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:19,311
Just so you know,
I told Ja-yeong everything.

230
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:21,897
About what?

231
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,276
About me? You put in a good word for me?

232
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,612
Not that.

233
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,864
I told her about Hyang-mi.

234
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:36,120
I said that Hyang-mi
isn't some man-eater or a slut.

235
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,164
Darn.

236
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,084
Isn't there

237
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,254
an adjustment period
for couples going through a divorce?

238
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,715
She hasn't dumped you yet.

239
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,760
Come by with Ja-yeong sometime
and I will...

240
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,431
serve the peanut dish

241
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,307
for free

242
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,351
in your name.

243
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,689
Dongbaek...

244
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,066
What now?

245
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,070
Are you crying? Gosh.

246
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,955
How about a yearly rent from now on?

247
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,626
Do you have the money? Want a loan, too?

248
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,130
Let's go.

249
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,134
What?

250
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,845
What do you mean?

251
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,847
Online? What about it?

252
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,023
Jessica...

253
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,900
topped Joker.

POPULAR REAL-TIME KEYWORDS

KANG JONG-RYEOL'S WIFE WAS MARRIED BEFORE?

00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,784
WHY DID JESSICA LIE?

257
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,128
The police promised
to reveal every crime he committed,

258
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,130
but they're just waiting for a confession.

259
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,674
Yes, that's the reality of it.

260
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,968
What still seems to be the issue

261
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:20,140
is the psychological evaluation
the defense

262
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,101
-handed in.
-Are you kidding me?

263
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:26,522
Unbelievable. Not that defense again.

264
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,484
This feels wrong.

265
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,819
Why?

266
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,614
Are you worried that he'll get a lesser
sentence due to his mental illness?

267
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,157
No, that's not it.

Is Heung-sik really moving?

269
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,293
Are you really moving?

270
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,590
Who will ask me over
to repair anything anymore?

271
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,387
Your father's to blame, not you.

272
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,602
Still,

273
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,772
I'm just as guilty.

274
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,151
I knew his legs were better

275
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,111
and I knew

276
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,197
he was poisoning the cat food.

277
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,367
Aren't you an avid cat-lover?

278
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,744
Why did you let him do that?

279
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,248
My dad hates loud noises.

280
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,501
He took it out on the cats

281
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,504
when they cried at night.

282
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,384
He just couldn't control himself.

283
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,012
Damn it.

284
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,644
You lived here your whole life,
so where will you go?

285
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,151
My dad even forgot to take his glasses.

286
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,488
Is this really the time
to worry about that?

287
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,908
I hate him, too.

288
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,703
But what can I do?

289
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,580
He's still my dad.

290
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,293
He may be a killer,

291
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,047
but he's still my dad.

292
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,593
Damn it.

293
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,432
Here. Stop fidgeting with it
and hand it over.

294
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,562
Damn it.

295
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,321
Why do you keep following me?

296
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,032
You see your doctor on
Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.

297
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,618
-I'm not blind, you know.
-So what?

298
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,664
You're going to watch me get my dialysis?

299
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,208
I'm allowed to have privacy, you know.

300
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,753
I have the right
to keep certain things hidden.

301
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,007
I heard that dialysis can be tough.

302
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,051
A transplant is the best.

303
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,637
Dongbaek, whether I die or not,

304
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,474
I have the right to choose my own fate!
Don't be like this!

305
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,935
No, you don't have the right to die.

306
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,270
Why not?

307
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,106
You've been my mom
for only seven years and three months.

308
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:17,901
What?

309
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,947
Do you even know
how long we've lived together?

310
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,160
Seven years when I was young
and three months just this year.

311
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,038
That's it.

312
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,040
That's not how mothers should be.

313
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,043
You were a short-term mom

314
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,672
and now you want me to just
live off your insurance money?

315
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,593
Mom,

316
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,305
have you ever been an orphan?

317
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,475
You've been constantly in my life.

318
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,728
Every day, your presence hurt me.

319
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:03,155
I'm too annoyed and pissed off to let you
off the hook with the insurance money.

320
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,659
I must live with you for 20 more years.

321
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,037
So stay alive

322
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,913
and pay off your debt.

323
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,167
Be a mother!

324
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,173
Darn her.

325
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,092
She won't even let me die
on my own accord.

326
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,851
She needs to keep her appointments.

327
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:37,522
You know how dangerous it can be
to skip dialysis.

328
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,567
What happens if she misses a session?

329
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,989
Being late for a dialysis
is considered as suicide.

330
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,958
The nurse's aunt
was a day late for her dialysis

331
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,211
and she died while playing golf.

332
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,588
Are you gambling on your life?

333
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,840
Do you not care about living?

334
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,802
You have no idea how much this hurts.

335
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,307
My blood is drained from my body
and swapped with clean blood.

336
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,102
Scary, isn't it?

337
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,063
Does it hurt?

338
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:23,068
It's not that I just feel weak.
I'm in a terrible mood as well.

339
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,698
Do you have any idea how sad it is

340
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,785
to know that a machine
is keeping you alive?

341
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,876
I'm going to schedule
the surgery with your doctor,

342
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,253
so just know that.

343
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,801
Are you scared? Should I stay with you?

344
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:53,932
So...

345
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,936
how was the seven years
and three months for you?

346
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,189
Was it all right?

347
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,486
Was it?

348
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,411
You really are the weirdest. Unbelievable.

349
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,082
Be strong and hang in there.

350
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:24,004
If you can't live for yourself,
then live for me. Okay?

351
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,567
Go ahead. You like rice with toppings.

352
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,322
I'm only asking because I'm curious.

353
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,365
What are you calling a joke?

354
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:56,453
We can't stop joking around
unless you tell us what you mean by it.

355
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,581
Get me some water.

356
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,838
Why can't I meet the suspect
that I caught myself?

357
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,925
Call it a visitation if you want,
I have rights.

358
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,053
Actually, you don't.
Mere officers don't get that right.

359
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,889
Your job is to keep order on the streets.

360
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,769
I'm not here just for kicks.
I have something for him.

361
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,897
-I have a reason to see him.
-And what may that be?

362
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,945
Why can't his son visit him?

363
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,113
You're violating his rights

364
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,324
by depriving a man
to wear his own glasses.

365
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,994
We have the right to decide
who gets to visit the suspect.

366
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,622
Right, then I'll also
take the liberty to report this

367
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,624
to the National Human Rights Commission.

368
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,125
I'm sure

369
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,504
you're aware that murderers' rights
are more important than yours.

370
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,010
You.

371
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:58,765
None of the cameras should be on
during my visit.

372
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,643
It all boils down to his human rights.

373
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,729
Human rights, sure.
Anyway, you have ten minutes.

374
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,738
Heung-sik's leaving Ongsan.

375
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,993
Why does he have to suffer

376
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,621
when you're the killer?

377
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,295
You're the last person I want to see,

378
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,465
but I'm here

379
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,051
as a favor to Heung-sik.

380
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:38,722
I'll get going then.

381
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,684
Are people pointing fingers at him

382
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,645
for being a murderer's son?

383
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,069
Heung-sik...

384
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,740
still considers you as a dad
despite all that.

385
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,619
The father tried to frame his son
as an accomplice,

386
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,413
but he wants you to have your glasses.

387
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,749
He's not my accomplice.

388
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,001
While you sit in here in silence,

389
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,920
Heung-sik's personal details
were all made known,

390
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,297
and he's already shunned.

391
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,841
You should think of him

392
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,135
and pay for your crimes

393
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,304
like a father.

394
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,599
They were being a joke!

395
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,435
They all died because they joked around.

396
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,037
You know what?

397
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,456
They're all edited.

398
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,628
They're all edited,
and my mom will sue everyone.

399
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,254
We'll find a law firm...

400
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:00,845
What?

401
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,889
Give me your phone.

402
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,308
Stop looking at it for a while.

403
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,482
Don't turn on your computer
or log into your social media.

404
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,526
Don't read the comments of news articles.

405
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,451
You must find me hilarious.

406
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,203
You were dying to divorce me,

407
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,539
and you have your reason now.

408
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,501
I won't abandon someone who fell down.
Even if I divorce you, it's not now.

409
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:39,008
You're Ji-seon's mom
and I won't let you look ridiculous.

410
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,554
I'll take care of everything,

411
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,849
so stop worrying
and don't browse the internet.

412
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,520
To be frank,
you two weren't living together anyway.

413
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,188
And it really doesn't concern you.

414
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,233
So I shouldn't be concerned?

415
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,402
Since we'll be strangers
after the divorce?

416
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:03,074
But to be frank,
don't you think we're complete strangers?

417
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,119
I'm not concerned about you
making money with me.

418
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,248
Hey.

419
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,876
I mean, sir.

420
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:17,172
Please remove
all the articles about my wife.

421
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,550
If you do that for me,

422
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,594
I'll renew the contract

423
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,013
and do everything
from loan shark ads to any events.

424
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,097
But...

425
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,516
if you don't do this for me,

426
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,229
I'll just retire.

427
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,524
POWER OFF

428
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,242
But you're at fault, too.

429
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,746
I just told some lies,

430
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,664
but I don't have any kids.

431
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:56,920
Yes, you're right. I'm at fault.
But let's make one thing clear.

432
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,844
Let's say I knew.

433
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,599
I knew that you were once married.

434
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,520
And everyone who needed to know
already knew that.

435
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,901
That means you didn't lie,

436
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,237
and you don't have to feel small.

437
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:24,697
Do you understand?

438
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:31,120
A person shows their true self
at the very last moment.

439
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,000
Their true warm self
that was hidden behind their aloofness.

440
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,215
His true cold self
he hid behind his aloofness began to show

441
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,342
without a doubt.

442
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:48,179
They're a joke
who can't even unclog their own john.

443
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,767
Some idiots look for us
even when their gas is cut off.

444
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,813
But they show off like they're a big deal,
so I couldn't help it.

445
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:02,318
If it looks like I can kill them,
I need to do that.

446
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,701
Is that why you started to kill them?

447
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,744
It's only tough to get started.

448
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,081
All of you could do it if you wanted to.

449
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,299
Is that why you killed

450
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,259
Ms. Kim Song-hwa?

451
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,555
That mad bitch

452
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,976
joked around with me
when she should be grateful.

453
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,104
That mad bitch
always got stuff delivered to her

454
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,189
with the money she got
working as an escort.

455
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,149
KIM SONG-HWA

456
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,027
But she always got them
delivered to our store.

457
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:49,490
The delivery guy took 2,500 won from me
saying it's cash on delivery.

458
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:55,288
And that bitch wouldn't take my change.

459
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,248
She wouldn't take it.

460
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,374
500 WON

461
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,710
And the look on her face.

462
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,170
Keep the change.

463
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,630
The look on her face...

464
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:09,218
I always hear this noise
whenever I lose it.

465
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,639
I can't live with that noise, can I?

466
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:16,726
I can't even bear
to listen to the sound of a clock.

467
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,023
VICTIM KIM SEON-SUK, FEMALE IN 50S

468
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,780
That bitch, the co-up head,
was a clean freak.

469
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,448
But her toilet always got clogged.

470
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,623
I went to unclog her john,

471
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,459
but she wouldn't stop following me around.

472
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,590
What? I already paid you.

473
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,718
It's not New York. It's Washington D.C.

474
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,095
It's New York.

475
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,722
-Then should we ask him?
-Sure.

476
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,684
What would he know?

477
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,646
Later on,

478
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,732
I couldn't bear to live
because of that noise.

479
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,779
Is that why you killed
Ms. Han Geum-ok, too?

480
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,658
If he doesn't like me,
why would he lend me his umbrella?

481
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,577
I don't get why I always
end up with jerks.

482
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,745
That crazy bitch.

483
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:22,083
She treated me like a jerk
only because I let her use my umbrella.

484
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,085
QUICK DELIVERY

485
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,920
That Chinese restaurant delivery guy?

486
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,548
I give them business,
and what does he say?

487
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,011
You should've made instant noodles.
Why did you order in this weather?

488
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,305
And you only ordered one bowl.

489
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,352
Joker was

490
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,606
a monster created
because of his sense of inferiority.

491
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,817
Those ignorant idiots

492
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,570
keep behaving like a joke.

493
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,783
What about Hyang-mi?

494
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,911
Why did you kill Ms. Choi Hyang-mi?

495
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,043
That's because

496
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,754
I thought she was the other bitch.

497
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,758
Dongbaek.

498
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,221
FISHING FESTIVAL

499
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,849
So why did she have to deliver it?

500
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,226
She was even wearing Dongbaek's bracelet.

501
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:33,905
Did you kill her at the fishing hole
and take her to the lake after that?

502
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,498
Yong-sik, if you throw a dead body
in a fishing hole,

503
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,042
it'll rise up in just two days.

504
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,063
You know you can get scratched
when you throw a net, right?

505
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,316
I got scratched throwing her in there.

506
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,115
I should have
pulled out her nails, darn it.

507
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,870
Dongbaek...

508
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,123
Why did you

509
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,834
try to kill Dongbaek?

510
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,711
She keeps on messing with me.

511
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,422
She keeps getting on my nerves.

512
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,719
We got him.

513
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,471
He's good.

514
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,974
We should use him as a hired hand.

515
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,937
Just let me see him, will you?

516
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,899
Hey, man. Do you know
why detectives get a leeway?

517
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,110
-There are reasons--
-Hey, wait.

518
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,573
Were you good friends
with Park Seok-yong's son?

519
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,033
It's called establishing rapport.

520
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,537
It's a way of making them confess
by earning their trust and friendship.

521
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,038
But you've known him as a kid.

522
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,041
I mean, he's your friend's father,
so you have a ground already.

523
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:13,629
On top of that, even murderers get
quite attached to their own kids.

524
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,673
That's what you're after.

525
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,426
So try to make him tell you
the stories in the order.

526
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,469
That's how we'll find his other crimes.

527
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,015
Okay, I clearly understand.

528
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,559
All right, let me put this together.

529
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,730
The keyword is his son. It's his son.

530
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,068
Stay on top of everything
and be on stand-by. Got it?

531
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,083
Mr. Park Seok-yong, the suspect.

532
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:56,881
You made a confession about all of them,
every single one of the six crimes.

533
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,552
And these glasses?

534
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,347
You might use these
to hurt yourself or others,

535
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,390
so we're taking these after inspection.

536
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,979
I used the glasses as an excuse.

537
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,316
I came because I wanted to see you.

538
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,236
I always go the full distance.

539
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:23,824
I'm going to make sure
that you're punished for everything.

540
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,875
Do you really think

541
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,503
that will happen?

542
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,588
Mr. Park.

543
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,885
My grandma was

544
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,972
a truly feeble-minded person.

545
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,724
And she fainted
when she saw a cow butchered.

546
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:53,271
I don't understand how the feeble-minded
can ever kill a person.

547
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:57,024
What people do on impulse
is kicking the tires of someone's car.

548
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,110
People don't kill a person on impulse.

549
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,446
I don't care how feeble-minded you are

550
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,116
or how you claim
to have murdered them on impulse.

551
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,746
Don't make any excuses
to cut down your sentence.

552
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,376
I'm taking this to the end

553
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,965
until Joker gladly takes his punishment.
Until the end.

554
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,347
The problem is finding a donor.
She can receive it from others, too.

555
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,391
But you're her daughter, so...

556
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,144
Can we just set up a date, then?

557
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,730
Do I really need my mom's consent?

558
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,024
We need your consent.

559
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,275
INTERNIST JEONG CHAN-GEOL

560
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,193
She told you about the situation, right?

561
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,238
She doesn't even need to get a checkup.

562
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,742
She's my daughter,
so it'll be a perfect match, right?

563
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,869
Isn't that right?

564
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,457
Getting a transplant is your only way,
so come with her to get a checkup.

565
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:58,794
But

566
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,588
what about the donor?

567
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:05,384
Does this affect the donor?

568
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,179
Kidney transplant is
a rather safe procedure

569
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,889
for the donor and the beneficiary.

570
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,266
I see.

571
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:17,063
Goodness, I'm so brazen.

572
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,274
I'm starting to wish I could live longer.

573
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,738
But in your daughter's case,

574
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,407
she has to get a checkup first.

575
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,701
This is a hereditary disease.

576
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,497
What?

577
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,249
Ms. Jo, your kidney condition is called

578
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,585
autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney disease.

579
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,963
If a mother has renal failure
due to a polycystic kidney,

580
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,591
there's a high chance
it'll happen to her daughter.

581
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:50,096
Does this mean she'll end up like me?

582
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,182
Not 100 percent, though. About 50.

583
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,975
What? 50 percent?

584
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:02,525
Wait, no. My daughter
is completely healthy right now.

585
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,527
She's fine. Why would it happen?

586
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:10,199
Ms. Jo, your symptoms
also appeared at the age of 48, too.

587
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,368
-Yes.
-Polycystic kidney

588
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:16,163
doesn't become obvious
before the age of 35.

589
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,251
Then will my daughter

590
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,296
end up getting dialysis as I do?

591
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,052
That means

592
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,180
she'll have to go through this pain, too.

593
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,228
Does she know about this?
Did she hear about it?

594
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:44,191
Goodness, I am a huge disaster
in my daughter's life.

595
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,862
The numbers show
that you won't be able to survive

596
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,822
unless you get a transplant surgery.

597
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:53,659
If you look for another donor,
you'll have to wait at least five years.

598
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,120
-Go talk to your daughter--
-No.

599
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,166
I won't do it.

600
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,376
That just means

601
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,837
I'm taking advantage

602
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:09,467
of my perfectly healthy daughter's life
to live a couple more years.

603
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,762
I don't want to do it.

604
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,853
But I'll...

605
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,105
just do it.

606
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,357
I'll win against that 50 percent.

607
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,359
Pardon?

608
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,947
Thankfully, I just can't be that unlucky.

609
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:38,913
I'm not sure if I should be thankful
for using up my unluckiness to this day.

610
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,461
It was finally my turn to get lucky.

611
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,609
Goodness. You are

612
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,570
always very harsh to me.

613
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,242
Getting in?

614
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,411
I should, shouldn't I?

615
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,720
Mom.

616
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,724
She hasn't had the dialysis yet.

617
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,060
Her numbers say
she's a ticking bomb.

618
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,770
Bring her immediately.

619
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,697
Yong-sik, I'm sorry I called.

620
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,740
But can you find my mom?

621
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,370
She might go home,

622
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,039
so go home for now, okay?

623
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,013
COARSE SALT

624
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,476
FINE SALT

625
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:29,648
I could finally see
what she had been doing for three months.

626
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,484
It'll be too salty.

627
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,364
Why are the pickled radishes so small?

628
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,284
Have you even seasoned the rice?

629
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,163
I thought she was
just concerned about her own health.

630
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:49,293
Do not eat these. Don't eat salt.
Don't eat soy sauce either.

631
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,837
If it tastes salty and delicious,
don't eat it.

632
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,757
Why did she put this up here?

633
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:04,391
-Mom.
-Pil-gu, give me a hug.

634
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,274
Even after I became a mom,
I can't be a match for my own mom.

635
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,156
No matter where

636
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,116
and when I die,

637
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,495
I can't be found anonymous.

638
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,583
Why do I keep swelling up?

639
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,794
It's scary.

640
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,801
No matter when I die,

641
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:43,639
I hope that half-wit definitely sees this.

642
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,891
KBC LIFE INSURANCE

643
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,189
KBC LIFE INSURANCE

644
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:56,610
Then let me leave my will with you.

645
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,280
No, I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to!

646
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,615
I want you to listen to me.

647
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,909
My gosh, but...

648
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:09,873
I already feel uncomfortable
about listening to a living person's will.

649
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,668
But if you must, say something
that will teach me a lesson.

650
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,504
Stop giving me instructions
on how to receive your insurance.

651
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,214
Lessons won't give her any money.

652
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,216
Do you think I came this far

653
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,927
and endured all those hardships
just to teach her a lesson?

654
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:27,224
You should try to live.
That's what you should do.

655
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,185
That darn money isn't
what's important right now.

656
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,312
That darn money is important.

657
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,357
And don't look down on that money.

658
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,444
It's the least I can do

659
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,613
for having abandoned my own child.

660
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,283
It's a symbol of my regret.

661
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:51,957
My gosh, I don't understand
why I need to listen to this.

662
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,334
I figured it'd be better
to tell you than her.

663
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,044
You're a cop, so I'm sure

664
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,589
you won't get scammed or anything.

665
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,385
Okay, fine. I get it.

666
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,137
Let's just say I understand.

667
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,181
No, wait. I'm not done.

668
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,309
-There are two more.
-"Two more"?

669
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:14,188
Are you determined
to tell me everything today?

670
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,150
My second request is for you to make sure
she gets a medical checkup every year.

671
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:23,530
And here's my third one.
Even if Dongbaek becomes sick

672
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,033
and asks you to break up,

673
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:28,911
don't ever break up.

674
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,873
Pil-gu will be an obstacle,

675
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,292
and so will your family.

676
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,795
But that's nothing.

677
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,881
If you two stay strong,
things will work out.

678
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,177
Even if Dongbaek asks you to break up,

679
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,471
you should stay strong

680
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,516
and wait for her until she's ready.

681
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,483
Ms. Jo, you see,

682
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,695
I'm already destined to do that.

683
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,451
Yong-sik.

684
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,205
My daughter, Dongbaek,

685
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,333
has lived a lonely life

686
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,335
for a long time.

687
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,256
Don't leave her alone.

688
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,800
Don't let her

689
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,469
be alone anymore.

690
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,871
What a life.

691
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,851
I shouldn't have come.

692
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,815
I shouldn't have come to see her.

693
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,362
But now that I have,
I'm starting to want to live.

694
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:38,040
I keep wanting to stay alive.
How am I supposed to die like this?

695
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,635
-Mom!
-Dongbaek.

696
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:56,767
Mom, Aunt Jang-mi's dog, Poppy,
just gave birth to five puppies.

697
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,060
-Really?
-Yes.

698
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,811
Poppy must be happy.

699
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:02,272
No, I bet it's the puppies that are happy.

700
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:05,817
Let's go.

701
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,362
I bet the puppies are happy to be born.

702
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,114
Are you happy to be born as well?

703
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,533
Yes, I'm very happy.

704
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,203
I was also

705
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:17,996
very happy

706
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,750
to have you, Dongbaek.

707
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,402
Where's my mom?

708
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,156
Dongbaek, the thing is...

709
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,454
I need to find my mom.

710
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,640
KBC LIFE INSURANCE

711
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:29,443
We found her in a downtown motel.

712
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,404
I'm sorry.

713
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,990
I was too late.

714
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:51,339
I had bad taste in men.

715
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:56,094
Your father got drunk
and threw a soju glass at me,

716
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,388
but it hit your head and left a scar.

717
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,807
And that's when I went crazy.

718
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,020
So I hit his head with a bottle of soju
and just left the house.

719
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,981
You kept getting bigger,

720
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,776
but I couldn't work
and take care of you at the same time.

721
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,654
Then I was offered a job as a cook
at a nightclub kitchen,

722
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,448
and they let us live in a small room.

723
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:19,326
Hey, that's dirty.
Don't eat leftover food.

724
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,080
It's what my sweetheart was eating.

725
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,541
Then I noticed that you started
calling people "sweetheart."

726
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,584
I told you it hurts!

727
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,920
Say that again

728
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,839
and I'll kill myself.

729
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,801
Why? What's wrong with "sweetheart"?

730
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,763
If you say that one more time,
we'll no longer be able to live together.

731
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,308
I'll sell you off to the briquette vendor.

732
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,018
Do you understand?

733
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,818
I hated that you started
calling people "sweetheart"

734
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:56,321
when you never even
got to say the word "Dad."

735
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,285
Then I even started working as a maid
for the ladies who worked there.

736
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,705
My gosh, Jeong-suk always
takes ages to pay me back.

737
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:09,042
-She's so annoying.
-That darn bitch, Jeong-suk.

738
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,338
You're overdue on my interest as well.

739
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:17,467
I was only 30 and was working so hard
that even my fingerprints had worn out.

740
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,846
But it was still so difficult
to raise a child.

741
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:25,600
Hey, Dongbaek, hurry and grow up
so you can pay off your mom's debt.

742
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,603
I'll get you a nice job once you turn 20.

743
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,899
It'd be quicker for you.
I really can't trust Jeong-suk.

744
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,403
My goodness, look at these cards.

745
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,404
-You bitch.
-My gosh!

746
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:41,158
How dare you say that to my daughter?

747
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,492
You damn bitch.

748
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,537
My gosh, what's wrong with her?

749
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,955
Gosh, that hurts.

750
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,375
I kept running away,
but there was nowhere to go.

751
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:58,258
And because you never got enough to eat,
you'd always tell me that you're hungry.

752
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,761
-Mom.
-Yes?

753
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,138
I want ice cream, too.

754
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,978
My heart broke,
but there was nothing I could do

755
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:14,608
because we never had enough money.

756
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,577
Stop drinking this.

757
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,746
Even now, just seeing it
makes me want to barf.

758
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,415
JOEUN BANK

759
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,799
Mom, I also want to try riding a taxi.

760
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,054
I get carsick easily,
so we can't ride a taxi.

761
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,680
I'm sorry.

762
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,309
Here. Take this.

763
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,729
And don't come back tomorrow, okay?

764
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:01,112
We moved from inn to inn. But one night...

765
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,908
I'm hungry, Mom.

766
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,744
Will you please

767
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,705
stop feeling hungry? Please stop.

768
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,249
It was just one night.

769
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,086
We had to sleep at Seoul Station.

770
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,005
WASHING HANDS CAMPAIGN

771
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,676
And that's when I decided...

772
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:27,013
-Please stop feeling so hungry.
-...to abandon you.

773
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,687
You need to start going to school.

774
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:38,358
If you go to school there,
the school food is going to be free,

775
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,069
and you'll even get clothes
and a school bag.

776
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:46,241
So when you get there,
tell them you're seven years old

777
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:51,371
and that you'd like to go to school
starting from next year.

778
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,041
If they ask you your name,

779
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,584
tell them it's Dongbaek.

780
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,087
Just tell them your name and age.

781
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,341
And if they ask you your mom's name,

782
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,468
tell them you don't know.

783
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,265
You have to do as I say, okay?

784
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:12,600
You fool.

785
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,854
You should've remembered
what I asked you to do.

786
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,356
That's how you'll be able to live here.

787
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,901
I'll come back with a lot of money.

788
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,196
So just wait here for one year, okay?

789
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:27,991
Wait for me.

790
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,660
You understand what I mean, right?

791
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,882
I was a mother who had left her daughter
at an orphanage,

792
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,010
and there was nothing I couldn't do.

793
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:50,388
Hey, get out of here
if you're going to stay quiet.

794
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,098
Just leave!

795
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,518
If you sit there with your mouth zipped
and looking all sad,

796
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,312
who would come here to drink?

797
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,606
At least smile or sing.

798
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:05,236
Hey, get out of here.
Just leave, you bitch!

799
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,573
My gosh, how did I end up
with a girl like you?

800
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:12,702
Don't forget to give me the payment
I gave you in advance, okay?

801
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,913
My gosh, what an annoying bitch.

802
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:39,020
I saw the pink dress

803
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:43,691
Fluttering in the spring wind

804
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:47,904
Today, like any other day

805
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,951
I chew on my coat string

806
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:57,247
And head to the Village Shrine
Where the swallows visit

807
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:06,506
When the flowers bloom, I smile with them

808
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,591
The moment I left you at the orphanage

809
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,637
and picked up that chopstick at that bar,

810
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,474
-And I cry with them
-I was no longer the same Jo Jeong-suk.

811
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:23,064
As we make a promise to each other

812
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:30,029
The spring day slowly leaves

813
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,701
That bitch ran away
as soon as she gathered all our money.

814
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:38,037
All I ever wanted to do was get you back.

815
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,581
What's with her?

816
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,791
My gosh, she really is a tough one.

817
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,626
-My gosh.
-There's nothing to take.

818
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,589
Girls' clothes
aren't even worth that much money.

819
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:48,798
Why would you take them?

820
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,675
-My gosh.
-She's unbelievable.

821
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,760
But poverty was like a monkfish.

822
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:56,181
The more I wanted to get rid of it,
the more it clung onto me.

823
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,602
I could've just ended it
by killing myself,

824
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:04,147
but I couldn't stand not seeing you,
so I went to get you back.

825
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,942
Dongbaek went to L.A.

826
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,154
"L.A."?

827
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,782
Why would she go to L.A.?

828
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,077
Her foster father is a professor
in theology.

829
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,996
And he emigrated to the States with her.

830
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:23,791
He and his wife are both good people
who care a lot about people's welfare.

831
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,711
Dongbaek got really lucky--

832
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:28,588
How can you call that lucky?

833
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,590
Why...

834
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:31,716
Why...

835
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:35,887
Why would you send my daughter away
without asking for my permission?

836
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:37,847
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-Why...

837
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:38,932
But,

838
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:42,810
how could we ask you for permission?
We don't even know you.

839
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,646
You're the one

840
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,731
who left her here.

841
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,275
This isn't a day-care center, you know.

842
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:55,949
You should think of your daughter
rather than yourself.

843
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:01,538
How did she look when she left?

844
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:06,793
Was she happy that she was
getting adopted by a rich family?

845
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,003
She asked me something.

846
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,259
-I have a question.
-Yes?

847
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,053
Can people ride airplanes

848
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:20,181
even though they can't ride taxis?

849
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,830
My gosh, your food is the best.

850
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,292
What motivated you
to do something like that?

851
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,627
-Let's watch something else.
-No, just leave it.

852
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:53,965
I saw a little girl
at an orphanage one day,

853
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,883
and I couldn't stop thinking of her.

854
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,304
And is she really...

855
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:03,016
Yes, she's become an attorney
and a human rights activist

856
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,977
who works and travels
all around the world.

857
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,063
It's like a miracle to us.

858
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,196
Back then,

859
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:22,327
I thought I had made the right choice
of having abandoned you.

860
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,706
I must've startled you.

861
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:34,881
I bought this for 420,000 won
at a department store.

862
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,717
I noticed that you like hats.

863
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,013
Here.

864
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:47,185
I'm not here to ask you for anything.

865
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,730
I just feel really grateful.

866
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,859
And I thought I should do something
to show you my gratitude.

867
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:58,655
If I could have things my way,

868
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,159
I'd even give you ten years of my life.

869
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:06,329
But there's not much I can give you.

870
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,626
Would you like to meet her?

871
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:18,424
My daughter wishes to see you.

872
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,517
Dongbaek.

873
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:29,435
Dongbaek.

874
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,400
How could you forget your own name?

875
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:43,199
Ma'am.

876
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,746
Are you going to look for your daughter?

877
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:54,752
I feel too shameless to do that
at this point.

878
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:59,590
Are you just going to hope
that she's doing well somewhere?

879
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:03,386
I really don't know what to say.

880
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,305
Even if she was lucky and got adopted,

881
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,267
every day would've
felt like a test for her.

882
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:13,271
Other people are loved by their parents
like it's a natural thing,

883
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:16,607
but girls like me
need to work hard for it.

884
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,653
The fact that I was abandoned
by my own mother

885
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:26,159
always made me lose my confidence
and feel insecure.

886
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,330
I tried so hard to be loved
every single day.

887
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:33,624
Because if I didn't,

888
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,878
I knew I'd get sent back
just like your daughter.

889
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:48,181
I couldn't help but wonder
why an adorable girl like you

890
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,267
got sent back to the orphanage.

891
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,688
Please don't ask me that.

892
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:59,609
I'm trying to find my daughter,

893
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,153
so I can't help but wonder why.

894
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:06,240
Why did you send back
the first girl you adopted?

895
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:08,367
It just happened.

896
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:17,835
She had a dark side to her,
so I asked her some questions.

897
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,798
And it turns out
that she was raised at a nightclub.

898
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,467
I think her mom used to work there.

899
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,179
It just made me feel uneasy.

900
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:30,848
They say girls end up
just like their mothers.

901
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:36,270
Our daughter, Mi-yeon,
is a very smart girl.

902
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,397
So I'm guessing her parents were
also smart.

903
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,149
But she was different.

904
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:43,694
The apple really doesn't fall
far from the tree.

905
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:48,407
My goodness!

906
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,409
That damn bitch.

907
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:53,371
Why would Dongbaek end up like me?

908
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,039
Why?

909
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:58,876
Why would that happen?

910
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:07,760
But when I finally found you,

911
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,303
-There you go.
-you were...

912
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,848
We're here!

913
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,808
-You were really running a bar
-Let's go.

914
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,060
as a single mother.

915
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,814
It really seemed as though
you had ended up just like me.

916
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,275
And that really broke my heart.

917
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,867
Aren't you going to talk to me?

918
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,034
Come on.

919
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:33,870
Seriously?

920
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,914
-But once I took a close look...
-Do you like Pil-gu that much?

921
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:40,793
-You'll know once you have a kid.
-You were smiling.

922
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,713
-Sing louder.
-I saw you smiling.

923
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,258
You weren't like me.

924
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,637
I wanted to cook all the meals
I never got to cook for you.

925
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,557
And I wanted to console and comfort you.

926
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:00,354
But you were the one who embraced me.

927
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,066
You gave me

928
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,027
so much warmth.

929
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:13,743
The reason I'm telling you all this

930
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,330
isn't because I want to be forgiven.

931
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,499
It's because I want you to know something.

932
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:36,724
Dongbaek.

933
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:39,518
Don't you want to see her?

934
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:46,901
Dongbaek.

935
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:51,113
There was not a single person
who didn't love you.

936
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:55,159
Forget the seven-year-old
who once got abandoned.

937
01:05:56,869 --> 01:06:00,122
Don't think you lack confidence,
and don't feel intimidated.

938
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,750
Live your life to the fullest.

939
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:06,963
It wasn't just seven years
and three months.

940
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,633
Throughout the past 34 years...

941
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:25,481
I loved you every single day.

942
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:42,581
Mom.

943
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,298
Mom.

944
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:04,603
Mom.

945
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:07,565
Mom.

946
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,537
She needs to stop telling me
she'll give me her kidney

947
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:23,748
so I can stay for longer.

948
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:36,302
Then how about you?

949
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:40,014
How was your 7 years
and 3 months with me?

950
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,266
Me?

951
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,270
How was it?

952
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:49,273
It felt like I was

953
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:53,652
getting my installment savings back.

954
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:56,489
"Installment savings"?

955
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,327
I've lived

956
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:05,998
a very difficult life.

957
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,753
It was so tiring.

958
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:13,714
Life felt like

959
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,384
a punishment to me.

960
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:22,932
But after I got to spend
three more months with you,

961
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,231
I realized that I had stayed alive

962
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:35,444
just so I could finally see you again.

963
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,287
It made up for all the difficult days
I had to go through.

964
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,542
It wasn't good enough for me.

965
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:52,002
But I guess it was for you.

966
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,974
I guess it was only good enough for me.

967
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:51,145
