1
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:23,953
What's taking her so long?

2
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:32,204
Ivy!

3
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:33,635
Ivy!

4
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,890
Ivy!

5
00:01:36,842 --> 00:01:38,848
Grace!

6
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:41,934
- Grace!
- Ivy!

7
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:49,902
- Hi! You're finally here!
- I'm finally here! Grace!

8
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:53,284
It feels like just yesterday,
we were talking about me flying over here.

9
00:01:53,309 --> 00:01:57,401
Oh, I'm so going to tour you
around here in New Zealand!

10
00:01:57,426 --> 00:02:00,731
Of course! I've been wanting
to come here for a long time.

11
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:02,266
At least, I'm here now!

12
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,358
After eight years, right?

13
00:02:04,383 --> 00:02:06,133
We're finally together!

14
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:09,174
Hopefully, you get your working visa soon.

15
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:13,076
Just trust me!

16
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:17,538
- So?
- I don't want to get my hopes up, Grace.

17
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:19,407
I still have to look for a job.

18
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,797
Oh, come on!

19
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,936
You'll get one, for sure!

20
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:26,434
Don't be so negative. Geez!

21
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:30,076
I just don't want to get
my hopes up too much.

22
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:33,107
- You know how it is.
- Ugh, stop being negative. Come on.

23
00:02:33,132 --> 00:02:34,318
Go get your stuff.

24
00:02:34,475 --> 00:02:35,647
Stop being dramatic.

25
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:38,627
- You have to tour me around, okay?
- Of course!

26
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:41,854
We'll explore every
nook and cranny! Let's go!

27
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,615
- Wait, wait.
- So heavy!

28
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:45,360
Sorry!

29
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:47,178
Come on, hurry!

30
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:52,086
Is this really how it is here?

31
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:53,193
Wait, Grace.

32
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:55,279
- Ouch!
- Wait!

33
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,205
- I have to take a picture of the view!
- Sure, go ahead.

34
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,460
It'd be a waste not to.

35
00:02:58,951 --> 00:03:00,851
You're happy to be here, right?

36
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:02,016
Of course, I am.

37
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:03,773
I'm so happy.

38
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,761
I'm happy to be with you.

39
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,836
I can't explain how happy I am right now.

40
00:03:10,861 --> 00:03:13,870
Don't worry. You'll be
seeing a lot of that here!

41
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,844
Wow! It's so beautiful here!

42
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:32,715
Welcome to my home.

43
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:35,151
Well, our home.

44
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,818
I'm sorry.
It's a bit small.

45
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:42,333
I'm the only one here.

46
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:44,247
So that I can save on rent.

47
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:48,656
But now that you're here,
I'll find a bigger one.

48
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:50,242
This place isn't small, Grace!

49
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:52,020
It's pretty huge!

50
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,810
Besides, I don't need a big house.

51
00:03:55,144 --> 00:03:58,433
Besides, I'm not sure if
I'll get a work visa here.

52
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:00,631
I'm just about to look
for a job.

53
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:02,706
You're so negative.

54
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:04,250
You just got here!

55
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:06,327
Oh, Ivy.

56
00:04:06,352 --> 00:04:08,376
I'm sure you'll find one!

57
00:04:09,997 --> 00:04:11,557
Oh, you got that picture printed out?

58
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:15,771
Of course, I did.

59
00:04:16,037 --> 00:04:17,281
It's a nice photo.

60
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:21,271
And, I'm always updated on your posts.

61
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:23,073
You know what?

62
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:27,471
I've been bragging to my co-workers
that you're an amazing photographer.

63
00:04:27,496 --> 00:04:29,606
Grace, I'm embarrassed.

64
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:31,027
What's embarrassing about that?

65
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:32,346
It's true.

66
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:34,192
And, I did say...

67
00:04:34,712 --> 00:04:38,509
One day, you will become
a famous photographer.

68
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:40,252
Grace, that's embarrassing!

69
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:43,652
Who knows what your co-workers
might be saying about me!

70
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:45,760
- I'm not that good!
- Oh, come on!

71
00:04:46,455 --> 00:04:47,771
You're so humble!

72
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,129
Oh!

73
00:04:58,911 --> 00:04:59,911
Hello?

74
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,215
Yes, sir.

75
00:05:03,154 --> 00:05:04,900
Alright. I'll be right there.

76
00:05:05,257 --> 00:05:06,257
See you.

77
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:08,331
That was about work, huh?

78
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,783
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:13,267 --> 00:05:17,106
Sometimes, I get last minute clients.

80
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:18,559
This job of mine...

81
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,694
This is a side job
so that I get paid the full amount.

82
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:25,192
But, I'll make it up to you.

83
00:05:25,217 --> 00:05:26,217
Promise?

84
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:28,365
Promise.

85
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:32,206
And, Grace, it's okay.

86
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,702
That's your job.

87
00:05:33,727 --> 00:05:35,039
It's more important.

88
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:37,826
And, I can handle being alone here.

89
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,670
I'm just going to sleep.
I'm still tired from the flight.

90
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:45,327
- I'm still jet lagged.
- Aw, you're a big girl now!

91
00:05:45,352 --> 00:05:47,658
I feel like crying!

92
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,913
- Are you sure though?
- Mhm.

93
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:52,947
I'll hurry up, so I can
get back early.

94
00:05:52,972 --> 00:05:55,329
Okay, you better!
You promised!

95
00:05:56,513 --> 00:05:57,513
Be careful.

96
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:59,340
Come back soon, okay?

97
00:05:59,705 --> 00:06:02,233
Your room is right there.
Next to my room.

98
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:03,905
- Okay. Thanks.
- Letter I.

99
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:05,147
Yes.

100
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:06,565
Bye-bye.

101
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,590
Bye.

102
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:54,548
Ivy.

103
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:55,722
Wake up!

104
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:58,062
- Ivy?
- Huh?

105
00:09:58,147 --> 00:09:59,579
Are you in the mood to go out?

106
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:02,933
I'm still jet lagged.

107
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,872
Come on, let's go out!

108
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:08,661
- Where are we going?
- To my friend's bar.

109
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:11,089
Didn't I say I would
make it up to you?

110
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:15,017
Let's go.

111
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:18,696
- I'm so tired.
- Please.

112
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:21,721
Let's go?

113
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:23,548
Fine.

114
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:25,313
Okay!

115
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:36,379
This is my friend's bar. Come on!

116
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:39,032
Let's get a table first,
and then I'll look for him.

117
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:40,057
Let's go here.

118
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:43,438
So? Is this place good?

119
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,374
- It's beautiful!
- Right?

120
00:10:46,398 --> 00:10:48,056
I told you!

121
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,293
Wait a minute.
I'll just look for him.

122
00:10:50,452 --> 00:10:51,838
- Stay here.
- Hurry, okay?

123
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:54,712
Yes, just enjoy there, okay?

124
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:17,196
Felix!

125
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:19,349
- Oh, Grace!
- Hi!

126
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,358
Come with me, let me
introduce you to my sister.

127
00:11:29,424 --> 00:11:30,424
Ivy.

128
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:36,541
This is Felix.

129
00:11:36,887 --> 00:11:39,461
He's Filipino, but rich.

130
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,973
But he also manages this bar.

131
00:11:42,097 --> 00:11:44,306
- Felix.
- Ivy.

132
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:46,424
Oh, so you're Ivy.

133
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:47,733
My sister.

134
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:49,707
She's told me all about you.

135
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:51,441
- Apparently, you're a great photographer?
- Felix!

136
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,304
Oh! Hi, Sweet.

137
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:58,176
There he goes again.

138
00:11:58,672 --> 00:12:00,269
I'll just get some drinks.
What do you want?

139
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,519
What do you want?

140
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:03,086
It's up to you, Grace.

141
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,815
It's up to you.

142
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,900
Just know that she can
really handle her alcohol.

143
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:08,969
Okay, okay, wait.

144
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:11,576
Everything good, guys?

145
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:12,956
Are you really just friends?

146
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:14,384
Why?

147
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:17,987
You kiss on the lips,
and you call yourselves just friends?

148
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:19,395
Ah, it's just...

149
00:12:19,453 --> 00:12:21,413
What do you mean? Wait.

150
00:12:21,438 --> 00:12:27,611
- You're not telling me something.
- Let's just say, it's complicated.

151
00:12:28,272 --> 00:12:29,272
Oh, well.

152
00:12:29,784 --> 00:12:30,886
Yeah.

153
00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:32,997
I'm happy here, Grace.

154
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:36,185
Welcome to New Zealand.

155
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:37,732
Thank you.

156
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:39,907
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

157
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:41,445
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

158
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,740
Welcome.

159
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:44,792
Excuse me, guys.
Just a minute.

160
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:47,314
Cheers, Grace!

161
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,400
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

162
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,971
- Yeah.
- Mhm.

163
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:54,505
Hey, what's the matter?

164
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:57,393
- What's wrong?
- Is your boyfriend really like that?

165
00:12:57,478 --> 00:12:58,860
He's close to girls?

166
00:12:59,118 --> 00:13:00,992
Felix is really like that.

167
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:02,558
He's really friendly.

168
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:04,840
That's in line with his job.

169
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:06,411
Getting along with others.

170
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:11,435
Just keep drinking!

171
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:16,853
Thank you.

172
00:13:50,048 --> 00:13:51,048
Oops!

173
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:55,369
- Grace, you're drunk again.
- Come here.

174
00:13:55,394 --> 00:13:57,115
I'm not drunk.

175
00:13:57,768 --> 00:13:59,005
Really now?

176
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:06,762
Here, drink water first.

177
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:08,742
Go on, Ivy. I'll take care
of your sister.

178
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:09,959
Take a rest.

179
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,337
Are you sure?

180
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:12,362
Yes.

181
00:14:12,657 --> 00:14:13,926
This isn't the first time.

182
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,056
She's always like this when she drinks.

183
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,128
She thinks she can handle it,
but with just a few shots,

184
00:14:19,196 --> 00:14:20,290
she's already drunk.

185
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:22,060
Hey, one more, come on.

186
00:14:22,085 --> 00:14:24,684
- One more? Geez.
- That's enough, go to sleep.

187
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:26,462
Alright, I entrust her to you.

188
00:14:26,722 --> 00:14:27,988
- Good night, Ivy.
- Take care of her, okay?

189
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:29,348
- Yep.
- Bye. Good night.

190
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:30,787
- Love you.
- Love you.

191
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,212
Oh, man, we rarely go out too...

192
00:14:36,398 --> 00:14:37,487
- What?
- What?

193
00:14:37,512 --> 00:14:38,512
Do you still want more?

194
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,313
Mhm.

195
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,020
I want more.

196
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,536
Hey, you're awake.

197
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:33,661
I'm cooking breakfast.

198
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:34,727
You can sit down.

199
00:18:34,803 --> 00:18:36,263
No. I'll do it.

200
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,884
No. I'll handle it.

201
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:53,812
- My head hurts.
- You woke up just in time, babe.

202
00:18:54,312 --> 00:18:55,743
I'm almost done cooking.

203
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:57,865
Thanks, babe.

204
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,884
I think I drank too much last night.

205
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,592
You really did.

206
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,107
You have a low tolerance for alcohol,

207
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:09,232
yet you ordered so many drinks.

208
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:11,154
Of course, I'm excited!

209
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:12,274
You're here with me!

210
00:19:12,304 --> 00:19:14,121
We're celebrating your arrival.

211
00:19:14,663 --> 00:19:15,663
Here.

212
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:17,485
Drink some water first.

213
00:19:17,772 --> 00:19:18,772
Thanks, babe.

214
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:25,744
Do you know what's so good about Felix?

215
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,272
He's a great cook.

216
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:29,413
We're lucky.

217
00:19:29,438 --> 00:19:30,587
He's cooking for us.

218
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:34,097
So, what's your plan for today?

219
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:36,452
What do you mean?

220
00:19:37,562 --> 00:19:39,552
Maybe you'd want
for us to tour Ivy around.

221
00:19:40,153 --> 00:19:41,410
The weather is great today.

222
00:19:41,524 --> 00:19:43,314
But, how about you?

223
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,580
Can you do it?

224
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,358
Of course. This is nothing.

225
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:48,312
Besides...

226
00:19:49,432 --> 00:19:50,952
That's a good idea.

227
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,370
So?

228
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,668
Let us tour you around.

229
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,737
So your visit here isn't a waste.

230
00:19:57,015 --> 00:20:00,049
It's fine with me, but...
Are you sure you're okay?

231
00:20:00,276 --> 00:20:02,530
I promise you, I can handle it.

232
00:20:02,582 --> 00:20:04,826
I'll be fine after I drink medicine.

233
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:06,072
Let's go?

234
00:20:08,885 --> 00:20:10,037
Eat first though.

235
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:15,847
Oh, Ivy, I'm so happy!

236
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:17,724
I missed you so much!

237
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:25,105
That's enough!
It's your turn!

238
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,376
- Let me take your picture!
- Come here!

239
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:28,457
- Hurry, Ivy! Let's take a picture!
- Make it nice, okay?

240
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:55,651
Wow! Nice shot!

241
00:21:56,718 --> 00:21:58,620
Your sister is right.

242
00:21:58,645 --> 00:22:00,154
You're a good photographer.

243
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:01,620
Thanks.

244
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:02,700
Where's Grace?

245
00:22:02,725 --> 00:22:03,847
She went to buy food.

246
00:22:03,872 --> 00:22:04,872
Can I?

247
00:22:08,112 --> 00:22:09,207
You know what?

248
00:22:09,351 --> 00:22:11,150
Your sister always tells
stories about you.

249
00:22:11,604 --> 00:22:14,177
She only talks about you
and nothing else.

250
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:18,371
At first, I thought she was
just a very proud sister.

251
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,290
But now that I can see it
with my own eyes, she's right.

252
00:22:22,611 --> 00:22:23,651
You are good.

253
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,246
Have you been a photographer
for a long time?

254
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:26,520
I guess.

255
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:30,205
I'm not really a professional though.

256
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,551
It was just a hobby.

257
00:22:32,605 --> 00:22:34,557
You know what?
You have a gift.

258
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:36,844
Not everyone has an eye
for photography.

259
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:39,693
- Can I ask you something?
- What is it?

260
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:41,726
How long have you been with my sister?

261
00:22:41,978 --> 00:22:43,686
She didn't tell me about you.

262
00:22:44,525 --> 00:22:47,305
Uh, I think it's
been almost a year,

263
00:22:47,752 --> 00:22:49,551
since we started
seeing each other.

264
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:50,903
We met at the bar.

265
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:51,967
Hmm...

266
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,581
It's nothing,
I was just surprised.

267
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:57,430
Because Grace and I
talk about everything.

268
00:22:57,684 --> 00:23:00,376
Suddenly, I learned that
she has a boyfriend.

269
00:23:00,691 --> 00:23:01,749
Boyfriend?

270
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:08,156
- You know what?
- Guys, let's eat.

271
00:23:08,181 --> 00:23:10,260
- I bet you two are hungry!
- Sit here.

272
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:12,377
Thank you!

273
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,047
Thank you, babe.

274
00:23:14,072 --> 00:23:15,841
- Sure.
- Thanks for this.

275
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,704
- It spilled!
- Oh, it spilled!

276
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,764
Oh no!

277
00:23:19,284 --> 00:23:20,964
Wait, let me hold this...

278
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:23,342
- So, is it true?
- What?

279
00:23:23,407 --> 00:23:25,293
- That you already have a girlfriend?
- What?

280
00:23:25,318 --> 00:23:28,407
- Who told you that?
- People. The Filipina girl?

281
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:30,254
What's her name?
She cleans houses?

282
00:23:30,432 --> 00:23:32,907
- Oh, you mean Grace.
- Nah. She's just a friend.

283
00:23:32,932 --> 00:23:35,232
I knew it!
You're fooling my sister.

284
00:23:35,257 --> 00:23:36,745
Felix, who is this?

285
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,116
I'm the sister of the girl
you're talking about.

286
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:42,622
For your information,
cleaning houses is a noble job.

287
00:23:42,647 --> 00:23:44,660
Stop talking down on my sister,
you slut.

288
00:23:44,704 --> 00:23:46,724
Felix, are you gonna
let her talk to me like this?

289
00:23:46,749 --> 00:23:48,709
- Ivy, calm down.
- Calm down?

290
00:23:49,992 --> 00:23:51,065
Ivy.

291
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:52,798
Please.

292
00:23:52,872 --> 00:23:53,938
Enough.

293
00:23:54,097 --> 00:23:55,764
What do you mean enough?

294
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:57,820
This asshole is fooling you!

295
00:23:58,365 --> 00:24:01,399
Ivy, can you just come with me outside?

296
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:03,793
We're not done yet.

297
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,817
Ivy.

298
00:24:05,592 --> 00:24:07,617
I'm sorry for what my sister said.

299
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:09,545
Come here!

300
00:24:09,672 --> 00:24:11,758
- I'm sorry about that.
- That's fine.

301
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:15,904
So...

302
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,276
Would you like
to have fun with me?

303
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,083
Grace, why'd you do that?

304
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:23,298
Why does it seem like
I'm the one at fault?

305
00:24:23,323 --> 00:24:26,539
We should've dragged your
asshole boyfriend, and that slut!

306
00:24:26,564 --> 00:24:27,564
Ivy, please.

307
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,576
You don't understand.

308
00:24:29,854 --> 00:24:33,033
- Can you calm down first?
- What do you mean I don't understand?

309
00:24:33,143 --> 00:24:34,523
It's so clear.

310
00:24:34,629 --> 00:24:37,012
He's just fooling you!

311
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:39,105
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Then what?

312
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,490
- You said...
- It's complicated.

313
00:24:40,515 --> 00:24:42,279
What do you mean?

314
00:24:42,938 --> 00:24:43,938
Look...

315
00:24:44,611 --> 00:24:46,674
We're not exclusive, okay?

316
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:49,587
I agreed that we can
still see other people.

317
00:24:49,612 --> 00:24:51,845
Why did you agree
to that, Grace?

318
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,667
Because you don't understand, Ivy.

319
00:24:56,019 --> 00:24:57,251
I love him.

320
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:58,512
Okay?

321
00:24:58,537 --> 00:25:01,337
It hurts, but I know
what I got myself into.

322
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:04,552
And it's not permanent, Ivy.

323
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:08,333
- Grace!
- I know I can change him.

324
00:25:08,358 --> 00:25:10,607
- What?
- He just needs time.

325
00:25:10,787 --> 00:25:13,826
Grace... Once a cheater,
always a cheater.

326
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:15,739
No matter where you go,

327
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,879
if the person cheats,
they will continue to do so!

328
00:25:17,904 --> 00:25:19,046
Ivy.

329
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:22,063
He loves me.
And I can feel it.

330
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:23,927
What kind of love is that?

331
00:25:24,214 --> 00:25:26,154
He's fooling you
right in front of your face?

332
00:25:26,393 --> 00:25:27,905
I'm old enough, okay?

333
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:29,467
I know what I'm doing.

334
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:30,940
Really now?

335
00:25:31,077 --> 00:25:32,595
You know what you're doing?

336
00:25:32,671 --> 00:25:35,782
Even if it's obvious
that you're hurt!

337
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,690
Ivy.

338
00:27:21,448 --> 00:27:22,448
Hey.

339
00:27:22,938 --> 00:27:24,162
I'm sorry.

340
00:27:25,624 --> 00:27:26,898
Ivy.

341
00:27:27,003 --> 00:27:28,666
Talk to me, please.

342
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:31,642
I'm sorry.

343
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:38,759
Ivy.

344
00:27:39,565 --> 00:27:40,565
Hey.

345
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:43,224
Ivy.

346
00:28:11,264 --> 00:28:13,431
Oh, you're awake.

347
00:28:13,784 --> 00:28:14,984
Here, eat.

348
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,194
- Come on. Let's eat.
- Grace.

349
00:28:19,672 --> 00:28:20,892
I'm sorry.

350
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:22,703
It's okay.

351
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:26,501
And you're right.

352
00:28:27,257 --> 00:28:29,240
I was pretty dumb back then.

353
00:28:29,898 --> 00:28:30,954
No, Grace.

354
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:33,696
I shouldn't have told you that.

355
00:28:34,491 --> 00:28:36,911
I shouldn't have interfered
in your personal life.

356
00:28:37,517 --> 00:28:40,670
I was just hurt that
he did that to you.

357
00:28:42,478 --> 00:28:43,639
Ivy.

358
00:28:46,485 --> 00:28:48,080
I know you're hurt.

359
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,701
But it's okay.

360
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,388
That's how it is.

361
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:54,323
And I'm used to it.

362
00:28:56,565 --> 00:28:57,790
Are you sure?

363
00:28:58,298 --> 00:29:01,400
Because if you're sure,
I'll support you.

364
00:29:02,226 --> 00:29:06,299
But I wish he wouldn't
do it where you can see it.

365
00:29:08,252 --> 00:29:11,515
Are you sure you're okay
with that kind of set-up?

366
00:29:12,225 --> 00:29:13,545
I know he loves me.

367
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,846
I can feel it.

368
00:29:16,985 --> 00:29:19,848
And I believe he'll change.

369
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:21,671
Promise.

370
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,584
Oh!

371
00:29:24,785 --> 00:29:28,077
I have to go, okay?
I'll leave you to it.

372
00:29:28,102 --> 00:29:30,369
- You have work, Grace?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

373
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,480
- Bye, I love you.
- Bye, I love you.

374
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:34,298
Babe.

375
00:31:34,705 --> 00:31:35,705
I'm sorry.

376
00:31:40,151 --> 00:31:41,263
Sorry for what?

377
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:42,717
I know you're mad.

378
00:31:43,098 --> 00:31:45,305
Because I couldn't
answer your calls last night.

379
00:31:46,998 --> 00:31:47,998
Forgive me?

380
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,079
I don't know, Felix.

381
00:31:52,731 --> 00:31:53,731
What do you mean?

382
00:31:54,397 --> 00:31:56,004
Ivy might be right.

383
00:31:56,997 --> 00:31:59,319
I really can't handle this kind of set-up.

384
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:03,728
I can't see you flirting
with other girls.

385
00:32:03,753 --> 00:32:05,490
Babe, listen to me, okay?

386
00:32:06,818 --> 00:32:09,051
I was forced to go out
with that girl last night.

387
00:32:09,965 --> 00:32:11,941
Because she's a potential partner, babe.

388
00:32:13,085 --> 00:32:15,252
She's working with
a famous alcohol brand.

389
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:17,645
I had to do that for the business.

390
00:32:19,651 --> 00:32:20,747
I'm sorry.

391
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:23,978
I won't do that again, okay?

392
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,505
You know, as much as possible,

393
00:32:28,032 --> 00:32:30,392
I try not to see anybody,
except you. Right?

394
00:32:32,632 --> 00:32:33,632
I'm sorry, alright?

395
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:35,517
Please.

396
00:32:43,071 --> 00:32:44,071
Let me carry that.

397
00:33:12,438 --> 00:33:13,438
Ivy.

398
00:33:13,752 --> 00:33:16,001
By the way, I'm with Felix.

399
00:33:16,991 --> 00:33:17,991
I can see that.

400
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:21,577
Sorry. I didn't tell you
that he's coming here.

401
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,285
Grace, you don't have
to ask permission from me.

402
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,703
This is your apartment.

403
00:33:26,795 --> 00:33:29,794
I told you, right?
It's okay with me.

404
00:33:32,173 --> 00:33:33,173
Hi, Ivy.

405
00:33:33,992 --> 00:33:34,992
Hi.

406
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,789
- Excuse me, I'll just edit some photos.
- Sure.

407
00:33:39,078 --> 00:33:40,448
Would you like some coffee?

408
00:33:40,566 --> 00:33:41,566
Yeah, sure.

409
00:33:41,591 --> 00:33:42,591
I'll just make it.

410
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:54,568
Wow, you're really good.

411
00:34:00,732 --> 00:34:04,122
You know what? I need new publication
materials for the bar's social media.

412
00:34:05,521 --> 00:34:07,974
Is it okay to hire you
as a photographer?

413
00:34:09,728 --> 00:34:12,110
- Me?
- Yeah, I told you I like your photos.

414
00:34:12,228 --> 00:34:13,656
So? Are you down?

415
00:34:14,628 --> 00:34:15,997
It's just a one-day shoot.

416
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:17,755
Ivy.

417
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,382
Accept the job.
Don't waste the opportunity.

418
00:34:21,481 --> 00:34:24,887
I'm sure Felix will pay you a lot.

419
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:27,052
- Right, babe?
- Yeah, of course.

420
00:34:27,095 --> 00:34:28,333
I'll pay generously.

421
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:31,792
So?

422
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,291
It'd be a waste
to say no!

423
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:22,561
Babe, I have to go.
I have a job to do.

424
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:24,782
Ivy, will you be fine here?

425
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:27,419
I'm sorry I forgot
to tell you.

426
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:28,686
Grace, I'll be fine.

427
00:37:28,984 --> 00:37:30,451
- Babe.
- Go on, babe.

428
00:37:30,476 --> 00:37:32,614
I'll take care of Ivy.
I'll bring her home later.

429
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:34,314
- Thank you.
- Go on.

430
00:37:37,478 --> 00:37:39,626
Felix, can you check
if these photos are good?

431
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:49,034
Yeah, they look so good.

432
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:51,165
Better than I expected!

433
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:53,917
I didn't make a mistake hiring you.

434
00:37:56,105 --> 00:38:00,107
Because of that, how about
I make you a new drink?

435
00:38:00,292 --> 00:38:02,599
- New?
- Yup. It isn't on the menu yet.

436
00:38:02,678 --> 00:38:04,272
It's something that I've been working on.

437
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:06,062
I'd like your opinion on it.

438
00:38:06,707 --> 00:38:07,707
Okay, sure.

439
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:08,901
Just a sec.

440
00:38:21,408 --> 00:38:22,408
Here.

441
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,558
- What's that?
- Green Mamba.

442
00:38:27,115 --> 00:38:28,166
It's good!

443
00:38:33,637 --> 00:38:35,565
- You sure?
- Yeah. Try it.

444
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:43,228
It's good!

445
00:38:43,253 --> 00:38:44,342
Sweet, right?

446
00:38:44,749 --> 00:38:46,238
Did you really make this?

447
00:38:46,304 --> 00:38:48,250
Of course.
Why don't you believe me?

448
00:38:48,338 --> 00:38:49,338
Oh, nothing.

449
00:38:51,232 --> 00:38:53,581
I started doing that back
in the Philippines.

450
00:38:54,391 --> 00:38:56,206
My uncle drank a lot.

451
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,260
I've been drinking with him
since I was young.

452
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:01,352
When did you start?

453
00:39:01,658 --> 00:39:05,436
I was only 11 when we started drinking.

454
00:39:06,072 --> 00:39:09,726
I left the Philippines
when I was 14.

455
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:17,126
So, is he the reason why
you chose to manage the bar?

456
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:18,809
I think.

457
00:39:19,185 --> 00:39:20,226
I mean...

458
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:22,142
What is this?
A Q&A?

459
00:39:22,847 --> 00:39:24,318
Why not?

460
00:39:24,343 --> 00:39:26,949
I just want to know
my sister's "boyfriend" better.

461
00:39:27,113 --> 00:39:29,078
Okay, fine. What else
do you want to know?

462
00:39:29,414 --> 00:39:30,842
Hmm...

463
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:32,754
How long have you been
here in New Zealand?

464
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:34,833
We moved here when I was 14.

465
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:39,250
So, maybe, it's been about 12 years.

466
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:40,867
Why did you choose to live here?

467
00:39:41,225 --> 00:39:42,758
You really have a lot of questions.

468
00:39:43,471 --> 00:39:46,744
My mom used to work here as an OFW.

469
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:49,193
Then she met my stepdad.

470
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,104
So, she married him.

471
00:39:51,234 --> 00:39:52,313
Then she brought me here.

472
00:39:52,511 --> 00:39:53,511
Really?

473
00:39:53,885 --> 00:39:55,613
Your mom is so lucky.

474
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:57,156
Your stepdad adopted you.

475
00:39:57,552 --> 00:39:59,091
My stepdad is a good person.

476
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:01,419
He even funded my studies.

477
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,582
That's why, I worked hard.

478
00:40:06,345 --> 00:40:09,581
So that I can make it up to him
for everything he did for my mom and me.

479
00:40:11,364 --> 00:40:15,163
But, three years ago, he died.

480
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,479
Sorry.

481
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,880
No, it's okay.

482
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:19,564
My mom is a little sad.

483
00:40:20,758 --> 00:40:23,638
But, we're okay now.

484
00:40:24,831 --> 00:40:28,331
It helps that we're both busy.

485
00:40:29,629 --> 00:40:33,873
Because the insurance that went to my mom
when my stepdad died was a lot.

486
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,880
We used that money to
set up small businesses,

487
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,080
including this bar.

488
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,319
What?

489
00:40:40,365 --> 00:40:42,432
I thought you're just a manager here.

490
00:40:42,457 --> 00:40:43,822
So you're the boss!

491
00:40:49,518 --> 00:40:50,584
I'm sorry.

492
00:40:50,805 --> 00:40:51,805
Sorry for what?

493
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:53,927
About the other day.

494
00:40:57,086 --> 00:40:58,299
I like Grace.

495
00:40:58,578 --> 00:41:01,791
But our set-up has been clear
to her from the very beginning.

496
00:41:02,899 --> 00:41:03,899
You know what?

497
00:41:04,771 --> 00:41:06,531
We already talked about it.

498
00:41:06,556 --> 00:41:08,477
And I won't meddle
in your personal life.

499
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:12,671
Sorry for yelling
at the girl before.

500
00:41:13,052 --> 00:41:14,398
It's okay, don't worry.

501
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:17,540
If you're not ready
for a commitment,

502
00:41:18,022 --> 00:41:20,002
Then, why don't you
stop seeing my sister?

503
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,244
I don't know.

504
00:41:22,024 --> 00:41:23,093
I'm a jerk, right?

505
00:41:25,877 --> 00:41:28,320
Grace is a good person,
yet I keep hurting her.

506
00:41:28,925 --> 00:41:30,495
I know this isn't an excuse.

507
00:41:30,785 --> 00:41:33,778
But, my mom and I
are handling a lot of businesses.

508
00:41:34,972 --> 00:41:36,592
So, I can't commit yet.

509
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:41,614
And, it's only been a few years
since my stepdad died.

510
00:41:43,531 --> 00:41:45,145
I don't want to leave my mom.

511
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:48,313
If the time comes
when you're ready to commit,

512
00:41:49,103 --> 00:41:52,797
do you find yourself
settling down with my sister?

513
00:41:54,124 --> 00:41:55,160
That's enough.

514
00:41:57,178 --> 00:41:59,599
Our conversation is
getting too heavy.

515
00:41:59,678 --> 00:42:01,376
You might start yelling at me again.

516
00:42:01,511 --> 00:42:03,465
There's no bouncer here.

517
00:42:03,658 --> 00:42:05,088
I can't stop you, you know.

518
00:42:05,113 --> 00:42:07,750
I'm a small girl.
Do you need a bouncer?

519
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:08,860
Of course, I do.

520
00:42:08,885 --> 00:42:11,921
Just the other day, your rage
could match the Incredible Hulk.

521
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:14,614
Your vein there. There! There!

522
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:16,686
It was so close to popping!

523
00:42:16,711 --> 00:42:18,254
Wow, seriously?

524
00:42:20,898 --> 00:42:23,673
Hey, you keep taking pictures of me.

525
00:42:23,698 --> 00:42:25,578
- Let me take a picture of you!
- Stop it!

526
00:42:25,603 --> 00:42:28,471
- No! Wait!
- Let me! Come on!

527
00:42:28,496 --> 00:42:30,047
Come on, let me try.

528
00:42:30,072 --> 00:42:31,302
- Let me try.
- Just a sec!

529
00:42:31,327 --> 00:42:33,221
- I'm not done yet!
- Let me try!

530
00:42:33,246 --> 00:42:35,513
- Come on, let me take your picture.
- Wait, wait! No, wait.

531
00:42:37,571 --> 00:42:39,623
Smile.

532
00:42:39,716 --> 00:42:42,284
- [Ivy laughing]
- My turn, let me take your photo.

533
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,581
You look good in the pictures I took!

534
00:42:44,902 --> 00:42:46,799
The ones I took!

535
00:42:47,404 --> 00:42:48,724
What do you mean?

536
00:45:46,766 --> 00:45:48,813
Oh, Ivy!
You're awake. Let's eat.

537
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:53,063
- Felix.
- Ivy, you're awake already?

538
00:45:54,398 --> 00:45:56,579
Babe, how were the shots, by the way?

539
00:45:57,383 --> 00:45:59,010
- Was it okay?
- Mhm!

540
00:45:59,366 --> 00:46:00,472
I was really amazed.

541
00:46:00,497 --> 00:46:01,717
Her shots were so good.

542
00:46:02,479 --> 00:46:03,479
Really?

543
00:46:03,913 --> 00:46:06,712
I told you, you could do it!

544
00:46:09,044 --> 00:46:10,167
Did you enjoy?

545
00:46:11,865 --> 00:46:13,567
You'll get a lot more opportunities soon!

546
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:18,079
Babe, I have to go.
I have a meeting in a while.

547
00:46:20,058 --> 00:46:21,069
See you later.

548
00:46:21,185 --> 00:46:22,185
Take care.

549
00:46:26,398 --> 00:46:29,070
So, do you have
any plans today?

550
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:30,301
What?

551
00:46:31,216 --> 00:46:33,100
Come on. Let's go out!

552
00:46:33,815 --> 00:46:37,826
I realized that we haven't
spent time together, just us.

553
00:46:38,342 --> 00:46:40,432
Felix is always with us.

554
00:46:42,408 --> 00:46:43,889
Okay, where are we going?

555
00:46:43,915 --> 00:46:45,197
It's a surprise.

556
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:48,463
Go take a shower.
I'll just get dressed, okay?

557
00:46:49,642 --> 00:46:50,642
See you.

558
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:06,358
You know what?

559
00:47:06,544 --> 00:47:09,683
This is my favorite spot here.

560
00:47:10,258 --> 00:47:11,560
Look.

561
00:47:11,834 --> 00:47:13,153
It's quiet.

562
00:47:13,585 --> 00:47:15,208
The lake makes you feel relaxed.

563
00:47:16,384 --> 00:47:20,559
That's why sometimes,
when I feel overwhelmed,

564
00:47:21,058 --> 00:47:25,668
I come here so that I can take
a break even for a little while.

565
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:28,693
You're right, Grace.

566
00:47:28,718 --> 00:47:29,718
It's beautiful here.

567
00:47:31,278 --> 00:47:38,484
But, you know, to be honest,
sometimes, it's really hard.

568
00:47:39,247 --> 00:47:40,848
Especially the first time I was here.

569
00:47:41,138 --> 00:47:43,683
It was more expensive here
compared to the Philippines.

570
00:47:43,857 --> 00:47:46,715
And I didn't know any
other Filipinos here.

571
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:51,524
That's why I really wasn't sure
if I could handle it here.

572
00:47:52,278 --> 00:47:58,298
But I told myself, I need
to do this for the two of us.

573
00:47:58,952 --> 00:48:01,302
And now you're here, Ivy.

574
00:48:01,437 --> 00:48:04,463
I'm so happy that you're here now.

575
00:48:05,238 --> 00:48:06,484
Thank you, Grace.

576
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:09,648
For everything you've done for me.

577
00:48:10,606 --> 00:48:14,448
When I was in the Philippines,
you always sent me half of your salary.

578
00:48:15,043 --> 00:48:17,103
Even if we're not really siblings.

579
00:48:18,085 --> 00:48:19,353
Oh, come on.

580
00:48:19,778 --> 00:48:23,968
In families, there's
no halves, or wholes.

581
00:48:24,772 --> 00:48:26,353
Family is family.

582
00:48:26,378 --> 00:48:27,378
Okay?

583
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:33,290
Also, it's not important to me
that we have different mothers.

584
00:48:33,753 --> 00:48:36,245
I owe a lot to Auntie.

585
00:48:36,343 --> 00:48:40,578
Because, since mom died,
your family adopted me.

586
00:48:41,735 --> 00:48:43,759
Not everyone can do that.

587
00:48:44,144 --> 00:48:49,201
That's why now, I'm working hard,
so I can repay you.

588
00:48:49,951 --> 00:48:51,265
Yeah...

589
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:53,420
I'm really nervous.

590
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:55,511
Just a little bit more.

591
00:48:56,326 --> 00:48:57,707
Just a little bit more.

592
00:48:57,732 --> 00:49:01,671
And we'll fulfill our dream
of living here together.

593
00:49:04,945 --> 00:49:05,976
You know what?

594
00:49:06,133 --> 00:49:07,688
I'm really nervous.

595
00:49:08,052 --> 00:49:09,052
Why?

596
00:49:09,224 --> 00:49:12,397
Because I might not get a job.

597
00:49:13,487 --> 00:49:15,064
Stop being negative!

598
00:49:15,274 --> 00:49:17,118
You'll find one, for sure!

599
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:20,019
And Felix is there, if ever.

600
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:22,401
Huh?

601
00:49:22,898 --> 00:49:25,549
He has a lot of connections.

602
00:49:25,911 --> 00:49:30,474
Well, if you don't have a choice,
get married to him.

603
00:49:33,084 --> 00:49:35,001
Oh, come on, I was kidding.

604
00:49:35,491 --> 00:49:37,461
Well, half joke.

605
00:49:38,772 --> 00:49:40,724
He's already a citizen here.

606
00:49:40,805 --> 00:49:43,354
Instead of us looking
for a foreigner here.

607
00:49:45,924 --> 00:49:47,477
Isn't he your boyfriend?

608
00:49:47,831 --> 00:49:50,767
Well, you're only getting
married on paper anyways.

609
00:50:20,278 --> 00:50:21,278
Ivy!

610
00:50:23,138 --> 00:50:24,138
Ivy!

611
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,430
What's up? Why're you jogging?

612
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:33,030
Nothing. I just
wanted to get some air.

613
00:50:36,675 --> 00:50:38,314
Why didn't you tell Grace?

614
00:50:38,875 --> 00:50:39,875
About what?

615
00:50:40,715 --> 00:50:42,121
About what happened to us.

616
00:50:42,322 --> 00:50:43,905
Why? Do you want me to tell her?

617
00:50:45,328 --> 00:50:46,837
I'm serious.

618
00:50:47,221 --> 00:50:48,512
I'm serious, too.

619
00:50:48,774 --> 00:50:50,246
Do you want me to tell her?

620
00:50:50,688 --> 00:50:52,022
I'm easy to talk to.

621
00:50:54,295 --> 00:50:55,295
You know what?

622
00:50:55,507 --> 00:50:57,127
You're acting like
it's nothing to you.

623
00:50:58,441 --> 00:50:59,721
Ivy, what are you talking about?

624
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:01,549
I'm serious.

625
00:51:01,755 --> 00:51:03,359
Do you want me to tell her?

626
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,222
Okay, fine. I'll tell her.

627
00:51:05,643 --> 00:51:06,804
Should I call her right now?

628
00:51:06,948 --> 00:51:08,704
Why are you acting like that?

629
00:51:09,142 --> 00:51:10,752
Do you really not care about me?

630
00:51:10,828 --> 00:51:11,828
Or my sister?

631
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:13,869
Just because you think
you're just fuck buddies?

632
00:51:14,267 --> 00:51:17,349
I didn't tell Grace because
I know she'll get hurt.

633
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,201
Is that what you want to happen?

634
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:31,048
Yes, sir.

635
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:33,355
Yeah.

636
00:51:34,422 --> 00:51:35,422
Yes.

637
00:51:36,387 --> 00:51:37,616
So, how much is that, sir?

638
00:51:40,663 --> 00:51:42,112
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

639
00:51:42,668 --> 00:51:44,443
Alright. Alright, sir.
Thank you.

640
00:51:44,702 --> 00:51:45,702
Yeah, see you later.

641
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:48,875
Where's Grace?

642
00:51:49,008 --> 00:51:50,008
She has work.

643
00:51:52,815 --> 00:51:53,815
Do you want me to go?

644
00:51:54,934 --> 00:51:55,934
No, it's okay.

645
00:54:50,768 --> 00:54:52,502
Grace, I need to talk to you.

646
00:54:52,762 --> 00:54:55,669
- Hmm?
- Felix, you're here.

647
00:54:55,924 --> 00:54:57,706
- Mmm...
- So, you were together...

648
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:59,606
- Yeah.
- He fetched me at work.

649
00:54:59,677 --> 00:55:00,770
Of course, babe.

650
00:55:00,795 --> 00:55:03,011
- You like it better that way, right?
- Mhm.

651
00:55:08,876 --> 00:55:10,390
What were you saying, by the way?

652
00:55:11,187 --> 00:55:13,376
- It's nothing.
- Are you sure?

653
00:55:13,401 --> 00:55:14,401
Did you eat?

654
00:55:14,947 --> 00:55:17,154
- I cooked earlier.
- Did you guys eat?

655
00:55:17,455 --> 00:55:18,455
- Mhm.
- Mhm.

656
00:55:35,426 --> 00:55:38,139
Oh my god, Ivy.
This is it!

657
00:55:38,164 --> 00:55:41,112
- I feel like you got the job!
- Let's check.

658
00:55:43,101 --> 00:55:44,101
What?

659
00:55:50,571 --> 00:55:51,571
Rejected?

660
00:55:53,112 --> 00:55:54,112
Huh?

661
00:55:54,545 --> 00:55:56,065
No, try the others.

662
00:55:56,397 --> 00:55:59,604
And, that company is also bad.

663
00:56:00,124 --> 00:56:01,932
Open the other emails.
I'm sure there's more.

664
00:56:11,297 --> 00:56:13,406
That's all of it.
All rejected.

665
00:56:17,027 --> 00:56:18,150
Come on, Ivy.

666
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:20,524
There's more, for sure.

667
00:56:20,986 --> 00:56:22,726
And, there's a lot of tourists here.

668
00:56:22,751 --> 00:56:25,221
So, for sure, there's a lot of hiring here.

669
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,014
We can do this, okay?

670
00:56:28,254 --> 00:56:29,698
I don't know...

671
00:56:30,668 --> 00:56:32,664
Don't be so negative.

672
00:56:33,468 --> 00:56:35,421
That's just a setback.

673
00:56:35,874 --> 00:56:37,254
There's a lot more, okay?

674
00:56:39,922 --> 00:56:41,626
I want to be alone.

675
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:43,294
Cool off...

676
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:20,704
Babe, I found her.

677
00:57:22,324 --> 00:57:23,924
Okay, I'll drop her off there.

678
00:57:25,285 --> 00:57:26,285
Bye.

679
00:57:37,476 --> 00:57:39,050
What are you doing here?

680
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,843
Did my sister call you?

681
00:57:41,575 --> 00:57:42,950
Grace is worried about you.

682
00:57:44,288 --> 00:57:46,363
I just need some air,
and some time to think.

683
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:47,850
You can go.

684
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:49,459
You don't have to watch over me.

685
00:57:50,521 --> 00:57:51,521
Okay.

686
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:53,409
What do you mean, okay?

687
00:57:54,015 --> 00:57:55,015
I'll stay here.

688
00:57:56,745 --> 00:58:00,265
You don't have to watch me.
I can take care of myself.

689
00:58:00,921 --> 00:58:03,455
Why? Who told you
that I'm watching over you?

690
00:58:03,948 --> 00:58:06,283
Am I not allowed to relax here?

691
00:58:10,004 --> 00:58:11,256
Come on, Ivy.

692
00:58:13,098 --> 00:58:14,391
It's just a job.

693
00:58:15,585 --> 00:58:17,093
It's not the end of the world.

694
00:58:19,892 --> 00:58:20,892
You know what?

695
00:58:20,917 --> 00:58:23,740
You can say that because
your life is nice here.

696
00:58:28,281 --> 00:58:29,281
Sorry.

697
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:30,881
You're right.

698
00:58:31,915 --> 00:58:33,335
It's not my place to say it.

699
00:58:36,497 --> 00:58:38,185
You know, Felix.

700
00:58:40,135 --> 00:58:42,310
Grace and I have been
dreaming about this for so long.

701
00:58:43,628 --> 00:58:45,418
To live here in New Zealand.

702
00:58:46,683 --> 00:58:49,237
Grace did everything
to make it happen.

703
00:58:49,881 --> 00:58:51,065
But me?

704
00:58:51,521 --> 00:58:54,682
I can't even find a job here.

705
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:58,248
That's how it is at first.

706
00:58:59,128 --> 00:59:00,128
It's hard.

707
00:59:04,054 --> 00:59:05,054
But you know what?

708
00:59:06,341 --> 00:59:08,624
Your sister went through a lot worse.

709
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,149
Do you think that...

710
00:59:11,456 --> 00:59:14,162
She would remain a cleaner
if she didn't get a lot of offers?

711
00:59:14,441 --> 00:59:15,520
Exactly.

712
00:59:16,216 --> 00:59:18,523
She endured and sacrificed a lot.

713
00:59:18,976 --> 00:59:20,743
But I can't repay her.

714
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:22,595
Why? Is she asking you
to do that?

715
00:59:22,656 --> 00:59:25,130
- No.
- Oh, so, she isn't asking for anything.

716
00:59:26,221 --> 00:59:29,264
Ivy, it's just a job.

717
00:59:29,629 --> 00:59:33,460
If you weren't successful today,
just try again.

718
00:59:34,728 --> 00:59:36,701
Nobody gets the jackpot
on their first try.

719
00:59:37,789 --> 00:59:38,789
I don't know.

720
00:59:39,581 --> 00:59:41,226
I just feel useless.

721
00:59:42,635 --> 00:59:43,883
You're not useless.

722
00:59:45,255 --> 00:59:46,335
You're just a human being,

723
00:59:47,062 --> 00:59:48,742
succumbing to the pressure.

724
00:59:51,567 --> 00:59:52,835
Honestly, you're lucky.

725
00:59:53,008 --> 00:59:56,132
Because your sister is there to help you.

726
01:00:06,642 --> 01:00:08,683
You know, Ivy...

727
01:00:10,021 --> 01:00:12,458
You're a beautiful
and talented person.

728
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:15,361
There's a job for you out there.

729
01:00:16,261 --> 01:00:18,032
I can feel it.

730
01:00:20,688 --> 01:00:23,935
Don't let one simple setback,

731
01:00:24,552 --> 01:00:27,045
ruin you and your sister's dream
of living here together.

732
01:00:30,817 --> 01:00:32,124
I know what you can do.

733
01:00:38,355 --> 01:00:39,355
That's enough.

734
01:00:56,438 --> 01:00:57,438
Ivy.

735
01:00:59,432 --> 01:01:02,279
Babe, thank you for being with her.

736
01:01:03,372 --> 01:01:04,452
Ivy.

737
01:01:07,681 --> 01:01:08,681
Why?

738
01:01:11,081 --> 01:01:12,865
Grace, I'm sorry.

739
01:01:13,028 --> 01:01:14,440
Sorry for what?

740
01:01:15,746 --> 01:01:18,756
- Because I'm a failure.
- No.

741
01:01:20,088 --> 01:01:21,703
That's not true, okay?

742
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,018
But what about...

743
01:01:32,846 --> 01:01:37,143
What about our dream
of living here together,

744
01:01:37,168 --> 01:01:40,121
if I can't find a job?

745
01:01:40,388 --> 01:01:43,264
Then we'll find some other ways.

746
01:01:43,427 --> 01:01:44,427
Okay?

747
01:01:44,748 --> 01:01:47,805
As long as we're together,
we can find a way.

748
01:01:48,716 --> 01:01:53,233
If I have to ask everybody I know,
I'll do it.

749
01:01:58,956 --> 01:02:00,993
If we have no choice,

750
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:02,875
then...

751
01:02:03,395 --> 01:02:05,354
Just marry Felix.

752
01:10:19,467 --> 01:10:21,713
Felix, I'm starting to feel guilty.

753
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:25,425
About what? This thing we're doing?

754
01:10:25,952 --> 01:10:26,952
Yes.

755
01:10:28,071 --> 01:10:30,908
You and Grace have something going on,
yet we're doing this.

756
01:10:32,105 --> 01:10:33,465
Do you want me to stop?

757
01:10:34,825 --> 01:10:35,865
I don't know.

758
01:10:36,251 --> 01:10:37,311
Just tell me.

759
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,327
I thought you're feeling guilty?

760
01:10:39,624 --> 01:10:40,674
I don't know.

761
01:10:41,851 --> 01:10:45,027
But I think I like what we're doing.

762
01:10:47,851 --> 01:10:48,891
I think...

763
01:10:49,491 --> 01:10:50,986
I'm starting to like you.

764
01:10:55,798 --> 01:10:56,798
Me too.

765
01:10:57,938 --> 01:10:58,938
Huh?

766
01:11:01,078 --> 01:11:03,125
I said I'm starting to like you too.

767
01:11:04,205 --> 01:11:05,205
No.

768
01:11:05,858 --> 01:11:07,399
This can't be.

769
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:10,327
We like each other.
What's wrong with that?

770
01:11:10,611 --> 01:11:12,662
You shouldn't be saying that to me.

771
01:11:12,888 --> 01:11:14,528
You should be saying that to Grace.

772
01:11:14,553 --> 01:11:18,176
- We should stop whatever this is.
- Ivy, you're the one I like.

773
01:11:22,468 --> 01:11:23,789
Not Grace.

774
01:11:26,508 --> 01:11:28,120
I was forced to like her.

775
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,983
How will we tell Grace?

776
01:11:38,418 --> 01:11:39,418
I don't know.

777
01:11:44,185 --> 01:11:45,185
Can we...

778
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,980
not tell her yet?

779
01:11:48,332 --> 01:11:50,477
I'll just look for the perfect timing.

780
01:12:13,783 --> 01:12:14,872
Hello, Ivy.

781
01:12:15,578 --> 01:12:16,578
Hello, Grace.

782
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:18,558
I might get home late.

783
01:12:18,699 --> 01:12:22,153
I have to go to the grocery store
to buy our dinner.

784
01:12:22,411 --> 01:12:24,831
- Will you be fine there?
- Yes, Grace.

785
01:12:24,856 --> 01:12:27,832
Sure, I'll be fine.
Don't worry about me.

786
01:12:28,018 --> 01:12:30,656
Sure I'm almost done here anyways.

787
01:12:30,905 --> 01:12:34,452
- I'll text you when I get home.
- Bye-bye.

788
01:12:34,778 --> 01:12:36,352
Bye. See you.

789
01:12:56,248 --> 01:12:57,277
Hey, Grace.

790
01:12:57,302 --> 01:12:59,342
This is your payment for your service.

791
01:12:59,969 --> 01:13:03,432
- Wow! Thank you, ma'am.
- You're welcome, and see you next time.

792
01:13:04,202 --> 01:13:05,202
Okay.

793
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:49,131
Ivy, good news! My client
gave me a huge tip!

794
01:14:49,156 --> 01:14:52,936
Let's just have dinner outside,
I'll fetch you in a bit.

795
01:15:33,201 --> 01:15:34,201
Oh!

796
01:15:37,508 --> 01:15:38,952
- Grace.
- Grace!

797
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:04,167
Grace, please let me explain.

798
01:16:04,424 --> 01:16:06,418
- Explain what?
- Grace! Please!

799
01:16:06,443 --> 01:16:07,491
That you're seeing my boyfriend

800
01:16:07,516 --> 01:16:08,524
- behind my back?
- Grace!

801
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:09,892
Grace, listen to us first.

802
01:16:09,917 --> 01:16:11,679
- Listen?
- Felix, stop!

803
01:16:11,704 --> 01:16:13,174
You have the audacity
to ask me to listen?

804
01:16:14,149 --> 01:16:16,171
You two are fooling me
behind my back!

805
01:16:16,196 --> 01:16:18,522
- Grace, we didn't mean for this to happen.
- No! No!

806
01:16:18,547 --> 01:16:20,275
- What are you saying?
- Grace!

807
01:16:20,897 --> 01:16:24,007
- I saw you two having sex!
- Please!

808
01:16:24,032 --> 01:16:26,957
- Grace, listen to us first.
- Grace, I love Ivy.

809
01:16:28,521 --> 01:16:29,584
What?

810
01:16:31,889 --> 01:16:32,967
You love her?

811
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,175
Grace.

812
01:16:36,115 --> 01:16:37,676
Screw you!

813
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:39,429
Get out of here!

814
01:16:39,848 --> 01:16:42,011
- Grace, please.
- I don't want to see you again.

815
01:16:42,036 --> 01:16:44,266
- Grace, please stop!
- Stop touching me!

816
01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:48,430
What?

817
01:16:50,048 --> 01:16:52,236
- Get out of here!
- Grace.

818
01:16:52,514 --> 01:16:55,549
I don't want to ever see you!

819
01:16:56,783 --> 01:16:58,169
That's enough, Grace.

820
01:16:58,233 --> 01:17:00,521
- Please listen to me.
- Ivy, stop it!

821
01:17:01,107 --> 01:17:04,936
- Please listen to me, Grace!
- Why would I do that?

822
01:17:04,961 --> 01:17:07,355
I saw you two with my own eyes!

823
01:17:08,091 --> 01:17:13,867
- I saw how you were fooling me!
- Grace! Just let me explain!

824
01:17:14,345 --> 01:17:16,354
- Shit!
- I didn't mean for that to happen.

825
01:17:16,379 --> 01:17:18,789
- Please believe me, Grace!
- Then what?

826
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:23,238
- You're really just a flirt? Is that it?
- Grace! No!

827
01:17:23,263 --> 01:17:26,588
- Damn it, you really...
- Grace, it isn't like that!

828
01:17:26,613 --> 01:17:31,128
You even asked me why I was
letting Felix walk all over me?

829
01:17:31,153 --> 01:17:33,542
- Let me explain! Please!
- What?

830
01:17:33,797 --> 01:17:36,436
- What will you even try to explain?
- Grace...

831
01:17:36,654 --> 01:17:39,633
I don't know. We didn't
want for this to happen.

832
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:41,617
- I didn't want this to happen!
- God damn it!

833
01:17:42,245 --> 01:17:45,378
- I'm not as stupid as you think I am!
- Please believe me!

834
01:17:45,403 --> 01:17:48,004
- Grace, I really tried!
- I'm not blind!

835
01:17:48,031 --> 01:17:49,604
Damn it!

836
01:17:49,696 --> 01:17:52,732
At first, I really just
wanted to break you two off!

837
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:56,881
Because I didn't want to see
Felix blatantly fooling you.

838
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:57,938
Oh?

839
01:17:58,328 --> 01:18:01,802
So it's okay if you're the reason
for him to hurt me?

840
01:18:01,834 --> 01:18:04,450
- So, is that how it is?
- Grace...

841
01:18:04,701 --> 01:18:09,208
- Grace, I didn't mean that...
- Damn you, Ivy!

842
01:18:10,537 --> 01:18:13,163
It isn't like that.
Please believe me, Grace.

843
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:17,517
So, if my boyfriend's side chick
is my sister, it's okay?

844
01:18:18,088 --> 01:18:19,088
Huh?

845
01:18:19,614 --> 01:18:20,984
You're really something!

846
01:18:22,669 --> 01:18:24,982
Shit! I told you, didn't I?

847
01:18:26,688 --> 01:18:28,750
I told you!

848
01:18:29,353 --> 01:18:32,139
- Grace...
- Shit, I was hoping...

849
01:18:32,164 --> 01:18:34,763
I was hoping that he would change
because I love him.

850
01:18:34,788 --> 01:18:36,356
Grace, please.

851
01:18:36,844 --> 01:18:38,158
Damn it!

852
01:18:39,343 --> 01:18:40,850
Grace, please!

853
01:18:59,404 --> 01:19:05,041
I'm sorry, Grace! I'm sorry!

854
01:19:07,065 --> 01:19:09,731
I'm so stupid!

855
01:19:10,195 --> 01:19:12,806
Grace...

856
01:19:17,164 --> 01:19:21,203
I'm sorry, Grace! I'm sorry!

857
01:19:56,763 --> 01:19:58,476
Shit!

858
01:19:58,774 --> 01:20:01,094
Damn it!

859
01:20:01,901 --> 01:20:04,660
God damn it!

860
01:21:16,146 --> 01:21:17,419
Grace...

861
01:21:19,824 --> 01:21:22,846
I already re-booked my flight
back home to the Philippines.

862
01:21:25,372 --> 01:21:27,470
I'm leaving this coming Friday.

863
01:21:29,091 --> 01:21:31,011
I know you're still mad at me.

864
01:21:32,445 --> 01:21:34,079
I can't blame you.

865
01:21:36,811 --> 01:21:39,045
So this is the only way
I could think of.

866
01:21:40,857 --> 01:21:43,624
I'll just go back to the Philippines.

867
01:21:46,298 --> 01:21:47,724
I'm sorry.

868
01:21:49,998 --> 01:21:52,230
I'm sorry for everything that happened.

869
01:21:55,311 --> 01:21:57,912
If you can't forgive me...

870
01:22:01,903 --> 01:22:03,292
That's what you're good at.

871
01:22:04,808 --> 01:22:06,348
Running away from your problems.

872
01:22:07,601 --> 01:22:09,762
- Grace.
- Damn it, Ivy.

873
01:22:11,702 --> 01:22:16,591
Because of a man, you're willing
to ruin our relationship?

874
01:22:18,022 --> 01:22:21,394
I know anything I do, or say
won't be enough.

875
01:22:21,755 --> 01:22:24,716
I know you can't forgive me.

876
01:22:25,721 --> 01:22:28,593
My sister, who's always protecting me.

877
01:22:30,662 --> 01:22:34,642
My sister, who did nothing, but wish we
could live together here in New Zealand.

878
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:42,200
Grace, I will forever carry
this sin I did to you.

879
01:22:45,731 --> 01:22:48,538
Because I know that
you will never forgive me.

880
01:22:50,561 --> 01:22:51,853
Grace, I'm sorry.

881
01:22:56,844 --> 01:22:58,107
I'm sorry, Grace.

882
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:02,950
I'm sorry.

883
01:23:07,834 --> 01:23:08,926
I'm sorry.

884
01:23:09,988 --> 01:23:11,928
I hope you'll forgive me one day.

885
01:23:14,581 --> 01:23:16,427
I'm sorry, Grace. I'm sorry.

886
01:23:21,232 --> 01:23:22,452
I'm sorry.

887
01:23:23,025 --> 01:23:24,305
I'm sorry, Grace.

888
01:23:26,538 --> 01:23:27,599
Grace...

889
01:23:30,361 --> 01:23:32,190
I'm so sorry, Grace.

890
01:23:42,211 --> 01:23:43,211
I'm sorry.

891
01:23:43,531 --> 01:23:45,318
I'm sorry, Grace.

892
01:24:01,121 --> 01:24:03,361
I'm sorry, Grace.

893
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:51,550
I was hoping you were here.

894
01:24:53,548 --> 01:24:55,386
Grace, wait a minute.

895
01:24:56,395 --> 01:24:58,266
Can we talk? Even for a bit?

896
01:25:08,211 --> 01:25:09,720
I'm sorry for what we did.

897
01:25:10,392 --> 01:25:11,588
For what I did.

898
01:25:13,018 --> 01:25:14,814
It's all my fault, Grace.

899
01:25:16,271 --> 01:25:18,515
I was an asshole to you
from the very beginning.

900
01:25:23,657 --> 01:25:25,648
I was able to pull some strings.

901
01:25:27,026 --> 01:25:28,674
I recommended Ivy for a job.

902
01:25:30,431 --> 01:25:32,064
The salary isn't big...

903
01:25:32,585 --> 01:25:34,791
But they're willing
to give a working visa.

904
01:25:35,356 --> 01:25:37,402
So that, Ivy can stay here
with you.

905
01:25:39,032 --> 01:25:41,555
I know this isn't enough
for you to forgive me.

906
01:25:43,278 --> 01:25:44,957
I'm not expecting much.

907
01:25:46,938 --> 01:25:48,963
I just want to help you two.

908
01:25:49,725 --> 01:25:52,544
And fulfill your and Ivy's dream
of living together in New Zealand.

909
01:25:57,333 --> 01:25:58,966
Did you ever love me?

910
01:26:03,296 --> 01:26:04,779
You know that I tried.

911
01:26:06,605 --> 01:26:08,237
But you love her.

912
01:26:10,925 --> 01:26:12,330
I'm sorry, Grace.

913
01:26:15,912 --> 01:26:17,074
Why is it like that?

914
01:26:20,417 --> 01:26:22,657
Why are you so unfair?

915
01:26:25,339 --> 01:26:27,721
I did everything for you, right?

916
01:26:29,636 --> 01:26:31,796
Why couldn't you choose me?

917
01:26:31,821 --> 01:26:33,664
I really tried.

918
01:26:37,068 --> 01:26:41,640
I think I felt obligated to match
the love you give me.

919
01:26:46,642 --> 01:26:48,227
I'm the one at fault, Grace.

920
01:26:49,874 --> 01:26:51,404
I'm the asshole.

921
01:26:52,114 --> 01:26:55,478
I'm the fool who can't accept your love.

922
01:26:57,102 --> 01:26:58,614
Why Ivy?

923
01:27:01,802 --> 01:27:03,795
Honestly, I don't know.

924
01:27:08,835 --> 01:27:09,835
Why?

925
01:27:11,994 --> 01:27:13,141
Why is it like that?

926
01:27:14,754 --> 01:27:17,422
Why didn't you try
learning how to love me?

927
01:27:19,519 --> 01:27:21,023
I tried to stop it.

928
01:27:22,901 --> 01:27:25,348
I mean, she's your sister.

929
01:27:27,348 --> 01:27:28,448
I don't know.

930
01:27:29,228 --> 01:27:31,210
I don't know why I love her.

931
01:27:43,361 --> 01:27:45,019
It's fine if you can't forgive me.

932
01:27:46,581 --> 01:27:47,812
But please...

933
01:27:50,401 --> 01:27:53,939
Don't let this get in
between you and your sister.

934
01:28:04,698 --> 01:28:06,746
That's my friend's contact number.

935
01:28:08,551 --> 01:28:09,963
He's expecting your call.

936
01:28:59,665 --> 01:29:03,029
Oh, Grace... Sorry for the mess.

937
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:04,662
I'm fixing my stuff.

938
01:29:05,005 --> 01:29:06,285
My flight is tomorrow.

939
01:29:11,768 --> 01:29:12,768
Here.

940
01:29:13,362 --> 01:29:14,607
Felix gave it to me.

941
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,784
His friend is hiring.

942
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:19,704
They're willing to give you
a working visa.

943
01:29:19,814 --> 01:29:20,875
No, Grace...

944
01:29:20,971 --> 01:29:21,971
I'm fine.

945
01:29:22,421 --> 01:29:24,849
I already booked my flight
for tomorrow.

946
01:29:28,131 --> 01:29:29,218
Ivy.

947
01:29:30,178 --> 01:29:31,178
Put that down.

948
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:37,668
You don't have to go home.

949
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:45,932
I gave it some thought, and...

950
01:29:47,555 --> 01:29:48,555
Yes.

951
01:29:49,632 --> 01:29:51,631
I was shallow.

952
01:29:52,736 --> 01:29:55,249
Look at you, you're so pretty.

953
01:29:55,605 --> 01:29:56,725
And I'm pretty too.

954
01:29:57,287 --> 01:29:58,287
See?

955
01:29:58,884 --> 01:30:01,911
I'm sure a lot of men
will be lining up for us, right?

956
01:30:02,544 --> 01:30:04,384
It might even be Kiwis.

957
01:30:07,644 --> 01:30:08,870
But, Ivy...

958
01:30:11,525 --> 01:30:14,479
What matters to me more
is our sibling bond.

959
01:30:16,123 --> 01:30:17,175
Go on.

960
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,200
Accept the offer.

961
01:30:25,638 --> 01:30:26,985
It's already there.

962
01:30:27,917 --> 01:30:30,577
Let's fulfill our dreams.

963
01:30:32,418 --> 01:30:33,418
Right?

964
01:30:34,255 --> 01:30:36,349
We've been dreaming
about this for a long time.

965
01:30:40,147 --> 01:30:41,195
You should accept it.

966
01:30:48,315 --> 01:30:51,194
We won't give up, right?

967
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:54,894
We won't give up on each other.

968
01:30:55,761 --> 01:31:02,880
So, no matter what happens,
remember, I'm here for you.

969
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:06,843
Sorry, Grace.

970
01:31:07,546 --> 01:31:08,692
Sorry.

971
01:31:08,717 --> 01:31:10,420
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

972
01:31:12,043 --> 01:31:18,302
I'm sorry, Grace. I'm sorry.

973
01:31:18,327 --> 01:31:19,442
It's okay.

974
01:31:19,631 --> 01:31:21,264
It's okay...

975
01:31:29,047 --> 01:31:32,613
Always remember that I'm here.

976
01:31:35,626 --> 01:31:37,326
Thank you, Grace.

977
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:42,419
I love you.

978
01:31:53,311 --> 01:31:54,851
We can do this, okay?

979
01:32:01,878 --> 01:32:03,139
It's okay.

980
01:32:15,544 --> 01:32:16,817
Don't cry anymore.

981
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:19,083
I'm here for you.

982
01:32:19,663 --> 01:32:21,350
- Hmm?
- Promise?

983
01:32:22,212 --> 01:32:24,120
- Promise?
- Promise.

984
01:32:56,812 --> 01:33:00,359
[chattering]

985
01:33:03,097 --> 01:33:04,377
It's so nice.
