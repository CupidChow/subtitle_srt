1
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,440
Dad,

2
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,400
please explain everything to me.

3
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,920
You are Prince Khanin,

4
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,360
the only heir of the Assavadevathin clan.

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,560
Your mother was ambushed.

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,720
She did not survive the incident.

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,800
His Majesty sent me in secret
to rescue you.

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,720
He commanded me

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,080
to take you into refuge with me.

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,440
Dad.

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,160
I still have no idea who hurt us.

12
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,360
If you want to find out
who hurt you and your dad,

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,360
the only way is to go to Emmaly.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I am…

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,560
Khanin Assavadevathin.

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,000
A body, charred beyond recognition,

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,240
was found.

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,400
Once the results are in,

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,320
I will report to you
immediately, Your Majesty.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,760
No need to do that.

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,360
That body is Thatdanai's.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,080
What did you just say?

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,640
Thatdanai has passed away,
Your Royal Highness.

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,520
I hereby order your punishment

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,840
for neglecting your duty
to care for Khanin.

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,840
You are dismissed
from your role as his coach

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,000
and confined,
prohibited from seeing him.

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,000
His Majesty has assigned this coach

29
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,440
to be your personal trainer,
Your Royal Highness.

30
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,920
I am Joe, Your Royal Highness.

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,640
Your Royal Highness…

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,680
Your Royal Highness!

33
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,360
Your Royal Highness!
Your Royal Highness,

34
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,640
can you hear me?

35
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
I want to entrust you with something.

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,480
I wish to know

37
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,039
who stands against me.

38
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,480
I haven't managed
to catch the culprit yet.

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,480
I'll have someone look into it.

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

41
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,240
But do you have any idea

42
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,920
who might be behind this?

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,480
It was taken at Heathrow Airport.

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,640
If I were to guess,

45
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,160
he's probably already in Emmaly.

46
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,160
Thanks a lot.

47
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,760
[Meet me in Assavadevathin]

48
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
Thank you, Wasin.

49
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,560
This is impeccable
and truly magnificent.

50
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,440
I am deeply grateful
to Your Majesty the King

51
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,000
for entrusting me with this duty.

52
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,000
And I thank Chana

53
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,680
for introducing the technology to assist
with scoring in this archery match.

54
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,720
In this round, I ask for your permission
to root for Khanin, Your Majesty.

55
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,000
Thank you.

56
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,680
Thank you.

57
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,080
How about rooting for Ava,
the front-runner?

58
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,160
She is unmatched
when it comes to archery.

59
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,160
It's too soon to say that.

60
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,040
Let's wait and see for ourselves.

61
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,040
Please, Father.

62
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,600
Welcome to the second round
of the Royal Competition.

63
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,120
This round features an archery match.

64
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,000
The competitors from all three clans
are now ready to compete.

65
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,600
This match features
four different targets:

66
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,960
standard targets,

67
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,800
birds,

68
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,360
horses,

69
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,320
and snakes,

70
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,640
each with their own scoring value.

71
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,160
Once the time is up,

72
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,800
the competitor with the highest score

73
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,480
will be crowned
the winner of this round.

74
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,600
All you have to do

75
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,440
is to get to the top.

76
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,280
It is not fair anymore, Ava.

77
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,360
You must do whatever it takes
to win this Competition.

78
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,680
If you wish to change Emmaly,

79
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,920
one way to do it

80
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,200
is to win the Competition.

81
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,080
I'll do my best to win.

82
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,679
If all competitors are ready,

83
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,799
I shall now declare
the archery competition

84
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,280
officially underway.

85
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Ten,

86
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
nine,

87
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
eight,

88
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,920
seven,

89
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
six,

90
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
five,

91
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
four,

92
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
three,

93
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
two,

94
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,720
one,

95
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,680
begin.

96
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,440
Sorry.

97
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,920
I just took the last shot.

98
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,920
What is happening?

99
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,760
What's going on?

100
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
Smoke bombs.

101
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,520
What's going on?

102
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,480
Father…

103
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,920
Send someone out
to find Khanin immediately.

104
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,000
Send the soldiers to the scene at once.

105
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,160
What's going on, Wasin?

106
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,480
Terrorism in Meenanagarin?
Is that possible?

107
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,880
There has never been
any act of terrorism in my city.

108
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,960
I ask for time to verify the facts.

109
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,920
Please rest assured,
Your Majesty and Royal Highnesses.

110
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,640
I won't allow my daughter
to be put in such danger.

111
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,000
I believe my people
are on their way to the scene.

112
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
My apologies, everyone.

113
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,960
We are currently unaware
of what has happened in the arena.

114
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,600
I kindly ask you
to proceed to a safe area.

115
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,600
Please.

116
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
- Ava!
- Ava!

117
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
Are you okay?

118
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,200
Watch out!

119
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,240
These arrows are the same as ours.

120
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,680
It's a setup.

121
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,720
They want to make it seem like

122
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,160
we turned on each other.

123
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,840
Let's get out of here.

124
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Can you get up?

125
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
Let me help.

126
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,200
Get on my back, can you?

127
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,120
Yeah.

128
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,960
You alright?

129
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,040
Go, Khanin.

130
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,320
I'll see you at the designated spot.

131
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Your Royal Highness…

132
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,960
Father,

133
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,440
I'm worried about Khanin's safety.

134
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,160
No matter what, he must be safe.

135
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,840
May I have your permission,
Your Majesty?

136
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,520
I apologize for my escape.

137
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,120
You have fled. What made you return?

138
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,680
Honestly, I had no intention to flee.

139
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,840
But being constantly watched
made it difficult to perform my duties.

140
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,280
Still, I have obeyed
your commands fully, Your Majesty,

141
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,040
to pursue the perpetrator.

142
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,560
Here is all the evidence
I have gathered.

143
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Your Royal Highness?

144
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,160
Make yourself at ease.

145
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,280
That would be inappropriate.

146
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,840
I wanted to meet you today
to talk about important matters.

147
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,400
I will ensure your protection

148
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,440
if you agree to help me.

149
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,200
Do you want me…

150
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,079
to help you?

151
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,480
Yes.

152
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,240
You must keep this confidential.

153
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,640
Do not reveal it to anyone,
not even His Majesty.

154
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,839
I don't understand.

155
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,440
Do you not trust His Majesty,
Your Royal Highness?

156
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,920
It's not that I don't trust him,

157
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,680
but everything I do
is to keep Khanin safe.

158
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,440
I lost him once,

159
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,880
and I cannot bear to lose him again.

160
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,280
Are you implying that…

161
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,240
His Majesty holds no goodwill
toward Prince Khanin?

162
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,400
To my father,

163
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,160
Assavadevathin comes
before everything else.

164
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,200
Do it for Khanin.

165
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,600
Join me in this.

166
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,880
Prince Rachata is planning
to send a new coach to Prince Khanin.

167
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,640
Prince Rachata?

168
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,640
He must be plotting something.

169
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,320
There's no solid lead at the moment,

170
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,720
but it's possible he wants information
or is planning an ambush.

171
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,160
What's the name of that coach?

172
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
It's Joe.

173
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,080
Please send me his profile.

174
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,880
Okay.

175
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
I need your help.

176
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
With what?

177
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,400
Coach Joe.

178
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,960
He was once a soldier
serving Bhuchongpisut.

179
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,160
Out of nowhere,

180
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,240
he became a top-tier fencer

181
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,800
in just a few months.

182
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,800
Got it.

183
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,880
At first,

184
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,040
all suspicion pointed
to the Bhuchongpisuts.

185
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,480
But once the truth came to light,

186
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,640
it turned out

187
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,400
they were merely a scapegoat.

188
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,480
Coach Joe's profile was fabricated.

189
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,480
So it was an intentional attack.

190
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,960
If you get caught,

191
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,640
you're as good as gone.

192
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,400
So please come with me.

193
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,760
If nothing else,

194
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,560
do it for Prince Khanin.

195
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,880
[Coach Joe Detained over Plot
to Poison Prince Khanin]

196
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,520
How did it turn out this way?

197
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,600
I'm confident nothing will reach you,
Your Royal Highness.

198
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,880
You've merely followed
Prince Wasin's advice.

199
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,560
Make sure everything is handled.

200
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

201
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
[You were right;
Coach Joe serves under Prince Wasin]

202
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,360
My source sent me these.

203
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,440
This forest is really perilous.

204
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,920
It's full of wild animals

205
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,240
and countless traps.

206
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,080
I'm noticing a lot of vulnerabilities
in this map.

207
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,440
Seems like it's designed
for a terrorist attack.

208
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,440
I never expected it…

209
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,000
to be Prince Wasin.

210
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,080
Because he seems kind?

211
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
You never know what's on someone's mind.

212
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,520
What do you think he's doing this for?

213
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Power.

214
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,520
Everyone's just hungry for power.

215
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,000
In this freaking country,

216
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,560
everyone should be equal by now.

217
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,040
We're all human.

218
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,760
What's the point of having power?

219
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,160
To put himself above everyone else.

220
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,880
He also checked the storeroom today.

221
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,040
Jeez,

222
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,440
again and again?

223
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,160
Yeah.

224
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,320
If I didn't know things were calm,

225
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,000
I'd believe war was coming.

226
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,200
Come on.

227
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,840
Stop talking nonsense.

228
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,840
Shit…

229
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,960
The GPS…

230
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,440
[You were right;
my source spotted something off]

231
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,600
[Vedish: You were right;
my source spotted something off]

232
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Soldiers,

233
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,120
detain Prince Wasin.

234
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,080
Follow me this way.

235
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,960
Your Majesty and Royal Highnesses,

236
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,160
please proceed this way.

237
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,680
All of you, please.

238
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
This way.

239
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
This way, please.

240
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,720
Soldiers,

241
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,000
detain Prince Wasin.

242
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,000
Watch out!

243
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,240
Your Royal Highness!

244
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
- Ran…
- Your Royal Highness.

245
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,360
Are you hurt, Your Royal Highness?

246
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,720
I'm okay.

247
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,760
Are you injured anywhere?

248
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,840
You're not hurt, right?

249
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,760
I'm totally alright,
Your Royal Highness.

250
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
This pearl…

251
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,320
has a tracker in it.

252
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,280
But Prince Wasin gave me this.

253
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,200
Exactly.

254
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,960
That's why I could locate you.

255
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
And if I could,

256
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,440
so can…

257
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,080
the rebels.

258
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,760
Are you implying…

259
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,320
Prince Wasin…

260
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,920
is behind the rebellion.

261
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,400
Because he has no heir,

262
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,280
he chose to get rid of everyone else's?

263
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,960
If you want to uncover the truth,

264
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,840
we need to get out of here
as soon as possible.

265
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,680
I'm not certain

266
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,280
what other traps may be in this forest.

267
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,320
But Ava's injured.

268
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
I'm okay.

269
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,360
Let's leave this place at once.

270
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
This way, please.

271
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
This way.

272
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,520
Are we all going to be safe, Ran?

273
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,120
Both clans have been directed
to proceed to the designated spot.

274
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,000
We shall meet again in Davin.

275
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,080
Are you hurt, dear?

276
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,240
I'm unharmed, Father.

277
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,640
Your Royal Highness, are you alright?

278
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
I'm fine.

279
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,480
Have our people arrived?

280
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,200
The ship is almost here,
Your Royal Highness.

281
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,760
You think you can escape me?

282
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,160
What is it that you want?

283
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,400
Nothing!

284
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,160
I never wanted anything
from someone as selfish as you.

285
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,920
You ripped my loved ones away

286
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,880
and tore my family apart.

287
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,320
Wait, wait.

288
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Calm yourself.

289
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,680
Let's talk nicely and calmly,

290
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,240
and I shall grant you a pardon

291
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,960
and allow you to seek refuge abroad.

292
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,440
I'm the one bringing you to justice.

293
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,520
How many lives have you taken?

294
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,800
You probably don't even know

295
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,960
that it was your grandfather
who killed my family.

296
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,440
So…

297
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,000
what matter brings you here today?

298
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,200
My wife was born in Assavadevathin.

299
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,840
She is currently deeply concerned
about the severely polluted air

300
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,520
near the mine, Your Majesty.

301
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,320
Has your wife just returned
from Assavadevathin?

302
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,920
No, Your Majesty.

303
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,640
But she was informed by her family.

304
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,040
What makes you certain that it's real?

305
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,200
There is no reason to lie,
is there, Your Majesty?

306
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,320
Wow, how very optimistic of you.

307
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,760
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty,

308
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,080
my family has told no lies.

309
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,720
I beg you
to help the people, Your Majesty.

310
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,280
How can I do that?

311
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,600
I humbly request that

312
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,880
you order the concessionaire company

313
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,160
to build containment pits for mine waste

314
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,040
to lessen the pollution

315
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:10,880
and protect the well-being
of the local people.

316
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,800
Let's say
I have acknowledged your request.

317
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,560
I am most grateful, Your Majesty.

318
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,120
With your permission,
I shall take my leave.

319
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,800
May you be blessed
with good health, Your Majesty.

320
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,360
Thank you.

321
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,360
We've come to ask
for your help, Rachata.

322
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,680
We were hoping you could support

323
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,720
the proposed mining law.

324
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,240
The proposed mining law?

325
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,480
Our inspection
of the gold mine in Assavadevathin

326
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,960
revealed a complete lack
of pollution control.

327
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,880
So we're asking all clans

328
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,960
to propose a regulatory law
for mining operations.

329
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,360
Certainly, I will lend my support.

330
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,160
We appreciate that.

331
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,160
I would like to ask for your help

332
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,040
to invent technology
that can reduce dust and pollution

333
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,360
as the people in Assavadevathin,

334
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,440
especially ones near the mine,
are suffering terribly from the issues.

335
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
Interesting.

336
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,760
Here's a quick thought.

337
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,880
Air purifiers should be able
to address that.

338
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,080
It's quite an intriguing idea.

339
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,320
My love…

340
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,760
My love,

341
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,800
I'm right here.

342
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,480
Shall I inform the miners
right away, Your Majesty?

343
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
No need.

344
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,800
Understood, Your Majesty.

345
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,360
My love…

346
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
My love.

347
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
My love!

348
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,240
My princess…

349
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,920
Why are you doing this to me?

350
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,719
After the lung and allergy medicine
was introduced,

351
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,080
patient visits at Bhuchongpisut Hospital

352
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,719
have risen over 200 percent,
Your Royal Highness.

353
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,960
This could be very profitable.

354
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
So…

355
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:27,520
I'll have the development team
accelerate this project immediately.

356
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,520
I will cause every one of you

357
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,320
pain and torment far beyond
what happened to my love.

358
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,360
Announce to all

359
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,720
that Her Royal Highness has passed away
due to preeclampsia.

360
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

361
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,680
When I declared why my wife died,

362
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,000
no one…

363
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,320
None of you even cared
if it was that disease.

364
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,800
My wife died from lung cancer

365
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,480
because of your careless
mining operations.

366
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,600
And now, you've got lung cancer, too.

367
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,520
Yet, you've never even tried
to do anything.

368
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,960
All you care about is the capitalists,

369
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,520
whether they'll gain profit

370
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,680
or whether they'll support you.

371
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,600
You only care if your family's power

372
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,080
will be threatened.

373
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,800
You care nothing for the people,

374
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,760
nothing for the country.

375
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,040
Go to hell.

376
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,400
Your Majesty…

377
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,600
Why are you protecting him?

378
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,960
Don't you know he's the one
who caused your mother's death?

379
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,520
Stop! Drop the gun.

380
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
- Wait…
- Wirun?

381
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,600
I said, "Drop the gun."

382
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Guns down.

383
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,400
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

384
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,400
- Your Majesty!
- Grandfather…

385
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,360
Your Royal Highness…

386
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,520
- Your Majesty…
- Father!

387
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,160
- Grandfather…
- Why, Wirun?

388
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,040
How does it feel to be betrayed
by the one you trusted most?

389
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,480
Try to understand me.

390
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,120
My sister lost her life,

391
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,760
and my whole family died
because of your mine.

392
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,520
Is your wife Wirun's sister?

393
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,000
You just never cared about anyone.

394
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,000
After all, blood is thicker than water,
isn't it?

395
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,080
Is this the reason

396
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,560
you took my side?

397
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,720
Intentional or not,

398
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,400
the outcome wouldn't change.

399
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,120
Stop pretending to be the victim.

400
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,480
Thanks to Wirun for the information.

401
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,760
It gave me the opportunity
to seek revenge again.

402
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,920
You should try Earl Grey,

403
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,200
the tea imported from the UK.

404
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,840
As soon as I found out from Wirun

405
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,320
that Khanin was still alive,

406
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,640
- I sent my men to get rid of him.
- Go.

407
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,800
We need to change the plan.

408
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,320
I'll reach out to you once we're there.

409
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,480
Since the assassination attempt
in the UK failed,

410
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,480
I realized I had to separate
Charan from Khanin.

411
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,960
Otherwise, the plan would never succeed.

412
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,720
You are dismissed
from your role as his coach

413
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,680
and confined,
prohibited from seeing him.

414
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,080
So you want me
to lose the Competition, Grandfather?

415
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Your Royal Highness…

416
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,280
And I did it.

417
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,880
His Majesty has assigned this coach

418
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,080
to be your personal trainer,
Your Royal Highness.

419
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,920
I am Joe, Your Royal Highness.

420
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,120
But Joe messed it up,

421
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,360
so I turned to Rachata instead.

422
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,720
Who do you work for?

423
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,120
Kill him.

424
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,400
His Majesty the King!

425
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,080
Turned out he was a coward.

426
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,560
Why can't we do anything?

427
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,360
You think you can take them down

428
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,680
without any proof?

429
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,120
Didn't have the guts to do anything.

430
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,120
I had no choice
but to finish it myself today.

431
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,280
But since I couldn't hurt you directly,

432
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,400
I had to hurt the one
you placed your hopes in.

433
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,360
Prince Wasin,

434
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,800
Wirun…

435
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,000
I understand you all,

436
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,560
but killing us won't do any good.

437
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,600
Stop, Khanin. There's no need.

438
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,920
I am the King.

439
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,120
They can't lay a hand on me.

440
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,640
Are you sure?

441
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,520
- Your Majesty, Prince Tharin…
- Let's go!

442
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,560
Thatdanai?

443
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,120
Freeze! Don't move.

444
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,640
This way, please.

445
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,360
Dad…

446
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,200
Khanin!

447
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,120
- Khanin!
- Dad…

448
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,560
Nin…

449
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,480
Khanin.

450
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,840
How have you been?

451
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,920
- I missed you.
- I'm okay.

452
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,320
You should go now.

453
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,240
We'll talk later.

454
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,240
Charan, take him.

455
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,320
- This way.
- Let's go.

456
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,280
- Your Royal Highness!
- Watch out!

457
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,440
I am the royal butler

458
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,680
assigned to serve Your Royal Highness.

459
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,240
Should you require anything,

460
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,760
please inform me at once.

461
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,920
Chakri…

462
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,480
Are you referring to…

463
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,200
Coach Joe, Your Royal Highness?

464
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,960
that I…

465
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,120
will not allow any harm to befall you.

466
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,480
You have my words.

467
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,320
Your Royal Highness!

468
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,280
Your Royal Highness…

469
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,120
Your Royal Highness!

470
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,800
Your Royal Highness!

471
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,840
The blame rests solely with me,
Your Majesty.

472
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,240
Please allow me
to accept any punishment.

473
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,320
Shall I…

474
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,640
summon the royal physicians
to examine you, just to be safe?

475
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,760
- Chakri!
- Chakri!

476
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,440
- Chakri!
- Chakri…

477
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,480
Chakri, hey!

478
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,400
Chakri…

479
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,360
Chakri!

480
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,040
Ran, what do we do?

481
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,480
- Chakri!
- Chakri…

482
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,280
- Chakri…
- Chakri…

483
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,320
About what Prince Wasin said,

484
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,840
can you tell me about that?

485
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,240
For the Competition's archery match,
taking place in Meenanagarin…

486
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,480
Even if something happened to the King,

487
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,320
wouldn't the Competition
still has to go on?

488
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,760
Soon,

489
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,080
we shall rise
and rule over this country.

490
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,760
I believe we have an opportunity
to bring about change.

491
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,360
You must win the fencing match.

492
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,360
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

493
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,640
His Majesty…

494
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,200

495
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,920
