1
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,360
What is happening?

2
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,680
<i>Send someone out</i>
<i>to find Khanin immediately.</i>

3
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,320
Soldiers, detain Prince Wasin.

4
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,360
Your Royal Highness.

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,720
Go to hell!

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,440
- Your Royal Highness!
- Watch out!

7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,400
- Chakri…
- Chakri.

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,200
- Chakri.
- Chakri.

9
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,120
Your Majesty, will you really
let Khanin and me leave

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,680
without ever seeing Tharin?

11
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,320
Please let me stay for a few more days.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,760
That won't be possible.

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,880
Things are far too unstable.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,640
Tharin agrees with me.

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,920
He's sent his regrets
that he cannot see you and Khanin off.

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,000
Has Khanin recovered
from yesterday's shock?

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,760
He is all right now, Your Majesty.

18
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,400
How about you?

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,800
Even with royal guards everywhere,
they dared to break in.

20
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,360
Trust me. There's truly no time.

21
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
You must leave now.

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,240
I understand, but…

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,120
Just go, and stay safe.

24
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,720
When the situation is better,
I'll come for you and Khanin.

25
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes.

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,840
I'd like to take my leave.

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,000
Chita, you stay.

28
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,920
I have faith in you.

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,840
Ensure the safety
of Princess Khunita and Prince Khanin.

30
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,400
I'll dispatch my best soldiers to help.

31
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,960
As for Charan,

32
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,560
he will be under my protection
until you return from the UK.

33
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,960
I'm afraid
it may not be proper, Your Majesty.

34
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,400
Your family, Phithakthewa,
has always been loyal.

35
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,720
I shall adopt Charan.

36
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,360
I see no reason
why this would be improper.

37
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,000
It is decided.

38
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,360
I am most grateful, Your Majesty.

39
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,240
<i>Moving on to the news</i>
<i>that has shaken the entire nation.</i>

40
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,920
<i>It's the archery match</i>
<i>in the royal competition,</i>

41
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,440
<i>taking place in Meenanagarin.</i>

42
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,760
ROYAL HIGHNESSES AMBUSHED

43
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,280
<i>As you can see,</i>

44
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,880
<i>an explosion occurred</i>
<i>in the middle of the competition.</i>

45
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,120
<i>Reports also confirm that outsiders</i>

46
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,040
<i>infiltrated the arena in an attempt</i>
<i>to assassinate Their Royal Highnesses.</i>

47
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,000
Khanin.

48
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,000
Are you injured?

49
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,400
Just a minor injury.

50
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,960
But it has been taken care of.

51
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,320
I'm all right.

52
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,360
Well… how is Grandfather doing?

53
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,560
The doctors have got the bullet out.

54
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,160
However…

55
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,560
Your Royal Highnesses.

56
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,120
His Majesty's out of the critical stage.

57
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,520
Ran,

58
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,800
thank you for always protecting me
and the Assavadevathins.

59
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,360
<i>Why are you protecting him?</i>

60
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,440
Don't you know he had your mother killed?

61
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,880
What Prince Wasin said…

62
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,240
can you tell me about that?

63
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,960
Did he mean…

64
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,360
Grandfather caused your mother…

65
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,240
Nin.

66
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,920
Listen to me.

67
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,200
I've known the truth all along.

68
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,240
What happened in the past
has nothing to do with you.

69
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,200
I'm not sure…

70
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,120
if you should know about it.

71
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,559
Why, though?

72
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,000
I don't want it to weigh on you.

73
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,000
But I already know about it
from Prince Wasin.

74
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,920
Please let me know the whole truth.

75
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,440
First of all,

76
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,880
the one who caused your mother's death…

77
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,320
Was it Grandfather?

78
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,920
Actually, I thought it was him, too.

79
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
But it wasn't.

80
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,120
Chita,

81
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,200
I'm sorry.

82
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,400
Why, Your Royal Highness?

83
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,440
You had to leave your family
just to be here for us.

84
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,760
I consider it a great honor to serve you.

85
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,720
Mother!

86
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,280
Mother. Where are you going?

87
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,440
Mother.

88
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,560
Mother…

89
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,480
<i>Charan is still just a child.</i>

90
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,040
When he grows up,

91
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,320
he will understand me,
Your Royal Highness.

92
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,480
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

93
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,200
For them to catch up
despite our hasty escape…

94
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,280
There must be a traitor among us.

95
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,600
<i>As you are aware, it was Prince Wasin</i>

96
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,680
<i>who was behind the assassination attempt</i>
<i>on both Princess Khunita and you.</i>

97
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,560
<i>The one who saw the incident that night</i>
<i>was Mr. Thatdanai.</i>

98
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,720
Your Royal Highness.

99
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,200
Your Royal Highness.

100
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,880
Chita…

101
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,800
Chita.

102
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,480
Chita.

103
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,920
Go after them!

104
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,840
Now!

105
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,560
Your Royal Highness.

106
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
When he came to our house,

107
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,400
I probably sneaked into his car.

108
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,720
<i>That day might be the reason why…</i>

109
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,440
Mother!

110
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,800
- Don't get in there.
- Mother!

111
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,080
<i>…I've come to hate the rain.</i>

112
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,800
Then

113
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,400
what Prince Wasin said
wasn't wrong after all

114
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,640
- because the Assavadevathins…
- That's not it.

115
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,120
The duties of the Phithakthewas
to the Assavadevathins

116
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,400
are to protect, take care of,

117
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,680
and remain loyal.

118
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,800
It's not due to any command,

119
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,200
but because of a vow.

120
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,200
Are you not mad at me at all?

121
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,080
Your mother died…

122
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,680
but I lived.

123
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,360
Do I really seem so unreasonable?

124
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,760
If I were you,

125
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,320
I have no idea if I would…

126
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,400
I'm not mad at you

127
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,080
or anyone.

128
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,680
No one…

129
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
wished for any of that to happen.

130
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,440
Prince Wasin is dead.

131
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,240
But…

132
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
how can I face you?

133
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,000
I feel like it was my fault
that your mother…

134
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
You were just a baby, Nin.

135
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,400
How could it be your fault?

136
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,440
But…

137
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,760
I should be grateful

138
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,240
that you came back to Emmaly with me.

139
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,800
Had I not found you,

140
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
I wouldn't have felt this way.

141
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,200
"Felt…

142
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,520
this way"?

143
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,800
Feeling that…

144
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,240
when we care for someone
with all our heart,

145
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,000
we love

146
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,920
and cherish them like our very life.

147
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Ran…

148
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,040
The surgery's done.

149
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,920
You don't need to worry.

150
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,280
He just needs to rest.

151
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,240
THEIR ROYAL HIGHNESSES AMBUSHED
DURING ARCHERY MATCH IN MEENANAGARIN

152
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,880
Chakri…

153
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,120
Your Royal Highness…

154
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,200
- Chakri.
- Your Royal Highness…

155
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,160
Hold on. Stop.

156
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,200
Just keep lying down.

157
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,400
I can't, Your Royal Highness.

158
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,359
What do you mean? Hey.

159
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,200
You just regained consciousness.
Don't move.

160
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,800
Chakri,

161
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,280
I'm here to see you.

162
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,440
Get well soon.

163
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,680
As soon as you said that,
I immediately felt better.

164
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,400
But…

165
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,440
are you all right, Your Royal Highness?

166
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,440
Still thinking about others?

167
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,040
I'm safe.

168
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,200
How are you doing, Chakri?

169
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,800
I'm feeling better now,
Your Royal Highness.

170
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,160
Khanin,

171
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,160
I've come to tell you that
His Majesty's condition has improved.

172
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,600
The doctors recommend that
he continue treatment in Davin,

173
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,960
so we'll need to head back there soon.

174
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,480
All right, Father.

175
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,400
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>the video of Prince Calvin from Bhujar</i>

176
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,000
<i>joining the protest</i>
<i>in Assavadevathin-ruled Emmaly?</i>

177
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,600
PRINCE CALVIN RECALLED

178
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,240
<i>That video has now gone viral.</i>

179
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,000
<i>Following the incident,</i>
<i>sources report that</i>

180
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,560
<i>he has been recalled to Bhujar.</i>

181
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,560
<i>The Royal Palace of Bhujar</i>
<i>has issued a statement,</i>

182
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,000
<i>asserting that Prince Calvin</i>
<i>acted of his own accord</i>

183
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,000
<i>and that Bhujar will not involve itself</i>
<i>in Emmaly's internal affairs.</i>

184
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,400
Looks like Calvin's in trouble.

185
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,680
As acting regent for His Majesty,

186
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,280
I hereby declare that
Prince Wasin has passed away.

187
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,480
Please rise and join me
in a moment of silence in his honor.

188
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,440
You may sit down.

189
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,480
As there is no heir
to the throne of Meenanagarin,

190
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,640
its authority must now return
to the central rule.

191
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,640
I shall assume temporary governorship
over it for the time being.

192
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,880
And what will happen
to the royal competition?

193
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,800
Rachata,

194
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,440
now is not the time to speak of this.

195
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,000
It's all right.

196
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,680
As you are well aware,

197
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,200
there was corruption
in the first round of the competition.

198
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,720
The archery results have been invalidated.

199
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,880
Moreover, we are also unable
to hold another archery match.

200
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,200
Thus, I wish to discuss this
with you first.

201
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,480
Are you saying
the competition will no longer continue?

202
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,840
I would like to see
His Majesty recover first.

203
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,640
When the time comes,

204
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,440
we shall reconsider the royal competition.

205
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,160
I'm going to be honest here.

206
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,000
Even if something happened to the King,

207
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,920
wouldn't the competition go on?

208
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,360
Rachata, how can you say such a thing?

209
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,360
You are right, Rachata.

210
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,680
However, after assessing the situation,

211
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,000
I still cannot assure the safety
of every royal family member.

212
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,600
If anything happens,
wouldn't it make things even worse?

213
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,800
Goddammit.

214
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,000
Those damn Assavadevathins.

215
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,120
They don't want me to take the throne.

216
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,160
That's why
they invalidated the competition

217
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,400
when you were about to win.

218
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,000
What is wrong with you?

219
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,760
Nothing to say?

220
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,480
I'm upset, too, Father.

221
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,720
Is this how you show your anger?

222
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,480
What a coward you are.

223
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,840
- You're completely useless.
- Please stop, Your Royal Highness.

224
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,200
Go away.

225
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Go away!

226
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,480
Please let me bear
the punishment instead.

227
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,400
What are you talking about? What?

228
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,520
Who do you think you are?

229
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,960
Speak.

230
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,480
Please forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

231
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,160
I had no right.

232
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,680
You had no right?

233
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,480
You have no right to stand in my way.

234
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,000
Stay down.

235
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,000
Now,

236
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,320
I'll have Ramil teach you

237
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,000
who rules and who serves.

238
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,480
Ramil,

239
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,400
step on his face.

240
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,960
Do it.

241
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,520
I cannot obey, Father.

242
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,280
You're testing my patience, aren't you?

243
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,920
I gave you an order.
Put your foot on his face.

244
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,680
Do it.

245
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,760
Now.

246
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,720
Step on his face.

247
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,000
Like that.

248
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,200
Now, you finally see

249
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,520
who rules

250
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,200
and who serves.

251
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,560
You're pathetic.

252
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,640
All this time,

253
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
I've suffered.

254
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,320
I've felt small.

255
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,560
But I endured it all because…

256
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,280
you were there with me.

257
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Because I knew…

258
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,160
you would protect me.

259
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
I have always protected you, haven't I?

260
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,760
No one's ever dared to mess with you.

261
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,440
But not with Prince Rachata, right?

262
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,520
I did everything I could.

263
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,680
Don't cry, Paytai.

264
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,160
I must respectfully decline your order,
Your Royal Highness.

265
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,040
I cannot do this.

266
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,880
The matter between us…

267
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
Please let it end here.

268
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,640
Do you even know what you're saying?

269
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,960
Though in private,

270
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,560
I consent to be your devoted servant…

271
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,480
Paytai…

272
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,760
In real life,

273
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,680
I have my own dignity.

274
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
And I wish to be honored

275
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,120
as your lover.

276
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,440
Where are you going?

277
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,720
Thank you for protecting me.

278
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,920
Thank you

279
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,640
for taking care of the Assavadevathins.

280
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,720
I'll be waiting over there, okay?

281
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,600
I know you loved roses, Mother.

282
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,280
Protect, take care of,

283
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,120
and remain loyal to the Assavadevathins.

284
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,160
I have fulfilled my duties…

285
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,280
as the head of the Phithakthewa family,
just as you once were.

286
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,200
That was fast.

287
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,600
You can take your time.

288
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
I'll be fine.

289
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,600
Thank you.

290
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,000
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

291
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,160
His Majesty…

292
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,800
Following the recovery of His Majesty,

293
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,600
he has commanded me
to gather the royal clans.

294
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,880
That is why
I've gathered you all here today.

295
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,360
We extend our heartfelt congratulations

296
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,120
on the recovery of His Majesty.

297
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,040
We offer congratulations
upon this blessed news.

298
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,640
Might we be allowed
to visit His Majesty now?

299
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,720
I appreciate your kind concern
for our clan.

300
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,000
However, his condition remains delicate,

301
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,960
and it is not yet appropriate
to allow visitors for now.

302
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:43,000
I thought today would be the day
we'd get to visit His Majesty.

303
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,880
If we're not allowed to visit His Majesty,
then what's the point…

304
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,960
of this meeting?

305
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,240
His Majesty has issued a command
regarding the royal competition.

306
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,240
He wishes for the competition to proceed.

307
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,360
He believes it is most fitting

308
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,280
that it proceed in the traditional way,

309
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,480
with a final fencing match
to determine the victor.

310
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,880
With your permission,

311
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,760
I have an announcement.

312
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,000
You have my permission.

313
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,840
After careful consideration,

314
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,320
to ensure my heir's safety,

315
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,480
we shall no longer take part
in the royal competition.

316
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,760
However,

317
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,600
the final decision rests with Ava,

318
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,280
my daughter and the pride of my clan.

319
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,120
You have devoted yourself fully
to your training.

320
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,040
The right to decide your participation

321
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,840
rightfully belongs to you.

322
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,880
I shall prove myself to you, Father.

323
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,160
Your archery skills are truly impressive,
Your Royal Highness.

324
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,680
I dedicated myself to training
because I didn't want to lose

325
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,120
and wanted to prove myself.

326
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,800
Thank you for your answer, Princess Ava.

327
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,320
<i>You've also done a wonderful job</i>
<i>speaking up for equal rights.</i>

328
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,400
<i>I wanted to prove that</i>
<i>being a woman didn't make me any less.</i>

329
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,040
But all the mess in this competition
has opened my eyes.

330
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,320
It is not fair anymore, Ava.

331
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
- Ava.
- Ava.

332
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,040
I've realized that it's nothing more
than a game of power,

333
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,520
and I have nothing to prove to anyone.

334
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,159
I, the heir of Davichmetha,
hereby withdraw.

335
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,360
To summarize,

336
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,800
we shall proceed with the fencing match
between the two clans,

337
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,480
Assavadevathin and Bhuchongpisut.

338
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,600
Ramil,

339
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,280
Khanin,

340
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,480
do you have any objections?

341
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,400
No, Your Royal Highness.

342
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,159
Father,

343
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,199
may I be permitted to speak?

344
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,800
You may.

345
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,960
This may not be the most suitable time
to proceed with the royal competition.

346
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,159
Would it not be better to wait
until His Majesty has fully recovered?

347
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,960
That may not be possible.

348
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,360
It was His Majesty himself who commanded

349
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,760
that the competition continue
without delay.

350
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,400
We have yet another matter to disclose.

351
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,400
The royal palace will announce that
Prince Wasin lost his life

352
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,880
in an accident during his travels.

353
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,440
A condolence letter will also be sent

354
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,640
to the extended kin of Meenanagarin.

355
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
That is the best decision.

356
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,760
But what shall become
of the governance of Meenanagarin

357
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,760
since Wasin had no heir?

358
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:46,640
Might it be wise to appoint
a qualified person to lead the region?

359
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,680
I am in agreement.

360
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,760
The royal palace must appoint a leader
suitable to the task.

361
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,160
Ramil's proposal is commendable,

362
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,320
yet it raises concerns that they may not
come from the Meenanagarin clan.

363
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,800
By withholding the truth for that clan,

364
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,680
we have shown enough respect.

365
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,720
Thus, I shall have the royal palace

366
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,160
select a suitable leader for Meenanagarin,

367
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,640
after which we may discuss
the matter again.

368
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,440
May I ask why…

369
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,000
the people of Meenanagarin are not granted
the right to choose their own leader?

370
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,360
That is indeed an intriguing question.

371
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,600
I presume you are referring to elections.

372
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,400
Yes, Father.

373
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,840
I appreciate your frankness,

374
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,360
but I must decline.

375
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,400
As for the leadership of Meenanagarin,

376
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,880
it shall proceed
as I have previously declared.

377
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,240
Can we talk?

378
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,040
Father,

379
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,720
I…

380
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,680
Are you disappointed in me?

381
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,880
I just thought…

382
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,760
maybe this was our chance
to bring about change.

383
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,800
I know you want to bring about change,

384
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,040
to see democracy in Emmaly.

385
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,840
But there's only one way.

386
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,840
You must win the fencing match.

387
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,360
If we win, will you change
the way we rule, Father?

388
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,680
I will do all that I can.

389
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,080
Then why did you reject me
in the meeting just now?

390
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,000
What you wanted

391
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,480
is for everyone there
to give up their power.

392
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,960
That's never an easy thing to ask.

393
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,840
But would you…

394
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,600
give it up?

395
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,400
If you win,

396
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,280
then wait and see what happens.

397
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,760
Nin…

398
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,680
your grandfather wanted me
to tell you that

399
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,160
he's sorry.

400
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,640
Has news of the rebellion been kept quiet?

401
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
Yes, Father.

402
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,280
Even the butler I trusted

403
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,320
turned on me…

404
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,120
And I never suspected a thing.

405
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,840
Wirun has passed, Father.

406
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,160
As he should.

407
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,120
- Father… I'll go get the doctor.
- No need.

408
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,400
I'm sorry, Tharin.

409
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,680
I regret what I've done to you and…

410
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240
Emmaly.

411
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,480
But you did it all
for our family and the nation.

412
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,520
Even if that excuse
paints me in a better light,

413
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,280
I'm still the one who set the path

414
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,040
and forced you to live that way
your whole life.

415
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,880
Honestly, deep down,

416
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,680
I might have been unhappy, too.

417
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,680
Maybe not telling you about Khanin
might have hurt you a lot, right?

418
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,880
My apology

419
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,680
might not help at all.

420
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,000
I was hurt before,

421
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,600
but that is behind me now.

422
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Let's work together
to fix what went wrong, shall we?

423
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,120
If I die before the competition…

424
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,080
keep it a secret
until the fencing match is over.

425
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,760
The news must be withheld
until the royal competition concludes.

426
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,200
How can I possibly do that?

427
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:42,720
My life's purpose
was to make the Assavadevathins flourish.

428
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:55,320
Even if I leave this world,
I won't stand in the way of its glory.

429
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,440
Khanin must be victorious.

430
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,880
I have faith in him.

431
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:25,040
Tell Khanin I'm sorry.

432
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,840
He's deeply sorry
for having caused all of this.

433
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,360
Fence on behalf of the Assavadevathins

434
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,240
and bring victory for Emmaly.

435
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,200
Can you?

436
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,000
What's wrong?

437
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,520
Worried about tomorrow?

438
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,800
I want to make things better for Emmaly

439
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,200
and make things right.

440
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,520
But if I lose tomorrow…

441
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,040
Don't worry.

442
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,120
Just do your best.

443
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,320
I feel so much pressure.

444
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,720
A little pressure's not all bad.

445
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,240
It can push you forward.

446
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,600
But this is too much.

447
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,800
I can't even sleep.

448
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,360
If you can't sleep,

449
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,480
I'll stay up with you.

450
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,760
These are heavy.

451
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,880
Can you handle them?

452
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,600
Here you go.

453
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,320
Good luck.

454
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,280
On guard.

455
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,200
Ready?

456
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,000
Go.

457
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,360
Go.

458
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,280
On guard.

459
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,720
Ready?

460
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,760
Go.

461
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,240
Well done.

462
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,360
That was incredible. You're the best.

463
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,520
If you can beat Charan,
we've got nothing to worry about.

464
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,200
I'd like to challenge you next, Dad.

465
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,280
Go get changed and come fight me.

466
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,080
Please.

467
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,400
Please…

468
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,680
Fence with me.

469
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,760
Wow, you're amazing.

470
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,400
Ready?

471
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,400
Watch out.

472
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,520
- Come on.
- Get me. Don't walk away.

473
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,320
Show me what you've got.

474
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,320
What?

475
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,320
Get this.

476
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,280
Come on.

477
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,480
Are you okay, Nin?

478
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,360
I won!

479
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,080
I won.

480
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,760
You don't even try to change.

481
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,520
Stop.

482
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,280
Get up,

483
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,800
or you won't be able to beat Khanin.

484
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,400
Get up.

485
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,000
Don't help him.

486
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,120
Get up, Ramil.

487
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,640
Soon,

488
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,200
we shall rise
and rule over this country.

489
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,960
Get up.

490
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,840
Shall we take a quick break?

491
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,840
Is Paytai here?

492
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,200
He hasn't come here at all,
Your Royal Highness.

493
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,600
You're looking after me now.
Are you fully recovered?

494
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,320
I told you, Your Royal Highness.

495
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,000
I've been well
since the day you came to visit me.

496
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,920
Good luck, Your Royal Highness.

497
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,160
Don't forget to breathe.

498
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,840
- Yes?
- You need to breathe.

499
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Breathe in.

500
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,840
Breathe out.

501
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,560
Feeling better?

502
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,600
Good luck.

503
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,440
You've got this.

504
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,960
Coming up next
is the royal fencing competition

505
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,560
between Prince Ramil Bhuchongpisut

506
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,120
and Prince Khanin Assavadevathin.

507
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:24,600
May both princes
take their positions, please.

508
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:32,600
This is the most historic match
Emmaly has seen in decades,

509
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,280
as it marks a duel

510
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,920
between the clans
of Bhuchongpisut and Assavadevathin.

511
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,840
On guard.

512
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,920
Ready?

513
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,040
Go.

514
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,680
Congratulations to…

515
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,880
- Grandfather…
- Khanin…

516
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,400
<i>I haven't changed my mind.</i>

517
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,160
Just like I told you before,

518
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,440
<i>I want an ordinary life.</i>

519
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,840
Don't forget to call me
when you have the time.

520
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,400
<i>Call me often.</i>

521
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,560
<i>Goodbye, Mr. Charan.</i>

522
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,480
I, Chakri, am leaving for London.

523
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,040
The moment has come.
