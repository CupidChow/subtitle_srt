2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,600
Khanin!

3
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,000
- Go!
- Dad!

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,640
Now your secret
is no longer safe from the enemy…

5
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,040
- This way!
<i>- …our journey to Emmaly won't be easy.</i>

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,560
Khanin is almost here.

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,240
I shall hold
the Royal Fencing Competition.

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,120
<i>You do know how dangerous it is</i>
<i>to deal with power struggles</i>

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,720
<i>before the Competition.</i>

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,640
I am unwell.

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,560
<i>I take the risk to bring my grandson back</i>

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,520
<i>because I trust no one</i>
<i>to protect Emmaly better than you.</i>

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,040
<i>For Emmaly,</i>
<i>Khanin must be the next prince.</i>

14
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,760
Your Royal Highness…

15
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,680
What?

16
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,400
This is Chakri, your butler.

17
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,480
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

18
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,160
I am the royal butler
assigned to serve Your Royal Highness.

19
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,200
Should you require anything,
please inform me at once.

20
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,040
Well…

21
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,640
There's no need for formality.

22
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,280
I wouldn't dare,

23
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,320
but you don't need to
speak so formally with me.

24
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,520
- But I--
- Your Royal Highness…

25
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,160
please let him fulfill his duties.

26
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,000
This way, Your Royal Highness.

27
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Allow me to guide you
to the royal dressing room

28
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,280
to prepare for the audience
with His Majesty the King.

29
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,480
Are you not coming?

30
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,240
That wouldn't be appropriate.

31
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,960
Why not?

32
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,280
Well, please follow me this way,
Your Royal Highness.

33
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,720
Your Royal Highness…

34
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,680
Young Prince.

35
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,040
Young Prince…

36
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,320
Who are you talking about?

37
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,280
You are Prince Khanin.

38
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,360
"Young Prince Master"
is another of your titles.

39
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,600
Hi.

40
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,360
Your Royal Highness, please don't do that.

41
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,080
Get up, please.

42
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,960
We can't handle it.
Please do not bow down.

43
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,520
You can't handle what?

44
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,920
The first thing you'll learn,

45
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,480
royal members
never lower their heads to anyone.

46
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,640
Wait. Is that the flag of Emmaly?

47
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,000
That's correct.

48
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,680
And the four flags that you see right now

49
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,960
are the flags of each region of Emmaly.

50
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,880
That is the flag of Assavadevathin,

51
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,280
featuring a golden horse
on a golden background,

52
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,880
with crossed swords behind.

53
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,280
Assavadevathin is located
in the north of Emmaly.

54
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,280
Next is the flag of Bhuchongpisut,

55
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,400
displaying a king cobra
spreading its hood,

56
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,800
adorned with diamonds,
set on a green background,

57
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,600
surrounded by roses.

58
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Bhuchongpisut lies to the east of Emmaly.

59
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,960
The flag of Meenanagarin

60
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,320
shows a blue shark with waves and pearls
on a blue background.

61
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,880
Meenanagarin is located
in the southern part of Emmaly,

62
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,640
near the sea.

63
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,160
Lastly, the flag of Davichmetha
features a phoenix spreading its wings

64
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,120
adorned with gems,
set on a pink background.

65
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,000
Davichmetha lies in the west of Emmaly.

66
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,440
Should you desire to know anything,

67
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,920
I am always here to answer.

68
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,560
There's nothing I don't know.

69
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,240
Mr. Chakri…

70
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,160
no need to be so formal with me.

71
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,520
I'm here for my dad, not to be a prince.

72
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,160
I…

73
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,840
How are things going?

74
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,840
Your Majesty, I humbly present myself.

75
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,080
I have brought the Earl Grey tea safely.

76
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,280
But something happened along the way,

77
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,960
and Mr. Thatdanai's whereabouts
are currently unknown.

78
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,559
How is Khanin? Is he hurt?

79
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,040
His Royal Highness is safe, Your Majesty.

80
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,880
And you? Did you get hurt?

81
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,880
Thank you, Your Majesty. I am unharmed.

82
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,720
My only concern is for Mr. Thatdanai.

83
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,360
I don't know how he is.

84
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,960
You don't need to be concerned.

85
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,160
Go find out
if Thatdanai is still alive or not,

86
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,240
and report back to me immediately.

87
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,040
As for the attackers,

88
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,280
very few know about Khanin's return.

89
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,400
One of them is a police officer of Emmaly.

90
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,200
I'm convinced it was an inside job.

91
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,240
If that's so,

92
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,000
immediately find out
who the mole inside this palace is.

93
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,480
Leave Khanin's protection to me.

94
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,440
I'll find someone to take your place.

95
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,640
You should hurry.

96
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,080
Right,

97
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,400
this is a projector developed
within our own nation of Emmaly.

98
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,840
It's a cutting-edge technology
used across all our cities.

99
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,760
Yet, for all our progress,

100
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,440
we continue to preserve
our noble traditions.

101
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,400
This is your royal dressing room,
Your Royal Highness.

102
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,440
May I inquire if there's anything
that you favor, Your Royal Highness?

103
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,800
Do I need to wear those?

104
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,960
Attire within the palace
must adhere to royal protocol.

105
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,920
On formal occasions or royal ceremonies,

106
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,200
one must dress by rank and title.

107
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,360
So something formal's happening today?

108
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,840
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

109
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,160
Soon, you must present yourself
to the King, who is your grandfather,

110
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,600
as well as to the major clans of Emmaly.

111
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,120
Your sense of fashion is amazing.

112
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,520
Can I have something simpler?

113
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Simpler?

114
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,280
Simpler… Something simpler…

115
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,840
How about this one?

116
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,600
Decorated with gold thread.

117
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,800
You just need to add your rank insignia.
That's it, Your Highness.

118
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,040
Something simpler.

119
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,640
That's not simpler at all.

120
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,040
You don't have anything simpler?

121
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,400
Since you are meeting
with His Majesty the King,

122
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,400
please wear this.

123
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,160
What?

124
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,760
What are you gonna do? I can do it myself.

125
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,560
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.

126
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,040
- Please forgive me, but…
- What? Hey.

127
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,040
- No!
- I'll help you, Your Royal Highness.

128
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,440
- Now.
- No need, I can do it.

129
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,320
Hey! I'm gonna do it myself.

130
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,520
Come on, I can do it.

131
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,440
Let us help.

132
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,400
- Ouch!
- Please let us.

133
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,760
Isn't it too tight?

134
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,000
What? There's more?

135
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,360
We're almost done.
You only need some accessories and…

136
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,400
a proper hairstyle.

137
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,440
I'm like a walking gold bar.

138
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,440
A walking gold bar?

139
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,000
You're funny, Your Royal Highness.

140
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,680
I have some exciting news
to share with you.

141
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,040
What is it, Your Majesty?

142
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
Hello.

143
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,160
I am… Khanin Assavadevathin.

144
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,840
That is your father.

145
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,320
Have a seat.

146
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,880
Please allow me to interrupt.

147
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,640
It's wonderful that Khanin is alive.

148
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,200
On behalf of the Meenanagarins,

149
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,600
I offer my sincere congratulations
to Your Majesty and Prince Tharin

150
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,640
for finding the heir.

151
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,880
We, the Davichmethas,
offer our congratulations as well.

152
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,040
We, the Bhuchongpisuts, offer ours too.

153
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,760
I appreciate that.

154
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,920
It's wonderful news, and I am deeply glad.

155
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,520
I mean no disrespect in raising this
on a day of celebration…

156
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,920
but how do we know for sure
that this person is Khanin

157
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,119
and is truly of
the Assavadevathin bloodline?

158
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,280
Should a DNA test
be conducted first, Your Majesty?

159
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,320
<i>Check this.</i>

160
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,440
This is Prince Rachata,
the head of the Bhuchongpisut clan

161
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,480
and the ruler of the eastern region,

162
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,400
which is rich in diamonds.

163
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,000
He has a single heir, his son,
Prince Ramil.

164
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,640
You need not worry, Prince Rachata.

165
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,720
The test has been conducted,
and the results are with me.

166
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,120
Your Majesty,

167
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,560
how can I trust that they are authentic

168
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,920
and not fabricated?

169
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,480
Prince Rachata, if you still have doubts,

170
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,600
you sure could arrange for another test,

171
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,480
since the Bhuchongpisuts
are knowledgeable in the medical field.

172
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,840
Am I correct?

173
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

174
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,360
Please allow me.

175
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,400
<i>This is Prince Chana,</i>

176
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,240
the head of the Davichmetha clan

177
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,880
and ruler of the western region,
wealthy and rich in gemstones.

178
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,640
<i>His sole heir is his daughter,</i>
<i>Princess Ava.</i>

179
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,720
Is there anyone else who still has doubts?

180
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,160
If no further concerns remain,

181
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,720
I shall arrange a celebration
to welcome Khanin Assavadevathin,

182
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,960
my grandson.

183
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,160
You are all welcome to attend.

184
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,360
This meeting is hereby concluded.

185
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
This is Prince Wasin,

186
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,280
the head of the Meenanagarin clan
and the ruler of the southern region,

187
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,360
which is prosperous in pearls.

188
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,000
He lost his consort and has no heirs.

189
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,080
Khanin.

190
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,360
Let's go.

191
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,240
It brings me great joy
to see our family gathered for a meal.

192
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,360
I've waited 22 years for this moment.

193
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,360
Thank you for coming back to me.

194
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,760
I'm happy too that you're back with us.

195
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,360
Is the food to your liking?

196
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,360
Let me know
if there's anything you'd like,

197
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,800
and I'll have the cooks
prepare it for you.

198
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,760
Prince Tharin, your father,

199
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,400
is the son of His Majesty the King.

200
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,480
He's the head of the Assavadevathin clan
and the ruler of the northern region,

201
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,160
which is rich in gold.

202
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,720
Prince Tharin lost his consort

203
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,560
and has one son…

204
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,880
Prince Khanin Assavadevathin.

205
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,520
I… I'm not picky.

206
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
Everything looks so amazing.

207
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Emmaly this, Emmaly that.

208
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
This food is Emmalian.

209
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,680
This house screams Emmaly.
Why not name me that too?

210
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,720
Is spaghetti your favorite food?

211
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,840
My dad wanted me
to get used to Emmalian food…

212
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,600
so he cooked this for me quite a lot.

213
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,280
I'm talking about… my dad, Thatdanai.

214
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,480
You must have trained in fencing
while you were with Thatdanai.

215
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,040
And I assume you also know
that our country…

216
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,120
has the finest fencers.

217
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I practiced it with my dad every day.

218
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,360
Thatdanai is a great fencer
and was once a coach for Tharin.

219
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,080
He later requested
to be your fencing coach,

220
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,080
even when you weren't born yet.

221
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,240
While you were in the UK,
did he teach you any skills

222
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,160
for the Competition?

223
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,320
The Competition?

224
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,600
Right.

225
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,920
You're a prince and my grandson,

226
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,560
the rightful heir who's eligible

227
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,680
to compete
in the Royal Fencing Competition

228
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,160
to bring the throne to your father.

229
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,600
Actually, I came here
only to see Thatdanai, my dad.

230
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,960
I do not wish to take on the title of heir

231
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,320
and will not compete in this competition.

232
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,960
Please inform everyone of my decision.

233
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,360
I understand.

234
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,240
We can talk about the competition later.

235
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,280
As for your title,
whether you take it or not,

236
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,680
you're still my grandson.

237
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,600
I'm going out to the balcony.
Please don't follow me.

238
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,720
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

239
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,040
Father.

240
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,920
Did I address you correctly?

241
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,920
There's no need for formality.

242
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,400
I'm sorry for not joining the Competition.

243
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,360
I know your reasons,
and I never meant to push you.

244
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,680
Take your time adjusting.

245
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,520
If you feel uncomfortable
or if you need anything,

246
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,800
don't hesitate to tell me.

247
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,160
I may not live in Davin,

248
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,400
but Assavadevathin is never far.

249
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,840
Can I ask you one more thing?

250
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,560
Sure.

251
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,160
Other than coming here
to wait for Thatdanai, my dad,

252
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,960
I came because I want to know
who attacked us.

253
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
Well…

254
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,800
About that,

255
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,920
I'll do my part to help uncover the truth.

256
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:53,080
Khanin, you must have been through a lot.

257
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,040
From now on,

258
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,520
would you let me protect you?

259
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
I…

260
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,560
Well…

261
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,760
I appreciate that.

262
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,760
It's already late.
I won't bother you any further.

263
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,280
I'll take my leave now.

264
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:52,040
Could it be that His Majesty the King
purposely kept Khanin's survival a secret

265
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,240
since the assassination
of Princess Khunita?

266
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Well…

267
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,760
He kept it a secret to protect Khanin.

268
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,200
I think it was a wise decision.

269
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:10,400
Now that Khanin has returned to Emmaly,
it is truly wonderful news.

270
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,680
With the return
of the Assavadevathin heir,

271
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,440
His Majesty will likely host
the Royal Fencing Competition soon.

272
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,320
That's uncertain.

273
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,280
Who really knows
what His Majesty has in mind?

274
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,280
The Competition is pointless

275
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,480
when bringing that boy back
already hints that…

276
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,280
the Assavadevathins…

277
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,040
aim to maintain their reign.

278
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,800
Perhaps you're reading too much into this.

279
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,320
So far, nothing has actually occurred.

280
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,120
I was informed that

281
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,800
Mr. Thatdanai's house in the UK
was burned to the ground.

282
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,520
A body, charred beyond recognition,
was found inside.

283
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,120
The parts of the body
have been sent for testing

284
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,600
to confirm whether it is Mr. Thatdanai.

285
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,080
Once the results are in,
I will report to you, Your Majesty.

286
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,680
No need to do that.

287
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,280
That body is Thatdanai's.

288
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,840
If Khanin can't let go of his past
and continues to dwell on it,

289
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,560
how can he possibly grow strong here?

290
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,960
Deliver the sad news
about Thatdanai to him.

291
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,480
Trust me,
and everything's gonna be all right.

292
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,520
What did you just say?

293
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,200
Answer me.

294
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,320
Tell me again. What did you just say?

295
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,920
Speak. Come on.

296
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,520
Thatdanai has passed away,
Your Royal Highness.

297
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,840
No, that's not true.

298
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,760
No!

299
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,880
- I don't believe that.
- That's enough.

300
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,760
- That can't be real.
- Khanin.

301
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,560
Tell me that wasn't true!

302
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,400
Don't cry. I'm right here.

303
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,360
Khanin, don't cry.

304
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,440
You should not be alone
at a time like this.

305
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,920
You should let Chakri keep you company.

306
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,840
I want to be alone.

307
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,720
You can keep me company, then.

308
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,199
I have come to bid farewell.

309
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,360
I have completed my duty

310
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,280
of bringing you back safely,
Your Royal Highness.

311
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,360
I don't think this…
is appropriate, Your Royal Highness.

312
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,840
What do you mean?

313
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,280
We shared a bed together for nights.
How come it's inappropriate now?

314
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,080
And I need to talk to you.

315
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,520
If I don't participate
in the Royal Competition,

316
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,520
will I be considered
a traitor to my family?

317
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,440
Everything… rests upon your decision.

318
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,240
Whatever you choose,
you have everyone's respect.

319
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,760
And you?

320
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,480
Do you want me to participate?

321
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,120
I do, Your Royal Highness.

322
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,040
Well then…

323
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,200
will you respect the choice I'll make?

324
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,360
I may not have many choices…

325
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,680
but whatever I choose…

326
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,400
can you be by my side forever?

327
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,080
Don't leave me.

328
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,240
I have an important announcement to make.

329
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:49,920
Three months from now,
the Royal Competition will be held

330
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,720
to appoint a new king
to ascend to the throne.

331
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,920
You may speak.

332
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,520
Why must the Royal Competition be held

333
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,800
when the heir of the Bhuchongpisuts
is the sole participant,

334
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,440
and the heir of the Assavadevathins
has no desire to participate?

335
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,240
What are your thoughts

336
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,960
now that you've heard
what Prince Rachata has stated?

337
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,640
You're making me dizzy looking at
you pacing, Your Royal Highness.

338
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,880
I will find out who killed my dad.

339
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,040
And you? Do you want me to participate?

340
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,000
I do, Your Royal Highness.

341
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
Khanin!

342
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,680
- Run away.
- Dad!

343
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,160
In every age,
power remains with those who win.

344
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,200
I am taking part in the Royal Competition.

345
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,680
The Assavadevathins will also participate.

346
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,040
You hold no right to participate
as you have not been officially appointed.

347
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,040
Regarding his title as heir,

348
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,680
I shall hold a ceremony soon
to ensure Khanin is the heir,

349
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,520
granting him the rightful place to compete
in the Royal Fencing Competition.

350
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,400
Does anyone oppose this decision?

351
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,360
It is thus decreed that

352
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,640
both an Assavadevathin and a Bhuchongpisut

353
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,080
shall partake in the Royal Competition.

354
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,720
Why don't I have the right, Your Majesty?

355
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,480
But no woman has ever participated before.

356
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,920
We have adhered to this tradition
for generations.

357
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,400
You must understand that women
do not have the same rights as men.

358
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,200
I will participate
in the Royal Competition.

359
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,080
No rule forbids women from competing.

360
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,480
It's just what everyone believes.
That's all.

361
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,720
The rules only say
that competitors must prove their worth.

362
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,480
Based on that,
I have every right to prove myself.

363
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,040
I agree with her, Your Majesty.

364
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,000
These days, men and women stand as equals.

365
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,080
Gender makes no difference.

366
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,480
It's skill that truly matters.

367
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,760
Upon reflection,

368
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,960
I see that what Ava said is true.

369
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,440
Therefore, I hereby declare that…

370
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,240
the heir of the Davichmetha clan…

371
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,120
may participate in the Competition.

372
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,880
A Bhuchongpisut,

373
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,400
a Davichmetha and an Assavadevathin

374
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,960
shall partake in the Royal Competition.

375
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,960
May each of you sharpen your abilities.

376
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,280
This concludes the meeting.

377
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,240
While one vanished…

378
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,400
and returned miraculously,

379
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,880
the other… is a woman.

380
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,480
By the customs of old,
you wouldn't be allowed to compete.

381
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,760
Fate truly favors
both of you, brother and sister.

382
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,600
Khanin…

383
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,160
and Ava…

384
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:02,560
With both of you joining the Competition,
it should be quite exciting.

385
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,640
Make sure you train hard, brother.

386
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,120
Thank you for your concern, Brother Ramil.

387
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,880
Thank you for today.

388
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,240
Forgive my boldness, Your Majesty,
but may I ask…

389
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,920
Were you not at all concerned
when Prince Rachata raised his objections?

390
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,040
Nothing is beyond my control.

391
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,360
Has anyone seen Mr. Charan?

392
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,200
I think he is
at the University of the Arts.

393
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,960
Why would he be there?
Is he still a student?

394
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,440
A professor.

395
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,760
He's a professor, Your Royal Highness.

396
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,720
Mr. Charan's probably back
at the university teaching art by now.

397
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,720
Teaching art?

398
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,880
Actually, he is
exceptionally talented in art.

399
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,440
More importantly,

400
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,120
he is a professor
at Morpheus University of the Arts,

401
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,080
which belongs to the Phithakthewa clan.

402
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,600
- Morpheus?
- Morpheus.

403
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Interesting.

404
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,280
Thought he was only good at fighting.

405
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,720
Turns out he's got an artistic side too.

406
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,800
Cat got your tongue?

407
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,360
Got this while we were attacked in the UK.

408
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,640
Why wait until now?

409
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,560
- Is it fake?
- I've checked.

410
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,320
Why would he leave evidence behind?

411
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,720
'Cause he doesn't care.

412
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,640
Okay. I've got this.

413
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,240
That's all?

414
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,880
You wanted me back here just for this?

415
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,440
One more thing.

416
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,240
Can you help me find someone?

417
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,440
Who is it?

418
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,840
Someone from the UK.
His whereabouts are unknown.

419
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,440
It's been staged
to look like he was killed.

420
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,760
You mean, he's alive
and you don't know where he is?

421
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,200
Right. You could try explaining it
more simply, you know.

422
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,200
Fine.

423
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,600
Basically, I want you to find Thatdanai,

424
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,480
the soldier who looked after
Prince Khanin back in the UK.

425
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,880
But this…
has to stay strictly confidential.

426
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,080
Hey…

427
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,640
Your Royal Highness.

428
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,080
Here we go again.

429
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,440
You're gonna ask
how I got here, aren't you?

430
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,000
I came to look for
Mr. Charan Phithakthewa.

431
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,120
We need to find Prince Khanin.

432
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,160
This could put our news on the map.

433
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,480
- Hold on.
- What?

434
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,720
How can you be sure he's here?

435
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,440
You sure it's true?

436
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,920
- Trust me.
- My apologies.

437
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,880
From my insider, it's the real deal.

438
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,920
Your insider's always wrong.

439
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,440
No, this one's not.
I saw someone from the palace.

440
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,040
Whoa.

441
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,760
I'll use the toilet.

442
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,240
Don't be long.

443
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,120
My apologies.

444
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,600
Why would you apologize? We didn't kiss.

445
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,680
Take the bike and meet me at the exit.

446
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,920
Yeah, right now.

447
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,680
Your Royal Highness!

448
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,200
I think we must return to the palace now.

449
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,640
Someone recognized me.

450
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,400
Keep them busy.

451
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,760
I'll take His Royal Highness
to the palace.

452
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,760
Understood.

453
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,200
Come with me, Your Royal Highness.

454
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,760
I'll take my leave, Your Royal Highness.

455
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,120
Where are you going? Stay the night here.

456
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,800
Why?

457
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,080
You can't do that now?

458
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,280
You're really leaving me, aren't you?

459
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,680
I apologize. My duties are completed.

460
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,320
Stop right there.

461
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,040
You're not allowed to leave.

462
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,760
Hey!

463
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,960
Thank you, Grandfather,
for understanding me.

464
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,320
I barely know anyone here.

465
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,600
Feel free.

466
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,600
Your Majesty.

467
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,800
Charan, I need you to do me a favor.

468
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:41,000
I, Prince Khanin Assavadevathin,

469
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:47,440
command you, Charan, to be by my side
and be my royal guard from now on.

470
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,840
I support this.

471
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,480
It's best to let Charan return to being
Khanin's personal guard as he was before.

472
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,600
Your will is my command, Your Majesty.

473
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,840
Good.

474
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,800
I'd like to speak with Charan privately.

475
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,920
May I have a moment alone with him?

476
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,840
Gosh, this way of living
feels so strange to me.

477
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,480
Is there something bothering you?

478
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,200
Your Royal Highness,

479
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,560
I don't think
I should speak informally to you…

480
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,560
due to our different statuses.

481
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,400
I will ensure to act appropriately
from now on.

482
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,280
I hope you will do so accordingly.

483
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,160
Nope. I'm fine talking this way.

484
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,560
And as a prince, I command you
to speak to me informally.

485
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,120
You wouldn't dare
defy the order of a prince, would you?

486
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,600
And by the way,

487
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,560
I'm still here
only to find the truth about my dad,

488
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,080
and you need to help me.

489
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,280
I assume you remember that, right?

490
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,160
Has the message from His Majesty
reached you all?

491
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,680
<i>He's appointed Charan as Khanin's guard.</i>

492
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,280
But honestly,
can Charan really handle that role?

493
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:16,120
His Majesty adopted him,

494
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,480
but he was never trained
or even wielded a weapon.

495
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,200
<i>All he did was grow up</i>
<i>to become an art professor.</i>

496
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,280
Does someone like that
really know how to fight?

497
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,400
His Majesty is a vicious old man.

498
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,040
Do not let your guard down.

499
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,440
<i>He just wants everyone</i>
<i>to believe it that way.</i>

500
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,640
And just like that,

501
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,600
the Phithakthewas shall reclaim
their position as royal guards.

502
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,920
ROYAL HEIRS TO COMPETE FOR THRONE

503
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,480
<i>Today, the Royal Palace has issued</i>
<i>a major announcement.</i>

504
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,080
<i>In three months,</i>

505
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:00,760
the Royal Competition will be held
to determine the next king.

506
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,360
The list of competitors is as follows.

507
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,600
<i>Prince Ramil of the Bhuchongpisut clan.</i>

508
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,520
To promote gender equality,

509
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,800
<i>Princess Ava of the Davichmetha clan</i>

510
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,080
will also take part
in this year's prestigious competition.

511
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,440
Another topic
that has been widely discussed recently

512
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,080
concerns the heir
of the Assavadevathin clan.

513
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:30,840
A breaking announcement confirms
that Prince Khanin Assavadevathin

514
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:35,040
<i>will be entering the Royal Competition</i>
<i>for the throne.</i>

515
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,120
<i>The Palace is also preparing</i>

516
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,840
<i>a formal introduction ceremony</i>
<i>for Prince Khanin Assavadevathin</i>

517
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,400
<i>to welcome and encourage him.</i>

518
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:47,560
I heard that Prince Khanin
is actually the real heir,

519
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,600
and the Royal Palace
already ran a DNA test to confirm it.

520
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:04,560
Yesterday's announcement from
the Royal Palace drew a lot of attention.

521
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,320
Everyone wants to know more about you.

522
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,040
My outfit was that striking.

523
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,240
I'd be surprised if I didn't get noticed.

524
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,680
Feel free, Your Highness.

525
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,680
If I could shine with a golden glow,
that'd be perfect.

526
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,600
Please don't make fun of yourself,
Your Royal Highness.

527
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,760
So, we may start.

528
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,240
Back in the day,
the ancestors of Emmalians

529
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,240
were very fond of social gatherings
and dancing.

530
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,880
One of their long-standing traditions
is switching partners while they dance.

531
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,800
Switching partners?

532
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,000
That's correct.

533
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,920
All attendees would continuously
change dance partners.

534
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,760
It's a tradition
that you ought to be familiar with.

535
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,880
Please teach me how to do it.

536
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,760
First of all,

537
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,240
it'd be better if you said, "Teach me."

538
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,160
No need for the word "please."

539
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,800
Sure.

540
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,080
Teach me…

541
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,480
okay?

542
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,480
That's amazing.

543
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,600
What are you doing?

544
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,160
What? Did I get it wrong?

545
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,040
You don't need to move it like this.

546
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,880
Just place your hand on my palm,
Your Royal Highness.

547
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,080
We'll start with the footwork.

548
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,000
Step forward.

549
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,720
One, two, three.

550
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,800
- Ouch.
- Oh.

551
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,600
I'm okay, Your Royal Highness.

552
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,000
Mistakes are common.

553
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:20,400
Left, and close.

554
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,200
Now, step backward. Backward.

555
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,800
- Right…
- Backward…

556
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,520
- And close.
- Close.

557
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,760
Now, we'll slowly spin.

558
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,440
Back. Spin.

559
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,960
Spin now.

560
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,240
Right, spin.

561
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,080
Seems like I'm starting to pick it up.

562
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,320
During your official introduction,

563
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,760
a lot of media outlets
will be covering the event

564
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,040
and showing great interest
in Your Highness.

565
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,840
That day,

566
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,800
news about you
is going to be all over social media.

567
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,160
If the public response is positive,

568
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,360
you will be warmly embraced by the people.

569
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:04,480
Thus, you should be ready,
especially in how you answer questions

570
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:11,520
and present yourself appropriately
as Prince Khanin Assavadevathin.

571
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,000
Your Royal Highness.
You didn't do that on purpose, did you?

572
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,440
I didn't.

573
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,720
It was a mistake.

574
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:40,120
<i>Emmaly, we stand in unity</i>

575
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:45,560
<i>We stand so tall and our land stays free</i>

576
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,280
<i>Through the storm, through the fight</i>

577
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,440
<i>We stand so strong</i>

578
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:56,320
<i>We give our all for Emmaly</i>

579
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:02,040
<i>Emmaly, people all belong</i>

580
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:07,480
<i>Emmaly, we are proud</i>
<i>To sing this noble song</i>

581
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:12,960
<i>Our flag shall wave so high, so strong</i>

582
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:18,640
<i>Emmaly's liberty forever long</i>

583
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:24,440
<i>Our flag shall wave so high, so strong</i>

584
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:31,520
<i>Emmaly's liberty forever long</i>

585
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,480
Thank you for joining me today.

586
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,720
To have finally found Khanin,

587
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,280
the only heir
of the Assavadevathin bloodline,

588
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,600
my grandson,

589
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,040
is a miracle beyond words.

590
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:54,360
This is my grandson,
Khanin Assavadevathin.

591
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,040
<i>You mean more to me</i>
<i>than you could ever imagine.</i>

592
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:11,600
But the care that goes beyond your duty
doesn't reflect well, Charan.

593
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,160
I have no other feelings or intentions.

594
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,520
But we're friends too, aren't we?

595
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,360
May I ask you to promise
that if I tell you something,

596
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,720
you won't risk yourself?

597
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,080
What have you got?

598
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:25,680
<i>I think we should</i>
<i>look into this ourselves first.</i>

599
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,240
<i>I want to go to Bhuchongpisut.</i>

600
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,840
<i>Your Highness, always remember</i>

601
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:32,080
<i>that Prince Ramil is your rival</i>
<i>in the Royal Competition.</i>

602
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,520
<i>I won't underestimate him.</i>
