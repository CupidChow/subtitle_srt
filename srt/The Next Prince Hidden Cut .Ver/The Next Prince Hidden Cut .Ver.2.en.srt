1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,920
FICTIONAL EVENTS,
VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED.

2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,960
Prince Khanin,
you carry the blood of royalty.

3
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,760
All these years,
was I never truly your son in your eyes?

4
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,320
It's never been like that.

5
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,680
I'm not going to Emmaly.

6
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,640
- He doesn't have a choice.
- Why wouldn't I?

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,560
It's my life.

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,680
Go.

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,440
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,520
Dad!

11
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,320
- Come on.
- Khanin, go!

12
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,640
- Dad!
- I'll be right there!

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,160
- Just go! Go!
- Come on.

14
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,040
- Go with Charan!
- Get them!

15
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,160
Dad!

16
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's go.

17
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,880
Hurry.

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,560
Watch out.

19
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,280
Dad.

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
Watch out!

21
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,840
Dad!

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,240
- Dad…
- Come with me.

23
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,400
Let go of me!

24
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,720
Let go. My dad needs help.

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,960
- Khanin!
- Let go of me.

26
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,360
Calm down.

27
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,280
Is this how you're gonna repay
your dad's efforts?

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,840
Come on.

29
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,680
Hurry up.

30
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm going back to my dad.

31
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,520
I can't let you do that.

32
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,680
We need to go now.

33
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,080
Please…

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,200
Let me go back to him, Charan.

35
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,080
You can't. We need to get out of here.

36
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,960
Hey!

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,560
Drop the gun.

38
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,360
Let's go.

39
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,400
Hey.

40
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,360
Now!

41
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,640
My apologies, sir.

42
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,000
Khanin made it.

43
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,600
All evidence has been dealt with.

44
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,440
I'll get the job done once I find him.

45
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,960
You need to stay here with me.

46
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,880
How do you know it's safe here?

47
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,480
They might be after us.

48
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,880
Trust me.

49
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,920
We're safe here.

50
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,760
It's the perfect size.
You really do know me well.

51
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,720
Hey, is this really necessary?

52
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,760
My dad might call me!

53
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,040
Hey, he would never contact you by phone
and risk exposing your location.

54
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,720
He trusts me.

55
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,920
If you don't trust me…

56
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,640
at least trust your dad.

57
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,400
My dad trusts you, so what can I say?

58
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,200
Let's just get some rest.
We've been through a lot today.

59
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,920
Are you hungry?
What are you craving? I'll order it.

60
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,720
We might need to stay here
for a few days.

61
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,760
Things are unpredictable.

62
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,680
I'm worried about your safety.

63
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,040
Get some sleep, okay?

64
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,120
Thanks.

65
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,400
- Hey.
- It hurts!

66
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,280
You want to put yourself in danger?

67
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,480
I'm going back to my dad.

68
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,040
You're only going to get caught.

69
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,920
Thatdanai is a skilled soldier.

70
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,480
He has always protected you.

71
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,440
What would you even do going there?

72
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,760
This phone doesn't work anymore,

73
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,240
and you're not allowed to use it.

74
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,480
I hope you understand…
that your identity must remain a secret.

75
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,960
How did you unlock the handcuffs?

76
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Only one of my hands was handcuffed.

77
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,080
Anyone could unlock them.

78
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,400
Show me how.

79
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,600
Your arm.

80
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,120
You want me to show you, right?

81
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,920
Why did you have to learn that?

82
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,920
I have my own duties.

83
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,000
And you have--

84
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,080
You're gonna say my duty
is to go back to Emmaly with you?

85
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,200
It's about time.

86
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,800
You must return to secure
the Assavadevathins' power.

87
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,280
Power?

88
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,640
And to make sure
that Prince Tharin, your father,

89
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,320
ascends the throne as the King of Emmaly.

90
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,200
Today's agenda is to review the economic
progress of all regions, correct?

91
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

92
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,560
Let's start with Tharin.

93
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,520
The Assavadevathin gold mining operations

94
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,640
continue to yield results as projected.

95
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,880
Clients from neighboring countries
have expressed satisfaction with our gold.

96
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,240
As for Bhuchongpisut,

97
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,480
we're facing grave difficulties
in the export of diamonds

98
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,600
due to illegal imports
from prohibited countries.

99
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,280
Would Your Majesty be able
to expedite the legislation

100
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,800
preventing the import of diamonds
from such countries?

101
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,440
I have not been idle.

102
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,320
But legislation must follow due procedure.

103
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,680
I hope you understand.

104
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

105
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,960
How are Prince Chana's territory
of Davichmetha

106
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,760
and Prince Wasin's territory
of Meenanagarin faring?

107
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,560
We are facing no difficulties.

108
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
These numbers are approximates.

109
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,760
We've begun selling gemstones
using blockchain technology,

110
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,720
and the figures are quite promising.

111
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,760
As for Meenanagarin,

112
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,520
we sincerely thank the Assavadevathins
for their support with research,

113
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,840
which has enabled
our dark champagne pearls

114
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,400
to have such distinctive qualities.

115
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,320
You're very modest.

116
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,920
We're not strangers, you know.

117
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,240
We should help one another.

118
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,840
Father.

119
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Please summon
the royal physician, Your Majesty.

120
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,760
Thank you, but I'm fine.

121
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,960
Being unable to meet
Your Majesty regularly,

122
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,720
we can't help but be concerned.

123
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,120
It's due to The Rule

124
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,800
that prohibits four of us from entering
the palace without permission.

125
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,560
The Rule exists
to ensure everyone's safety.

126
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,040
To avoid a tragedy
similar to what happened 22 years ago.

127
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

128
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,680
Right now…

129
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,040
The meeting is over.
Thank you all for attending.

130
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,000
You called for me.
Is something the matter, Father?

131
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,920
I've been keeping a secret from you.

132
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,920
Khanin's still alive.

133
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Father…

134
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,560
What did you just say?

135
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,640
Khanin is on his way back.

136
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,560
I'll take good care of our son.

137
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,040
Why so serious?

138
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,160
It's just a fun practice, Ava.

139
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,200
I know it is.

140
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,200
But I'm afraid
I can't go easy on you, Ramil.

141
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,280
The first to score 15 points wins.

142
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,040
On guard.

143
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Are you ready?

144
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,440
Go.

145
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,320
Halt.

146
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,280
Are you ready? Go.

147
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,640
Halt.

148
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,320
Halt.

149
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,360
A Davichmetha and a Bhuchongpisut…

150
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,280
Halt.

151
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,080
It's nice that they're good friends.

152
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,520
Halt.

153
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,960
They've actually been friends
since they were kids.

154
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,240
Halt.

155
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,640
They're almost like siblings.

156
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,720
Halt.

157
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,360
Attack. Parry-riposte.

158
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,360
Ramil's skills remain as sharp as ever.

159
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,440
His talent is undeniable…

160
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,720
as one would expect
from the son of Prince Rachata.

161
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,200
Your skills are impressive.

162
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,600
May we have a return match next week?

163
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,080
It can be in Bhuchongpisut.

164
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,080
I can hardly claim to have defeated
a marvelous young lady

165
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,400
as gifted in fencing as you are.

166
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,640
Perhaps my victory was due to your injury.

167
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,640
Stop flattering me, Ramil.

168
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,480
Well, I wasn't.

169
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,440
Now that the news is spreading,

170
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,560
it's unfortunate that you're a woman.

171
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,080
If you weren't, you'd surely be
a fearsome competitor

172
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,320
in the Royal Competition.

173
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,480
However…

174
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,480
do you know why, when the heir wins,

175
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,000
the father takes the throne?

176
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,720
Because in Emmaly, raising an heir
is considered equally important

177
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,240
to ruling the kingdom.

178
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,600
I might be a woman,

179
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,080
but I've studied the royal traditions
and Emmaly's history thoroughly.

180
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,800
From the Westerners, right?

181
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,440
You're still not as fluent in Emmaly
as you used to be.

182
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,760
Well, speaking isn't part
of the competition.

183
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,560
Be that as it may,
tradition forbids women to compete.

184
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,760
It's quite unfortunate

185
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,120
that I'm the only male heir
from all four clans.

186
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,360
Your Royal Highnesses.

187
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,120
My attention is needed elsewhere.

188
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,840
I shall take my leave now, Ramil.

189
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,480
Where have you been?

190
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,400
I was accompanying Prince Rachata,
Your Royal Highness.

191
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,000
Are you confused about your duty?

192
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,280
You should be with me.

193
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,680
Not with someone else.

194
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,600
Please let go of me.

195
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,160
If anyone sees us, we'll be in trouble.

196
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,080
Who would see us?

197
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,600
Soon, we Bhuchongpisuts
will reclaim the throne of this palace.

198
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,240
Whoever plans to gossip about us
must have some real guts.

199
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,640
We need to change the plan.
I'll reach out to you once we're there.

200
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,960
We should leave now, Your Highness.

201
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,760
Can you speak normally?

202
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,240
There's no need for formalities. Please.

203
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
By the way…

204
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,320
I want to stay here.

205
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,840
- I need to find my dad.
- You can't.

206
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,880
This place is too dangerous for you.

207
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,360
If Thatdanai made it,

208
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,160
the first place he'd go to is Emmaly.

209
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,200
He'd know that you'd be there.

210
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,840
I still have no idea who tried to harm us.

211
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,200
You want me to just leave?

212
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,720
If you want to find out
who harmed you and your dad,

213
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,480
going to Emmaly is the only way.

214
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,520
Fine.

215
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,360
If he's going there, I'll go, too.

216
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,640
Now that the secret about you
is no longer safe from the enemy,

217
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,600
our journey to Emmaly won't be easy.

218
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,840
A message from Mr. Charan just came in,

219
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,000
saying that for safety reasons,
the arrival may be delayed.

220
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,240
The enemy knows about the plan
and is currently pursuing both of them.

221
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,120
My apologies.

222
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,840
What?

223
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,880
I actually wanted to book business class,

224
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,600
but I feared fewer people
would draw more attention.

225
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,480
Why would you apologize?

226
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
What's with you?

227
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,360
I'm fine.

228
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,200
I'm just a regular guy.

229
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,640
It's not a big deal.

230
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,000
I also prefer a window seat.

231
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,000
Did you have a nightmare?

232
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,360
Worried about the plane crashing?

233
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,800
Hey.

234
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,560
Can I ask you something?

235
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,280
Be honest.

236
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,720
You should already know
that taking me with you is dangerous.

237
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,000
Why are you still doing this job,

238
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,080
risking your life,

239
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,360
and coming alone?

240
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,160
It's my duty, Your Royal Highness.

241
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,880
Come on. Stop being formal.

242
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,920
I flew across the skies…

243
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,240
mainly to escort Your Royal Highness
back to Emmaly safely.

244
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,640
A duty…

245
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,760
Is that why Dad took care of me?

246
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,600
He was probably just doing his duty.

247
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,320
Thatdanai is an exceptional person,

248
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,280
entrusted with the important task
of looking after you.

249
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,680
I can't speak for him.

250
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,280
But I believe that for him,
it wasn't just about duty.

251
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,760
It was much more than that.

252
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,680
How come…

253
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,520
people still hunt others down
in this day and age?

254
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,400
In every age…

255
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,400
power remains with those who win.

256
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
And you?

257
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,880
Do you desire it, too?

258
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,520
Power doesn't matter to me.

259
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
But you do, Your Royal Highness.

260
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,800
What happens when we arrive in Emmaly?

261
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,400
Once we're there, Your Royal Highness…

262
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,520
I said no formality.

263
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,040
Okay.

264
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,840
Once you make it to Emmaly,

265
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,440
you'll meet your family.

266
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
A family that I don't know at all.

267
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,160
When the time comes,
will you still be there for me?

268
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,200
It's a lot better out here.

269
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,520
If we fly straight to Emmaly,
I know we'll run into those guys again.

270
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,080
Isn't Hanoi a better option?

271
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,840
They've probably thought about it already.

272
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,160
We're still not completely safe here.

273
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,720
How can we go to Emmaly from here?

274
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,200
I have a friend in Thailand.
He can help us.

275
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,960
<i>Should we go on a trip to Thailand?</i>

276
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,440
It's close to Emmaly.

277
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,360
Their culture and language
are similar to ours.

278
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,600
Why don't we just go to Emmaly then?

279
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,280
You miss that place, don't you?

280
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,440
I'm not ready to go there yet.

281
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,560
Well…

282
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,360
we could just go to Thailand.

283
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm fluent in Emmaly.

284
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,240
That means I can speak Thai fluently, too.

285
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,200
My Thai friend once told me…

286
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,920
that my accent sounds
exactly like a Thai's.

287
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,240
I'm better at it than any other language.

288
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,120
One of my friends told me Thai food
is delicious. Have you tried it?

289
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,240
I think I just scrolled past it.

290
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,040
Here, have you tried this?

291
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,200
Som tam.

292
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,840
Right! Som tam!

293
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,240
My friend says it's heavenly.

294
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,600
"Som" means orange, but why is it
part of the name for papaya salad?

295
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,720
Here.

296
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,920
Let's go.

297
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,640
Hey.

298
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,760
Yes?

299
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,760
Is everything okay?

300
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,240
Yeah.

301
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,040
You must not leave my side.

302
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,440
Okay.

303
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,360
We've been followed.

304
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,160
- Sorry for cutting the line.
- That's all right.

305
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,280
We can go now.

306
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,360
What's the hurry?

307
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,840
Where are you going?

308
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,880
This place.

309
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,480
That condo. I've been there before.

310
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,600
Where have you guys been?

311
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,720
- Japan.
- I've been there.

312
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,880
I worked there ten years ago.

313
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,200
The pay was great.

314
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,200
Right.

315
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,720
You guys are looking great today.

316
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,560
Are you celebs or something?

317
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,120
Not gonna talk, are we?

318
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,200
Are you still with me?

319
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,480
You seriously won't say anything to me?

320
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
Gosh.

321
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,560
Wait.

322
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,440
Why are they tailgating us?

323
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,480
You want this, don't you?

324
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,120
Fine, let's do it.

325
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,480
Can't you go any faster?

326
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,000
Sure, we'll see.

327
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,600
- Any faster, sir?
- Here we go.

328
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,360
Bangkok Drift!

329
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,400
This is getting out of hand.
They're after you, aren't they?

330
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,080
I'll pull over. You guys have to leave.

331
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,360
CHATUCHAK MARKET

332
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,520
Get off. Now.

333
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,520
What do we do now?

334
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,800
They're still after us.

335
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,960
Let's go inside first.

336
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,159
This way.

337
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,239
You two go that way.

338
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,040
You. Come with me.

339
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,120
That's them!

340
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,680
Stay behind me.

341
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,800
Hey!

342
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,000
Charan!

343
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,640
Hey!

344
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,640
Are you all right?

345
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,440
Come on.

346
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,000
Change your clothes.

347
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,960
Aren't you going to change?

348
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,360
Show me your arm.

349
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,160
I'm good.

350
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,160
Come on.

351
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,560
You'll get sick.

352
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,720
Just worry about yourself.

353
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,080
Thank you.

354
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,360
- Your wound…
- It's all right.

355
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,040
I think they're gone.

356
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,400
What's next?

357
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,680
I've sent our location to my friend.

358
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,920
Won't he get in trouble?

359
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,960
You lost your phone?

360
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,680
Hey!

361
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,120
How did you get in here?

362
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,800
We're sorry.
We were just avoiding the rain.

363
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,720
You're trespassing right now.

364
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,040
I'm calling the police.

365
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
Sir…

366
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,280
do you really think
we broke into this place?

367
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,000
Wait, you look… familiar.

368
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,680
You're like…

369
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,040
Like who?

370
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,000
Like that famous singer.

371
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,840
Really?

372
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,840
Thank you, sir.

373
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,880
We're so sorry for being in here
without your permission.

374
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,520
We really needed shelter from the rain.

375
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,520
It was raining cats and dogs, and…

376
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,680
my friend's injured.

377
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,480
And how did that happen?

378
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,920
It was some crazy guy.

379
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,080
He even took our phones.

380
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,960
Can we borrow yours to call our friend?

381
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,560
Please?

382
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,040
Please.

383
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,000
Sure.

384
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,160
Thank you.

385
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,360
Please forgive my friends.

386
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,200
We're sorry for bothering you.

387
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,480
Come on, that's fine.

388
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,320
- I'm willing to help.
- I know.

389
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,040
I was really shocked, though.

390
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,920
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

391
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,720
Let's go.

392
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,680
Yo, big bro.

393
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,440
It's been ages, and the first thing you do
is bring me trouble.

394
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,560
Thanks, though.

395
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,480
Here.

396
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,920
And who's this guy?

397
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,240
My brother.

398
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,200
Your brother?

399
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,960
Like, a biological one or…

400
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,720
You're such a pain in the ass.

401
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,360
There's no need to be rude.

402
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,720
Thank you for helping me… and Ran.

403
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,080
No problem, bro.

404
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,680
Come on. Let's go.

405
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,000
Have a seat.

406
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,080
Right.

407
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,920
I'm Vetith.

408
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,480
I'm Ran's friend.

409
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,160
We went to the same school.

410
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,600
- What?
- What?

411
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,240
He's not your brother, is he?

412
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,680
The cat's out of the bag.

413
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,920
I knew it.

414
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,880
We met in the UK

415
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,080
before we…

416
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,840
started dating.

417
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,360
I knew it.

418
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,160
You're so quiet now, huh?

419
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,400
He's not.

420
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,520
My Unc-unc…

421
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,000
is the cutest!

422
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,720
You're getting chubbier, aren't you?

423
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,440
Look at those chubby cheeks.

424
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,400
Wait a second.

425
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,560
Did you just call him "Unc-unc"?

426
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,360
That's just a nickname for my boyfriend.

427
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,720
It's from…

428
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,400
Because he's naggy like a grumpy old man.

429
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,320
How about you, Ran?

430
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,760
What do you call him?

431
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,320
That one, Unc-unc.

432
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,680
You always call me that.

433
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,440
Cutie.

434
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,040
Cutie.

435
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,320
Cutie?

436
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,160
I am that, so that's what you call me.

437
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,440
"Naughty."

438
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,080
That's cute.

439
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,280
But it's kinda like…

440
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,320
It's too boring.

441
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,280
Let's call him…

442
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,960
"Tue-tue."

443
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,360
Goes well with "Unc-unc."

444
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,000
Tue-tue and Unc-unc.

445
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,360
Tue-tue?

446
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,680
Unc-unc?

447
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,760
Can you call me "Tue-tue"?

448
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,600
Okay…

449
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,760
my Tue-tue.

450
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,200
Hey. Hey, Ran.

451
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,000
Who hurt you and your boyfriend?

452
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,240
What did you guys do?

453
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,080
Why does everything have to be so serious?

454
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,000
- Can we talk for a moment?
- Sure.

455
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:15,160
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.
I didn't mean to joke around with you.

456
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,240
You don't need to call me that.

457
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,680
Who said my identity must remain a secret?

458
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,000
We can trust this guy.

459
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,320
What? That's why I went all out.

460
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,200
How do I get him to stop bowing?

461
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,080
That's enough.

462
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,400
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

463
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,000
Please talk to me normally.

464
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,040
What's the plan for tomorrow?

465
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,400
You sure it's safe on trains?

466
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,880
Come on. They'll find you
no matter where you go.

467
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,440
Don't worry. I've got a plan.

468
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,800
Hello.

469
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,240
How can I help you?

470
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,040
Have you seen this person?

471
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,120
I think he just asked me for directions.

472
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,320
There! That's him.

473
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,360
Is it him?

474
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,560
Ran.

475
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,360
Let's go.

476
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,280
How do you like my plan?

477
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,320
What a flawless plan.

478
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,080
How can you not laugh?

479
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,280
We have no choice.

480
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,280
They're at the platform.
I'll get there first.

481
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,560
Don't get exposed, okay?

482
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,040
I'll see you there.

483
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,240
Can I get you something?

484
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,520
Can I get you something?

485
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,680
That's better.

486
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,520
Thai inhalers are so good.

487
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,280
They make you feel refreshed.

488
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,200
Wanna try it?

489
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,880
It's great.

490
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,320
Unc-unc?

491
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,120
Do you think I'm a good actor?

492
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:04,880
You're not bad.

493
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,800
No compliments, huh?

494
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,880
I did a great job
of acting like your boyfriend.

495
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,520
Even Vetith fell for it.

496
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,880
Give me some attention.

497
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,560
There's no need to pretend right now.

498
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,640
Fine, I'll stop.

499
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,680
Thanks for protecting me.

500
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,880
When can I take this off?

501
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,480
It's making me laugh.

502
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,040
Wearing it is good for you.

503
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,080
It's for your safety.

504
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,400
Let's change our clothes before we arrive.

505
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,360
Father…

506
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,040
I must head back to Assavadevathin
this evening.

507
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,160
That can wait.

508
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,320
Khanin will be here soon.

509
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,000
To make sure Assavadevathin stands firm,

510
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,320
I will be holding
the Royal Fencing Competition.

511
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,680
When do you plan to do that?

512
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,960
By this evening,
I shall declare to the people

513
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,640
that a new King is to be chosen.

514
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,240
But Khanin's about to come back.

515
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,960
I don't want him to participate so soon.

516
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,520
You do realize how dangerous it is
to be one of the competitors.

517
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,040
Tharin.

518
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,360
Yes, Your Majesty?

519
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,440
I am unwell.

520
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,560
<i>Do I really need to stay here?</i>

521
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,520
<i>Yes, Your Royal Highness.</i>

522
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,280
<i>This is the outer section.</i>
<i>Your residence is located at the back.</i>

523
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,760
<i>Please, Your Highness.</i>

524
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,280
Why was I never told about this?

525
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,600
I ordered them to keep it a secret.

526
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,320
I'm willing to risk bringing
my grandson back

527
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,960
because deep down, I know…

528
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,640
that there's no one I can trust
to protect the people of Emmaly

529
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,600
more than you, Tharin.

530
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,720
<i>For Emmaly's sake,</i>

531
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,800
<i>Khanin must be the next prince.</i>

532
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,160
I am Khanin Assavadevathin.

533
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,480
I mean no disrespect by bringing this up
on a day of celebration,

534
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,840
but how can we be sure that this person

535
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,040
is truly of the Assavadevathin bloodline?

536
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,040
His Majesty will likely host
the Royal Fencing Competition soon.

537
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,880
While one vanished
and returned miraculously,

538
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,440
the other is a woman.

539
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,680
I'd like Your Highness to compete.

540
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,480
Will you respect the choice I make?

541
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,160
This is my grandson,
Khanin Assavadevathin.
