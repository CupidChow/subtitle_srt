1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,040
FICTIONAL EVENTS,
VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED.

2
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,960
PREVIOUSLY

3
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,800
The care that goes beyond that closeness
doesn't reflect well, Charan.

4
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,960
I'm taking care of His Royal Highness.

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,080
I have no other feelings or intentions.

6
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,920
But we're friends, too, aren't we?

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,160
I returned and agreed to compete
to find out what happened to Dad.

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,280
I had Vedhis look into the evidence
I got from one of the attackers in the UK.

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,720
<i>Have you told Grandfather?</i>

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,600
- You're the first to know. I'll tell--
- Don't tell him.

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,520
<i>Let's look into this ourselves first.</i>

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,080
We are delighted
that you came to visit our city.

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,720
There's still one more important place
I'd like to show you.

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,879
Prince Khanin.

15
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,920
Prince Khanin.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,720
- Are you wounded?
- I'm sorry to make you worry.

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,680
<i>You mean more to me</i>
<i>than you could ever imagine.</i>

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,320
Prince Calvin of Bhujar

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,400
is to come and further his studies
in the arts at your university.

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,040
I fear that

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,640
I will have no time
to dedicate to training Prince Khanin.

22
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,800
Go on and do what you truly love.

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,760
Some distance
between Khanin and Charan

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,200
might be for the better.

25
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,400
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,560
Is something the matter?

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,520
Mr. Wirun requests
Prince Khanin to hurry up,

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,120
as the royals have gathered
in the grand hall.

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,520
This way, please.

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
Khanin!

31
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,760
How are you doing?
Have you settled in all right?

32
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,199
Kind of, actually.

33
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,560
You must be unfamiliar
with Emmaly's customs.

34
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,800
Hence, your manner
is so at odds with ours.

35
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,080
Your Royal Highnesses,
it shall soon be time.

36
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,640
Please proceed inside.

37
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,400
We are gathered here today

38
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,960
to propose fair terms
for this year's Royal Competition.

39
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,520
All are welcome to voice their thoughts.

40
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,320
I worry for Ava, Your Majesty.

41
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,840
She's a woman,

42
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,480
and in competitions
between men and women,

43
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,200
it is not uncommon
for the men to hold back.

44
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,800
Isn't gender irrelevant in this matter?

45
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,080
When the match begins,
none of the competitors will show mercy.

46
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,760
You're suggesting that
women stand equal to men?

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,120
Does my presence mean nothing?

48
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,440
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

49
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,080
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

50
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,520
For this Royal Competition,

51
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,440
all clans with heirs
should be allowed to participate.

52
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,720
The Competition shall proceed as always

53
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,160
in accordance with
the traditions of Emmaly.

54
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,920
May I speak, Your Majesty?

55
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,560
You may.

56
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,520
I humbly propose
an addition to the Competition.

57
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,440
While fencing remains
our proud tradition,

58
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,279
it may no longer be sufficient.

59
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,480
I propose we include a test of ingenuity.

60
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,480
The diverse talents of our heirs

61
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,280
will strengthen our kingdom's standing
on the global stage.

62
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,200
Would it be a good idea to include
a quiz competition, Your Majesty?

63
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,440
It would enhance the Competition.

64
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
Furthermore,

65
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,920
we could allow the people
to participate by voting.

66
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,120
I agree with Prince Wasin.

67
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,760
Beyond fencing and ingenuity,

68
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,080
in addition to those competitions,

69
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,200
wouldn't it be wise
to include archery as well?

70
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,160
I agree with Prince Chana, Your Majesty.

71
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,480
Very well, let us follow these rules

72
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,160
and host three competitions
for this year's Royal Competition.

73
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,640
I must respectfully disagree,
Your Majesty.

74
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,040
Fencing has been
our long-standing tradition,

75
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,920
and altering the rules
would be highly inappropriate.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,840
Should Prince Rachata disagree,
I completely understand.

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,320
After all,
I have no heirs to carry on my lineage.

78
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,960
My proposal was made
only out of goodwill toward Emmaly.

79
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,880
The tests of ingenuity

80
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,040
and archery skills
are indeed appropriate.

81
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,640
Let all preparations be made.

82
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,760
Khanin, Ramil, and Ava,

83
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,960
the heirs of the three clans,

84
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,760
are to gather in Davin City
for their training.

85
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

86
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,000
Let the Royal Palace make it known…

87
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,440
the Fifth Royal Competition…

88
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,480
shall take place in the near future.

89
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,160
WHERE ARE YOU?

90
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,720
ANSWER?
WHEN WILL YOU COME?

91
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
- Look!
- What's wrong with you?

92
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,520
<i>That was Professor Charan?</i>

93
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,120
<i>Yeah, Professor Charan Phithakthewa,</i>

94
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,840
<i>the nationally renowned art instructor.</i>

95
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,520
His family owns our university,

96
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,120
<i>and he's also adopted</i>
<i>by His Majesty, the King.</i>

97
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,320
Have you seen this?

98
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,560
It's a fan page of him and Prince Khanin.

99
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,520
They're so cute.

100
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,560
That's adorable.

101
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,520
Hey, I think I'll go to
the square this evening

102
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,160
to join the environmental campaign march.

103
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,440
You coming?

104
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,840
Who's coming with you?

105
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,520
The usual guys.

106
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,920
Sure, I'll come.

107
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,840
Let's go.

108
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,680
Wait…

109
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,960
- Hey, Jay.
- Yeah?

110
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,320
Your nose is bleeding.

111
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,320
Sit down right here.

112
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,200
Shit.

113
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
- Got any tissue paper?
- No.

114
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,120
I'll go find you some.

115
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,720
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

116
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,480
Jeez…

117
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,720
How come you're back so early?

118
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,640
I'm sorry.
I thought you were my friend.

119
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,160
It's okay.
Do you want me to call an ambulance?

120
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,160
That's all right. It's just a nosebleed.

121
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,640
If you're feeling better,
please excuse me.

122
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Okay.

123
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,200
Wait, hey! Your handkerchief…

124
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,680
What?

125
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,520
If you need anything else,
Your Royal Highness…

126
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Thank you.

127
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,800
Please just call me Calvin.

128
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
Come in.

129
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,720
Hi, Professor.

130
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,200
I've been informed that this semester,
I'll be a student assistant again

131
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,960
just like I was last semester.

132
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,200
That's right. Let's work well together.

133
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,160
Sure.

134
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,720
This is Calvin…

135
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,680
an exchange student from Bhujar.
He just transferred into our program.

136
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,720
Hi, I'm Jay.

137
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,520
Calvin's still getting used to the place.

138
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,040
Please keep an eye on him for me.

139
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,080
Sure.

140
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,200
Over here is our faculty building,

141
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,360
and this entire area
also belongs to our faculty.

142
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,480
By the way,
what made you decide to study here?

143
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,400
In my country, this place is renowned
for its excellence in the arts.

144
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,840
Which is your area of expertise?

145
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,240
Painting?

146
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,440
I haven't figured that out.

147
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,520
I know how to do everything, though.

148
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,840
How about you?

149
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,640
Sculpture, I believe.

150
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,680
- I see.
- Right…

151
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,120
the handkerchief
I borrowed from you this morning…

152
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,080
I'll have it cleaned
before returning it to you.

153
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,760
That's fine. It's yours now.

154
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,800
You can't do that. It seems pricey, too.

155
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,640
I'll clean it, sanitize it,
and give it back to you.

156
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,520
The national flag of Emmaly

157
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,160
features a crest
that unites the emblems of all four clans.

158
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,560
The emblem of the Assavadevathin clan
is a golden horse

159
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,840
since their region is known
for extensive gold mining operations.

160
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,640
As a result, gold has become
a key economic product of their domain.

161
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,400
You don't seem very focused today,
Young Prince.

162
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,840
I'm too tired, Chakri.

163
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,240
Well then…

164
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,760
you should have some rest.

165
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,520
Let's take a break from the lesson

166
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,200
and check this out.

167
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,880
Here's the list of top fencing coaches

168
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,480
that Prince Tharin has arranged
for Your Royal Highness.

169
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,720
Why do I need to see it?

170
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,640
Prince Tharin truly cares about you,

171
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,840
so he's sent skilled coaches
for you to choose from.

172
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,920
You can choose one for me, then.

173
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,600
I can't, Your Royal Highness.
Please choose one.

174
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,720
I don't feel like doing anything.

175
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,680
At least have a look at it, please?

176
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,160
Please?

177
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,080
- You want me to choose a coach?
- That's right, Your Royal Highness.

178
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,520
But I just remembered that…

179
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,080
you're still keeping something from me.

180
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,880
If you tell me where Charan is,
then I'll agree to choose.

181
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,920
I have no idea, Your Royal Highness.

182
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,600
No coaches for me, then.

183
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,560
No, you can't do that!

184
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,480
Please choose one.

185
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,200
If you don't tell me where he is,
I won't choose.

186
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,640
I'll go find him myself.

187
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,120
That's even worse, Your Royal Highness!

188
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,880
If you leave the palace by yourself,

189
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,640
I'll end up locked away forever,
Your Royal Highness.

190
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,840
Then, you'll take me to him.

191
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,520
Your Highness!

192
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,480
You wanna play tag, Your Royal Highness?

193
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,000
Please don't…

194
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,480
Your Royal Highness…

195
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,440
Your Royal Highness! Your Royal Highness!

196
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,160
Okay, I give up.
You win, Your Royal Highness.

197
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,080
Okay.

198
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,600
You win, Your Royal Highness.

199
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,400
This one.

200
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,440
We're done with the coach now?

201
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,280
Let's go find Charan.

202
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,560
Your Royal Highness!

203
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,040
- Let's go change.
- Come on, Your Royal Highness!

204
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,120
Relax completely and
let your brush move with your feelings.

205
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,280
What you went through
must have drained you, right?

206
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,800
Have something sweet.
It might help ease your stress.

207
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,320
Thank you.

208
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,520
<i>The Garden of Eden…</i>

209
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,040
Haven't you finished it yet?

210
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,240
I haven't had time to do so…

211
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,800
but I should have more time for art
from now on.

212
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,240
That gorgeous Garden of Eden
really shows how greedy people can be.

213
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,960
We all desire to have everything.

214
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,440
The more forbidden something is,

215
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,520
the more we want to possess it.

216
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,480
Such feelings are difficult to restrain.

217
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,480
Your Royal Highness, you are the most
important person in the world for me.

218
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,280
How did the last class go?

219
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,720
I did an abstract painting.

220
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,920
I saw the painting you did last class.

221
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,720
Is something bothering you?

222
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,760
That's a tough question.

223
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,840
If something's troubling you,
you can let it out through your artwork.

224
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,080
Well…

225
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,760
About what happened…

226
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,240
I can't say much about it.

227
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,040
But as an Emmalian,

228
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,360
I just want you to know that

229
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,080
I was worried about Prince Khanin, too.

230
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,120
Please do not let that trouble you.

231
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,640
His Royal Highness is safe now.

232
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,720
Hearing it directly from his royal guard
has put my mind at ease.

233
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,960
You may continue your painting.

234
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,840
Okay.

235
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,080
Why are you here, Your Royal Highness?

236
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,400
I was just passing by.

237
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,840
Are you okay, Your Royal Highness?

238
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,520
Yeah, I'm fine. Don't worry.

239
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,440
Right, His Royal Highness
was looking for a toilet.

240
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,560
This way, please.

241
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,720
That's strange.
How come His Royal Highness is here?

242
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,440
I'll see you next week.

243
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,440
Why are you here, Your Royal Highness?

244
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,600
I came to…

245
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,440
look around

246
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
and learn.

247
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,240
Why aren't you at the palace with me?

248
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,720
Why do you have to be here?
You didn't answer any of my texts.

249
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,800
I'm a professor,

250
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,280
and I have been ordered by His Majesty

251
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,040
to look after the prince
from the neighboring country.

252
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,880
Where is he, then?

253
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
You were with Paytai, weren't you?

254
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,680
Mr. Paytai is a student
in my special class.

255
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,960
That's why you don't have time.

256
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,080
I was merely doing my duty.

257
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,880
What about your duty
to protect and take care of me,

258
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,160
and remain loyal to the Assavadevathins?

259
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,080
I, Khanin Assavadevathin,

260
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,360
command you, Charan Phithakthewa,

261
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,440
to reside in the palace every day
as my royal guard.

262
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Professor, it's time…

263
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,120
Well… My apologies for the discourtesy.

264
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,760
Who said you could come in?

265
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,000
So, I'll take my leave
and let you two continue.

266
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,680
I need to attend my class for now.

267
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,640
I'll come back
and finish our conversation later.

268
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,320
If it's not too much trouble…

269
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,560
I kindly ask that you…

270
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,160
keep Prince Calvin's title confidential

271
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,360
as requested by His Majesty.

272
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,320
Everyone has things they're not good at.

273
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,760
No one's good at everything
from the start.

274
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,040
But anything
can be learned, Your Royal Highness.

275
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,920
Not this one, though.

276
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,240
I think it might be best
if you head back to the palace now.

277
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,960
You need to come with me.

278
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,040
I'm afraid that won't be possible
anytime soon, Your Royal Highness.

279
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,120
Are you going to disobey my order?

280
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,480
That's not what I meant,

281
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,960
but I must be here to teach my students.

282
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,040
Chakri, why did you take it with you?

283
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,440
I noticed that
you were trying so hard to paint this,

284
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,680
so I have brought it back for you.

285
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,400
The car's parked over that way.

286
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,640
- Let's go.
- I'm not leaving.

287
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,200
You were rushing out,

288
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,480
so I thought…

289
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,720
How can I leave now?
What's taking him so long?

290
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,320
Chakri,

291
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,800
go get Charan.

292
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,280
Your Royal Highness,

293
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,400
you ordered Mr. Charan to come out,

294
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,960
yet he still hasn't.

295
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,000
I am honestly at a loss
as to what else I can do.

296
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,640
Excuse me.

297
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,080
Have you seen this person?

298
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,080
I haven't.

299
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,880
- Thank you.
- No worries.

300
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,040
- Is it ten plus one?
- Yes.

301
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,960
Excuse me.

302
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,520
- Hi.
- Hello.

303
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,200
- Want some popcorn? Here you go.
- I'm good.

304
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,080
I was gonna ask
if you've seen this person.

305
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,520
Wait.

306
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,760
He seems familiar.
I think I've seen him somewhere.

307
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,760
Really? Where did you see him?

308
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,280
I may not have.

309
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,160
Come on, have you seen him or not?

310
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,920
I mean, it's been a long time.

311
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,960
Well…

312
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,080
I'm kinda stuck,

313
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,000
but if you've got anything
to get my brain going,

314
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,480
it'll be easier to figure it out.

315
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,800
How much do you want?

316
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,360
Come on, we're like friends.
Let me ask how much you have.

317
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,440
It takes a lot of brainpower.

318
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,880
- You need to--
- Jeez.

319
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,280
Hey, I can give you a discount.
How much? I'm fine with anything.

320
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,920
Pay me after I find him.

321
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,120
Come on, pay me,

322
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,800
- or you won't find him.
- Popcorn?

323
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,360
- We want some popcorn.
- Sure.

324
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,000
- Popcorn, please.
- Sure.

325
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,160
ANYTHING?
NO CLUE.

326
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,560
- A guy was missing for 48 years.
- Popcorn!

327
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,400
- I found him in a day.
- Popcorn.

328
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,880
Sure, sweeties.

329
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,520
Let me know if you need more colors.

330
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,120
You should take a break.
Thanks for today.

331
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,120
If you'll excuse me.

332
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,680
Adding more color right here
can give it greater depth.

333
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,160
Right here?

334
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,560
Is it better?

335
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,480
Paytai.

336
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,680
Your Royal Highness.

337
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,680
Is this the matter you talked about?

338
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,480
Come with me now.

339
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,240
Don't you know who you belong to

340
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,920
and what your duties are?

341
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,040
I know who I belong to
and what my duties are.

342
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,160
But there is no rule
that says I cannot study art, is there?

343
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,400
Charan works for the Assavadevathins…

344
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,160
my enemies.

345
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,320
If you don't want trouble…

346
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,880
stay away from them.

347
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,400
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

348
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,800
Now that you know, remember it.

349
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
I am fully aware of who I belong to.

350
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,600
I have acted inappropriately.

351
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,040
Please punish me, Your Royal Highness.

352
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,240
You are mine…

353
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,080
all mine.

354
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,760
Siwakorn…

355
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,400
secure all the coaches.
Don't let anyone else have them.

356
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,080
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

357
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,880
You know
why I called you here, don't you?

358
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,640
You've been wasting time on nonsense.

359
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,920
How do you expect
to compete with others?

360
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,840
Please forgive me, Father.

361
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,640
I've gotten you some new coaches.

362
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,880
From here on,

363
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,840
the Competition matters the most to you.

364
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,840
Keep that in mind.

365
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,920
Yes, Father.

366
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,120
I will do my best to train.

367
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,640
Good.

368
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Because if you won't…

369
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,040
I will have to dismiss your companion.

370
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,880
I understand, Father.

371
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,800
Did no one tell you that there's been
a change in today's schedule?

372
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,960
This is my coach.

373
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
Say hi.

374
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,040
If you'll excuse me, I'll continue
my training with the national coach.

375
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,280
As for you,

376
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,400
have fun with the dummy.

377
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,240
Good luck,

378
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,600
Mr. Number One
of the British Fencing Club.

379
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,040
It's okay. I'll find you a new coach.

380
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,120
No need.

381
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,880
I know someone.

382
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,040
You're finally back, huh?

383
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,240
Is there anything I can help you with,
Your Highness?

384
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,240
So this is what you want?

385
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
If there is nothing else you require,

386
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,600
I'll take my leave.

387
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,280
I've brought the completed painting
of <i>the Garden of Eden</i>

388
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,199
to offer to you, Your Majesty.

389
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,800
Thanks for thinking of
an old guy like me.

390
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,600
Your painting skills
remain as exquisite as ever.

391
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,199
Thank you, Your Majesty.

392
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,120
The garden at Phithakthewa Manor
was inspired by <i>the Garden of Eden.</i>

393
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,360
This painting

394
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,719
is actually from
my mother's favorite spot.

395
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,920
That is all I have for today.

396
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,240
May Your Majesty be blessed
with good health and strength.

397
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,040
Don't leave just yet.

398
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,280
Grandfather,

399
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,880
I have a request to make.

400
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
Right now, I am training alone

401
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,640
without a coach to guide me.

402
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,440
I feel lost, Grandfather.

403
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,960
I'm uncertain if I'm on the right path.

404
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,320
I understand that
I did not grow up in Emmaly

405
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,160
and may still be seen as an outsider.

406
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,520
But I am deeply determined
to do my best in this competition.

407
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,560
I want you to understand that
you had to be raised in another country

408
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,760
solely for your safety.

409
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,600
As for your coach,

410
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,360
do not worry.

411
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,640
I'll make sure
to find a skilled one for you.

412
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,320
I understand the reasons
behind what you did.

413
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,880
However, as for the coach to train me,

414
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,480
it's something I'm concerned about.

415
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,680
I think…

416
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,560
the coach should be someone
who understands me well

417
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,640
and can provide me with proper guidance.

418
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,400
I think there is one person
suitable for this role.

419
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,880
Having the right and capable coach

420
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,680
will help me recognize my weaknesses

421
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,760
and overcome my rivals.

422
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,920
I wish for Charan

423
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,040
to be my coach, Grandfather.

424
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,320
You shouldn't have said that
to His Majesty.

425
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,080
I was simply stating facts.

426
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,480
Bargaining is totally normal.

427
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,960
I am not a bargaining chip.

428
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,800
I didn't say you were.

429
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,360
I know what I need to do,

430
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,520
and it's what Grandfather wants from me.

431
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,160
All I ask…

432
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,400
is to have you by my side.

433
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,880
Since you brought me to the palace,
you have kept your distance from me.

434
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,720
Why can't you be my coach?

435
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,280
Is it because
you don't wanna be around me?

436
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,960
You flew across the sky
to bring me back…

437
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,960
Now you're going to leave me like this?

438
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,200
You have no sympathy for me, do you?

439
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,200
It's not like that, Your Royal Highness,

440
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,800
but His Majesty--

441
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,480
What if he says
we can't see each other ever again?

442
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,840
Will this be the last time we meet?

443
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,880
Answer me.

444
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,440
Your Royal Highness,
please conduct yourself appropriately.

445
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,240
So this is inappropriate, huh?

446
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,800
Look into my eyes.

447
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,120
I told you to look into my eyes.

448
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
Now answer me.

449
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,800
Why can't you be my coach?

450
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,480
I don't fence in front of others.

451
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,120
Anyway,

452
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,960
I shall be your coach from now on.

453
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,840
If I overstep in any way,
I ask for your forgiveness in advance.

454
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,160
It seems like
you're in a really good mood today.

455
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,600
Please inform the university that
I won't be able to teach for some time.

456
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,400
When will you be returning
to teach again, Master?

457
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,080
Not until the Royal Competition is over.

458
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,440
Any updates?

459
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,160
<i>Just like I texted you.</i>

460
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,600
<i>About Mr. Thatdanai,</i>
<i>I just sent you a picture. Check it out.</i>

461
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,000
<i>It was taken at Heathrow Airport</i>

462
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,160
<i>on the same day we met in Thailand.</i>

463
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,320
<i>If I were to guess,</i>

464
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,520
<i>he's probably already in Emmaly.</i>

465
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,320
<i>But I'll look into it further</i>
<i>and get back to you.</i>

466
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,480
<i>I'll contact you with an update.</i>
<i>That's all.</i>

467
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,440
Thanks a lot.

468
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,520
Well done, Chakri.
Did you order these from Thailand?

469
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,040
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

470
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
How refreshing.

471
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Your Royal Highness…

472
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
please remove your fencing uniform.

473
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,960
What?

474
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,320
Why?

475
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,440
Please take it off.

476
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,560
You want me to be your coach, don't you?

477
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,000
Yeah.

478
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,880
One. All the way up and down. Two.

479
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,440
All the way up and down.

480
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,880
Keep going.

481
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,800
Do it fast.

482
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,760
Faster.

483
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,880
One,

484
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,520
two…

485
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,600
Harder. Three.

486
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Faster?

487
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,440
Harder.

488
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,840
Good, Your Royal Highness.

489
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,240
Faster.

490
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,960
- Come on.
- Hey,

491
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,880
won't you give me a break?

492
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,680
You've just finished three sets.

493
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,520
Do you wish to stop already?

494
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,440
No,

495
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,600
I'm just…

496
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,560
exhausted.

497
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,000
Faster, Your Royal Highness.

498
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,480
Faster than that.

499
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,200
Your Royal Highness,

500
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,400
are you hurt?

501
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,320
My ankle might be sprained.

502
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,760
This ankle?

503
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,560
No.

504
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,160
This one.

505
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,000
Chakri, His Royal Highness
is severely injured.

506
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,520
Get the doctors, now.

507
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,200
I think we should…

508
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,560
I'll get the doctors.

509
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,680
I think I'm feeling better now.

510
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,400
If you are,
then let's continue our training.

511
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,440
It hurts now.

512
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,800
This training

513
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,240
is to strengthen your body.

514
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,760
It is a crucial skill

515
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,680
to enhance your endurance

516
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,720
and help you last longer in a match.

517
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,440
I'm too tired.

518
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,920
Can't we fence already?

519
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,360
Are you sure you want that?

520
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,120
I'm more than sure.

521
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,640
Were you born with a sword or something?

522
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,880
Shall we continue, Your Highness?

523
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,600
You won't give me a break?

524
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,680
I thought you wanted to fence.

525
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,680
Well, yeah.

526
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,560
Your Royal Highness, please forgive me.

527
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,440
Mr. Charan, I'll…

528
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,360
It's okay. Bring a cooling towel
and some cold analgesic gel

529
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,880
to His Royal Highness' room.

530
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,080
Okay.

531
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,680
Come here.

532
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,520
Don't drop me.

533
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,520
<i>His Highness fell and twisted his ankle.</i>

534
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,480
NEXT EPISODE

535
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,960
Let's have Khanin
take a break for now, then.

536
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,160
Khanin.

537
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,920
If you ever need anything,
don't hesitate to let me know.

538
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,800
Meenanagarin is
the southern city of Emmaly,

539
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,240
and its main export
is the dark champagne pearl.

540
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,480
This is beautiful.

541
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,760
I'd love to see dark champagne pearls.

542
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,160
<i>They're hard to come by</i>

543
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,960
<i>and must be ordered in advance.</i>

544
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,440
Well…

545
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,880
If you wish to see them,

546
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,760
<i>I know a place I can take you to.</i>

547
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,440
These pearls belonged to my mother.

548
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,080
My father had it custom-made

549
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,160
and gave it to my mother
on their wedding day.

550
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,120
If I may?
