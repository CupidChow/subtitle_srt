3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,200
I wish for Charan

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,360
to be my coach, Grandfather.

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,080
I am not a bargaining chip.

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,240
All I ask

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,280
is to have you by my side.

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
Anyway,

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,600
I shall be your coach from now on.

10
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,160
Ouch…

11
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,320
- Can't you be gentle?
- Please don't move.

12
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
It's okay. Be at ease.

13
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,800
What happened?

14
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,400
His Royal Highness had a minor injury
during training, Your Royal Highness.

15
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,920
Let's get the doctors here.

16
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,800
It's nothing serious, Father.

17
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,120
His Royal Highness simply misstepped,

18
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,080
causing him to fall and twist his ankle.

19
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,360
I'm giving him first aid,
Your Royal Highness.

20
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,840
Let's have Khanin
take a break for now, then.

21
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,640
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

22
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,640
I need a word with my son.

23
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,760
Khanin,

24
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,280
no matter how important
the Competition is

25
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,320
to the Assavadevathins,

26
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,720
nothing is more important to me than you.

27
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,200
I don't want to see you hurt again.

28
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
I will be more careful, Father.

29
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,920
Khanin,

30
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,640
before you do anything,

31
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,520
you must first compose yourself.

32
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,040
You're lucky. This is not bad.

33
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,440
- Oh…
- Your Royal Highness…

34
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,480
Your Royal Highness…

35
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,000
Please have a seat.

36
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,520
I want to wash my hair.

37
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,160
Wash your hair? Oh…

38
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,440
Then, please wait a moment.

39
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,200
Since you dye your hair often,

40
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,440
I recommend using Lolane Intense Care.

41
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,840
It helps detangle messy hair,
making it soft

42
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,120
and easy to comb in just seven seconds.

43
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,920
Lolane!

44
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,040
Yeah.

45
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,920
The geographical landscape
of Meenanagarin,

46
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,240
the southern city of Emmaly,

47
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,440
is characterized by rainforests

48
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
or tropical rainforests.

49
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,640
The city lies along the coast,

50
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,080
and its main export commodity is pearls.

51
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,840
Pearls?

52
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,720
Especially the world-renowned
dark champagne pearls.

53
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,920
This is beautiful.

54
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,000
But they probably cost a lot, don't they?

55
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,680
Dark champagne pearls are the priciest.

56
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
And…

57
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,320
is Meenanagarin far from here?

58
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,120
It is the closest to Davin City

59
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,800
and has the second-largest population
after Davin City.

60
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,680
Your Royal Highness…

61
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,200
I'd love to see the dark champagne pearls
with my own eyes.

62
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,120
I believe that the treasury here…

63
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,400
Not Grandfather's pearls

64
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,520
nor the Assavadevathins'.

65
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,000
I want to see ones…

66
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,320
that are accessible to other people.

67
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,280
We still have time.

68
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,040
Actually, we can just go to Meenanagarin
to see them.

69
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,520
But your ankle has just healed.

70
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,080
- I think…
- It's just healed.

71
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,560
That means it's already healed.

72
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,840
Look.

73
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,640
I can walk around now.

74
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,559
Please take me there.

75
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,200
Please.

76
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,000
It's not far, you said.

77
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,400
If you wish to go out now,

78
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,920
you may only

79
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,880
be able to visit the pearl shop

80
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,120
behind the university,
Your Royal Highness.

81
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,400
Alright, let's go there.

82
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,480
Chakri!

83
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,360
I'm going to the market
behind the university.

84
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
Charan's coming with me.

85
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,200
You don't need to come, right?

86
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,360
Okay?

87
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,920
Chakri said we could go.

88
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,720
Your Royal Highness,
please slow down.

89
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,000
If I do that,

90
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,600
you'll have to talk to me casually,
okay?

91
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,720
That would be improper.

92
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,080
Your Royal Highness!

93
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,520
Freshly grilled pork right here.

94
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,840
Here you go.

95
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,400
Would you like some freshly grilled pork?

96
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,160
Sure.

97
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,800
Charan…

98
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,840
Is that one good?

99
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,720
Would you like to try some?

100
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
Well…

101
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,600
I can't imagine
how the flavors would blend.

102
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,640
[Grilled pork with milk tea]

103
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,440
This dish used to be only for miners

104
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,000
as they needed energy-boosting food
that was quick and easy to eat,

105
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,040
so they combined
savory and sweet tastes in one.

106
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,440
But since the taste was too unusual,

107
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,120
they added spices to improve it.

108
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,560
Thanks.

109
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,280
Would you like some grilled pork?
They're still warm.

110
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
How do you sell these?

111
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,760
Oh,

112
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,120
Prince Khanin.

113
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,840
How much would you like,
Your Royal Highness?

114
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,960
One set, please.

115
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,720
You want some?

116
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,040
I'm good, Your Royal Highness.

117
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,080
We'll get one set, then.

118
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,960
Sure.
Here you are.

119
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,320
One emma, please.

120
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,800
The milk tea tastes pretty odd,

121
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,560
but with the grilled pork,

122
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,920
they're a good combo.

123
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,440
You should try some.

124
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,760
I…

125
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,000
I know you've tried it before,

126
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,520
but I want you to join me.

127
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,400
Isn't it good?

128
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,400
Hey,

129
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,720
give me a smile.

130
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,800
It's inappropriate to do it here.

131
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Come on, it won't hurt.

132
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,360
Smile.

133
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,840
Give me a smile.

134
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,840
Do you even know how to smile?
Come on.

135
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,920
That's it.

136
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,920
Let's go.

137
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,000
This way, Your Royal Highness.

138
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,840
[Smooth skin starts at Gangnam Clinic]

139
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,960
Do you have any dark champagne pearls
from Meenanagarin?

140
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,880
Well,

141
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,200
the pearls are in high demand now,
Your Royal Highness.

142
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,480
They're hard to come by

143
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,760
and must be ordered in advance.

144
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,920
Shall we order it now,
Your Royal Highness?

145
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,760
Well…

146
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,960
So we came all this way for nothing.

147
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,080
I truly apologize, Your Royal Highness.

148
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,080
If you wish to see it,

149
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,200
I know a place I can take you to.

150
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,640
This is the manor of the Phithakthewas.

151
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,600
How beautiful.

152
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,360
So it's only you and your butler
in this whole place?

153
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,960
This manor was built
when Emmaly was first founded.

154
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,160
The Phithakthewas have long served
as royal guards to the Assavadevathins.

155
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,480
Royal guards?

156
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,960
Oh, so the reason you don't fence
in front of others

157
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,160
is because you're part of
a royal guard clan?

158
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,160
That's right.

159
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,760
A royal guard's powers
ought not to be exposed to enemies.

160
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Right.

161
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,560
This way, please.

162
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,480
This is where I spend most of my time.

163
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
It's where I paint.

164
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,640
I would've mistaken this for a gallery
if you hadn't told me.

165
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,520
It doesn't look anything like
an old manor of a royal guard clan.

166
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,440
Did you paint all of these yourself?

167
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,680
I did most of the paintings myself,

168
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,680
but some,

169
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,400
like this one,

170
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,040
were done by my mother.

171
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,480
Wow, so everyone in your family
is good at painting, right?

172
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,360
Not exactly,

173
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,160
but painting is something I really enjoy.

174
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,680
Every time I paint,

175
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,240
it calms me down.

176
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,200
You should teach me, too.

177
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,120
- I'm afraid that wouldn't be proper.
- "I'm afraid that wouldn't be proper."

178
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
I know.

179
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,240
But who gets to decide
what's proper or not?

180
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,320
If you ask me,

181
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,920
I think it's totally alright.

182
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,640
Wait. Hold on.

183
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,400
This is my private space.

184
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,840
I'm afraid it's not quite proper.

185
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,360
Please proceed that way.

186
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,560
Why, though?

187
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,080
Can't I be in this room?

188
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Please let me see your paintings.

189
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,000
I won't cause any trouble, promise.

190
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,320
Then, give me a moment.
I'll be right back.

191
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,640
Okay.

192
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,079
What have you got?

193
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,200
These pearls belonged to my mother.

194
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,640
She absolutely adored pearls

195
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,520
and dreamed of
collecting every shade of them.

196
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,120
It all started with this one.

197
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,560
She told me it was a gift from my father

198
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,280
back when they started dating.

199
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,800
A white pearl,

200
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,920
the color of purity,

201
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,200
sincerity,

202
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,840
freedom,

203
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,200
and loyalty.

204
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,080
This is the dark champagne pearl
you wanted to see.

205
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,000
It is truly stunning.

206
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,960
My father had it custom-made

207
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,320
and gave it to my mother
on their wedding day.

208
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,000
He seemed so romantic.

209
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
If I may…

210
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
Now that you've seen it
with your own eyes,

211
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,640
would you still want to
order the dark champagne pearls?

212
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,640
It is truly magnificent.

213
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,560
I want one.

214
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,000
I'll take care of it.

215
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,560
Um…

216
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,400
I think I'd rather go see it
in Meenanagarin myself.

217
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,520
If that chance comes by,

218
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,560
I'll take you there.

219
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,920
Okay.

220
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,680
[Prince Khanin and Charan Spotted
Enjoying Market Stroll Together]

221
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,760
[He's really cute! #PrinceKhanin]

222
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,880
[They've got that
"just started dating" vibe! #PrinceKhanin]

223
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
People are overhyping Khanin.

224
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,120
Why haven't you looked into
Prince Khanin's background

225
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,400
to find something to use against him?

226
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,960
The reason you want me to look into this

227
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,320
is because you're dying to know

228
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,520
if Khanin and Charan

229
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,200
are actually dating, right?

230
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,360
And if they are,

231
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,800
would you be upset?

232
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,880
There's no reason for me to be upset

233
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,200
because I…

234
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,320
belong to you, Prince Ramil.

235
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,560
Do you really belong to me?

236
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,800
Khanin?

237
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,520
How is everything going?

238
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,440
Are you getting used to
living in the palace yet?

239
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,720
I am, Your Royal Highness.

240
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,760
That's great.

241
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,600
I brought His Majesty
some bird's nest today.

242
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,320
Do you want to have a taste as well?

243
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,360
It's alright, Your Royal Highness.

244
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,040
I'm not particularly fond of it.

245
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
Oh, really?

246
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
No worries.

247
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:09,080
If you ever need anything,
don't hesitate to let me know.

248
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,360
After all,

249
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,640
the Assavadevathins stand like the sun
over the Meenanagarins.

250
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,280
I shall go to see His Majesty now.

251
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,960
Can I use my hands?

252
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,720
Whatever.

253
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,920
Charan,

254
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,720
once today's lesson is over,

255
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,040
I'd like to visit the market again.

256
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,240
There are still many things
I haven't tried.

257
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,600
I'm afraid that would not be possible.

258
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,680
Besides today's lesson,

259
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,560
you still have fencing training
and archery practice.

260
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,280
Oh, right.

261
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,720
I just ran into Prince Wasin.

262
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,720
He told me that

263
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
the Assavadevathins

264
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,920
stand like the sun
over the Meenanagarins.

265
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,800
Doesn't that sound a little odd?

266
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,160
Perhaps Prince Wasin was implying that

267
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,640
the Meenanagarins

268
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,840
will always remain loyal
to the Assavadevathins.

269
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,560
So that's why he said he stands with me.

270
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,720
Should an Assavadevathin be appointed
King of Emmaly again,

271
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,920
Meenanagarin would surely benefit.

272
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,000
What kind of benefit?

273
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,280
In the past,

274
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,440
when pearls from Meenanagarin
became scarce,

275
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,960
the Assavadevathins allocated a budget
for pearl research,

276
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,400
including the development
of new pearl colors

277
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,880
to increase production.

278
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,000
If Prince Tharin ascends to the throne,

279
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,680
Meenanagarin will likely continue
to receive research funding.

280
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,280
However, since Prince Wasin has no heirs,
his words…

281
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,040
were probably just a gesture of affection
for Your Royal Highness.

282
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,000
Understood, Professor.

283
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,440
What would I do without you?

284
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,000
Hold this with your left hand.

285
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,440
Pick up the arrow with your right hand.
Set the tip of the arrow here.

286
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,840
Aim at the target.

287
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,040
Aim at the target.

288
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,560
Let's do it again.

289
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,120
A yellow pearl,

290
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,960
symbolizing good friendship

291
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,640
and good health.

292
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,720
It's yours now.

293
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,840
You promised me

294
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,520
you'd take me to Meenanagarin.

295
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,040
I will keep my promise.

296
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,240
Have a good night.

297
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,280
Keep your index finger above

298
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,320
with your middle and ring fingers below.

299
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,120
Concentrate, Khanin.

300
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
I did it,

301
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,920
- didn't I?
- It was likely a fluke.

302
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,960
Now, do it yourself.

303
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,640
Hey!

304
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,080
What?

305
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,600
Have you found the person you were after?

306
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,440
Do you work here?

307
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,640
Do you think this apron
is just an accessory?

308
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,440
Obviously, I work here.

309
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,480
Have you found the person you were after?

310
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,400
No.

311
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,800
- You haven't?
- Yeah.

312
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,080
I've seen him, though.

313
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,480
I'm not lying.

314
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,280
You don't believe me?

315
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,400
I'll take you to him after work.

316
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,600
Are you going back to your country
this holiday?

317
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,920
I don't think so, Your Majesty.
I wish to spend my time off here.

318
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,200
That is perfect.

319
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,440
Go ahead.

320
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,800
Are you done with your fencing training?

321
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,960
Come, have a seat.

322
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,440
I was just speaking with Prince Calvin,

323
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,600
and I thought it'd be best
to have you join us now.

324
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,480
What's the matter, Grandfather?

325
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,520
I see that

326
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,280
you and Prince Calvin
are around the same age.

327
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,600
It'd be nice if you two grew close.

328
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,560
Also, I'd like you to take him on a trip

329
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,360
to Davichmetha for a break.

330
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,960
A trip to Davichmetha?

331
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,240
That's right.

332
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,200
Ramil and Ava will be going along, too.

333
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

334
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,440
Please look after Khanin
and Prince Calvin for me, Charan.

335
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

336
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,200
Why does this palace
feel so unlike the others, Chakri?

337
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,000
Prince Calvin,

338
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,320
Khanin,

339
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,720
it is my pleasure
to welcome you both in person.

340
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,720
Thank you very much,
Your Royal Highness.

341
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,560
You are all welcome.

342
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,960
It has come to my attention

343
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,680
that Prince Calvin
desires to stay elsewhere.

344
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,200
In truth, this place
would be far more convenient.

345
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,160
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Royal Highness.

346
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,760
I'm not very familiar
with such magnificence.

347
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,120
Actually, I only feel some regret,

348
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,520
but it's okay.

349
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,720
As for Khanin,

350
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,360
a guest room
has been arranged over there.

351
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,080
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

352
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,240
I'm sure you'd like to
check out our palace at least a little.

353
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,760
Please, feel free.

354
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,320
Khanin,

355
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,640
please come this way.

356
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,080
Ava is cozying up to Khanin,

357
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,800
probably hoping to ride his popularity
with the public.

358
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
Ridiculous.

359
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,800
But I think

360
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,960
it would be great
if you gained some popularity, too.

361
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,480
I had some free time,

362
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,600
so I came to see your archery range.

363
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,560
I hope you don't mind
if Khanin's joining us, too.

364
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,800
Of course, I don't.

365
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,040
It's your range after all.

366
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,760
Have you been here for some time now?

367
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,720
Are you done with the palace tour?

368
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,160
Would you like to try archery with us?

369
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,800
I appreciate your kindness,

370
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,840
but I shall pass for now.

371
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,880
Is there anywhere you'd like to visit?

372
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,400
There are plenty of beautiful buildings
and places to visit around here.

373
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,240
Well…

374
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,840
Is there anywhere you'd recommend?

375
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,200
I wanna check out the city.

376
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,840
I just looked it up,
and it looks super interesting.

377
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,520
Since we've already come
all the way from Davin,

378
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,320
we shall make the most of it.

379
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,480
Would you care to join us?

380
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,160
It's more fun with more company.

381
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,120
How could I miss a trip
with Prince Calvin?

382
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,480
Then, I'll book a hotel for us all.

383
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,320
Chakri, you don't have to come.

384
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,400
Oh…

385
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,920
If my father knows I'm here…

386
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,840
Do not worry.

387
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,960
Let yourself go a little,
so we can all have fun together.

388
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,239
What is this called?

389
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,480
Davicher, Your Royal Highness.

390
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,719
It's a local apple-based cocktail,

391
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,760
bearing a taste similar to apple cider.

392
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,960
Wow,

393
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,480
that's a unique taste.

394
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,560
There's nothing of this sort
in my country.

395
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,719
It's one of Davichmetha's prides,

396
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,080
even though I've never tried it myself.

397
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,199
Since you're already here,
you should give it a try.

398
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,639
I don't enjoy drinking.

399
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,600
I prefer watching others get drunk.

400
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,760
Come on, Ava.

401
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,920
Try some. It's wonderful.

402
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,200
No booze, no fun, right?

403
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,520
Sure.

404
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,320
You're here, Ramil?

405
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,840
Do you see me here?

406
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,360
Ava.

407
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,720
Yes?

408
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,160
Let's hit the dance floor.

409
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,720
We can do that?

410
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,720
Of course!

411
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,240
We're just having fun.
What could possibly be wrong?

412
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,840
But I can't dance.

413
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,160
Just do what I do.

414
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,840
Prince Calvin, would you like to join us?

415
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,240
I think I'll pass.

416
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,040
Paytai,

417
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,520
come dance with us.

418
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,440
Me?

419
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,160
- Yes.
- Me?

420
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,680
- Yeah.
- Are you talking to me?

421
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
Let's go!

422
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,920
Your Royal Highness!

423
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,240
Your Royal Highness…

424
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,080
That must've been a blast, huh?

425
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,040
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.

426
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,680
I am truly remorseful.

427
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,040
Please command me

428
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,680
as you wish, Your Royal Highness.

429
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,840
Any command?

430
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,720
For Your Royal Highness,

431
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,120
I am like a pet,

432
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,960
a devoted one,

433
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,080
ready to obey every command of yours.

434
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,800
Oh, my God. Prince Calvin, come on. Said
he was going to the toilet but ditched us.

435
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,920
Hey,

436
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,760
I can walk.

437
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,560
- I barely drank anything.
- It's okay.

438
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,480
Charan…

439
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,320
There you are.

440
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,920
Your Royal Highness,

441
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,320
I humbly entrust Prince Khanin
to your care.

442
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,160
Charan…

443
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,920
It's okay.

444
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,320
Charan!

445
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,360
Hey…

446
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,200
Charan!

447
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,320
Charan… Charan…

448
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,240
Charan!

449
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,160
Hey!

450
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,120
Charan!

451
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,960
Charan…

452
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,200
Are you okay?

453
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,760
Are you hurt anywhere? Tell me.

454
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,640
I'm okay.

455
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,280
Should we leave now?

456
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,560
Let's go.

457
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,200
Stay here with me.

458
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,840
I'm right here,

459
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,320
right by your side.

460
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,760
Charan…

461
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,000
You've taken care of me so much.

462
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,160
Now, it's my turn to take care of you.

463
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,680
When I was six…

464
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,360
<i>Mother…</i>

465
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,120
Ran, take good care of yourself, okay?

466
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,680
And follow His Majesty's commands.

467
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,160
I'll have to be away for a while,

468
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,000
but I promise

469
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,320
I'll be back as soon as I can.

470
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,600
Mr. Thatdanai is here.

471
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,640
Mother!

472
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,280
Mother!

473
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,960
Please don't leave me.

474
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,640
Where are you going?

475
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,480
Mother!

476
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,160
Mother…

477
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,360
She said she'd come back,

478
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,320
but she never did.

479
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,600
She didn't keep her promise.

480
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,200
Whenever it rains,

481
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,080
it terrifies me.

482
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,440
It's okay.

483
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,400
You don't have to talk now.

484
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,360
You should stay the night here.

485
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,040
I…

486
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,680
Please.

487

You've saved me once again.

504
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,360
Who do you think did it?

505
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,520
A serious matter has arisen.

506
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,120
It is unacceptable
to take Khanin into such a location.

507
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,240
You can't dismiss him.
I do not consent to it.

508
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,560
You don't need to worry.
An excellent coach has been appointed.

509
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,480
I am Joe, Your Royal Highness.

510
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,520
There are plenty of coaches
in this country,

511
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,960
yet somehow only this one
happened to be available.

512
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,280
Please keep a close watch
over His Royal Highness.

513
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,240
You are allowed to cross the line.
