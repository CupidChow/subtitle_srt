1
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,360
<i>The winning heir</i>

2
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,880
<i>will secure their father's position</i>
<i>as the next king.</i>

3
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,160
<i>If you wish to change Emmaly,</i>

4
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,520
one way to do it
is to win the Competition.

5
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,320
I'm glad

6
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,120
Ramil's putting more effort
into practicing than before.

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,880
Let Mira be my coach

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,840
<i>or I'll withdraw</i>
<i>from the Competition entirely.</i>

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,360
<i>I would like you</i>
<i>to paint a portrait of me.</i>

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,440
<i>Do you like me?</i>

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,680
Do you like me as much as I like you?

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,080
Ran…

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,960
do you think it's even possible
for a royal to renounce their title?

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
Of course…

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,600
but only if they've come of age

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,040
and are capable
of making their own judgments.

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,720
I don't want
the theoretical kind of answer.

18
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,280
Just say it like how you would
as an ordinary art teacher.

19
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,760
In that case…

20
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,680
maybe it would've been better
not to be royal at all.

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,480
No royal rules, obligations

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
or heavy responsibilities.

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
That's true.

24
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,320
When you're not royal,
you'll be just an ordinary person,

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,440
living peacefully.

26
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,640
Then power won't matter.

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,080
But if you must have it,

28
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,600
you should use it with justice…

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,040
for the benefit of everyone.

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,720
You're right.

31
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,760
If I ever have more power than I do now,

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,760
I'll want to use it as fairly as I can
for everyone as well.

33
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,880
Whatever you choose to do…

34
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,640
and whoever you become…

35
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,240
I'll be by your side.

36
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,600
It's so nice of you
to let me come out and relax like this.

37
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,720
But during the Competition period,
you need to be extra careful.

38
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,720
It's nothing, really.

39
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,520
This car is easy to use, easy to drive,
fully equipped with safety features,

40
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,320
and perfectly suited for everyday use,

41
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,360
everyone's driving one.

42
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,160
The Royal Competition
is less than a week away.

43
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,600
The first round is a test of wit.

44
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,600
There's a good chance
the questions will ask for opinions

45
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,400
rather than factual knowledge.

46
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
So I've prepared some questions for you.

47
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,520
THE ROYAL COMPETITION
TEST OF WIT

48
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,480
The breeze today
stirs more than the leaves.

49
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,840
It brings with it
wishes of good fortune to this land.

50
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,240
Seeing Your Majesty so joyful,

51
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,360
I believe your health
is improving day by day.

52
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,000
I have faith that
once the Royal Competition concludes,

53
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,280
Khanin will bring the throne to Tharin.

54
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,200
It's been a long time.

55
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,000
I've been waiting all this time
for this day to come.

56
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,560
You have borne much hardship
for your own clan, Your Majesty.

57
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,680
I humbly offer
my heartfelt congratulations beforehand.

58
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,960
Great. That's great.

59
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,240
That's the best wish.

60
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,640
I shall accept your congratulations
ahead of time.

61
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,480
The first round,
which allows public voting,

62
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,920
should not pose any difficulty
for Prince Khanin.

63
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,760
His Royal Highness
is cherished by the people.

64
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,000
He is sure to win.

65
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Indeed.

66
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,960
Introducing this additional round
is meant to benefit him.

67
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,240
But as for the archery round ahead…

68
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,320
why would you consent
to Prince Chana's demands, Your Majesty?

69
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,600
What do you think?

70
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,280
From my humble consideration,

71
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,840
might this be

72
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,920
to prevent favoritism
toward the Assavadevathins?

73
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,400
At times, power is needed
to subdue people…

74
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,039
yet kindness toward them

75
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,880
also helps keep their hearts at peace.

76
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,040
By letting Ava, a woman, participate

77
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,920
and adding a competition
that suits her strengths,

78
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,240
it shall keep Ramil in check.

79
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,680
However,

80
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,800
wouldn't this put Prince Khanin
at a disadvantage, Your Majesty?

81
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,160
Wirun, you are intelligent.

82
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,280
Still,

83
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,760
you've never held power before.

84
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,400
Giving hope to people
is such an irresistible temptation.

85
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,280
Ava's talent lies in archery,

86
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,960
but she'll never beat
the male heirs in fencing.

87
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,920
So that's how it is.

88
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,400
I am merely of lowly status

89
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,560
and could never hope
to have such wisdom, Your Majesty.

90
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,800
What a truly wonderful day this is.

91
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,080
Let's head to the hall, shall we?

92
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

93
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,120
Your Royal Highness,
are you feeling stressed?

94
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,240
I gave you a complete makeover!

95
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,800
That hair is so cute, neat and elegant.

96
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,120
Let's have some tea.

97
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,720
Tea…

98
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,960
Don't get too worked up.

99
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,560
Just stick to what you've learned.

100
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,160
I've checked around.

101
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,280
Everything's all right.

102
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,680
It's really happening now.

103
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,240
I'm afraid… that I might mess up.

104
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,720
You've got this, Nin.

105
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,440
We've prepared so much together.

106
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,920
Don't worry, okay?

107
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,240
What if--

108
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,520
Whatever the result may be,

109
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,560
I'll always be right here.

110
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,360
Your Royal Highness,
try not to worry too much.

111
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,680
Have some tea to help calm your mind.

112
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,280
Seems like you're more worked up than me.

113
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,840
Gosh.

114
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,000
There's no tea left.

115
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,320
Oh, well…

116
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,560
I'll get you another cup.

117
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,160
Gosh, this isn't better.

118
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,160
Don't worry, my dear.

119
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,200
Just do your best.

120
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,280
Khanin, though our time together
has been short…

121
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,080
please never doubt my love for you.

122
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,720
I have loved you since 22 years ago,
and I still do.

123
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,840
Before,

124
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,400
I kept it quiet,
not wanting to make you feel uneasy.

125
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,400
But now,
you're very strong and dignified.

126
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,160
I couldn't be more proud.

127
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,920
Thank you, Father.

128
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,360
I understand your reasons,

129
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,720
and I'm deeply grateful
that you understand mine too.

130
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,920
It's nearly time.

131
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,680
You should be ready.

132
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,960
Give it your all.

133
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,240
Yes, Father.

134
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,640
Come here.

135
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,880
Stay focused.

136
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:19,280
FIRST ROUND OF ROYAL COMPETITION:
TEST OF WIT

137
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,200
Today is the day

138
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,360
that the Emmalians
have eagerly awaited for three months

139
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,040
<i>since the official announcement.</i>

140
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,600
Finally, it's time for the first round
of the Royal Competition.

141
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,120
By "first round,"

142
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,000
I mean the rules this time
differ from previous Competitions.

143
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,000
The first round will have the competitors
answer questions,

144
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,120
testing their vision and wit,

145
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,880
with each answering one question.

146
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,240
Very soon, we'll get to see
the princes and the princess.

147
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,320
In the meantime, allow me to introduce
the heirs from the three regions

148
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,440
who will be competing today.

149
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Having a day off feels freaking awesome.

150
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,200
Exactly.

151
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,160
It's so we can all watch this.

152
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,320
Watch who's going to be our next king.

153
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,600
It doesn't matter, though.

154
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,200
At the end of the day,
we have to handle the issues ourselves.

155
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,760
Yeah, I think so.

156
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
- You think so?
- Yeah.

157
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,040
June, want some water?

158
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,280
You should've told me.

159
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,440
<i>Our country is privileged</i>
<i>to host the neighboring country of Bhujar.</i>

160
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,920
Jay. Check this out.

161
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,880
That's…

162
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,360
<i>Prince Calvin has come</i>
<i>to witness our Royal Competition.</i>

163
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,040
Shit.

164
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,640
Are you serious?

165
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,480
<i>You don't know who I am, do you?</i>

166
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,200
<i>- I do.</i>
<i>- So you know I'm a prince?</i>

167
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,160
Jay.

168
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,040
You took a prince to the protest?

169
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,640
That's freaking dope.

170
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,720
I think Jay probably just
found out about it too.

171
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,720
ARM - THAT CALVIN WHO JOINED THE PROTEST
IS A PRINCE?

172
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,720
As His Majesty
values the voice of the people,

173
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,760
he's decreed that this round
be decided by the Emmalians

174
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,560
<i>through public voting.</i>

175
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,040
Voting? That's never been part of it.

176
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,480
It's just voting.

177
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,880
Who knows what goes on behind the scenes?

178
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,680
The time is now upon us.

179
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,680
I hereby declare
the Royal Competition of Emmaly

180
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,960
officially open.

181
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,880
And the first to answer the question
is Prince Ramil Bhuchongpisut.

182
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,080
Please stand on the designated podium,
Your Royal Highness.

183
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,720
The question for Prince Ramil
is as follows.

184
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,760
Could you identify
some long-standing issues in our nation

185
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,760
that have been overlooked,
become persistent,

186
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,760
and failed to be addressed?

187
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,760
Please share your answer
with the people, Your Royal Highness.

188
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,800
That's not the question
from the committee.

189
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,040
It is not, Your Majesty.

190
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,520
I shall look into it immediately.

191
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,000
It's too late now.

192
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,680
From here on out,
just make sure nothing else goes wrong.

193
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

194
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,440
In my view,
every issue in Emmaly matters

195
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,640
and deserves to be addressed.

196
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,680
But if I were to choose one
that remains in the shadows,

197
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,960
it would be…

198
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,000
a family-related issue.

199
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,000
The numbers from last year may seem small,

200
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,760
only 4,000 to 5,000 reported cases,

201
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,440
but this is not about statistics.

202
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,240
It's about people.

203
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,640
Domestic violence…

204
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,640
often aimed at women and children…

205
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,760
leaves lasting wounds
on both the body and mind.

206
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,440
That was a stupid thing to do.

207
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,840
But it's a misguided notion,

208
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,280
ingrained over time…

209
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,640
and passed down through generations.

210
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,240
It was taught
to motivate, instill discipline…

211
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,640
You'll remain silent?

212
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,080
<i>…and promote obedience.</i>

213
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,600
In truth, it has caused
generations of pain.

214
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,200
It damages confidence,

215
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,520
creates all kinds of trauma…

216
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
and isolates people from society.

217
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,280
When a person is denied the chance
to grow into their best self,

218
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,160
the nation loses a part of its future.

219
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,760
I truly believe…

220
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,720
children are the future of our nation,
and of this world.

221
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,200
And that is why
this issue must be addressed.

222
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,840
Thank you for your answer,
Your Royal Highness.

223
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,800
Next,

224
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,880
Princess Ava Davichmetha,
please stand on the podium.

225
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,800
If you could change one law in Emmaly,

226
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,200
which law would you choose to amend,
Your Royal Highness?

227
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,600
For generations, the laws of our nation
have been written by men,

228
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,480
which led to some being unjust
toward women

229
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,360
and gender-diverse people.

230
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,320
While we have achieved marriage equality,

231
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,200
deeper understanding
is still lacking in other areas.

232
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,480
<i>Stop asking so many questions.</i>

233
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,120
A woman is training you.

234
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,840
Don't you think
those two clans will laugh at us?

235
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,280
I would propose laws to ensure equal pay,

236
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,760
increase political representation
for women…

237
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,800
We have adhered to this tradition
for generations.

238
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,280
You must understand that women
do not have the same rights as men.

239
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,960
…and promote
greater participation of women

240
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,120
in government
and international organizations.

241
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,480
Our education policies
should also be reformed

242
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,640
to eliminate gender bias.

243
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,440
Why are there only male vendors?

244
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,760
None of them are female.

245
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,000
In Meenanagarin,
the husband should provide for the family

246
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,280
while the wife's responsible
for the housework.

247
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,800
With these reforms,

248
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,560
Emmaly will move
toward a fairer legal system,

249
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,680
one that protects women's rights
in the long term.

250
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,520
Thank you for your answer, Princess Ava.

251
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,960
Next will be the question
for Prince Khanin Assavadevathin.

252
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,040
Please come to the podium.

253
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,760
If given the opportunity,

254
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,120
what strategies would you recommend
to stimulate the economy of Emmaly?

255
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,000
Our nation, Emmaly, has so much to offer,

256
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,400
from its fascinating culture

257
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,120
to its exquisite cuisine.

258
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,720
Personally, I've always had a fondness
for Davin spaghetti sauce.

259
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,240
<i>With its food, culture and traditions,</i>
<i>Emmaly has great potential</i>

260
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,600
<i>to grow its soft power</i>
<i>on the global stage.</i>

261
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,360
Nin.

262
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,240
You've raised him well.

263
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200
Thanks.

264
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,120
I'm sure that he misses you a lot.

265
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,520
Emmaly is also home to four regions,

266
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,720
each with its own unique charm.

267
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,040
I personally love Bhuchongpisut,
an ancient city…

268
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,360
<i>for its deep historical roots.</i>

269
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,440
I also love the nightlife in Davichmetha…

270
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,320
<i>when joy fills the city.</i>

271
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
I love how welcoming our nation is.

272
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,800
The people are friendly
even to someone like me, a prince.

273
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,120
And the sea of Meenanagarin
is so breathtakingly beautiful.

274
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,080
Most of all,

275
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,960
what touches me the most is
the lantern procession in Assavadevathin,

276
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,480
<i>a tradition that honors the beliefs</i>
<i>and the way of life of our miners,</i>

277
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,560
<i>the backbone of our economy.</i>

278
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,200
By connecting with the people
throughout Emmaly,

279
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,400
I've learned that
our nation's greatest treasure

280
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,240
is its kind, welcoming people,

281
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,280
who embrace visitors
from around the world.

282
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,600
If we promote local culture
through thoughtful campaigns

283
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,280
and ensure the revenue goes back
to local communities,

284
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,440
empowering them to support themselves,

285
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,160
we can truly strengthen
our tourism economy.

286
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,120
But before implementing
any economic strategies,

287
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,200
we must first address a pressing concern.

288
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,840
The dust pollution
caused by mining in Assavadevathin

289
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,120
<i>has harmed Emmaly's air quality for years.</i>

290
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,200
By solving this issue immediately,

291
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,320
in tandem with enhancing the economy,

292
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,960
we can enhance both economic growth
and the nation's quality of life.

293
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,480
Thank you.

294
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,040
Thank you for your answer, Prince Khanin.

295
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,800
And with that, all the competitors

296
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,400
have completed their answers
to the three questions.

297
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,200
We're moving into
the first round of judging.

298
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,240
<i>All Emmalians, you may now cast your votes</i>
<i>for the royal candidate of your choice.</i>

299
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,480
Prince Khanin's answer was lit.

300
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,880
Someone in power finally said
what needed to be said.

301
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
I'm glad.

302
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
Jay.

303
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,000
Jay!

304
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,480
What's wrong?

305
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
I'm glad too.

306
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,880
The princess truly showed empathy
toward women.

307
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,280
I'm voting for her.

308
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,120
She nailed it.
I liked the education policy reforms.

309
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,160
I prefer Prince Ramil, though.

310
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,440
He seemed to
really understand family issues.

311
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,880
Still, it looked like

312
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,040
Prince Khanin understood
Emmaly's problems on a bigger scale.

313
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,320
Exactly. I think we should vote for him.

314
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,320
Right.

315
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,200
PRINCE KHANIN MENTIONED THE POLLUTION

316
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,080
HE SPOKE ABOUT THE DUST PROBLEM

317
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,960
I'M SURE HE'S GETTING MANY VOTES

318
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,440
Three, two, one,

319
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,240
the voting has officially ended.

320
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,960
The votes from everyone all across Emmaly

321
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,840
have been counted and recorded.

322
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,120
It's now time to announce

323
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,240
the competitor who has received
the highest number of votes.

324
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,440
The competitor with the most votes is…

325
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,120
Prince Ramil of Bhuchongpisut.

326
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,080
I offer my sincere congratulations
to His Royal Highness.

327
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,040
However, the Royal Competition
is not yet over.

328
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,720
Two more rounds still lie ahead.

329
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,640
The next round
will be an archery competition,

330
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,480
taking place in Meenanagarin
in just three days' time.

331
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,760
Seems like the people really adore him.

332
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,280
Congratulations, Rachata.

333
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,080
I humbly offer my congratulations,
Your Royal Highness.

334
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,639
No need to feel down, brother.

335
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,560
I know you've always had
strong public support.

336
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,320
It's just that…

337
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,920
perhaps they connected more
with my answer.

338
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,440
Your words sound almost like
you're insulting us.

339
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,120
Come on, Ava.

340
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,720
Don't be so harsh on me.

341
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,720
What's it called again?

342
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Consolation.

343
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,240
I'm only consoling you.

344
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,520
The competition is ongoing.

345
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,960
I don't think
this is the right moment to do so.

346
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,040
In fact, if our answers

347
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,000
truly bring about solutions
to the nation's issues,

348
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,240
it serves the people's best interests.

349
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,400
There's nothing that needs consolation.

350
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,880
Khanin's right.

351
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,360
I agree with him.

352
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,600
Why am I getting ganged up on?

353
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,760
That couldn't be.

354
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,000
The three of us have been rivals
for a long time.

355
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,080
That's right.

356
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,760
I'll see you in the next round.

357
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,120
May I have a word with you?

358
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,640
I admire your courage
in answering the question the way you did.

359
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,440
The way I did?

360
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,920
You spoke out
about the issues in Assavadevathin.

361
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,000
It had to be said by someone.

362
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,880
The more powerful our voice is,
the more we must use it.

363
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,880
You've also done a wonderful job
speaking up for equal rights.

364
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,720
It was my own experience
that gave me the courage to speak up.

365
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,200
And now that I've said it,
I feel like a weight has been lifted.

366
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,120
I may have lost this round,
but I may not the next time.

367
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,960
I'm not planning to lose either.

368
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,680
Did I handle Ramil's words well?

369
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,080
Father.

370
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,760
I did it.

371
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,480
That's enough to make you happy?

372
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,520
I believe it feels like
a promising beginning for us.

373
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,320
Obviously.

374
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,200
I did it with my own hands.

375
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,160
You?

376
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,960
Can't imagine you winning anything.

377
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,800
Who do you work for?

378
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,240
His Majesty the King.

379
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,400
<i>He was sent by the King.</i>

380
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,960
That old man
is always up to lowly deeds.

381
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,760
The only way for us to survive…

382
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,560
is to win

383
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,200
and reclaim our glory.

384
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,360
It could be risky.

385
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,920
I don't care, okay?

386
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,720
Rig the voting discreetly.

387
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,400
No matter what,
Ramil's votes have to secure first place.

388
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,360
I set a ladder up for you.

389
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,280
Father, you mean--

390
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,880
All you have to do

391
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,560
is get to the top.

392
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,680
No mistakes allowed.

393
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,440
Do you understand, Ramil?

394
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,720
Yes, Father.

395
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,080
If you don't sleep now,

396
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,360
you won't have the energy tomorrow.

397
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,840
Someone once told me that
art is a form of relaxation.

398
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,560
If I draw a picture of you before bed,

399
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,520
it should help me sleep better.

400
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,040
Such a naughty kid.

401
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,080
Please stay still.

402
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,000
I think…

403
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:29,160
changing from drawing to another activity,
it would help sleep better too.

404
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,840
Don't you agree?

405
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,440
If I…

406
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,440
lull you to sleep,

407
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,960
what would you say?

408
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,800
That should be fine, right?

409
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,040
I appreciate you walking with me.

410
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,960
I have to.

411
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,680
My friends were pretty loud, though.

412
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,960
They were annoying you, right?

413
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,480
I'm sorry.

414
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,040
I didn't say that.

415
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,440
Being around people is actually fun,
and our home's usually pretty quiet.

416
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,440
Come on, cut the drama.

417
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,920
I'm totally fine.

418
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,960
You're the one feeling down.

419
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,320
I brought you out for a walk
to get some fresh air

420
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,120
and hopefully feel better.

421
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,680
CALVIN
CAN WE TALK?

422
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,160
Was that from Calvin?

423
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,680
Wait, no.

424
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,760
It's Prince Calvin, right?

425
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,760
Yeah.

426
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,400
Why?

427
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,920
Now that he's a prince,
you don't want to talk to him anymore?

428
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,040
I don't know.

429
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,960
I don't even know
how I'm supposed to feel.

430
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,280
Just go clear things up with him.

431
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,920
It's just impossible no matter what.

432
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,840
Jay.

433
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,960
If you guys don't talk,
nothing's gonna get better.

434
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,360
If you don't want to talk to him,
just tell him straight up.

435
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,600
It's that simple.

436
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,880
Seriously?

437
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,040
Someone like me,

438
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,800
telling him to leave me alone?

439
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,880
Jay.

440
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,920
Life is unpredictable.

441
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,440
We never know when we'll meet again,

442
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,720
or if it will be the last time.

443
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,800
Either way, go sort things out with him.

444
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,160
<i>Let's take a look at this news.</i>

445
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,720
<i>It began with a video</i>
<i>that recently surfaced online.</i>

446
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,440
The video shows
a pollution protest taking place.

447
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:07,880
<i>What stands out is</i>
<i>the presence of Prince Calvin of Bhujar</i>

448
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,840
<i>walking among the protesters.</i>

449
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,400
Jay!

450
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,080
Jay!

451
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,960
Can I come in?

452
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Is June not home?

453
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,480
She's in her room.

454
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,880
Can I sit with you?

455
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,680
There's something I need to explain.

456
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,240
What is there to explain?

457
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,960
It's just that…

458
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,400
you…

459
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,920
Actually, no.

460
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,480
I can't even talk to you
like this anymore.

461
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,520
Can we just talk like before?

462
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,480
I'm afraid I cannot, Your Royal Highness.

463
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,480
That would be improper.

464
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,920
Are you saying…

465
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,840
you're just gonna walk away from me?

466
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,800
We were never meant to meet this way,
Your Royal Highness.

467
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,000
Don't do that, Jay.

468
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,120
I didn't even deserve

469
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,600
to hear the truth from you,
Your Royal Highness.

470
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,360
Honestly…

471
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,800
I really meant to tell you.

472
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,160
After the protest,
I'd like to talk to you.

473
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,320
At the protest?

474
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,600
Yes.

475
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,720
But with everything coming up…

476
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,000
I'm here today to apologize…

477
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,480
and to bid you farewell.

478
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,240
I've been commanded to return to Bhujar.

479
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,080
I'm sorry.

480
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,840
I'm truly sorry.

481
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,480
It is beyond my place to accept
your apology, Your Royal Highness.

482
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,360
We should never again.

483
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,240
Please take your leave.

484
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,240
I said, please take your leave.

485
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:26,920
Ava…

486
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,760
A DAY BEFORE THE ARCHERY COMPETITION

487
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,240
…I am certain now,

488
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,160
so I rushed here to tell you.

489
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,440
What is it about, Father?

490
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,800
According to my sources,

491
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,520
Rachata rigged the voting last time…

492
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,960
so Ramil won that round.

493
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:57,360
THE ROYAL COMPETITION
ARCHERY

494
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:03,960
<i>Welcome to the second round</i>
<i>of the Royal Competition.</i>

495
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,160
<i>This round features an archery match.</i>

496
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,080
<i>The competitors from all three clans</i>
<i>are now ready to compete.</i>

497
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,040
<i>I set a ladder up for you.</i>

498
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,920
All you have to do

499
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,640
is get to the top.

500
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,240
It's not fair anymore, Ava.

501
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:41,000
You must do whatever it takes
to win this competition.

502
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,640
If you wish to change Emmaly,

503
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,560
one way to do it
is to win the Competition.

504
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:15,960
<i>If all competitors are ready,</i>
<i>I shall declare the archery competition</i>

505
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,480
<i>officially underway.</i>

506
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:23,400
<i>Three, two, one…</i>

507
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,560
<i>Begin.</i>

508
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,200
<i>Do you not trust His Majesty,</i>
<i>Your Royal Highness?</i>

509
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,320
Join me in this.

510
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,640
Do it for Khanin.

511
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,080
I lost him once,
and I cannot bear to lose him again.

512
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,920
Please send me Coach Joe's profile.

513
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,160
The GPS…

514
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,560
In this freaking country,
everyone's just hungry for power.

515
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,760
PRINCE KHANIN IS IN DANGER
