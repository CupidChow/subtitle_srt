00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,000
FICTIONAL EVENTS,
VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED.

2
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,800
I am taking part in the Royal Competition.

3
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,000
The Assavadevathins will also participate.

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,680
I will participate
in the Royal Competition.

5
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,320
No rule forbids women from competing.

6
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,560
With you both competing,
it'll be exciting.

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,400
Train hard, Brother.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,440
Nothing is beyond my control.

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,680
This is my grandson,

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,160
Khanin Assavadevathin.

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,520
<i>Through the tears, I stared out the window</i>

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,640
<i>I couldn't see anything even a shadow</i>

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,520
<i>Every second's moving too slow</i>

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,720
<i>All I could do is hold</i>

15
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,320
<i>Hanging here in the longest, darkest night</i>

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,480
<i>At least the clock hand is moving wise</i>

17
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,960
<i>Sitting, taking longer deep sighs</i>

18
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,640
<i>Here comes another try</i>

19
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,680
<i>Light of a new dawn</i>

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,320
<i>It's time to move on</i>

21
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,040
<i>Waiting for a new day</i>

22
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,160
<i>Better days are on the way</i>

23
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,160
<i>Waiting for a new day</i>

24
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,640
<i>Waiting for a new day</i>

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,800
<i>And the sun will rise again</i>

26
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,280
<i>Waiting for a new day</i>

27
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,240
<i>It's gonna be okay</i>

28
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,240
I'm Lady Aon.

29
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,440
I'm from Thailand.

30
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,880
and so fabulous!

31
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,920
Thank you for joining us today, Lady Aon.

32
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,000
Please excuse me.

33
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Thank you.

34
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,440
Thank you for joining us,
Emperor of Da Caihong.

35
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,960
Your presence
at this momentous celebration

36
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,440
is the greatest honor
I could ever receive.

37
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
To be part of your magnificent celebration

38
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,680
is a tremendous honor for me as well.

39
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,880
The Emperor of Da Caihong,

40
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,600
<i>who has long been</i>
<i>one of Emmaly's key trade partners.</i>

41
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,320
It's an honor to meet you, Your Majesty.

42
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,240
My name is Khanin.

43
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,040
Nice to meet you, too.

44
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,640
Your piano performance today…

45
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,720
was truly enchanting and beautiful.

46
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

47
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,160
I hope today's celebration brings you joy.

48
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,480
Indeed, it does.

49
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,600
On behalf of our nation, Bhujar,

50
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,600
we humbly offer congratulations
to Your Majesty.

51
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,960
There's no need to be so formal.

52
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,920
We're close neighbors,
just like one big family.

53
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,040
Nice to meet you, Prince Khanin.

54
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
I'm Prince Calvin.

55
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,680
Nice to meet you, too, Prince Calvin.

56
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,000
Before long, I might need to ask a favor
from both of you.

57
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,880
My son, Calvin, is interested in studying
at the University of the Arts here.

58
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,760
It is a great honor for our country.

59
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,480
Today,

60
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,640
I'm truly honored
to be part of this celebration.

61
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,760
You are exceptionally gifted
in music, Your Royal Highness.

62
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,560
Thank you for your kind words.

63
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,080
It's because I've had a passion for music
since I was younger.

64
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,600
Hello.

65
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,040
Hello.

66
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,920
On behalf of Bon Dre Cher, it is a great
honor to be part of this celebration.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,120
Congratulations, Prince Khanin.

68
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,120
I'm honored by your presence as well.

69
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,960
Apart from your musical talent,

70
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,600
your fencing abilities
are equally impressive.

71
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,920
We've heard of your achievements

72
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,960
while you were still in the UK.

73
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,200
Thank you.

74
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,000
Fencing has always been a part of my life.

75
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,080
I grew up with it.

76
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,320
Ande Emmaly is known

77
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,680
for having the finest fencers.

78
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,480
Your Royal Highness,

79
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,120
it's time to get ready
for tonight's dance.

80
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,120
Thank you.

81
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,280
The pleasure is mine.

82
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Khanin, the celebration is magnificent.

83
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,200
Come, Ava. Will you dance with me?

84
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,680
Sure.

85
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,560
<i>Where the time has gone</i>

86
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,440
<i>I just know you're my world, my dawn</i>

87
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,000
<i>You've taken my heart, my soul, my way</i>

88
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,360
<i>In this night, it's us who'll stay</i>

89
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,720
<i>Moonlight shines so bright</i>

90
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,320
<i>Thousands of stars join us tonight</i>

91
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,800
<i>Every step we take, stars align</i>

92
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,040
<i>This moment feels like it's truly mine</i>

93
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,480
<i>The world's a fairy tale</i>

94
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,240
<i>In your arms tonight</i>

95
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,160
<i>I wish to stop this time</i>

96
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,560
<i>And call you my endless light</i>

97
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,480
<i>Dancing in the moonlight with you</i>

98
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,040
<i>Under the stars, just us two</i>

99
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,200
<i>With every beat, my heart's complete</i>

100
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,360
<i>You, you made my dream come true</i>

101
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,800
<i>Now and forever with you</i>

102
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,520
<i>Hold me so tight</i>

103
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,240
<i>All through the night</i>

104
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,400
<i>Hold me so tight</i>

105
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,080
<i>All through the night</i>

106
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
Thanks.

107
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,040
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

108
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,000
Let's take a break, Your Royal Highness.

109
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,920
Come on.

110
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,440
Please go on. Have fun.

111
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,240
Your Royal Highness?

112
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,160
Please listen carefully.

113
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Stick to the script.

114
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,120
Any unexpected questions…

115
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
particularly those concerning Mr. Charan…

116
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,560
Must not be addressed.

117
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,200
I understand, Chakri.

118
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,200
Mr. Charan, well…

119
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,400
I'll wait here.

120
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,520
This way, please, Your Royal Highness.

121
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,720
I still find this odd.

122
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,120
On behalf of the people of Emmaly,
I would like to offer my congratulations

123
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,200
and welcome Your Royal Highness back.

124
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,520
May I respectfully ask
about how your life was

125
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,440
before you returned to Emmaly?

126
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,320
I grew up in London.

127
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,360
To be honest, I never imagined

128
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,760
that I would ever experience
something like this in my life.

129
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,480
Living in such a grand palace

130
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,440
and living a life so different
from what I was used to.

131
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,360
<i>Adapting to this new reality</i>
<i>is incredibly challenging for me.</i>

132
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,880
<i>I'm not quite used to it.</i>

133
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,920
During the dance,

134
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Your Royal Highness seemed close
with Mr. Charan.

135
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,560
Could you share more
about that connection?

136
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
Please excuse us.

137
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,680
We're past the allotted time,

138
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,720
and Prince Khanin needs to proceed
with his next appointment.

139
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,120
Are you tired, Your Royal Highness?

140
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,160
May I offer you some treats or snacks?

141
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,320
Sounds nice.

142
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,720
Thanks, Chakri.

143
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,000
You've been a great help to me today.

144
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,640
Are you tired?

145
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,560
It's my duty, Your Royal Highness.

146
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,320
Aren't you tired of standing? Have a seat.

147
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,440
Right here.

148
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,000
What are your duties?

149
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,920
To protect and take care of Prince Khanin,

150
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,800
and to protect and remain loyal
to the Assavadevathins.

151
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,480
Those are my duties.

152
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,480
When it's just the two of us,

153
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,280
you don't need to speak so formally.

154
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,440
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

155
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,560
Okay.

156
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,400
Why weren't you with me
in the interview room?

157
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
Answer me.

158
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,560
At the dance,

159
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,600
a lot of people
were keeping an eye on us.

160
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,600
And?

161
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,280
Nothing matters more
than your public image.

162
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,000
"I care about you."

163
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,839
That's how you say it.

164
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,480
You don't know how to say it?

165
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,160
I care about you.

166
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
You do?

167
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,040
As what?

168
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,280
All right.

169
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,760
Yeah, I know. I'll be there.

170
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,080
Gosh, this will blow up the Internet.

171
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,280
They're flirting!

172
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,800
Your Royal Highness!

173
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,280
Your Royal Highness…

174
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,800
Chakri?

175
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,480
You…

176
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,000
He forgot to take off the mic,

177
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,720
and we could hear
their intimate conversation.

178
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,120
Guys, this is like a drama.
So we got this news.

179
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,280
<i>Prince Khanin and Mr. Charan</i>
<i>are a perfect match!</i>

180
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,200
<i>Gosh!</i>

181
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,880
What are your thoughts on this?

182
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,480
I don't think it's possible
that they're a couple.

183
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,800
Charan is wise

184
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,440
and well aware of his status.

185
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,560
So you believe…

186
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,920
it's all just to draw attention?

187
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,240
Dating rumors that spark curiosity

188
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,160
can really stir up attention,

189
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,200
but it's unclear if this one
was intentional or just an accident.

190
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,080
How are you still smiling, Ava?

191
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,680
Do you think popularity
is just a trivial thing?

192
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,760
It may not directly affect the Competition
according to the old rules,

193
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,120
but I don't think
things will go that smoothly.

194
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,480
His Majesty…

195
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,320
will likely make some adjustments.

196
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,920
That's why

197
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,720
you should start looking for a coach
to train you from now on.

198
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,840
Mira is already the perfect fit.

199
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,920
I shall take my leave.

200
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,640
<i>"I care about you." That's how you say it.</i>

201
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,440
PRINCE KHANIN AND HIS GUARD TALKING!

202
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,200
<i>You don't know how to say it?</i>

203
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,520
<i>I care about you.</i>

204
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,760
<i>You do?</i>

205
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,720
<i>As what?</i>

206
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,760
Make sure Prince Ramil's bike
is in good condition.

207
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,320
Yes, sir.

208
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,560
Your Royal Highness…

209
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,200
How did this go viral?

210
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,400
ALL EYES ON PRINCE KHANIN AND HIS GUARD.

211
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,800
The Assavadevathins could have
intentionally stirred up this rumor.

212
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,200
Do you know why I called for you?

213
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,560
To ask us about the rumors?

214
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,760
Although today's world
embraces marriage equality…

215
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,840
you're my grandson…

216
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,120
and I've adopted Charan.

217
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,040
Any relationship
that goes beyond family ties…

218
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,520
would be inappropriate.

219
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,200
Grandfather, Charan and I are close

220
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,080
simply because he was the one
who brought me back.

221
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,840
We've been through
life-threatening situations together.

222
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,960
But care that goes beyond that closeness…

223
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,840
doesn't look good, Charan.

224
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,400
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

225
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,480
I'm merely taking care
of His Royal Highness

226
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,560
in my capacity as his royal guard.

227
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,560
I have no other feelings or intentions.

228
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,760
He's right, Grandfather.

229
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,920
I don't have
any feelings for him, either.

230
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,240
Given that this is Khanin's introduction,

231
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,840
you must exercise extra caution
from here on.

232
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,800
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

233
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,640
The rumors.
What are you going to do about them?

234
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,560
I humbly request
your pardon, Your Majesty.

235
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,640
I have a suggestion to make.

236
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,040
<i>At this time,</i>

237
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,600
<i>His Royal Highness is receiving</i>
<i>overwhelming support from the public.</i>

238
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,520
<i>Would it not be wise</i>
<i>to shape his public image</i>

239
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,560
<i>as someone warm and accessible?</i>

240
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,440
<i>I believe such an approach</i>
<i>would win him public affection.</i>

241
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,560
<i>If the Royal Palace</i>
<i>attempts to correct the rumors now,</i>

242
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,360
<i>it might raise doubts among the public,</i>

243
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,520
<i>suggesting a cover-up or fabrication.</i>

244
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,440
<i>Might this not affect</i>
<i>His Royal Highness' reputation adversely?</i>

245
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,480
Smile a bit wider.

246
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,720
Ready? This way, please.

247
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,400
Please smile, Mr. Charan.

248
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,000
This day's finally over.

249
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,520
Your Royal Highness,
how about taking a shower first?

250
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,360
It could help you feel better.

251
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,680
Let's go.

252
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,040
Stop right there.

253
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,760
Stop.

254
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,360
I can do it myself.

255
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,360
It's been a long day. Go get some rest.

256
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,720
Were you talking to me, too?

257
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,160
Who said you could leave?

258
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,840
Your Royal Highness…

259
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,040
There's no one else here.

260
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,600
Okay.

261
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,240
When you spoke to Grandfather,

262
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
what did you mean…

263
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,280
when you said
you were merely being my royal guard?

264
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,880
That's what I have to do.

265
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,600
But we're friends, too, aren't we?

266
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,120
If there's nothing else…

267
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,600
please rest.

268
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,520
You have an early lesson
on Emmaly tomorrow.

269
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,880
<i>In ancient times,</i>

270
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,360
<i>Emmaly was long ruled</i>
<i>by the Bhuchongpisut royal dynasty.</i>

271
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,080
<i>However, during the colonial era,</i>

272
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,600
<i>Emmaly fell in defeat.</i>

273
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,040
<i>Invading soldiers</i>
<i>oppressed the people for decades,</i>

274
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,560
<i>plunging them</i>
<i>into poverty and hardship.</i>

275
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,920
<i>Eventually, they rose up in unison,</i>

276
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,320
<i>and the heir of the Bhuchongpisuts</i>
<i>rose with them.</i>

277
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,960
<i>He challenged the enemy</i>
<i>to a fencing duel.</i>

278
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,120
<i>Whichever side prevailed</i>
<i>would lay rightful claim to Emmaly.</i>

279
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,840
<i>The Bhuchongpisut led the nation</i>
<i>to reclaim its independence.</i>

280
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,080
<i>Out of deep gratitude and reverence,</i>

281
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,240
<i>he named his father the King of Emmaly.</i>

282
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,320
As the victory had been won
through the alliance of four clans,

283
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,560
Prince Thanes Bhuchongpisut announced
the Royal Fencing Competition

284
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,280
to determine the rightful heir
to the throne.

285
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,160
What's on your mind, Your Royal Highness?

286
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,640
Nothing.

287
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,600
Forget it.

288
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,280
Go on. I'm listening.

289
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,360
What awaits Your Royal Highness

290
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,760
after the current king
abdicates the throne

291
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,720
is the Royal Fencing Competition,

292
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,400
held to determine the next king.

293
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,720
Should the heir of any clan
emerge victorious,

294
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,160
their father shall ascend
as the next King of Emmaly.

295
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,360
So, now that
I'm finally becoming useful,

296
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,960
the Assavadevathins decided
to bring me back?

297
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,480
Your Royal Highness…

298
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,360
At the time,

299
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,840
they were simply trying to keep you safe.

300
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,840
So that I could compete one day.

301
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,120
I don't mind it, actually.

302
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,040
You both know

303
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,600
that I returned and agreed to compete

304
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,960
just to find out
what happened to my dad.

305
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,360
But even now, I still don't know a thing.

306
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,200
May I have your word…

307
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,600
that if I tell you this,
you will not put yourself in danger?

308
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,440
What have you got?

309
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,400
Please promise me first.

310
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,960
Okay.

311
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,840
I promise.

312
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I had Vetith look into the evidence I got
from one of the attackers in the UK.

313
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,640
As you can see,

314
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,840
he really is a police officer
in Bhuchongpisut.

315
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,000
Look at this.

316
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,440
That's the photo the Royal Palace
released to the press.

317
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,920
Prince Rachata.

318
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,240
I looked into his background.

319
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,400
He climbed the ranks way too fast.

320
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,960
The attempt on Khanin's life
could be linked to the Bhuchongpisuts.

321
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,600
Maybe you're right, maybe not.

322
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,400
Have you told Grandfather?

323
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,760
You're the first to know.

324
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,640
- And I'll--
- Don't tell him yet.

325
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,640
I think…

326
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,280
we should investigate it ourselves first.

327
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,560
Also…

328
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,520
I want to go to Bhuchongpisut.

329
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,160
His DNA matches Tharin's 99%.

330
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,600
Prince Khanin has arrived.

331
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,160
Khanin, did your journey go smoothly?

332
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,920
We are delighted
that you came to visit our city.

333
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,280
My journey did go smoothly,
Uncle and Ramil.

334
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,400
Khanin,

335
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,440
I'm very glad
that you came to visit Bhuchongpisut.

336
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,720
How about this?

337
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,160
I'll get Ramil to show you around.

338
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,200
You're the same age.
Get to know each other.

339
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,000
So you won't feel uneasy around me.

340
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,520
Thank you for your concern, Uncle.

341
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,880
Once you've finished touring around,

342
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,240
I'll have Ramil take you to our museum.

343
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,160
It's full of historical facts
about Emmaly.

344
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,640
You'll have the chance to learn more.

345
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,960
Understood, Father.

346
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,760
If you have any questions at all,
I'm here to answer them.

347
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,760
After all, the Bhuchongpisut clan
remains the oldest royal family.

348
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,840
That sounds like a great idea.

349
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,960
I hope you don't mind, Ramil.

350
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,800
Follow me. This way.

351
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,640
Khanin,

352
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,920
I've taken you around the entire palace.

353
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,960
But there's one more important place

354
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,320
that I'd like you to see.

355
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,320
An important place?

356
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,000
Isn't that the Bhuchongpisut Palace?

357
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,440
There's another important place
outside the palace

358
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,680
that's closed to outsiders.

359
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,000
Only the Bhuchongpisuts have access.

360
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,280
If you don't mind,
would you go with me this evening?

361
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,200
I don't think Ramil had anything
to do with Prince Rachata's plans.

362
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,120
Or maybe the Bhuchongpisuts
aren't even responsible.

363
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,840
We can't be sure of that yet.

364
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,160
Either way, do not trust Prince Ramil.

365
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,520
I don't trust anyone but you.

366
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,720
Are you sure you don't need an escort?

367
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I'll be fine.

368
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,080
He wouldn't act so brazenly.

369
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,600
Your Royal Highness, always remember

370
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,640
that Prince Ramil is your rival
in the Royal Competition.

371
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,320
Never underestimate him.

372
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,200
I won't.

373
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,240
I'll call you if anything happens.

374
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,920
This stunning place

375
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,080
is closed to outsiders, Ramil?

376
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
Certain places…

377
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,800
aren't meant for everyone.

378
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,240
You may not know this yet,

379
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,720
but your mother, Princess Khunita,
was from the Bhuchongpisut bloodline.

380
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,720
She was my father's cousin.

381
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,320
We're actually family.

382
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,880
Anyway…

383
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,680
please let me give you a gift, brother.

384
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,880
Thank you, Ramil.

385
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,360
When I was just a kid,
whenever I felt low…

386
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,640
I'd come here by myself.

387
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,200
The pressure from all the expectations…

388
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,160
made me feel so small.

389
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,320
Being part of the royal family

390
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,280
must have weighed heavily on that kid.

391
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,160
It was to help you stand
with the grace you possess today.

392
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,360
This is the Serpent King statue,

393
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,000
a revered figure that our family
has honored and worshiped for centuries.

394
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,760
You might find it familiar

395
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:49,200
since the emblem of the Bhuchongpisut clan
was inspired by this very statue.

396
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,840
You can compare it
with the bracelet I just gave you.

397
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,880
Khanin…

398
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,200
The bracelet…

399
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,720
Did you drop it around here?

400
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,000
You may not know this…

401
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,040
but in the Bhuchongpisut clan,

402
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
we value every gift we receive

403
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,560
and protect it with our lives.

404
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,320
But don't worry.

405
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,000
I'll go find it out there
where we came from.

406
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,240
Keep looking around here, okay?

407
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,400
Okay.

408
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,640
Prepare a meal for His Royal Highness.

409
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,680
- You may do it now.
- Understood.

410
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Professor Charan.

411
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,000
Why are you all by yourself?

412
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,840
Where are Prince Ramil and Prince Khanin?

413
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,000
They went to the forest behind the palace.

414
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,360
When did they go?

415
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,680
Four hours ago.

416
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,640
They must be on their way back.

417
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,520
Khanin's gone missing,
and I can't reach his phone.

418
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,120
Hang on, Mr. Charan.

419
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,640
Why are you back already?
Weren't you supposed to return tomorrow?

420
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,040
This is not the time.
We need to find Prince Khanin.

421
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,000
- Prince Khanin!
- Khanin.

422
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,040
- Khanin!
- Prince Khanin!

423
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,840
Prince Khanin?

424
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,920
Prince Khanin!

425
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,840
Prince Khanin!

426
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,960
We went this way.

427
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,720
I'll go this way.

428
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,480
Prince Khanin!

429
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,400
Prince Khanin!

430
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,360
You three go that way.
The rest, come with me.

431
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,880
Yes, Your Highness.

432
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,320
Prince Khanin!

433
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,400
Prince Khanin.

434
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,320
Charan!

435
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,040
Is that you?

436
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,120
I'm right here.

437
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,360
Are you okay, Your Royal Highness?

438
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,400
Yeah.

439
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,600
I fell off my bike.

440
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,040
The tires are flat.

441
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,640
All I could do was wait.

442
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,920
Are you wounded?

443
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,400
Got this when I fell off.

444
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,920
I'm sorry to make you worry.

445
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,520
Please don't be.

446
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,080
It's my fault.

447
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,520
How is it your fault?

448
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,000
It was just an accident.

449
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,000
No, it wasn't.

450
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,000
It's still my fault.

451
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,000
If I fail to act when you're in danger,

452
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,800
then my oath to protect you with my life

453
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,120
means nothing at all.

454
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,000
- But…
- Your Royal Highness.

455
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,320
You mean more to me
than you could ever imagine.

456
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,040
Please get up slowly.

457
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,160
Well, you could've just helped me walk.

458
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,760
You've found Khanin?

459
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,480
Khanin.

460
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,680
I'm really sorry.

461
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:10,080
I actually went back to the cave,
but I didn't see you there.

462
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,040
We must have missed each other.

463
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,760
Right, the bracelet.

464
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,080
I found it.

465
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,120
I'd like to give it back to you.

466
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,720
This may hurt, Young Prince.

467
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,800
Hang in there.

468
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,920
Khanin.

469
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,520
Are you all right?

470
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,760
I'm sorry.

471
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,280
Please don't be, Uncle.

472
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,760
It's your fault,

473
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:10,120
letting Ramil take Khanin
into the forest unaccompanied.

474
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,600
Ramil, have you apologized to him?

475
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,120
I asked you if you've apologized to him.

476
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,840
Please don't do that, Uncle.

477
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,520
I'm not mad, and I don't blame him.

478
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,080
I just…

479
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,240
I don't think it's appropriate
for me to stay here tonight.

480
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,240
I'd like to take my leave, Uncle.

481
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,640
That was a stupid thing to do.

482
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,080
You are clearly dumb.

483
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,800
You think I don't know?

484
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,160
You chose to go into that forest
because there's no signal there.

485
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,480
And the missing bracelet…
That was you, wasn't it?

486
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,160
No, Father.

487
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,520
No?

488
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,160
No?

489
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,440
Listen to me.

490
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,480
As long as the Assavadevathins
are still in power,

491
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,000
don't you dare pull stunts
with Khanin again.

492
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,560
And just to be clear…

493
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,560
your stupidity got Paytai into this!

494
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,680
I shall take my leave,
Your Royal Highness.

495
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,840
Hold on.

496
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,640
Well…

497
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,000
I shall take my leave.

498
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,200
It wasn't your fault.

499
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,760
I was being stupid.

500
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,720
You got caught up
in the royal families' games.

501
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,600
I'm glad, though…

502
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,520
that you found me before they did.

503
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,360
I'm glad to have found you, too.

504
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,400
Thanks.

505
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,120
I believe…

506
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,680
the Bhuchongpisuts do not mean well
toward the Assavadevathins.

507
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,440
Something feels wrong.

508
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,760
Anyway, don't tell Grandfather
about today's incident

509
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,240
and about the attacker being
a police officer.

510
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:35,200
Make sure that none of the guards…
ever speak of what happened today.

511
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,320
It's impossible to keep secrets
from His Majesty.

512
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,720
Have a seat.

513
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,920
What brings you back early?

514
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,760
His Royal Highness has journeyed
as he pleased.

515
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,360
I'm sure you know
there's nowhere safer than here.

516
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

517
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,480
What do you think of that picture?

518
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,800
The constellation of the twins…

519
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,240
glowing brilliantly in the sky.

520
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,520
It looks quite romantic, Your Majesty.

521
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,160
The two stand side by side,

522
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,280
yet it is no easy feat.

523
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,360
Legend has it

524
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,840
that Pollux is like a god,
bestowed with immortality.

525
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,040
Castor, on the other hand,

526
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,800
is like a mortal with a fleeting life.

527
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,920
The two cannot be together…

528
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,840
unless Pollux sacrifices his immortality.

529
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,800
And should this tale culminate in death,

530
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,400
would you still find it romantic, my dear?

531
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,520
My apologies, Your Majesty.

532
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,960
In my humble opinion,

533
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,440
even though they stand together
as stars in the sky…

534
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,880
their tale endures as one of love
and leaves a lasting impression.

535
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,480
I'm sure you'd make a great artist.

536
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

537
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,760
Right, I almost forgot.

538
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,200
Prince Calvin of Bhujar

539
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,040
is to come and further his studies
in the arts at your university.

540
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:09,280
For such an important guest,
I think you're the most suitable.

541
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,760
My only fear is that…

542
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,600
I won't have enough time
for Prince Khanin's training.

543
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,720
Forget that.

544
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,800
Go on and do what you truly love.

545
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,760
As for Khanin, you can leave him to me

546
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,720
so that he finds greater focus.

547
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,400
I hope you understand.

548
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

549
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,600
It is my belief that Prince Khanin
may have ordered Mr. Charan

550
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,400
not to speak of what happened
in Bhuchongpisut.

551
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,760
Forget it.
Nothing bad happened. That's enough.

552
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

553
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,280
Some distance
between Khanin and Charan

554
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,440
is probably for the best.

555
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,400
This is Calvin,

556
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,000
an exchange student from Bhujar.

557
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,760
Please keep an eye on him for me.

558
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,840
Sure.

559
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,800
Why are you here, Your Royal Highness?

560
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,680
Why aren't you at the palace with me?

561
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,040
I was just doing my duty.

562
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,960
What about your duty to protect me,
to take care of me,

563
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,160
and protect and remain loyal
to the Assavadevathins?

564
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,560
Charan, come sit with me.

565
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,880
I'm afraid that--

566
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,560
That's an order.

567
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,600
Check out the buzz we're getting.

568
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,280
This is a good sign, right?

569
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,600
How soft.

570
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,240
There something's even softer.
