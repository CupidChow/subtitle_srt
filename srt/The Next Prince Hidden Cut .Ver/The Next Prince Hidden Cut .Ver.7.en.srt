1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,920
ALL DEPICTED EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL.

2
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,320
<i>I'd like you to take him on a trip</i>
<i>to Davichmetha for a break.</i>

3
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,800
<i>Since we've already come</i>
<i>all the way from Davin,</i>

4
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,280
<i>we shall make the most of it.</i>

5
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,920
<i>You're dying to know</i>

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,840
<i>if Khanin and Charan</i>
<i>are actually dating, right?</i>

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,200
Charan…

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,680
<i>Whenever it rains…</i>

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Mother!

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,280
<i>…it terrifies me.</i>

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,640
You've taken care of me so much.
It's my turn to take care of you.

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,080
<i>So my heart's solely made</i>

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,040
<i>Just for you, my one and only</i>

14
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,960
I…

15
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,560
You're back, Young Prince?

16
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,280
Uh… I…

17
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,880
I nodded off.
I have no idea what happened.

18
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,880
So, where did you go?
Did you have fun?

19
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
I'll see you tomorrow,
Your Royal Highness.

20
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,760
What perfect timing, Chakri.

21
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,120
Just go to bed now.

22
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
I'm sleepy.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,160
Should I take you--

24
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,440
Leave.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,840
Okay.

26
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,680
Jay.

27
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,960
You're up?

28
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,680
Any idea what you did last night?

29
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,200
Oh, hey.

30
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,080
Are you okay?

31
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Jay?

32
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,280
- You don't know who I am, do you?
- I do.

33
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,240
So you know I'm a prince?

34
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,200
You're totally wasted, Calvin.

35
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,480
Jay, give me a ride.

36
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,800
Hey, Calvin.

37
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,720
Calvin…

38
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,440
I'm sorry

39
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,200
for bothering you.

40
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,400
It's totally fine.

41
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,960
We're friends now.

42
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,960
You were so drunk last night.

43
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,360
You couldn't even talk straight,
so I didn't catch who you came with.

44
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,560
Anyway,

45
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,720
why did you come to this city?

46
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
To see my friend.

47
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Like, a friend?

48
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,360
I came to see a friend too.

49
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
Right,

50
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,440
while you were still asleep,

51
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,120
I went out and bought some food.

52
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,840
Well,

53
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,560
this place you're staying at

54
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,240
is pretty massive.

55
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,320
And it looks really nice.

56
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,520
Seems like you are

57
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,400
a super rich exchange student.

58
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,520
Or perhaps,

59
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,680
are you a prince in disguise?

60
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,360
You actually fell for it?

61
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,040
That would make a good series.

62
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,360
If you were a prince,

63
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,679
we wouldn't have been friends.

64
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,039
You must have

65
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,440
been friends with the rich guys,

66
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,679
businessmen,

67
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,160
or those royal family members,

68
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,640
right?

69
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
This is good.

70
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,440
You want this one?

71
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,720
This is just an appetizer.

72
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,200
Give it to me.

73
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,960
You can't even peel the paper off.

74
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,360
Here, have some.

75
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,040
After you lent me your handkerchief,
I started carrying my own around.

76
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,920
I haven't forgotten
to return yours though.

77
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,760
I'll give it back once I get home.

78
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Thank you.

79
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,680
Anyway, where do you live?

80
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,800
I live in Meenanagarin.

81
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,920
If there's a long break sometime,

82
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,480
would you like to go there?

83
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
I'll show you around.

84
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,440
There are fish to see

85
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,960
and beaches to check out.

86
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
What do you think?

87
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,200
I want to go there.

88
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,400
I'll see you over the break then.

89
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,320
Okay.

90
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
One sec.

91
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah, what's up?

92
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,600
The wildfire protest at five
has changed its location.

93
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,160
What? To where?

94
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,760
The city square.
You're still coming, right?

95
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,760
Yeah, I'm coming.

96
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
I'll see you there.

97
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,960
I have to go see my friend.

98
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,040
There's a protest to raise awareness
about wildfires today.

99
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,800
Would you like to come along?

100
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,480
I might have to excuse myself.
I've got something to take care of.

101
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
I see.

102
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,520
Let's finish our meal
and head our separate ways.

103
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,440
Alright.

104
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,440
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.

105
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,360
You again, Chakri.

106
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,720
What do you mean, Your Royal Highness?

107
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
I see.

108
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,400
Whatever you command,
I am at your service, Young Prince.

109
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,720
I don't want anything.

110
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,760
There is no need to be hesitant.

111
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,440
Kindly command me, Young Prince.

112
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
Oh.

113
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,680
It seems you're in quite a hurry today.

114
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,960
Chakri!

115
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,920
Only Charan is allowed to follow me.

116
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,800
Gosh.

117
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,760
Hey.

118
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,960
Why did you want me here?

119
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,000
What do you think?

120
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,080
I wanted to talk about
what happened in Davichmetha.

121
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,280
Okay.

122
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,600
You've saved me once again.

123
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,240
Who do you think did it?

124
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,680
Thank you very much,
Your Royal Highness.

125
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,920
Prince Chana?

126
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
I don't think so.

127
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,800
He wouldn't dare do that
in front of his daughter.

128
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
I can't be certain about this yet,

129
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,400
but I've had someone
watch the Bhuchongpisuts closely.

130
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,960
It's been revealed that
Prince Rachata is displeased

131
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,640
seeing you in the spotlight.

132
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,200
It felt more like a distraction

133
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,560
or a test.

134
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,560
If they really wanted to hurt me,
it wouldn't have been this sloppy.

135
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,840
I'm guessing they had another motive.

136
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,360
We must be extra cautious.

137
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,160
Who knows what could happen next?

138
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,360
It's okay.

139
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,600
I've got you by my side.

140
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,320
VEDISH: KANIN AND HIS COMPANION'S MOMENTS

141
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,280
IS THIS LEGIT?

142
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,840
I'LL UPDATE ABOUT THATDANAI.

143
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,160
CHARAN: MIGHT BE OUT OF TOUCH FOR A WHILE.
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM FOR ME.

144
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,080
THANKUNEXT: I LOVE
HOW DOWN-TO-EARTH THE ROYALS ARE

145
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,120
His Royal Highness is receiving
a great deal of attention.

146
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,800
It may seem inappropriate,

147
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,680
yet he's winning hearts
all over social media.

148
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,360
His Royal Highness
and Mr. Charan have returned.

149
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,840
Shall I summon him
to see you now, Your Majesty?

150
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,880
Summon him.

151
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,760
I need to be clear.

152
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,760
Your Royal Highness,

153
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,319
a serious matter has arisen.

154
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,680
I know you're clever enough
to figure out why I summoned you.

155
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,560
I am well aware.

156
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,200
I beg your forgiveness
for the offense I have caused.

157
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,480
Your Royal Highness.

158
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,400
You need to wait.

159
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,920
It is unacceptable
to take Khanin into such a location.

160
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,000
You'll receive punishment
for neglecting your duty

161
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,280
to care for Khanin,

162
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,640
which exposed him to unnecessary danger.

163
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,720
You're dismissed from you role,

164
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,320
confined, and prohibited from seeing him.

165
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,800
I don't care.

166
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,400
Have you forgotten
the manners I taught you?

167
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,600
This is not the time!

168
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,360
Your Royal Highness…

169
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,320
Chakri.

170
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,600
I have neglected my duty

171
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,280
and committed the offense
as you've decreed.

172
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,680
I am deserving of the punishment.

173
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
So you want me to lose the Competition?

174
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
You aren't allowed to interfere.

175
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,440
You can't dismiss him.

176
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,960
I do not consent to it.

177
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,800
You don't need to worry.
An excellent coach has been appointed.

178
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,640
The Assavadevathins
shall forever stand above all.

179
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,120
- I don't think--
- Khanin!

180
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,200
My commands are absolute.
This is none of your concern.

181
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,960
Your Royal Highness…

182
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,000
Please come here.

183
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,920
Khanin may not know,

184
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,560
but you should know the reason
behind my actions.

185
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,480
How could it not be my concern?

186
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,360
- Your Royal Highness!
- Stop it.

187
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,160
If I can't vent in my space,
why bother being a prince?

188
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
May you find calm.

189
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,440
It's ill

190
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,520
striving against the stream.

191
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,280
I'm already backing off.

192
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,680
You may be a prince,

193
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,000
but remember

194
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,280
that your grandfather is the King,
Your Royal Highness.

195
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,440
Our agent within Davin Palace reports

196
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,160
an abrupt replacement
of Prince Khanin's coach.

197
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,840
Mr. Charan is now confined
and barred from see him.

198
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,080
That old man

199
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,040
can't stand the idea of his grandson
being with someone of a lower class.

200
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,960
You think you're so superior, huh?

201
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,960
I saw this as the perfect chance

202
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,840
to have our agent inserted
beside Prince Khanin.

203
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,000
Coincidentally, among the names
for the new coach

204
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,080
is a fencer who is one of ours.

205
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,040
Thus, I have taken
appropriate action accordingly.

206
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
How did it go?

207
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Did His Majesty choose him?

208
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,080
It's good news for us.

209
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Great.

210
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,360
Make sure he reports
on everything about Khanin.

211
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,760
I won't let him miss a single detail.

212
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,680
The Bhuchongpisuts

213
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,200
shall rise to the throne again.

214
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,640
His Majesty has assigned this coach

215
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,320
to be your personal trainer,
Your Royal Highness.

216
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,480
I am Joe.

217
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,160
He used to be
on the national fencing team

218
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,120
and is proficient in several sports,

219
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,320
including archery, Your Royal Highness.

220
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,480
Please extend my thanks to His Majesty.

221
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,640
Training may start tomorrow.

222
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,840
Do you think

223
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,080
I can text Charan that…

224
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,960
If you don't wish for him
to face a harsher punishment,

225
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,800
don't let anyone hear you mention him.

226
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,560
About getting in touch,

227
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,400
I think his phone must've been taken away.

228
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,560
Can you check on him for me then?

229
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,000
Find out where he is and how he's doing.

230
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,080
And if you happen to see him,
please convey my apologies.

231
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,840
Yes.

232
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,720
No need to be formal, dear.

233
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,720
Alright, Father.

234
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,480
I've heard about your new coach.

235
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,760
Is everything okay with you?

236
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
It is, Father.

237
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,560
Did you come here today
on official business?

238
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,920
I was worried about you,

239
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,920
so I made up some business to come here.

240
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,000
Thank you, Father.

241
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,040
Khanin,

242
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,960
I want you to realize that

243
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,880
endangering a prince's life

244
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,240
is a grave offense.

245
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,160
Charan's confinement

246
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,080
is already an act of kindness
from His Majesty.

247
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,840
But it's not fair.

248
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,800
He was trying to protect me.

249
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,920
Without him,

250
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,520
I have no one else to trust.

251
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,200
Being a prince

252
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,720
with the duty to compete
in the Competition is not easy, dear.

253
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
Khanin,

254
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,440
from now on,
you must always be vigilant.

255
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,640
Yes, Father.

256
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,120
Your Royal Highness,

257
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,680
we have stayed here longer than planned

258
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,240
and have now passed the scheduled time
to return to Davin.

259
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,360
It can wait.

260
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,880
They won't be so hard on me.

261
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,640
Ava!

262
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,240
Yes, Father?

263
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,440
Are you seriously going to hide
what happened that night from me?

264
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,440
Do you even realize what you've done?

265
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,720
Just because the princes
can do something

266
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,720
doesn't mean
you're allowed to do the same.

267
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,240
Here we go again.

268
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,640
It's always about my gender.

269
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,920
How many more times
must I hear those things?

270
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,680
You're a woman. You need to accept it.

271
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,000
I have. What about you?
Have you accepted it yet?

272
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,920
Or have you always been disappointed
that your heir is a woman?

273
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,960
I shall take my leave to Davin,

274
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,880
and from now on,
I shall prove myself to you, Father.

275
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,280
Ava!

276
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,560
He should've come already!

277
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,160
Mr. Wirun,

278
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,840
may I take a couple of minutes
of your time?

279
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,000
Could you kindly tell me
where Mr. Charan is being confined?

280
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,080
Why do you need to know?

281
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,560
His Majesty's command

282
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,040
prevents him
from seeing His Royal Highness.

283
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,240
But I am not His Royal Highness,

284
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,320
am I?

285
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,200
Come on, Mr. Wirun.

286
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
I truly wish to see him.

287
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,400
Is it not possible for me
to know where he is?

288
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,520
The couple of minutes are up.

289
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,840
Guess I can go now, right?

290
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Uh…

291
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,320
Where are you going?

292
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,800
To see Mr. Charan?

293
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,160
Should I come along?

294
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,720
Would you like me
to prepare a meal set for him?

295
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,560
Well, I happen to be free right now.

296
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,560
Mr. Wirun!

297
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,720
Mr. Wirun!

298
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,320
What a mean guy.

299
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,040
Oh…

300
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,040
Hold on.

301
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,200
Who are you serving that to?

302
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,640
Uh, this is for…

303
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,480
Mr. Wirun.

304
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,760
I see.

305
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,640
It's Mr. Wirun's?

306
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,120
Yes.

307
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,200
Wow, some Thai snacks!

308
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,840
I didn't know

309
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,120
he enjoyed Thai snacks, too.

310
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
Neigh!

311
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
Neigh…

312
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,520
Neigh!

313
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,920
Chakri.

314
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,800
Gosh,

315
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,600
Mr. Charan.

316
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,960
You scared me.

317
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,240
My heart dropped to my stomach!

318
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,400
How did you find me?

319
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,600
Were you following that royal attendant?

320
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,280
Well…

321
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,640
His Royal Highness

322
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,640
is very worried about you,

323
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,560
so he asked me to find you.

324
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
Also,

325
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
he asked me to apologize to you
on his behalf.

326
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,200
Please tell His Royal Highness

327
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,600
not to worry about me.

328
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,760
He should focus on his training

329
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,120
and be careful.

330
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,320
Pardon?

331
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Be careful?

332
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,440
There are plenty of coaches
in this country,

333
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,120
yet somehow only this one
happened to be available.

334
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,840
I have a feeling this new coach

335
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,080
is somehow tied
to Prince Rachata's actions.

336
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,680
Okay. Understood.

337
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,800
I'll take care of His Royal Highness.

338
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,680
And I won't let him know

339
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,200
that you're here.

340
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
Uh…

341
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,000
But…

342
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,480
just to be sure,

343
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,120
are you really okay being here?

344
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,320
I actually like it here.

345
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,800
Just can't go anywhere for now.

346
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,720
His Majesty didn't mean
to punish me too harshly.

347
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,200
The reason is just…

348
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
I'll go back inside.

349
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,800
Oh, okay.

350
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,760
Chakri,

351
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,480
please keep a close watch
over His Royal Highness.

352
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,920
Yes.

353
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,720
Well done, Your Royal Highness.

354
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,440
You've shown great endurance.

355
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,120
I believe someone once told you

356
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,280
that your greatest strength
is your speed.

357
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,679
I am aware.

358
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,080
But your weakness
lies in your endurance.

359
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,600
You run out of energy early
as your skills aren't strong enough.

360
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,000
We'll have to push harder in training
from now on.

361
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,200
You've trained hard today.

362
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,760
Yeah.

363
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,800
Thanks, Chakri.

364
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
Since you were busy
with practice all day,

365
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,160
I…

366
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,520
haven't had the chance
to share the news yet.

367
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,800
What?

368
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,320
Have you found Charan?

369
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,240
Yes.

370
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,400
He is doing alright,

371
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,960
and he wanted me to tell you

372
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,000
not to worry about him.

373
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,080
He said you should focus
on your training

374
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,960
and be careful, Your Royal Highness.

375
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,640
I can't go to him, can I?

376
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,560
Should you insist

377
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,240
on sneaking out to meet him,

378
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,800
it will surely be discovered.

379
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,520
And now,

380
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,840
the punishment could be
even more severe.

381
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,480
Therefore, you can't see him.

382
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,080
I affirm with my honor as your butler

383
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,160
that he is indeed safe,
Your Royal Highness.

384
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Again, Your Royal Highness.

385
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,880
Again.

386
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
Again.

387
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Again.

388
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,280
That was too weak.

389
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,000
Again.

390
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,080
Again.

391
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,200
Again.

392
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,360
Again.

393
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,160
Again, Your Royal Highness.

394
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
That's enough!

395
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,400
He might get injured.

396
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,800
Here,

397
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,080
let me help.

398
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,920
I was gonna stop after all.

399
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
But you haven't been
performing well yet.

400
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
You've only managed
to hit the bullseye a few times.

401
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,280
I can't keep going anymore.

402
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,760
Let's just do it later.

403
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,760
Oh, Your Royal Highness…

404
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,280
Who do you think you are?

405
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,480
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.

406
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,200
No one has ever disregarded
my commands before.

407
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,280
No one ever ignores what I say, either.

408
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,400
I said I couldn't keep going.

409
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,480
Do you want me to end up injured?

410
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,040
It's odd.

411
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,040
Pardon me, Your Royal Highness?

412
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,520
Ever since I came here

413
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,200
and became a prince,

414
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,560
I've never had this feeling before.

415
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,600
Are you referring to…

416
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,160
Coach Joe, Your Royal Highness?

417
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,240
Yeah.

418
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,000
Do you feel the same way I do, Chakri?

419
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,800
Yes, I do.

420
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,080
His tone, expression, and demeanor

421
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,800
seem lacking in sincerity.

422
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,160
Be assured, however,

423
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,760
that I…

424
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,880
will not allow any harm to befall you.

425
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,480
You have my words.

426
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,040
So…

427
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,280
Shall we proceed

428
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,040
with our first lesson today?

429
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,760
Today's lesson focuses on
the geography of Emmaly.

430
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,680
Anything else I need to improve?

431
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,600
Your archery skills are truly impressive,
Your Royal Highness,

432
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,640
yet there's one thing
that needs improvement.

433
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,040
The most important point is that,

434
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,040
when it is time to rest,

435
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,520
you must indeed rest.

436
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,720
And now is the time.

437
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,080
- But if I don't…
- Your Royal Highness,

438
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,160
please don't put too much pressure
on yourself.

439
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,240
I can't

440
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,080
since I don't wish for Father
to reproach me again,

441
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,240
especially regarding the Competition.

442
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,000
Let us practice archery here instead.

443
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,040
New surroundings

444
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,120
may help lighten the mood.

445
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,080
Since the archery competition
will take place in a simulated field,

446
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,520
practicing here
would be quite effective.

447
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,880
I have also heard that Charan…

448
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,560
often comes here for workouts, right?

449
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,320
Mr. Charan?

450
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,400
I knew it.

451
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,440
Your Royal Highness,

452
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,560
I do not feel at ease with him.

453
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,680
The bow you'll be using today
differs slightly from the previous one.

454
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,800
I have made some adjustments
to better suit your needs.

455
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,520
I prefer the one I've been using.

456
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,080
Now.

457
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:51,920
Now.

458
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,160
Now.

459
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,480
Now.

460
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,360
Now.

461
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,680
Now.

462
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,440
Your Royal Highness,

463
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,800
are you okay?

464
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,240
Your Royal Highness…

465
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,880
Your Royal Highness!

466
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,880
Your Royal Highness…

467
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,760
Your Royal Highness!

468
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,960
Your Royal Highness!

469
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,880
Your Royal Highness,

470
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,200
can you hear me?

471
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,080
Get the doctors now!

472
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,280
Your Royal Highness!

473
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,360
- What happened to him?
- He collapsed

474
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,760
after an archery training session.

475
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,120
It may have been too intense.

476
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,040
Please have all of his food
and belongings thoroughly inspected.

477
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,480
This may involve poisoning.

478
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,400
Understood.

479
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,040
Head to the kitchen

480
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,040
and carry out an inspection.

481
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:45,960
Your Royal Highness…

482
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:47,960
Your Royal Highness!

483
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,400
You…

484
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,640
Go find Coach Joe at once.

485
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,560
Now!

486
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,440
Come on.

487
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,840
His Royal Highness is now safe,

488
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,880
but he has not yet awakened.

489
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,800
How did the poison reach him?

490
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,760
I have confirmed that

491
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,160
the poison came from the bow,
Your Royal Highness.

492
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,800
The amount was not large,

493
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,800
but His Royal Highness
had prolonged exposure.

494
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,360
Fortunately, Mr. Charan intervened

495
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,240
and raised concerns
about the poison in time.

496
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,880
Had it been discovered any later,

497
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,680
His Royal Highness

498
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,240
might have suffered paralysis

499
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,440
or…

500
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,480
The blame rests solely with me,
Your Majesty.

501
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,000
Please allow me
to accept any punishment.

502
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,600
Should you bear the blame,

503
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,720
I must bear greater still.

504
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,080
I'm most curious as to how that coach
managed to embed himself among us.

505
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,720
The fault lies with my own negligence.

506
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,240
Please allow me
to accept any punishment, Your Majesty.

507
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,800
You all want punishment,

508
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,760
but without Charan's intervention
to save my grandson,

509
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,880
such punishment
would serve no purpose.

510
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,200
Thank you, Charan.

511
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,680
Your confinement is lifted,

512
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:59,720
and you shall be reinstated
as Khanin's coach.

513
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,400
Your command is my will.

514
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,520
My gratitude to you, Your Majesty.

515
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,120
I also entrust you with his care.

516
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,320
With the Royal Competition approaching,

517
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,200
trust becomes increasingly scarce.

518
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,920
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

519
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,920
Your kindness is beyond measure.

520
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,760
I want to entrust you with something.

521
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,120
If it concerns the infiltrator,

522
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,800
I shall closely monitor the situation,
Your Majesty.

523
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,240
I wish to know

524
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,800
who stands against me,

525
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,480
no matter what means it takes.

526
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,800
Thank you
for keeping a close watch on him.

527
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,760
It is a great honor
to have carried out your command.

528
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,600
Who sent you here?

529
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,440
It was all staged.

530
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,320
No need to explain

531
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,920
what happens to those
who fail in their duties.

532
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,400
No one is behind this.

533
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Very well.

534
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,200
If an order is given to get rid of you,

535
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,360
there's nothing we can do to help.

536
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,640
If I told you…

537
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,920
Why?

538
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,440
I want to be unharmed.

539
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,960
Just keep a close watch on him.

540
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,080
Your hands, please.

541
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,520
Any news on Khanin?

542
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,360
Currently,

543
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,960
there's a thorough investigation
into Prince Khanin's coach,

544
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,920
but it's being kept confidential.

545
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,680
So, is Khanin dead?

546
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Your Royal Highness!

547
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,360
You should not express such thought
at a time like this.

548
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,920
You are worrying too much.

549
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,360
I, too, am concerned.

550
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,880
His death would take away all the fun.

551
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,360
My apologies, Your Majesty.

552
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,800
He must've been beheaded by now.

553
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,240
This won't end here.

554
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,560
Uncover the truth.

555
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,320
I will bring the culprit to justice!

556
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,920
Princess Ava…

557
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,880
How is Khanin doing?

558
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,720
I came to check on him.

559
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,120
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.

560
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,640
His Majesty has forbidden any visitors
to see His Royal Highness.

561
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,280
I'm afraid…

562
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,640
you're also not allowed to…

563
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,360
I understand.

564
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,320
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

565
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,440
Why are you treated as an outsider?

566
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,320
I am indeed not from this family.

567
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,720
♫I need your love♫

568
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,080
♫The only love I've longed for,♫

569
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,320
♫Just the word "love" from you,
and that's all♫

570
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,840
♫Let me hear it, I won't ask for more♫

571
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,160
♫I need your love♫

572
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,560
♫The only one I adore,♫

573
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:59,640
♫My heart's been waiting
just for you, my all♫

574
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,240
Your Royal Highness,

575
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,800
- can you hear me?
- Your Royal Highness…

576
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,120
- Your Royal Highness…
- Get the doctors now!

577
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,680
You're awake, Your Royal Highness.

578
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,920
Are you able to sit up?

579
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,800
Please have some water first.

580
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,480
How are you feeling,
Your Royal Highness?

581
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,080
My head aches,

582
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,120
and my eyes hurt.

583
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,080
What happened to me?

584
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,000
You were poisoned.

585
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,720
You've been unconscious
for two full days and nights.

586
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,040
Poisoned?

587
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,600
The poison came from the bow you used.

588
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,280
Coach Joe attempted to harm you,
Your Royal Highness.

589
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,480
Shall I…

590
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,560
summon the royal physicians
to examine you, just to be safe?

591
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:26,920
Okay.

592
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,160
What about…

593
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,840
Anything you wish, Your Royal Highness?

594
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,840
Oh…

595
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,160
Mr. Charan…

596
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,560
suspected the presence of poison,

597
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,840
allowing the royal physicians
to save you in time.

598
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,680
So,

599
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,240
shall I summon Mr. Charan
to see you now?

600
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,320
As you wish, Your Royal Highness.

601
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:07,760
Uh…

602
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,920
In fact, he's been keeping vigil

603
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,120
by your side throughout the nights.

604
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,080
Oops…

605
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,440
What did I just say?

606
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,360
Let's just forget it.

607
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,080
I'll go get him immediately.

608
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,480
Your Royal Highness,

609
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,560
are you hurt?

610
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,880
If you hadn't suspected the poison,

611
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,560
I might have followed my dad
to the grave.

612
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,440
I am…

613
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,000
I am worried about you.

614
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,240
Thanks.

615
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,920
It was my fault.

616
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,880
I caused you to face such danger.

617
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,960
How could it be your fault?

618
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,480
You were dismissed.

619
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,360
However,

620
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,680
Mr. Charan has been reinstated
as your coach, Your Royal Highness.

621
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,920
Really?

622
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,760
That's perfect!

623
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:14,080
I shall proceed
to prepare your meal in advance.

624
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,480
Welcome back, my royal guard.

625
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,200
You actually know how to smile.

626
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,840
It looks good on you.

627
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:11,160
Chakri didn't lie:
you did stay by my side.

628
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,520
I know this touch.

629
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:35,440
♫I trust you♫

630
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,280
♫The only one I trust, that's you♫

631
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,800
♫I trust you♫

632
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,480
♫No matter what this life may do,♫

633
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:49,560
♫Just promise me you will stay, too♫

634
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:55,160
♫A new world lies ahead,
and I'll follow you♫

635
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,000
I vow…

636
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,600
to protect you with my life.

637
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:47,720
♫So my heart's solely made♫

638
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,320
♫Just for you, my one and only♫

639
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,840
♫I'll look the other way,♫

640
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,720
♫Ignoring what others say♫

641
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:01,640
♫I'll just turn a blind eye,♫

642
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:05,000
♫Letting other voices pass by♫

643
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:08,600
♫Just for a few seconds,♫

644
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,680
♫My love is for no one else,♫

645
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,640
♫But you♫

646
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:32,440
♫Even if my life meets its end,♫

647
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,840
♫My love for you will never bend♫

648
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,240
♫Heaven and earth bear witness♫

649
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,320
♫Across all lifetimes,♫

650
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,920
♫Our love is endless♫

651
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,440
♫Forever will my heart stay loyal♫

652
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,880
It's his favorite.

653
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:56,280
♫Through the end of time♫

654
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:00,160
Lolane Intense Care, Water Treatment…

655
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:05,840
♫Just for you, my one and only♫

656
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,680
It feels like I forced you to do this.

657
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I'm willing to do it.

658
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:15,960
♫I'll turn a blind eye♫

659
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:19,000
♫And just let other voices pass by♫

660
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,040
What a nice smell.

661
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,200
I'll have Chakri order more of it.

662
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:30,359
But without you,

663
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,760
I'm not sure
it would've smelled this good.

664
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,560
I don't wanna sleep anymore.

665
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,040
I've done that all day long.

666
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,399
I have fully recovered.

667
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:09,439
Seriously.

668
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,319
That's good news,

669
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,520
but you must still rest.

670
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:28,880
Now that I'm better,

671
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,359
you won't stay anymore, will you?

672
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,800
You no longer need to stay as my guard,

673
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,400
but may we be together

674
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,720
as something else?

675
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,520
I want you to touch me here…

676
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,800
Here…

677
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:28,760
And here.

678
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,720
And…

679
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,480
Do I really have to tell you…

680
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,560
where I want your touch?

681
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:23,120
You are allowed to cross the line.

682
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,600
If I do…

683
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,080
It's just us here.

684
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,400
It's you, Charan,

685
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,040
and me.

686
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,120
I know.

687
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,360
Just me and you.

688
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,040
Do you still remember
the tale of the Emmalian kiss?

689
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,960
Always.

690
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,800
I humbly ask for your permission…

691
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:09,440
♫The world's a fairy tale,♫

692
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:14,560
♫In your arms tonight♫

693
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:18,400
♫I wish to stop this time,♫

694
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:23,960
♫And call you my endless light♫

695
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:31,440
♫Ooh, dancing in the moonlight with you,♫

696
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:37,480
♫Under the stars, just us two♫

697
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:45,440
♫With every beat, my heart's complete♫

698
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,520
♫You…♫

699
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:51,680
♫You made my dream come true♫

700
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:58,000
♫Now and forever with you,♫

701
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,480
♫Hold me so tight,♫

702
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:08,160
♫All through the night♫

703
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:55,880
♫Ooh, dancing in the moonlight with you,♫

704
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:02,040
♫Under the stars, just us two♫

705
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,440
♫Hold me so tight,♫

706
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,880
♫All through the night♫

707
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,640
Breathe.

708
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,960
♫Hold me so tight,♫

709
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:32,440
♫All through the night♫

710
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,480
Ran.

711
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:00,760
What?

712
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,000
Still find it strange?

713
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,160
It feels nice,
just being together like this.

714
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,240
Then, let's be together for eternity.

715
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:09,320
You don't need to worry
about anything now

716
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:10,920
because I'll be here for you.

717
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,840
Prince Calvin just told me

718
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,560
he's visiting Meenanagarin.

719
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,840
Would you like to join my trip?

720
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,520
This is June, my sister.

721
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,320
Now I understand
why you're part of the protesters.

722
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:40,160
♫The only love I've longed for,♫

723
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:44,400
♫Just the word "love" from you,
and that's all♫

724
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,880
♫Let me hear it, I won't ask for more♫

725
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,200
♫I need your love♫

726
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:53,320
♫The only one I adore,♫

727
01:24:54,440 --> 01:25:01,440
♫My heart's been waiting
just for you, my all♫

728
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:09,920
♫Oh, I need your love♫
