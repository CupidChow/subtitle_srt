1
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,360
My friend has invited me
to visit his hometown in Meenanagarin.

2
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,280
I am truly honored
by your visit to Meenanagarin.

3
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,840
Wanna go see him for a bit?

4
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,080
Are you okay?

5
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,760
If we don't fight for change,
how many more

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,680
will end up like my dad and my sister?

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,560
But I want to stand
with the people.

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,640
Let us sing with all our voices,

9
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,520
so those in power hear us loud.

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,800
The Assavadevathins

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,720
are knowingly taking innocent lives.

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,360
You're harming the people!

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,520
Don't hurt them!

14
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,440
<i>The Assavadevathins</i>
<i>are knowingly taking innocent lives.</i>

15
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,840
<i>That mine costs lives.</i>

16
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,520
<i>- The king's killing people!</i>
<i>- Stop!</i>

17
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,880
Don't hurt them.

18
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,320
Don't hurt them!

19
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,320
- Don't be violent!
- You're harming us!

20
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,640
- Come on.
- Let go of me!

21
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Khanin…

22
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,960
Khanin!

23
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,920
Are you alright?

24
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm truly sorry for what happened today.

25
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,360
It must have been quite a shock for you.

26
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,040
But I've already sent someone to deal with
the one who caused the disturbance.

27
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
"Deal with"?

28
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,640
Yes.

29
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,360
Have him imprisoned for life

30
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,960
for harming Prince Khanin.

31
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,000
He didn't harm me, Uncle.

32
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,480
We were the ones who went too far.

33
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,920
He nearly lost his life from suffocation.

34
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,120
All I wish to know is…

35
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,200
whether the people are telling the truth.

36
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,440
Are the Assavadevathins
really knowingly taking innocent lives?

37
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,800
I don't think so.

38
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,360
It was my own negligence.

39
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,280
You and the Assavadevathins
bear no blame.

40
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,720
Let's not speak of this any further.

41
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,640
Here,

42
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,520
I've prepared a gift for you.

43
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,040
I hope you'll like it.

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Go on, open it.

45
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,760
A black pearl,

46
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,760
known to shield its owner

47
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,040
and grant them great strength.

48
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,320
This is our local dessert.

49
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,560
I had it prepared just for you.

50
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,840
Please, have a taste.

51
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,320
It tastes wonderful, Uncle.

52
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,560
But…

53
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,720
I'm feeling a little weary.

54
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,400
I'd like to excuse myself
and get some rest.

55
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,000
I understand.

56
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
Go ahead and get some rest.

57
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,920
<i>This incident</i>

58
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
has significantly impacted
the Assavadevathins, Wasin.

59
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,400
<i>I understand, Your Majesty.</i>

60
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,080
<i>The perpetrator has now been dealt with,</i>

61
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,480
<i>and we've suppressed the news,</i>

62
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,360
<i>except on social media,</i>
<i>which remains outside our control.</i>

63
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,240
<i>How is my grandson doing?</i>

64
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,040
He seemed a little shaken.

65
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,360
He has gone to rest now, Your Majesty.

66
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,080
<i>Take good care of him.</i>
<i>Make sure nothing else happens.</i>

67
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Otherwise, I may have to revisit
the funding for your research.

68
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,560
I expect you to honor your word.

69
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,160
<i>I accept your order</i>
<i>with utmost respect, Your Majesty.</i>

70
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
How?

71
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,760
Am I supposed to just sit in the palace,

72
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,840
dressing up,

73
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,760
fencing, and shooting arrows,

74
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,080
while people out there
are in pain, even dying?

75
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,960
That's not how it is, Nin.

76
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,920
Prince Wasin

77
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,720
is already doing what he can.

78
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,320
The ruler's duty

79
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,000
is to ensure peace in the land.

80
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,960
Your duty

81
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,200
is to compete in the Royal Competition.

82
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,480
As for everything else,

83
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,320
you must be more cautious from now on.

84
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,720
Even Prince Wasin seems suspicious.

85
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,120
I should've believed you.

86
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,080
You were right about everything.

87
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,920
Everyone's out for themselves.

88
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,640
It's safest not to trust anyone.

89
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,680
In the battle for power,

90
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,440
you can't really tell

91
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,840
who's on which side.

92
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,760
Trust no one

93
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,240
but yourself, Nin.

94
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,280
Not even me.

95
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,840
Why would you say that?

96
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,680
If I can't even trust you,

97
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,200
then who do I have left?

98
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,960
I said it wrong.

99
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,640
- I meant to say…
- I see now.

100
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,440
If it ever comes down to choosing
between me and your duty,

101
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,840
you won't choose me, will you?

102
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,880
That's not what I meant.

103
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,720
If I failed today

104
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,840
and you ended up getting hurt,

105
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,120
how am I supposed to go on?

106
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,320
How can you trust

107
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
that I'll always keep you safe

108
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,560
when I can't even promise that
to myself?

109
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
You cared.

110
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
Just admit it. You cared about me.

111
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,760
It's not that hard.

112
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,680
I care about you a lot, Nin.

113
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,120
So please,

114
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,280
don't put yourself in danger again,

115
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
okay?

116
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,480
Yeah.

117
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,000
I got it.

118
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,920
I get the whole duty thing, too.

119
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,960
<i>Yet I don't think it's much of a climb</i>

120
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,960
But don't be so cruel to me
like that again, okay?

121
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,360
<i>If our love feels out of sight…</i>

122
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,040
With utmost respect,
Your Royal Highness.

123
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,400
<i>I believe that love conquers all,</i>

124
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,960
<i>Nothing can make it fall</i>

125
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,600
Where are you taking them?

126
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,000
Well…

127
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,120
News about today's incident?

128
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Let me see it.

129
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,880
Chakri,

130
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,360
let me see it.

131
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,880
(Behind your glory, people fall sick!)

132
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,920
(Until the dust is gone,
we'll keep demanding answers!)

133
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,680
(Dust was never solved,
only cover-ups to protect their power!)

134
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,680
You got blamed because of me.

135
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,480
I'm sorry.

136
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,280
You don't need to.

137
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,480
I did what I had to.

138
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,800
I don't think…

139
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,760
you should read any more posts.

140
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,800
I…

141
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,360
Why should I not?

142
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,480
What's really going on here?

143
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,240
(Dust is dangerous! #SayNoToTheMine)

144
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,040
(No more lives should be lost!)

145
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,720
(Will our voices matter?)

146
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,680
(Sympathy for the victims
of the greedy leaders!)

147
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,240
Is what people are saying
about the mine true?

148
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,840
Someone really died
because of the Assavadevathins?

149
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,760
Is silence a yes, Ran?

150
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
I see it now.

151
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,720
I can't even trust

152
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,120
my own family.

153
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,480
Help me dig into this.

154
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,520
I need to know who's behind it.

155
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,880
Get me the details on the person

156
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,160
who tried to harm Prince Khanin, too.

157
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,000
<i>Alright, Mr. Royal Guard.</i>

158
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,160
<i>I'll reach out</i>
<i>if anything comes up.</i>

159
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
<i>Right, I forgot to mention…</i>

160
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
I gotta go now.

161
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,120
I'm very worried.

162
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,880
It's okay.

163
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,480
Everything's gonna be fine.

164
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,160
Thank you, Doctor.

165
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,000
I shall take my leave, Your Majesty.

166
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,560
How are you doing, Grandfather?

167
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,800
I feel so much better now.

168
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,120
Don't worry about me.

169
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,840
What about you?

170
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,120
Are you hurt anywhere?

171
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,880
I'm not harmed, Grandfather.

172
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,960
Thank you for your concern.

173
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,240
It's something
no one ever wanted to happen.

174
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,520
There was no need for you
to take such risks.

175
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,320
It was dangerous.

176
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,320
Don't do anything like that again.

177
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,280
There's something I want to ask you.

178
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,720
What the people were saying
during the protest,

179
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,000
about the Assavadevathins.

180
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,680
Slandering us…

181
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,640
without a shred of evidence?

182
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,640
Why should it be…

183
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,640
of any interest, Khanin?

184
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,520
If there is no evidence,

185
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,080
why would they accuse us, Your Majesty?

186
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,920
This is all political.

187
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,680
Politics is full of twists and turns.

188
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,560
You shouldn't concern yourself with it.

189
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,079
Take care of your own duties first.

190
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,599
If that is your will,

191
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,160
I shall accept it, Grandfather.

192
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,319
Please take your rest.

193
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,079
I shall not disturb you any longer.

194
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,839
Charan, you stay.

195
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,800
Sit down.

196
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,320
This tea's wonderfully fragrant.

197
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,600
It brings back
the fondest memories of the past.

198
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,600
The flavor of Earl Grey
is so rich and strong.

199
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,720
It was the right choice
to have you bring it from the UK.

200
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,240
But even so, there are times
when trivial matters trouble me,

201
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,960
and they seem to…

202
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,720
take away so much of its taste.

203
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,280
I'd like you to look into the source
of these distractions so that…

204
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,760
we may stop the trouble
before it begins.

205
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,640
And as always,

206
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,400
keep this matter confidential.

207
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
No one must know.

208
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,880
Your command is my will, Your Majesty.

209
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,560
Your Royal Highness,

210
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,720
Prince Calvin is now at the palace,
awaiting an audience with you.

211
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,160
He's here?

212
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,040
Please proceed this way.

213
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,960
Okay.

214
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,000
I saw what happened
at the square in Meenanagarin,

215
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,000
and I couldn't help but feel concerned.

216
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,560
Are you alright?

217
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,200
Thank you for your concern,

218
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,440
but I'm unharmed.

219
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,920
It's the people
I'm most concerned about.

220
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,720
Still, I feel bad

221
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,000
that I couldn't be of any help to you.

222
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,840
It wasn't your fault.

223
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,720
You and Jay are friends, right?

224
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,400
He's a Morpheus student, too.

225
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,560
Are you close?

226
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,400
I'm not sure if I could say that.

227
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,640
What's wrong with him?

228
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,320
Nothing.

229
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
It's just that…

230
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,200
I wanted to understand more
about the protests.

231
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,080
I thought you might be close to him,

232
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,400
so he might share something.

233
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,880
There's something
I'm not meant to find out?

234
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,000
Not exactly.

235
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,960
It's just that I feel guilty about him.

236
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,720
Guilty?

237
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,600
I've kept it from him that I'm a prince.

238
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,200
Now I don't know how to bring it up.

239
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,240
There's never been a right moment.

240
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,760
If there's no right moment,

241
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,080
then make one.

242
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,520
You're Prince Calvin.

243
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,040
You've got this.

244
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,080
It wouldn't be right

245
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,920
for someone special
to hear the truth from someone else.

246
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,480
Someone special?

247
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,520
Yeah.

248
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,560
If he wasn't,

249
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,440
you wouldn't be this caught up in it,
would you?

250
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Jay!

251
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,360
Can we talk?

252
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,920
I'm really sorry I didn't show up

253
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
and that I wasn't in touch.

254
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,280
I was…

255
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,040
What?

256
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,480
You were what?

257
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,080
Something urgent came up.

258
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
It was so urgent…

259
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,840
that you didn't even have a moment
to tell me?

260
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,640
(Mother: You should've been
more careful)

261
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,040
(Guys, it's Prince Calvin from Bhujar!)

262
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,360
(Prince Calvin in the flesh.)

263
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,720
(It's really him! He's so gorgeous!)

264
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,000
(Don't do anything reckless again.)

265
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,400
(Your father won't take it well
if he finds out.)

266
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,160
<i>Are you home yet?</i>

267
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,760
I am.

268
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,080
I'm really happy

269
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,360
that I got to spend the day with you.

270
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,880
Right, Jay.

271
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,600
About tomorrow…

272
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,520
<i>Oh, right.</i>

273
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,320
<i>I forgot to send you the location.</i>

274
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,640
<i>Give me one sec.</i>

275
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,480
I mean…

276
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,280
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

277
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
No.

278
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,480
I know I was wrong,

279
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,440
and I'm sorry.

280
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,360
But my feelings for you are really deep.

281
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,520
If I want to clear things up between us,

282
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,320
would you mind?

283
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,560
Do you realize

284
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,320
why I'm this mad?

285
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,760
I didn't keep my word.

286
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,840
You just disappeared.

287
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,640
I was clueless.

288
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,760
How did you expect me to react?

289
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,760
I had no clue what was happening.

290
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,520
Don't you think…

291
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,360
I'd be concerned about you?

292
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,440
I'm sorry that I disappeared

293
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,320
and didn't tell you what happened.

294
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,560
I won't make you feel that way again.

295
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,080
I promise.

296
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,240
Keep your word.

297
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,040
If you win against me,

298
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,760
I've got a prize for you tonight.

299
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,040
You must not challenge me like that,
Your Royal Highness.

300
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,560
For I am confident

301
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,120
that I will be the one to win.

302
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
Your Royal Highness!

303
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Your Royal Highness! This way.

304
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,040
Are you harmed?

305
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,960
I'm fine.

306
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,800
Let's leave right now.

307
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,720
Hurry!

308
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,840
Please rise.

309
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,600
Please forgive us

310
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,640
for arriving late, Your Royal Highness.

311
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,960
Are you hurt?

312
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,320
Go find him.

313
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,640
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

314
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,920
I'm sorry.

315
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,080
You had to go through pain
because of me again.

316
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,720
I'm alright, Your Royal Highness.

317
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,280
It's better that it was me.

318
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,800
If something happened to you,

319
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,800
I would never forgive myself.

320
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,560
It's not your fault.

321
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,520
I won't let this slide.

322
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,200
Whoever dares to harm me and my people

323
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,080
must face consequences.

324
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,920
Let go!

325
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,960
Let go of me!

326
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Now!

327
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,160
Your Royal Highness,
please spare me.

328
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,680
Who put you up to this?

329
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,360
I was…

330
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,600
acting under orders
from His Majesty the King

331
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,040
to observe you from a distance.

332
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,960
How could I ever trust you?

333
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,880
<i>Are you hurt anywhere?</i>

334
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,360
I was fortunate

335
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
to come out unharmed,

336
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,440
but my companion,

337
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,080
Paytai, was injured.

338
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,680
<i>It's good that you're safe.</i>

339
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,400
Who was bold enough to try to hurt you?

340
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,560
<i>I suspect there are only two clans</i>

341
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,760
<i>that would take delight</i>
<i>in my misfortune,</i>

342
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,680
either the Davichmethas…

343
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,920
or the Assavadevathins.

344
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,560
<i>My guards managed to capture a man,</i>

345
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,920
<i>and he claimed he was sent by the King.</i>

346
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,840
That old man's sick right now.

347
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,800
I'll have to pay him a visit.

348
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
Talk to you later.

349
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,080
Siwakorn,

350
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,960
have the convoy ready
within ten minutes.

351
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,280
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

352
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,600
Father,

353
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,960
may I seek your counsel?

354
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,880
Um…

355
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,760
Yes!

356
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,160
I believe it would be wise

357
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,520
to start clear negotiations
with the miners

358
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,040
and the protesters.

359
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,120
Your move. Do you wish to go on?

360
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,520
Father…

361
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Tharin,

362
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,600
you're planning to do something
that's not needed.

363
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,440
If we refuse to listen,

364
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,800
how will we ever know

365
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,400
what they truly want?

366
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,840
Emmaly still needs a lot of income
from the mine.

367
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,680
If you don't want to see
it face an economic crisis,

368
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,760
do as I say.

369
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,520
Will you keep playing or not?

370
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,160
If not,

371
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,160
why bother staying around?

372
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,520
You shouldn't have gone
to the trouble of coming here.

373
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,800
I've already recovered.

374
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,480
No trouble at all.

375
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,160
But are you sure
you've truly recovered, Your Majesty?

376
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,600
It's only natural for someone my age.

377
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,520
Nothing to be concerned about.

378
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,680
What about you?

379
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,880
I heard you were hurt. Is that true?

380
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm only lightly injured, Your Majesty.

381
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,240
I've met the person you sent
to watch over me.

382
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

383
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,800
That puts my mind at ease.

384
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,920
Sadly, I haven't managed
to catch the culprit yet.

385
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,960
Leave that matter to me.

386
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,560
I'll have someone look into it.

387
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

388
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,240
But do you have any idea

389
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,000
who might be behind this?

390
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,320
Do you intend any deeper meaning
in your question?

391
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
There was nothing implied, Your Majesty.

392
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,800
I only asked out of curiosity.

393
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,880
Come in.

394
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,440
We have not identified the criminal yet,
Your Royal Highness.

395
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,120
I'm afraid…

396
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,880
it may take a little longer.

397
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,160
By that time,
he must've been silenced for good.

398
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
Father,

399
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,600
we are fully aware

400
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,080
that it's the doing of…

401
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,640
the Assavadevathins.

402
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,400
Why can't we do anything?

403
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,280
Do we have to just wait and do nothing?

404
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,800
You think you can take them down

405
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,480
without any proof?

406
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,640
Don't forget who's behind them.

407
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,120
And from what we've talked
to that old man,

408
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,160
he neither admitted nor denied.

409
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,200
He probably thinks
he's got all the power

410
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,720
to do whatever he wants.

411
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,720
(Assavadevathin
profits greatly from mining)

412
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,320
Are you going to bed now?

413
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,920
Yeah,

414
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,080
I'm about to sleep.

415
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,360
(Heir to the Assavadevathins
Fifth Royal Competition declared)

416
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,360
(It's true. Workers are dying.)

417
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,040
(People ended up dying
because of selfish people in power.)

418
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,840
You said you were going to bed.

419
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,120
What are you reading,
Your Royal Highness?

420
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,639
About the mine.

421
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,880
(Girl Caught Stealing Gold from Mine
to Pay for Mother's Cancer Treatment)

422
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,159
<i>From those present at the scene,</i>
<i>it was reported that</i>

423
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:39,280
<i>the girl needed money</i>
<i>for her mother's cancer treatment.</i>

424
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,080
<i>It was also said that</i>

425
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,199
<i>her mother's illness was affected</i>
<i>by her work at the mine.</i>

426
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,159
<i>The conclusion of this matter</i>

427
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,840
<i>awaits further official clarification.</i>

428
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,400
<i>- Stop!</i>
<i>- You're too young to do this.</i>

429
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,120
<i>- Let me go!</i>
<i>- What do you want?</i>

430
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,760
<i>- Don't move!</i>
<i>- Look at me.</i>

431
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,680
<i>What?</i>

432
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,240
<i>- Why stealing?</i>
<i>- Show your face!</i>

433
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,160
<i>It's for my mom's treatment. I'm sorry.</i>

434
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,520
<i>Please let me go.</i>

435
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,280
Some of the protesters

436
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,040
have indeed worked
at the Assavadevathin mine.

437
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,520
The movement has grown larger

438
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,800
with workers and students
joining from all cities.

439
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,600
Things like this
spread quickly like wildfire.

440
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,120
As I see it,

441
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,440
the freedom of the people
cannot be controlled.

442
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,360
The tighter the control,

443
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,680
the more the situation deteriorates,
Your Majesty.

444
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,960
Your Royal Highness…

445
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,640
Please don't do this.

446
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,120
Your Royal Highness…

447
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,840
- Please…
- Sorry to bother your personal time.

448
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,640
Is it something urgent enough
to make you barge in like this?

449
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,440
I have something
to request, Grandfather.

450
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,720
I wish to study
the mining operations in Assavadevathin.

451
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,080
Well…

452
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,160
Maybe this can wait

453
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,920
until the Royal Competition ends.

454
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,680
Based on the recent protest,

455
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,560
I think we need to improve
the operations at the mine.

456
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,200
Those accusations are just rumors.

457
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,480
I've observed the mine for years,

458
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,680
and it has been properly run throughout.

459
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,680
Tharin himself cares for the workers
as he ought to.

460
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,560
Still, I think there could be

461
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,440
a grain of truth in those rumors.

462
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You're one of us, Khanin.

463
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,600
And still, you don't place your trust
in your own father, your own family?

464
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,560
I only wish to uncover the truth.

465
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,520
There is nothing to uncover.

466
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,280
- When people accuse us…
- Stop it.

467
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,280
and we don't try to clear our name,

468
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,200
- Khanin!
- that just makes it seem like…

469
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,840
their words are right, doesn't it?

470
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
Khanin!

471
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,320
Get out!

472
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,160
Does the truth trouble you that much?

473
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,480
Leave.

474
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,080
I don't want you in my sight.

475
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,920
Go!

476
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,600
Just go!

477
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,800
Your Royal Highness…

478
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,680
I came here to calm down by myself.

479
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,960
If you came to blame me,

480
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,200
can we leave it for later?

481
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,280
You knew full well

482
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,400
that you shouldn't have enraged
His Majesty,

483
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,720
and yet you did it anyway.

484
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,960
May I ask why, Your Royal Highness?

485
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
I can't stay silent and do nothing.

486
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,560
The mining and weather problems

487
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,480
aren't something
you can just fix right away.

488
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,440
Stop talking like Grandfather.

489
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,040
I don't even know

490
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
what the truth is.

491
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,200
If you want to find out,

492
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,880
I'll make sure to get the answer.

493
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,920
Yeah.

494
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,640
Stop.

495
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,720
Who do you work for?

496
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,600
Speak.

497
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,680
Do it.

498
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,680
Stop.

499
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,160
You think you have any say in this?

500
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
Kill him.

501
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,720
His Majesty the King!

502
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,720
It was the command

503
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,240
from the King.

504
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,320
Who are you mad at, my dear?

505
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,240
I had a little argument
with Grandfather.

506
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,760
He hasn't been well for long.

507
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,280
Avoid any disagreement with him, dear.

508
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,640
Okay?

509
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,480
Yes, Father.

510
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,720
I'm here to let you know

511
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,320
that I'm returning to Assavadevathin

512
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,680
with a significant event coming up soon.

513
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,520
Event?

514
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,560
What event, Father?

515
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,320
Charan,

516
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,040
you haven't told him yet?

517
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,320
Forgive me.

518
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,240
Maybe my teaching was insufficient,

519
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,120
so His Royal Highness cannot recall.

520
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,320
It's the lantern procession
of our homeland,

521
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,680
which is a long-standing tradition.

522
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,800
Would you be interested
in going to see it?

523
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,000
I would, Father.

524
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,840
But…

525
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,000
Can I go?

526
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,200
Your shoulder motion has improved.

527
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
Yeah,

528
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,440
but I have to get used to it, too.

529
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,720
Great.

530
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,840
With frequent practice,
your body will get used to it.

531
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,560
Ran,

532
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,000
have you been to
a lantern procession before?

533
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,160
I have

534
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,320
when I was young.

535
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,200
After my mother passed,

536
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,360
I haven't returned
to Assavadevathin at all.

537
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,960
In that case,

538
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,600
let's make new memories there together.

539
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,400
I promise

540
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,200
to practice hard while we're there.

541
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,720
Actually, no.

542
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,120
I swear.

543
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,240
Do you really think you can escape
the power of His Majesty the King,

544
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,320
Mr. Thatdanai?

545
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,360
Follow us.

546
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,040
Where are you going, buddies?

547
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,400
Better think twice
before going that way.

548
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:19,880
Give me that.

549
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,440
Look into that camera.

550
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,080
Wanna go viral?

551
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,360
Alright,

552
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,080
I'll take him from here.

553
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,000
Let's go.

554
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,840
Right here.

555
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,480
Alright, you're safe.

556
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,560
Who are you?

557
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,560
Why did you save me?

558
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,840
I'm Vedish,

559
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,880
a friend of Charan.

560
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,520
What did you mean

561
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,240
by saying Charan sent you

562
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,320
to find me?

563
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,280
Is there a problem?

564
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,800
Nothing, just…

565
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,520
He asked me to take care of you.

566
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,280
I'm good.

567
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,600
I can take care of myself,
and I've got things to do.

568
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,280
You were about to die.

569
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,280
If I didn't step in,
those soldiers would've taken you away.

570
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,080
They are no threat to me.

571
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,360
Don't be too confident.

572
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,680
If you get caught,

573
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,360
you're as good as gone.

574
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,160
So please come with me.

575
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,680
If nothing else,

576
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,360
do it for Prince Khanin.

577
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,920
Is something wrong?

578
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,800
Stop the cover-ups.
Face the air pollution crisis!

579
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,720
Yeah!

580
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,720
You have all that power
but still can't fix this. Just leave!

581
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,560
<i>Think it'll end just by complying?</i>

582
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,200
Real change takes time.

583
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,760
It takes courage and determination.

584
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,480
Is it true that the mine's pollution
is making miners ill?

585
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,760
I'm tired.

586
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,920
It's very late now.

587
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,360
Why are you here?

588
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,440
I would like you
to paint a portrait of me.

589
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,920
<i>The only love I've longed for,</i>

590
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,160
<i>Just the word "love" from you,</i>
<i>and that's all</i>

591
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,640
<i>Let me hear it, I won't ask for more</i>

592
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,960
<i>I need your love</i>

593
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,080
<i>The only one I adore,</i>

594
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:47,200
<i>My heart's been loving</i>
<i>only you, my all</i>

595
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:55,680
<i>Oh, I need your love</i>
