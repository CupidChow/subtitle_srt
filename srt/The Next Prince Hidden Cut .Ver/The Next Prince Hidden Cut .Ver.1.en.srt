1
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,720
Centuries ago,

2
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,000
the lands of Southeast Asia
brimmed with life and riches.

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,560
Meenanakarin,

4
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,880
Davichmetha,

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,480
Assavadevathin

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,160
and Phuchongphisut

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,600
coexisted in peace for generations

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,200
until an enemy came unbidden,

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,280
and all four kingdoms were attacked.

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,840
The king of Meenanakarin called for unity,
so the four kingdoms became one:

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,400
the nation of Emmaly.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,560
Years passed,

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,000
the dynasties took turns on the throne,

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:10,000
and now it belongs to King Thipokbowon
of the Assavadevathins.

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,120
For when we stand united,

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
we shall never fall.

17
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,560
Mr. Charan.

18
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,920
His Majesty has issued
a royal command for you

19
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,760
to appear before him
within the next half hour.

20
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,520
Understood.

21
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,960
Stop it, Charan.

22
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,760
Your skill remains as sharp as ever.

23
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,760
This is the finest combat instructor
who trains our royal guards.

24
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,280
His role remains classified.

25
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,960
You must be quite curious
why I tested you, aren't you?

26
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,240
I'm certain you have
your own justifications, Your Majesty.

27
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,760
The cicadas are shedding their skin.

28
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,360
Summer must be coming soon.

29
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,680
Wouldn't it be great
if someone who understands me

30
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,640
could join me for a cup of tea?

31
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,560
One more thing,
I've mentioned this many times.

32
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,560
When it's just the two of us,
there's no need for formality.

33
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,960
You're still the grandson I've raised
since you were little.

34
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,240
Now rise.

35
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,960
My apologies, Your Majesty.

36
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,960
Have a seat.

37
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,600
Sit down.

38
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,520
You're the only grandson

39
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,560
I can talk to freely.

40
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,760
How are you doing?

41
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
I have withered away
as the days went by,

42
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,880
but I feel lonely.

43
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
That's why I asked you to join me.

44
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,160
What kind of tea would you like to drink?

45
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,400
Chamomile or oolong?

46
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,200
Both can no longer satisfy me

47
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
because I know there's something better.

48
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,560
You should try Earl Grey,

49
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,480
the tea imported from the UK.

50
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,440
The flavor lingers…

51
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,480
reminiscent of days long gone.

52
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,440
But now, I am too old to fetch it myself,

53
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,560
and I cannot trust anyone enough
to ask for such a favor.

54
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,360
If you trust me,

55
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,360
I will bring it to you.

56
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,200
Then you should hurry.

57
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,920
You're the only one
I can place my trust in.

58
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,560
Go to Thatdanai, an old friend of mine.

59
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,640
He will have
the finest tea prepared for you.

60
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,040
If you wait any longer,
it may be too late.

61
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,000
Your command is my will, Your Majesty.

62
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,960
En garde.
(On guard)

63
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,400

You got this.

Allez.
(Go)

74
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,800

One-minute break.

En garde.
(On guard)

83
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,440
Prêts?
(Ready?)

84
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,440

- Yes.
- Good.

113
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,840
Nice shot.

114
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,080
Let's go!

115
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,240
The last one was great.

116
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,840
Yes.

117
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,320
- Good.
- Yes, come on. Yay.

118
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,560
Congratulations to
the winner of Group A, Kenneth.

119
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,720
I've heard that
Kenneth is of Emmaly descent,

120
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,200
one of the best fencing countries
in the world.

121
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,360
He's also the best
in his university's fencing club.

122
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,880
It's not surprising.

123
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,160
Please give
Kenneth support in the Finals.

124
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,440
Kenneth, Kenneth, Kenneth.

125
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,640
Shit.

126
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,280
I'm just messing around, mate.

127
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,760
By the way, congratulations.

128
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,680
Hey,

129
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,120
why are you following me?

130
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,160
Are you a scout?

131
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,440
What?

132
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,120
You can't speak?

133
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,640
What the hell do you want?

134
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,280
Why is it?

135
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,960
Don't know what I'm saying, huh?

136
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,680
I guess you're not a scout, then.

137
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,440
I see.

138
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,800
Are you trying to flirt with me?

139
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,960
Gosh, man.

140
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,480
Has no one told you that
following someone you like

141
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,800
is kind of creepy?

142
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,520
And I have no interest in you.

143
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,200
What a waste of time.

144
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,520
My apologies.

145
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,160
Don't jump to conclusions.

146
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,280
Wait…

147
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,480
- You speak…
- And has no one here told you

148
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,040
that every time you lunge,
your shoulder twitches first?

149
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,920
That little habit of yours

150
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,720
might be the reason you lose one day.

151
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,960
Is this really
all the top fencers of the club

152
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,440
have got?

153
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,280
You still have lots more to work on.

154
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,880
Who the hell are you?

155
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,040
- If you think you know me so well…
- It's not just your shoulder.

156
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,520
You're also too hasty.

157
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,680
I say this with the best intentions.

158
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,600
If you stay this way,

159
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,360
victory will never be yours.

160
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,760
Alright.

161
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
Here you are.

162
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,240
Have a seat.

163
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,640
You know what? Today…

164
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,720
I've made it to the Finals.

165
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,680
Really?

166
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
Congratulations.

167
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,480
Don't get ahead of yourself just yet.

168
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,400
- For the Emmalians…
- For the Emmalians,

169
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,640
I am not yet strong enough
to be a professional fencer.

170
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,920
Emmaly this, Emmaly that.

171
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,880
This food is Emmalian.

172
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,120
The house looks like
it came straight out of Emmaly.

173
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
Why didn't you just name me Emmaly, too?

174
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,080
It's good that you know that.

175
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,080
Eat up.

176
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,840
After this,
you'll come to practice with me.

177
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,480
Gosh, Dad.

178
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,760
You won't give me a break, will you?

179
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,360
Khanin…

180
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,120
Yeah, fine.

181
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,960
Nin,

182
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,040
mind your table manners.

183
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,160
I know.

184
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,200
Wasn't gonna use it.

185
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,760
I just took it out.

186
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,480
If you hadn't become a writer,

187
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,160
you would've been a soldier.

188
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,600
Every time you lunge,

189
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,840
your shoulder twitches first.

190
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,760
Is this really
all the top fencers of the club

191
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,800
have got?

192
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,320
What's going on?

193
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,880
You seem distracted today.

194
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,240
Is something wrong?

195
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,160
I…

196
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,680
Nothing, Dad.

197
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,680
Let's give it another try.

198
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,480
Relax, okay?

199
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,200
Stay focused. Breathe.

200
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,120
Start when you're ready.

201
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,600
Take a deep breath.

202
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,120
Right.

203
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,000
That was very good.

204
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,680
I'm proud of you
for recognizing your own weakness

205
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,040
and fixing it on your own.

206
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,040
Am I really better?

207
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,960
Yes.

208
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,880
Your problem is that

209
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,560
you move your shoulder a bit too early
and tense up,

210
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,000
but I can tell
you're trying to change that.

211
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,320
Let's try that again.

212
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,520
Relax.

213
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,920
Take a deep breath. Focus.

214
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,080
Good.

215
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,800
Right.

216
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,880
Great.

217
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,000
Halte.
(Halt)

218
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,920
Yes.

219
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,600
Halte.
(Halt)

220
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,720
Yes.

221
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

222
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,680
Allez.
(Go)

223
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,600
Halte.
(Halt)

224
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,520
En garde.
(On guard)

225
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,800
Prêts?
(Ready?)

226
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,040
Allez.
(Go)

227
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,560
Nice one. Let's go.

228
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,240
Yes, yes, yes.

229
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,520
Kenneth, you're the first Emmalian
that I've ever faced.

230
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,760
Congratulations.

231
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,080
Thank you for the match.

232
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,600
May I ask you? Who taught you fencing?

233
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,600
It's my dad.

234
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,120
Surprise!

235
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,680
You?

236
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,560
Why are you here?

237
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,840
- I have…
- Leave that to me.

238
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,120
Nin,

239
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,480
this is Mr. Charan.

240
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,840
He's gonna stay with us for a while.

241
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,200
Mr. Charan?

242
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,480
He's the grandson of someone I respect.

243
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,720
I don't get it.

244
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,080
You told him to leave that to you.
What did you mean by that?

245
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,080
Why does he have to stay here with us?

246
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Make sure to be a good host, Khanin.

247
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,480
Ugh, running out again…

248
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,800
Where do you think you're going?

249
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,200
Why are you down here?

250
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,720
Can't I?

251
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,440
Fine,

252
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,360
just do whatever you want.

253
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,800
I'm just not used to

254
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,920
having a stranger in my house.

255
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Why do you have to be here?

256
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
You can ask your dad.

257
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,080
I'm asking you.

258
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,080
Don't you have a place to stay?

259
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,000
I do,

260
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,400
but there's a reason I have to be here.

261
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,280
Wait,

262
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,280
a reason to be here?

263
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,920
What is it?

264
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,480
Your dad knows everything
you wish to know.

265
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,080
Try asking him.

266
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,880
Dad.

267
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,800
Yes?

268
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,400
Look,

269
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
I won.

270
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,480
Great job.

271
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,680
Thanks, Dad.

272
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,600
I was gonna show it to you yesterday,

273
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,000
but something happened.

274
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,000
Give me a moment.

275
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,920
Here.

276
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,240
Do you need to cook for him, too?

277
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,280
Nin…

278
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,560
I'll go practice, then.

279
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,040
Not in the mood to see someone.

280
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,480
Nin…

281
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,360
I'll go eat with Paul at the club.

282
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,320
See you.

283
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,680
- Kenneth.
- Shit.

284
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,440
- I got you.
- Oh, my God, Paul.

285
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,880
What's going on, mate?

286
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,400
You've been so jumpy lately.
Are you okay?

287
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,280
Honestly,

288
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,480
lately, I feel like I've been followed.

289
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
All the time.

290
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,000
Come on, you're being paranoid.

291
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,280
I mean,

292
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,000
there's no one here.
Just literally you and me.

293
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,200
Wait,

294
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,800
don't you tell me that

295
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,160
this is the reason
you didn't answer the phone last night?

296
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,400
Kenneth,

297
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,600
we were waiting for you,

298
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,600
to party with you.

299
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,200
I was exhausted.

300
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,280
I nodded off.

301
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,560
It's okay.

302
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,160
Today, we have a party
at Samantha's place.

303
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,640
You have to come, please.

304
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,800
I've got you two choices: yes or yes.

305
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,200
Please.

306
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,680
Yeah.

307
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,240
- So we have to go.
- At least I won't get to see Charan.

308
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,200
Come on.

309
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,160
Uh…

310
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,840
Who are you,

311
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,000
sir?

312
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,280
I'm Kenneth's friend.

313
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,800
Friend?

314
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,280
Nice to meet you.

315
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,960
Hi.

316
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,640
I just heard that
your friend invited you to a party.

317
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,600
- It's none of your business.
- I'm coming with you.

318
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,360
Don't be ridiculous.

319
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,680
Who are you to come?

320
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,600
I heard you're having a party,
celebrating Kenneth's win, right?

321
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
Oh, yeah.

322
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
Can I come?

323
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,800
Well…

324
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,320
Yeah, my man.

325
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
You know what? The more, the merrier.

326
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,320
I think.

327
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,600
So, what's your name, sir?

328
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,800
Charan.

329
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,280
Charang? Charang.

330
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,160
Right, let's join us.

331
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,320
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

332
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,240
Why not?

333
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,480
Come on, boy.

334
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,080
That's a great idea. You like it,

335
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,000
don't you?

336
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,240
No?

337
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,120
Jump, jump!

338
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,000
Hi, guys.

339
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,600
My cousin brought
Tao Kae Noi seaweed snacks

340
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,400
from Thailand for you all.

341
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,880
So enjoy.

342
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,520
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

343
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,640
Are you having fun?

344
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,600
- It's okay.
- Good.

345
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,320
Cheers…

346
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,600
- to the winner.
- The winner.

347
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,000
- Hi.
- Hey.

348
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,880
This is for you.

349
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,240
Thanks.

350
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,200
Are you guys enjoying?

351
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,320
How is it going?

352
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,720
- It's going great.
- Good?

353
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,080
You know, I'm a bit tipsy now.

354
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,960
Hi.

355
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,120
Oh, hey.

356
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,640
So, you said

357
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,400
you were a friend of Kenneth,
am I right?

358
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,520
You can say that.

359
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,800
Okay.

360
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,480
You never told me
you had a hot friend, Kenneth.

361
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,680
He's your type.

362
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,120
Quit staring at me.

363
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,040
You want this?

364
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,640
It's good, though.

365
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,960
Try it.

366
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,120
Guys, cheers.

367
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,120
Cheers.

368
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,160
- Cheers.
- Come on, cheers.

369
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,560
- Cheers.
- Yeah, drink.

370
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,240
Man, you're such a heavyweight.
You're drinking a lot.

371
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,080
No. No, I'm not.

372
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,920
I just know when to stop.

373
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,920
Okay.

374
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
He's good, though.

375
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,680
So you're friendly now, huh?

376
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,040
I've never been unfriendly.

377
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,320
Come on, guys.
What are you guys talking about?

378
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,000
Hey, hey, hey.

379
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,000
- Hey, boy.
- Hey.

380
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,200
Should we go inside?

381
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,920
Exactly, that's a great idea.

382
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,160
Let's get inside.

383
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,920
- That's a perfect idea, you know.
- Yeah.

384
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Give it back if you won't eat it.

385
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,920
Let's play a game.

386
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,840
A game?

387
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,320
Yeah, what game should we play?

388
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,880
You wanna play anything? Any idea?

389
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,360
I think we should play…

390
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,680
The Pocky Game.

391
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,160
The Pocky Game? That's a great idea.

392
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,080
Come on, man.

393
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,680
Play with us, Kenneth, my boy.

394
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,960
No, I'm not playing that.

395
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,880
- Come on.
- Come on, man.

396
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,000
We're here to celebrate your win.

397
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,480
So, you must play.
There's no choice for you.

398
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,560
And Charang…

399
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,800
Join us, too. Come on.

400
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,720
No.

401
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,480
Come on, man. Don't be mean to him.

402
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,920
He's our new friend.

403
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,920
Yeah, yeah. Let's spin it for a pair.

404
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yeah, you go first.

405
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,320
- Come on.
- Thank you.

406
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,040
Alright, let's go.

407
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,320
No… No, come on, man.

408
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,560
Why?

409
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,000
Don't look at me like that.

410
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,960
I did not wanna pair up with you.

411
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,600
Do you think I wanna do this? Come on.

412
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,280
Why it has to be you?

413
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,440
Your turn. You gotta do this.

414
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,480
- Come on.
- Come on, Kenneth.

415
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,560
Oh…

416
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,360
That's a good one.

417
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,040
Wow, that's crazy.

418
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,880
Alright. Okay, I'll be your referee.

419
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,120
So, the rule is very simple.

420
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,360
You make your pocky
as short as possible,

421
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,960
and the pair
with the shortest piece wins.

422
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,240
And the losers must drink.

423
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,360
Right?

424
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,640
I have no plans to lose.

425
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,800
If you're afraid, just leave.

426
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,920
Why do I have to?

427
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,480
When we share the exact same goal.

428
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,640
I'm ready.

429
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,520
I wish you were.

430
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,200
- Alright, let's do it.
- Let's do it.

431
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,120
Ready?

432
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,280
- It's not hard.
- Okay.

433
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,920
Three,

434
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,159
two,

435
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,760
one.

436
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,120
Go!

437
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,320
Go, go, go. Yes.

438
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,040
Yes, closer.

439
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,960
Paul,

440
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,800
- Yes, yes. Closer.
- go, go.

441
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,400
- You got it.
- Closer.

442
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:24,480
- Go, go.
- Closer. Closer, yeah.

443
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,239
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, closer.

444
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,040
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

445
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,719
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yep.

446
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,800
Who's gonna win?

447
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,920
Come on, man.

448
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,120
Closer, closer.

449
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,560
Who's gonna win?

450
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,719
You're gonna win?

451
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,719
This is good.

452
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,840
This is good.

453
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,159
Gosh, let me see.

454
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,600
Show me.

455
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,040
- This is good.
- Show me the results.

456
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,240
Check it.

457
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,120
- Ours is way shorter, right?
- Yeah.

458
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,960
Show me the piece.

459
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,680
You see? It's obvious.

460
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,400
- No, no.
- The winners are…

461
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,360
Kenneth and Charan.

462
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,040
Did you guys…

463
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,000
- Oh, no.
- No, dude!

464
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,960
Did you guys kiss?

465
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,880
Come on, man. This is not…

466
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,960
Hey,

467
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,240
what's wrong?

468
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,840
Are you still thinking
about the game earlier?

469
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,120
Seriously?

470
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,480
Just 'cause our lips touched?

471
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,480
Do you know…

472
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,520
about the tale of the Emmalian kiss?

473
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,360
No.

474
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,880
A kiss is a kiss. Nothing special.

475
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,080
What? Are you gonna tell me or not?

476
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,560
Okay.

477
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,080
I'm not curious anymore.

478
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,840
I'll get my stuff and leave.

479
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,520
Nin.

480
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,680
You're still up?

481
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,720
Why are you back so late?

482
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,400
I went to a party
with Paul and the others.

483
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,280
I thought I'd already texted you.

484
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,600
I was just worried.
It's good that you're back now.

485
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,120
Get some rest.

486
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,240
Dad,

487
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,400
I wanna know about…

488
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,760
the tale of the Emmalian kiss.

489
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,280
Why do you wanna know about it now?

490
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,960
Well, I'm just curious.

491
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,680
You always tell me
everything about Emmaly.

492
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,240
Why can't you tell me about this one?

493
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,320
It's not that I can't.

494
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,320
I just don't think it's necessary.

495
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,440
Why is it not?

496
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,880
I mean…

497
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,120
I need to know everything
about Emmaly anyway.

498
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,080
The tale of the Emmalian kiss…

499
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,480
Among Emmalians, to kiss someone

500
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,000
is to seal a bond of love,

501
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,360
lasting until death do them part.

502
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,760
Well,

503
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,800
that was just a game.

504
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,080
Let's not take it too seriously.

505
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,200
A game?

506
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,800
What game did you guys play?

507
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,480
Nothing, Dad.

508
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,840
I think I'm going to bed now.

509
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,880
Have a good night.

510
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,200
Hold on.

511
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,360
I'm glad, though,

512
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,160
that you're curious about Emmaly.

513
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,360
Among Emmalians, to kiss someone

514
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,200
is to seal a bond of love,

515
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,680
lasting until death do them part.

516
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,680
It's just a tale.

517
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,040
It's probably nothing.

518
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,600
Just 'cause our lips touched.

519
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,120
Fine, I'll get this straight with him.

520
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,680
Moreover,

521
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,400
I feel like we've been followed.

522
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,360
For that reason, Prince Khanin
must be taken back to Emmaly immediately

523
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,480
for his own safety.

524
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,520
Nin's been followed?

525
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,720
Prince Khanin needs to be informed
of his royal lineage.

526
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,640
I'm well aware of that,

527
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,360
but he's not ready for the competition.

528
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,840
His Majesty's health
continues to decline.

529
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,680
According to the ancient laws of Emmaly,

530
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,920
the Royal Competition is to be held
upon His Majesty's abdication.

531
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,280
Therefore,
His Royal Highness must return

532
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,680
as the only heir
of the Assavadevathin clan.

533
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,360
I don't know how to tell him.

534
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,320
Through all these years,

535
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,760
he has grown as a son to me.

536
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,720
Is this how you're gonna repay
your dad's efforts?

537
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,840
I'm going back to my dad.

538
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,880
You're only going
to get yourself caught.

539
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,480
If you don't trust me,

540
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,240
at least trust your dad.

541
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,120
How can we go to Emmaly from here?

542
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,200
I know a friend in Thailand.

543
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,360
He can help us.

544
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,680
No matter where you go,
they'll catch you either way.

545
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,280
Khanin is on his way back.

546
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,000
By this evening,

547
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,400
I shall declare
to the people that a new King

548
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,560
is to be chosen.
