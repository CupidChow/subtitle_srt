1
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,000
Please keep a close watch
over His Royal Highness.

2
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,200
Yes.

3
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,800
Your Royal Highness!

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,560
Your Royal Highness…
Your Royal Highness!

5
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,160
His Royal Highness is now safe.

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,920
Fortunately, Mr. Charan intervened

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,240
and raised concerns
about the poison in time.

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,400
Thank you, Charan.

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,280
Mr. Charan has been reinstated
as your coach, Your Royal Highness.

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,880
Chakri didn't lie:
you did stay by my side.

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,400
I vow…

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,680
to protect you with my life.

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Ran.

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,120
What?

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Still find it strange?

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,160
Are you still thinking about…

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,280
last night?

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,040
Will you give me a bite of that macaron?

19
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
Please.

20
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,400
Give me a bite.

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,720
I want to be spoiled.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,800
Would you really deny my plea?

23
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,920
Oh…

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Prince Calvin!

25
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,320
I'm here to see Prince Khanin.

26
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,800
Oh…

27
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,360
Please proceed this way,
Your Royal Highness.

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,800
Have you recovered from your illness?

29
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,080
You sure have a sharp eye.

30
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,640
I'm feeling much better now,

31
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
both physically…

32
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,800
and emotionally.

33
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,800
Would you like some macarons?

34
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,160
I shall not disturb you.

35
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,040
Please feel free to carry on.

36
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,960
You just came to ask that?

37
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,680
Knowing that you've recovered,

38
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,520
I feel at ease.

39
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,720
I shall take my leave.

40
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,880
But I don't think he'll tell anyone.

41
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,000
I believe there is nothing
to worry about.

42
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,280
But from now on, let's be more cautious

43
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,520
when we're close, Your Royal Highness.

44
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,640
We don't need to.

45
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
Your Royal Highness…

46
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,480
I want to be this close to you.

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What's wrong with that?

48
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,800
Let's do what I said.

49
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
Come on.

50
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,160
Let's go to my room.

51
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
Please get some rest.

52
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,800
Chakri,

53
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,240
I want something.

54
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,280
Can you order it for me?

55
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,120
You're talking about…

56
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,480
Lolane Intense Care Water Treatment?

57
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,440
We still have them, Your Royal Highness.

58
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
Yeah, that's good.

59
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,160
Make sure we're not running out of them.

60
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,080
But what I was talking about…

61
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,320
is…

62
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,120
What is it, Your Royal Highness?

63
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,480
What's the emblem
of the Davichmetha clan?

64
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,520
Uh…

65
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
A bird.

66
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,440
That's correct.

67
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,840
What kind of bird?

68
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,880
I need to know that, too?

69
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,120
Yes.

70
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,280
Who would know that?

71
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,159
A flamingo, I guess.

72
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,280
Nin, if you fail to be attentive,

73
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,880
you may face unexpected problems
during the Competition.

74
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,200
I just don't know the answer.

75
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,000
If you do, tell me.

76
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,080
How about this?

77
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,360
If I get it wrong one more time,

78
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,080
I'm willing to be punished by you.

79
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,560
Come on, I'll let you punish me.

80
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,200
What kind of punishment do you want?

81
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,520
Well…

82
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,920
One wrong answer,

83
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,600
and I'll give you a kiss.

84
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,720
One kiss for one wrong answer.

85
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,200
Right here.

86
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,200
How exactly is that a punishment?

87
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,320
Of course it is!

88
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,080
It's all on me.

89
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,600
You won't kiss me,

90
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,240
but I'll kiss you.

91
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,000
What?

92
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,840
You were literally…

93
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,880
Anyway,

94
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,000
it's just a kiss.

95
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,320
Let's focus on our lesson.

96
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,800
What is the former capital of Emmaly?

97
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,840
♫When looking at the sky,♫

98
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,480
Higher.

99
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,800
Again.

100
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,720
♫Yet I don't think it's much of a climb♫

101
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,080
You need to be faster.

102
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,960
♫If our love feels out of sight,♫

103
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,760
♫Just hold each other's hand tight♫

104
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,240
♫I believe that love conquers all,♫

105
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,520
♫Nothing can make it fall♫

106
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,320
Faster!

107
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,280
♫As long as you're with me,
right by my side,♫

108
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,320
♫I am not afraid♫

109
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,280
Your Royal Highness!

110
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,080
♫No matter how endless
the sky may seem,♫

111
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,040
♫And how treacherous
this journey might be,♫

112
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,320
♫If I must cross the heavens,
I'll set out willingly,♫

113
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,400
♫As long as you're there,
waiting for me♫

114
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,480
♫We'll build a bridge
of a million stars,♫

115
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,440
♫Let love guide us, no matter how far♫

116
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,680
♫All I ask
is to trust in love and in me,♫

117
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,720
♫Take my hand and you will see,♫

118
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,640
♫Above the sky, we're meant to be♫

119
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,520
You beat me again.

120
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,680
It's no fun at all.

121
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,000
Your shoulder twitches
before lunging again.

122
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,200
I didn't mean to.
What do you want me to do?

123
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,560
You need to stay more focused.

124
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,080
When all you care about is winning,

125
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,480
it tends to backfire.

126
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,520
Let me ask you something.

127
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,440
Does being adopted by His Majesty
mean you have to be a fencing expert?

128
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,800
I was born into the Phithakthewa family,

129
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,400
so I've been learning fencing
since I was little.

130
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Why, though?

131
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,480
My family serves as royal guards,
protecting the Assavadevathins.

132
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,240
But why would they have to do that?

133
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,120
My ancestors swore
an oath to His Majesty

134
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,200
the moment he was crowned king.

135
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,480
So it's inherited?

136
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,720
Even if I hadn't said anything
to Grandfather,

137
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,720
you still would've become my guard.

138
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,040
Whether I become a royal guard or not

139
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,360
is solely up to His Majesty.

140
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,000
Do you protect me this well

141
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,840
just because of some oath
your ancestors made?

142
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,000
If it's my duty,

143
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,800
I need to do it
to the best of my ability.

144
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,000
How about…

145
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,880
this thing?

146
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,320
About that,

147
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,120
I'm sure you can tell
from everything I've done.

148
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,480
A reward for being so sweet.

149
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,360
It's been such a long day.

150
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,960
I don't wanna fence anymore.

151
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,720
Let's do something else.

152
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
How about we go have some fun?

153
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,360
Wanna touch him?

154
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,680
Is this how we're gonna have fun?

155
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,600
It sure will be fun.

156
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Your turn.

157
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,120
Don't worry.

158
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,360
Dyrane never harms anyone.

159
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,560
Dyrane?

160
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,520
That's his name.

161
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,240
Come on, touch him.

162
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Let's get to know each other,
so you'll feel more comfortable.

163
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,720
You and him seem so close.

164
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,760
I've trained him myself.

165
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,600
It's only natural we're close.

166
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,760
Seriously, being close to a horse?

167
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,360
Have you introduced yourself to him?

168
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,640
What?

169
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,960
I need to do that with a horse?

170
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,520
Yeah, so you'll get closer quickly.

171
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Fine, here we go.

172
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,840
Dyrane…

173
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,720
I'm Nin,

174
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
Khanin.

175
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,960
Please don't kick me, okay?

176
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,840
I want to be friends.

177
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,960
Let's be friends, alright?

178
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Is this a joke?

179
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,480
It was your plan, wasn't it?

180
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,440
That's for tricking me.

181
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,360
I won't do it again.

182
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,520
Come here.

183
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,000
Hold the saddle right here firmly.

184
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,079
Put your left foot in the stirrup

185
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,200
and push yourself up.

186
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,680
Go on, try it.

187
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,920
Here, hold this.

188
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
Don't tense up.

189
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,920
I'm not.

190
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,720
Let me know if it scares you.

191
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,840
It won't as long as you're here.

192
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,560
Ran…

193
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,960
Should we call it a day? We might fall.

194
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,320
He's not moving.

195
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
We'll never fall.

196
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You should've told me you wanted a hug.

197
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,800
You should've done it if you knew.

198
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,960
It feels nice,
just being together like this.

199
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,880
Then, let's be together for eternity.

200
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,560
We've got tough training ahead.

201
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,760
I don't want you to worry too much.

202
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,800
I will be fine

203
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,360
as long as you're with me.

204
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,360
I've always been with you.

205
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,240
If there's anything
I can do for you, I will.

206
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
And I'll do my best
to always be there for you.

207
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,280
It's gonna be okay.

208
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
I'm right here.

209
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,840
I had Chakri order it a while ago,

210
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,320
but I couldn't find the right moment
to give it to you.

211
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,240
Wait…

212
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,400
You should close your eyes.

213
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,800
Wear these when it rains,

214
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,360
so nothing will scare you now.

215
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,240
I just want to help you
through tough times,

216
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,280
the way you helped me survive mine

217
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,520
when I had no one but you.

218
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,720
Thank you.

219
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,000
You don't have to worry
about anything now.

220
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
I'll be right here for you, always.

221
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,960
Have you had enough
of Emmaly yet, Prince Calvin?

222
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,080
I would never have, Your Majesty.

223
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,040
I've enjoyed it here,

224
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,920
and with some friends at the university,

225
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,320
it's even more enjoyable.

226
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,600
I'm grateful
you hold our country in high regard.

227
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,120
And how is your father doing?

228
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,880
He is pleased and in excellent health.

229
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,520
Should you need any help,

230
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,360
do not hesitate to ask.

231
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,720
I am glad to help.

232
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,000
I appreciate your kindness.

233
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,360
You did mention your university.

234
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,520
How is everything going?
Is Charan attending to you properly?

235
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,360
He has been looking after me well.

236
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,080
During this long holiday,

237
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,960
my friend has invited me
to visit his hometown in Meenanagarin.

238
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,880
I see.

239
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,240
Oh, you're here.

240
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,600
Join us for a meal.

241
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Let me know if you need anything.

242
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,920
Prince Calvin just told me

243
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,720
he's visiting Meenanagarin.

244
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,400
Did you say Meenanagarin, Grandfather?

245
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,080
You want to come, too?

246
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,000
Yes.

247
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,880
I've just learned
about the dark champagne pearls,

248
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,320
so I want to see them
in their natural setting.

249
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,120
I see.

250
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,840
So,

251
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,520
would you like to join my trip?

252
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,320
May I accompany Prince Calvin
on the trip?

253
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,680
Alright, then.

254
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,640
I'm coming as well.

255
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,520
It's been a long time
since I last visited there.

256
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,720
Alright?

257
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,520
Let me give you a hand.

258
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,800
Why are you not joining me
for a bike ride?

259
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,680
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

260
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,640
But…

261
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,800
today,

262
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,680
my muscles are sore.

263
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,600
A bike ride after a while feels so nice.

264
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
I've had enough of the fencing training.

265
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
But…

266
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,480
if Prince Rachata finds out

267
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,840
that you skipped your training…

268
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,320
My father will never know about it.

269
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,240
Trust me.

270
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,920
Companions

271
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,480
must endure

272
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,080
and take the blame for one another.

273
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,000
Father!

274
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,480
- Prince Ramil…
- Stop it!

275
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,440
Stop!

276
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,720
Just let go of me.

277
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,720
Stop it, Father.

278
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,960
Please, Father.

279
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,960
- Let go!
- Please stop.

280
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,920
Leave me alone!

281
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,960
- Prince Ramil!
- Father!

282
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,720
- Prince Ramil…
- It's not his fault at all!

283
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,680
Prince Ramil, you should stop.

284
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,000
Father, it's not his fault!

285
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,280
- Prince Ramil…
- What the hell?

286
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,640
- Take him out now.
- Your Royal Highness…

287
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,040
- Prince Ramil…
- Please stop!

288
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,320
Prince Ramil!

289
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,840
You should stop.

290
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,320
- Have you gone nuts?
- Please, Prince Ramil.

291
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,160
- Why?
- Guards!

292
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,480
- Paytai!
- Get him out of here.

293
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,160
- Prince Ramil…
- Please stop, Father!

294
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,280
Please!

295
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
Paytai!

296
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,600
Who said you could stop?

297
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
I…

298
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,840
I'd like…

299
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,280
a break, please.

300
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,280
Are you really going to
defy Prince Rachata's command?

301
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Stop!

302
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,240
Stay away from him.

303
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,840
That's a command from me,

304
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,880
Prince Ramil Bhuchongpisut.

305
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,200
Get rid of those.

306
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,400
Your Royal Highness,

307
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,120
please don't get involved.

308
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,720
If Prince Rachata finds out,

309
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,120
I'll surely face
even harsher punishment.

310
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,280
No!

311
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,240
Now!

312
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,960
No more punishment.

313
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,080
I deserved it, Your Royal Highness.

314
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,840
Being your companion comes with a duty

315
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,760
to take the blame for you.

316
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,320
Come with me.

317
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,760
I trust that

318
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,040
you will keep me safe.

319
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,840
What are you going to do to me?

320
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
So…

321
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,080
is everything going well?

322
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,880
Both of you,

323
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,000
place this bag

324
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,560
and those two

325
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,120
at the door.

326
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,320
There's so much stuff.

327
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,000
Come on.

328
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,200
As you're aware,

329
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,440
formal attire is needed

330
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,520
when visiting other cities.

331
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,160
Right,

332
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,000
did you bring
my Lolane Intense Care, too?

333
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,920
Oh…

334
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,400
Yes.

335
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,800
That has been prepared,
Your Royal Highness.

336
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,440
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

337
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,200
Please make haste
to His Majesty's presence immediately.

338
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,080
Wirun!

339
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,000
I wish to talk to His Majesty
about the mining matter.

340
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,960
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

341
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,360
It'd be better to wait
until His Majesty is fully recovered.

342
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,320
I came to discuss a matter with you,

343
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,440
only to find out you had an accident.

344
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,400
Come on,

345
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,680
it's nothing serious.
No need to make a fuss.

346
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,560
Alright.

347
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,720
Are you okay, Grandfather?

348
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,680
I just had a little fall.

349
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,400
Do not be concerned.

350
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,840
He injured his wrist

351
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,920
and has caught a cold,

352
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,440
so the doctors advise

353
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,120
against any travel.

354
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,520
Sickness

355
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,120
is simply a part of nature

356
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,800
and can happen to all.

357
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,040
That said, the trip to Meenanagarin

358
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,920
must proceed as scheduled.

359
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,800
Otherwise, we'd be failing
Prince Calvin's trust.

360
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,600
I could use some rest, too.

361
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,600
Wishing you a speedy recovery,
Your Majesty.

362
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,080
I entrust Khanin and Prince Calvin
to your care.

363
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,960
They are on their way to Meenanagarin.

364
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

365
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,760
I shall take good care of
them and the entourage.

366
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,240
Please recover quickly, Your Majesty.

367
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,760
I am truly honored
by your visit to Meenanagarin.

368
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,320
The honor's all mine,
Your Royal Highness.

369
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,480
The royal attendants
shall take you to rest.

370
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,800
Please feel at ease, Prince Calvin.

371
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,680
Should you need anything, let us know.

372
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,120
I will.

373
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,440
I'm really glad
you came to visit us, Khanin.

374
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,200
I wish to learn about your culture

375
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,840
and see the dark champagne pearls
with my own eyes.

376
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,240
I humbly ask for your permission, Uncle.

377
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,640
You don't need my permission at all.

378
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,080
I'd like to stroll around the city

379
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,160
like an ordinary person.

380
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,480
Could you please treat me like one?

381
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,640
I'm more than happy to do as you ask.

382
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,800
However, as you are the important heir
of the Assavadevathins,

383
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,880
and Prince Calvin
will also be accompanying you,

384
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,360
I can't take any risks.

385
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,120
Therefore,

386
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,640
I will have my guards

387
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,040
discreetly protect you from a distance.

388
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,120
I hope you do not mind.

389
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,560
I don't, Uncle.

390
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,360
If my child were still alive,

391
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,840
he would be about your age.

392
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,960
I'm going to bed now.

393
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,920
Oh…

394
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,280
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

395
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,560
Should you need anything,
please don't hesitate to let me know.

396
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,920
Ran,

397
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,200
stay with me.

398
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,600
Not here.

399
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,880
Not there

400
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,240
and not here.

401
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,080
Looks like I'm the only one
wanting to stay with you.

402
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,560
I want to stay with you, too,

403
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,480
but I don't think
it's proper to do it here.

404
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
Why not?

405
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,440
No one would doubt it.

406
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,760
A guard's duty is
to be by the prince's side.

407
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
Trust me on this.

408
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,680
Listen to me, okay?

409
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,040
Rest well.

410
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,520
We're having a trip tomorrow.

411
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,000
What a nice car to ride in.

412
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,560
It seems perfect for everyday use.

413
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,160
Do you recall that…

414
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,880
we've also ridden in
another model of this car?

415
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,040
Are there two models?

416
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,120
Yes.

417
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,720
You sure are good at this.

418
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,760
You know exactly
what fits each situation.

419
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,360
Oh…

420
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,480
Have you been here long?

421
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,400
Yeah.

422
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,040
Let's go for a walk, then.

423
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,360
Calvin!

424
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,280
Is everything okay?

425
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,600
Yeah, everything's fine.

426
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,920
I was just texting my friend.

427
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,280
You've got a friend here?

428
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,760
He's a friend from Morpheus,

429
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,800
and he's from around here.

430
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,880
It's a semester break, so he's home.

431
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,960
I see.

432
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,160
So…

433
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,880
wanna go see him for a bit?

434
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,520
We can plan to meet up again later
to return to the palace.

435
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,440
Sounds nice?

436
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,520
Prince Wasin firmly instructed that…

437
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,640
Just send someone
to follow him at a distance.

438
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,280
A distance, you know?

439
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
Come on,

440
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,400
we're on a trip here.

441
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,680
Just relax.

442
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,760
I understand his concerns, though.

443
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,640
You can send someone,

444
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,320
but make sure they keep their distance.

445
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,240
Thank you.

446
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,080
Ran,

447
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,720
why are there only male vendors?

448
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,200
None of them are female.

449
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,280
In Meenanagarin,

450
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,080
it's believed that the husband
should provide for the family

451
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,440
while the wife is responsible
for the housework.

452
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,240
What?

453
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,720
Seriously?

454
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,680
Why do they still believe
in things like that?

455
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,320
What if a man doesn't want
to be the provider?

456
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,760
What if a woman doesn't want
to stay home?

457
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,240
Why can't we do things we love?

458
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,200
They should stop imposing
these roles on people.

459
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,880
Not saying anything?

460
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,520
You also believe in it?

461
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,720
I just think beliefs…

462
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,840
are the hardest thing to change.

463
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,080
But that doesn't mean
change is impossible,

464
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,680
right?

465
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,320
Yes.

466
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,440
It just takes time.

467
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,480
Yeah.

468
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,720
Let's check it out.

469
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,720
Feel free to look around.

470
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,320
Let me know if you like anything.

471
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,800
Feel free.

472
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,680
Let's go further.

473
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,600
Okay.

474
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,960
Feel free to check them out.

475
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,240
- Hello.
- Hello.

476
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,320
Oh, you're the prince!

477
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,520
Do you have any dark champagne pearls?

478
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,440
Oh!

479
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,280
I just happen to have the last one!

480
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,240
Finally, a real one!

481
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,800
It's beautiful.

482
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,040
What do people usually make

483
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,480
with pearls this size?

484
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,760
They're usually made
into necklaces, Your Royal Highness.

485
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,640
A single pearl can enhance the elegance
of both the piece and the wearer.

486
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,360
So now we have to look for
a necklace maker?

487
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,040
About that,

488
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,480
please leave it to me.

489
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,480
Thanks.

490
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,040
Isn't it pretty?

491
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,440
It is.

492
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,760
- We'll take this, please.
- Yes, sir.

493
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,080
June!

494
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,640
June…

495
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,360
This is June, my sister.

496
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,360
My name is Calvin.

497
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,600
Are you okay?

498
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,280
You alright?

499
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,880
He came to travel.

500
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,400
You should show him around.

501
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,720
But Mom isn't home yet.

502
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,160
I can't leave you.

503
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,480
I'll be fine.

504
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,400
It's nothing.

505
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,480
I can wait.

506
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,440
You can stay with her.

507
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,480
Jay, just take him on a walk.

508
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,520
I'll be fine.

509
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,440
It's nothing.

510
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,880
Coming back this time,

511
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,920
her condition's gotten so much worse.

512
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,760
It's hard to believe

513
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,440
someone so young

514
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,920
could be that ill.

515
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,000
Now…

516
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,240
I understand
why you're part of the protesters.

517
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,960
This was never just about her illness.

518
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,720
The truth is,

519
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,240
my dad passed away

520
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,040
from a severe lung disease.

521
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,880
After that,

522
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
we left Assavadevathin and moved here.

523
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,440
I originally joined the movement

524
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,000
just to get justice for my dad…

525
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,400
and June.

526
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,280
But once I got involved,

527
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,920
I realized something.

528
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,600
If we don't fight for change,

529
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,440
how many more lives

530
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,080
will end up like my dad and my sister?

531
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,800
If we all stay quiet

532
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,160
and don't speak up,

533
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,400
how will anyone in charge

534
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,000
even know this problem exists?

535
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,960
But I think…

536
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,400
those in power
also want to help the people.

537
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,720
If they really do,

538
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,080
why is there no sign of progress?

539
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,080
If they do care,

540
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,360
shouldn't there be
some solutions by now?

541
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,560
Do you want to join me tomorrow?

542
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,080
Sure.

543
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,160
I appreciate your understanding.

544
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,040
We're friends after all.

545
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,760
Friends…

546
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,480
share both the good and the bad, right?

547
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,360
I never thought I'd like you this much.

548
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,160
The super strict…

549
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,360
and meticulous one…

550
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,960
Yet when you give me what I want,

551
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,440
you'll become the sweetest!

552
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,120
I can't give you everything you want.

553
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,760
- I have my duties to…
- Come on.

554
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,160
I know, I know.

555
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,560
That word again.

556
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,720
So being strict

557
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,640
is part of your duties,

558
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,040
but falling for me

559
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,480
is beyond them, right?

560
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,920
You understand me, right?

561
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,800
Yeah.

562
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,920
I'll try to.

563
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,000
Will you stay with me tonight?

564
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,760
I can't.

565
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,840
Again?

566
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,000
Jeez.

567
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,440
At least…

568
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,720
join me for dinner,

569
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,400
please!

570
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,000
Come on, we'll just have dinner.

571
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,400
It's not a big deal.

572
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,280
Will you say yes?

573
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,840
Take a seat.

574
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,760
How was everything?

575
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,560
Did you have a good time, dear?

576
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,680
Your city is truly beautiful, Uncle.

577
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,080
And the air feels so fresh.

578
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,360
Make sure you come back often, then.

579
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,920
You're always welcome here.

580
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,560
Uncle,

581
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,280
actually,

582
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,360
there is something I wish to request.

583
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,480
What is it?

584
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,120
I came across this flyer.

585
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,880
And I hope to join the campaign

586
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,280
and sing with the people.

587
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,520
Sure.

588
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,920
The younger generation
holds you in great admiration.

589
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,280
To them,

590
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,680
you represent change for our country.

591
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,040
Meeting you in person,

592
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:31,720
they'll grow even more fond of you
and offer greater support.

593
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,040
Thank you, Uncle.

594
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,160
But I will have my guards

595
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,640
discreetly protect you from a distance.

596
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,680
I hope you do not mind.

597
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,600
I'd like you to stay by my side today.

598
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,160
I don't want you too far from me.

599
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,440
Why?

600
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,840
Afraid I'll disappear on you?

601
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,960
We have to stay alert all the time.

602
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,080
I don't want to risk you getting hurt.

603
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,160
Public places can be unpredictable.

604
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,240
What happened in Davichmetha
might happen again.

605
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,160
I know,

606
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,680
but I also want to stand
with the people.

607
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,280
You understand me, right?

608
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,200
I want to use my title
to truly make a difference.

- Hey, Jay.
- What?

618
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,000
Prince Khanin's joining us.

619
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,520
He is?

620
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,480
Yeah.

621
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,720
He has…

622
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,400
visited our university.

623
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,480
Oh…

624
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,000
- Oh, right.

00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,040
Wait, this is gonna be fun.

626
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,080
Come with me.

00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,040
Come on, Jay.

628
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,120
Hurry.

00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,680
I wanted to help.

634
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,360
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

635
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,440
Then…

636
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,800
Please proceed this way.

637
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,880
This way.

638
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,240

let us sing with all our voices,

Okay!

stop it.

Your Royal Highness!

673
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,000
What did you mean by that?

674
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,000
The mine in Assavadevathin…

675
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,480
It killed my parents.

676
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,760
That mine has blood on its hands.

677
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,760
The King is killing more people!

678
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,080
You're all so damn selfish.

679
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,200

but spread toxic dust.

If it weren't for your greed,

683
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,520
my parents would still be here.

01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,080

- Hey!

685
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,840

686
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,760
Stop!

01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,200
Come on, calm down.

688
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,640
Hey, you're going too far.

689
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,600
Think you can do anything to me, huh?

690
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,040
You're hurting us!

691
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,160
You're harming your people!

694
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,600
We need to go.

695
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,120
Hey, don't be violent!

696
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,680
Don't hurt them!

697
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,400
Stop!

698
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,160
- Calm down!
- Take it easy.

699
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,440
Just calm down.

700
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,640
Don't be violent.

701
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,640
Hey!
Stop!

702
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,560
Don't hurt them.

703
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,560
Calm down! Stop!

01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,240

705
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,800
We were the ones who went too far.

706
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,080
He nearly lost his life
from suffocation.

707
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,760
You can't really tell

708
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,160
who's on which side.

709
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,160

712
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,560
Not even me.

713
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,480
Your Royal Highness…

714
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,120
- Please…
- Sorry to bother your personal time.

715
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,040
I can't even trust

716
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,280
my own family.

717
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,920
Come closer.

I'll let you have a bite.

719
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,400
I enjoyed our stroll today.

720
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,640
Can you take me here often?

721
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,760
If nothing's in my way,

722
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,120
I will.

723
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,000
Next time, let's bring this along
as a snack,

724
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,200
