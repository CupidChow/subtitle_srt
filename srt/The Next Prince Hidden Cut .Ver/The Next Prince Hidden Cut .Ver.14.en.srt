1
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,160
I, the heir of Davichmetha,
hereby withdraw.

2
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,400
We'll proceed with
the final fencing match

3
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,520
between the two clans:

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,480
Assavadevathin and Bhuchongpisut.

5
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,880
Now, you finally see

6
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,360
who rules and who serves.

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,800
Get up,

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,520
or you won't be able to beat Khanin.

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,240
He hasn't come here at all,
Your Royal Highness.

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,960
Maybe this was our chance
to bring about change.

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,680
You must win the fencing match.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,080
I feel so much pressure.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,120
Good luck.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
You've got this.

15
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,440
Ladies and gentlemen,

16
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,280
the Royal Fencing Competition

17
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,400
is about to begin in just a few moments.

18
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,920
Our nation, Emmaly,
is known across the world

19
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,200
for the strength of its fencers.

20
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,080
Many of our fencers have ranked

21
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,880
among the best in the world.

22
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,960
And today, we are about to witness
the most historic match

23
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,800
Emmaly has seen in decades.

24
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,360
It marks a duel
between the clans of Assavadevathin

25
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,240
and Bhuchongpisut.

26
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,280
May both princes

27
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,960
take their positions, please.

28
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,480
Allow me to briefly introduce
Prince Khanin.

29
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,600
Prince Khanin Assavadevathin

30
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,480
has recently returned
from the United Kingdom,

31
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,560
yet he's shown a deep passion
for embracing the culture of Emmaly.

32
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,680
On social media, he's been praised
as a symbol of change.

33
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,160
Up next, I present
Prince Ramil Bhuchongpisut,

34
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,160
a familiar and well-respected figure
among the Emmalians.

35
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,480
He possesses
both intelligence and skills.

36
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,440
He is fond of all sports
and excels in every one of them.

37
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,320
As you all know, to ensure
the safety and security of all,

38
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,200
today's match is taking place
in a closed setting.

39
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,800
The moment has arrived.

40
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,760
The Royal Fencing Competition
between the two royal clans

41
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,360
officially begins now.

56
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,520
you need to breathe.

57
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,280
Breathe in.

58
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,680

Please be informed that

94
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,280
the Bhuchongpisut clan
has requested a ten-minute timeout

95
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
as permitted by the rules.

96
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
I have done my best, Father.

97
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,560
Is that the best you can do?

98
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,160
If you lose,

99
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,080
you know what's coming, don't you?

100
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,440
The Bhuchongpisuts will fall,
all thanks to you.

101
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,480
If there's nothing else,

102
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,000
I shall take my leave.

103
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,960

Allez.
(Go)

131
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,880
Is this really all
the top fencer of the club has got?

132
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,240
Who the hell are you?

133
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,120
Young Prince.

134
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,600
Young Prince…

135
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,480
Who are you talking about?

136
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,480
Men and women stand as equals.

137
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,760
Gender makes no difference.

138
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,640
It's skill that truly matters.

139
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,200
I am…

140
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,640
Khanin Assavadevathin.

141
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,280
If you stay this way,

142
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,520
victory will never be yours.

143
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,520
While one vanished…

144
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,360
With both of you
joining the Competition,

145
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,160
it should be quite exciting.

146
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,800
To have finally found Khanin,

147
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,400
my grandson,

148
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,840
is a miracle beyond words.

149
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,720
This is my grandson,

150
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,880
Khanin Assavadevathin.

151
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,840

Congratulations, Brother.

161
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,520
Thank you, Brother Ramil.

162
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,560
On behalf of the people of Emmaly,

163
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,360
I offer my heartfelt congratulations
to you, Your Royal Highness.

164
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,000
Let's go and congratulate Khanin, Father.

165
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,440
Okay.

166
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,360
Let's go.

167
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,520
You're amazing, Your Royal Highness.

168
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,480
You did it!

169
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,480
As we all know,

170
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,160
Prince Khanin's victory

171
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:25,040
secures another reign on the throne
for the Assavadevathin clan.

172
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Your Royal Highness,

173
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,280
Prince Rachata has requested…

174
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,920
your presence.

175
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
Please proceed this way.

176
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,720
You're a disgrace, Ramil.

177
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,160
How dare you give me that look?

178
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,360
How dare you?

179
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,400
You can slap me again. I won't stop you.

180
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
Now you're provoking me?

181
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,040
Fine.

182
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,400
No number of slaps

183
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,320
can change what happened today.

184
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,480
I have…

185
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,920
already lost to Khanin.

186
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,160
Watch that mouth of yours.

187
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,400
Who do you think you are?

188
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,680
I am your son, Father!

189
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
All this time,

190
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,280
I only wished to be a good son,

191
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,360
a good prince…

192
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,120
I tried to be a good man
to the one I love.

193
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,280
But you took everything from me.

194
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,760
You have gone mad.

195
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,440
Because I've lost everything!

196
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,200
Right now,

197
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,160
I have nothing left.

198
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,120
I'm the one

199
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,920
who gave you everything.

200
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh, did you?

201
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
Father,

202
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,840
when I fell,

203
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,560
did you ever care if I was okay?

204
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,520
Why?

205
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,520
It was nothing serious.

206
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
Did you expect me to baby you?

207
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,480
Forget it, Father.

208
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,440
It doesn't matter anymore.

209
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,760
We may still be father and son in name,

210
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,480
but from this day on,

211
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,360
I will no longer serve
under your command.

212
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,160
You're not allowed to leave.

213
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,800
Ramil!

214
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,680
Ramil!

215
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
Ramil!

216
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
Father,

217
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,600
Khanin is here to see you.

218
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,440
Grandfather…

219
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
Khanin…

220
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,040
Father told me that

221
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,520
you had sent your apology.

222
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,200
So I want you to know…

223
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,400
I accept your apology, Grandfather.

224
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
You're Charan, right?

225
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Charan,

226
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,080
from now on, I'll be your grandfather.

227
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,560
Call me Grandfather.

228
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,240
Grandfather…

229
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
Remember,

230
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,400
even if you have no one else,

231
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,160
you'll always have me.

232
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,080
Let us all proceed.

233
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,040
Ramil…

234
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,200
As the King of Emmaly,

235
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,040
I hereby proclaim
the principles of my reign.

236
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,720
From this day forth,

237
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,280
I shall devote my life
to serving every citizen of Emmaly,

238
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,680
and strive to resolve all matters,
great or small,

239
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,880
for the lasting peace of my people.

240
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,720
How do you envision the future of Emmaly

241
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,840
from this point onward,
Your Royal Highness?

242
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,280
His Majesty the King has recognized
the environmental issues

243
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,480
and has issued policies to preserve
our country's natural heritage.

244
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,120
We may soon see new regulations

245
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,640
that comprehensively address
environmental concerns.

246
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,320
What about Your Royal Highness?

247
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,320
Might we know

248
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,800
what you wish to do next?

249
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,120
I shall stand in support
of His Majesty's work.

250
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,880
As to how…

251
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,240
I'm still searching for the answer.

252
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,880
Uh…

253
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,480
Aren't you sticking to the script,
Your Royal Highness?

254
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,240
It's better to say what I truly feel.

255
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,400
♫Where the time has gone,♫

256
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,960
♫I just know you're my world, my dawn♫

257
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,600
♫You've taken my heart,
my soul, my way,♫

258
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,720
♫In this night, it's us who'll stay♫

259
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,960
♫Moonlight shines so bright♫

260
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,840
Will you dance with me,
my most trusted royal guard?

261
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,800
With utmost pleasure.

262
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,320
♫This moment feels like it's truly mine♫

263
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,960
♫The world's a fairy tale,♫

264
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,800
♫In your arms tonight♫

265
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,400
♫I wish to stop this time,♫

266
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,040
♫And call you my endless light♫

267
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,920
Why didn't you stick
to the script, though?

268
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,040
I did not want to pretend.

269
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Honestly, I still don't know

270
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,120
If I can't even answer that for myself,

271
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,080
If I can't even answer that for myself,

272
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,240
I don't want to lie about it, either.

273
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,080
But you know what, Ran?

274
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,480
There's one thing
I can say for sure right now.

275
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,320
I want to be with you, Ran.

276
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,640
♫The world's a fairy tale,♫

277
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,080
♫In your arms tonight♫

278
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,600
♫I wish to stop this time,♫

279
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,280
♫And make you forever mine♫

280
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,960
♫Ooh, dancing in the moonlight with you,♫

281
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:23,360
♫Under the stars, just us two♫

282
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,000
♫With every beat, my heart's complete♫

283
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,480
♫You…♫

284
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,120
♫You made my dream come true♫

285
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,280
♫Oh, and it is only you♫

286
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,960
♫Hold me so tight,♫

287
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,840
♫All through the night♫

288
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,440
♫Hold me so tight,♫

289
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,520
♫All through the night♫

290
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,320
May I ask

291
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,240
what's on your mind?

292
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,080
Why are you two here?

293
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,360
Aren't you going inside?

294
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,720
My apologies, Father.

295
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,600
What's on your mind?

296
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,840
I'm just…

297
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,760
considering something.

298
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I've spoken with Thatdanai.

299
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,480
And I think…

300
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,520
as long as you're happy,

301
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,440
I won't dictate your path.

302
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,560
Live your life
the way you truly want to.

303
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,000
Thank you, Father.

304
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,760
I need a little more time,
and I'll let you know soon.

305
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,760
Let's go inside, shall we?

306
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,560
Paytai…

307
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
Your Royal Highness…

308
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,000
How do you know I'm here?

309
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,280
I saw your painting.

310
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,800
- How have you been?
- How are you doing?

311
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,639
Have you…

312
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,600
received any punishment,
Your Royal Highness?

313
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,640
Your Royal Highness,

314
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,960
are you alright?

315
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,400
I'm sorry.

316
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,920
I've never been the lover you deserved.

317
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,400
You…

318
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,080
don't need to be sorry,
Your Royal Highness.

319
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,080
Your Royal Highness…

320
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Please don't cry.

321
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,560
Can you tell me what happened?

322
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,800
My father…

323
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,520
was nothing but a madman,
drunk on power.

324
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,840
I'm sorry.

325
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,120
It's okay.

326
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,520
I truly am.

327
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,360
I have nothing left now.

328
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,840
Neither do I, Your Royal Highness.

329
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,040
I was born the son of a politician,

330
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,280
sent to serve you since I was a child.

331
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,560
And I…

332
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,960
foolishly believed that

333
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,440
everything I did
was for the sake of my family.

334
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,160
It's okay, Your Royal Highness.

335
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,600
Please don't cry.

336
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,080
Is it really okay?

337
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,760
I'm still here with you.

338
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,880
Thank you.

339
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,440
I will stay right by your side.

340
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,240
Get this ready for me.

341
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,920
Sure, Your Royal Highness.

342
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,640
What are you doing?

343
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,240
Since you're here,

344
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,160
I have something to tell you.

345
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,920
I want a break today.

346
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,360
Please take me out.

347
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,880
If you want to go out,

348
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,120
you need to inform His Majesty first.

349
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,640
I already did.

350
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,440
You can ask Chakri.

351
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,440
Sorry?

352
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,040
Oh…

353
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:54,040
His Majesty asked that
you look after His Royal Highness.

354
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,160
Where do you want to go?

355
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,840
This reminds me of…

356
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,520
when we ran away from the attackers
and came to Emmaly.

357
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,000
Someone here was really tough
at that time, huh?

358
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,760
If you weren't so stubborn,

359
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,000
your Unc-unc
wouldn't have been so tough.

360
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,760
Alright,

361
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,200
Unc-unc.

362
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,680
I like calling you by that name.

363
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,080
Then call me that again.

364
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,480
Unc-unc…

365
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,160
We've tried that before.

366
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,040
You want some again, right?

367
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,760
Prince Khanin,

368
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,480
how many sets would you like to get?

369
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,080
- One, please.
- Okay.

370
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,800
Here you go, Your Royal Highness.

371
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,280
Come on,

372
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,800
let me feed you, Unc-unc.

373
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,920
Does it look good on me?

374
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,320
It's cute.

375
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,040
You like it?

376
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,320
It's so pretty.

377
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,320
How cute.

378
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,480
But you're cuter.

379
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,240
Let's match.

380
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Cute.

381
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,640
I remember this.

382
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,200
We were eating grilled pork
together right here.

383
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,280
It feels so different
from the last time.

384
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,800
I remember…

385
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,720
having to tell you to smile.

386
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,320
I was worried we might be noticed,

387
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,040
or even worse,

388
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,280
you might be ambushed.

389
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,680
So you had that serious, stern look…

390
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,440
cause you were worried about me?

391
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,640
I think you could say that.

392
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,560
Just accept that you cared.

393
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:50,960
Yes.

394
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,760
I cared about you.

395
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,920
Then tell me if you love me.

396
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,880
I know

397
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,920
you have a lot on your mind.

398
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,200
And one of them…

399
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,400
is about me, isn't it?

400
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,080
It's not just you
I've been thinking about.

401
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,280
It's our future.

402
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,280
Let's go somewhere quiet

403
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,160
and talk about us.

404
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,000
What a beautiful starry night.

405
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,840
Yeah.

406
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,840
So beautiful.

407
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,800
Ran, what's that star?

408
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,360
Would you like to say something first?

409
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,320
Oh…

410
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,520
We're here to talk.

411
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,760
Right, that's why we're here.

412
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,600
So…

413
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,840
I've been thinking.

414
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,160
But before I say anything,

415
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,280
I wanna know
what you wanna do from now on.

416
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,680
I think…

417
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,320
I want to devote myself
to assisting His Majesty.

418
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,760
The pollution crisis
needs immediate action,

419
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,960
and I'll stand with him
in confronting the old power structure.

420
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,880
I understand.

421
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,000
Having you support His Majesty

422
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,400
will surely give him peace of mind.

423
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,280
That sounds like a good path.

424
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,560
What about you?

425
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,120
What have you been thinking?

426
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,280
I've made up my mind.

427
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,480
I'm going back to the UK

428
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,440
to study more about…

429
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,720
pollution management.

430
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,720
Maybe I'll learn something new

431
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,440
and help Emmaly grow in the future.

432
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,320
But…

433
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,240
your title…

434
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,120
I've never wanted a title.

435
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,000
I haven't changed my mind.

436
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,640
Just like I told you before,

437
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,520
I want nothing more
than an ordinary life.

438
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,600
If I'm no longer a prince,

439
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,800
can you say you love me now?

440
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,040
I think…

441
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,440
If you have to think,

442
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,520
that means you can't, right?

443
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,000
That's not what I meant.

444
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,840
I just think…

445
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,360
if I say it,

446
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,360
it might be inappropriate

447
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,680
or even wrong.

448
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,960
I get it.

449
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,160
I'll be waiting for the day
you can say you love me.

450
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,160
Big news for our nation today, guys!

451
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:41,040
Prince Khanin
has renounced his royal title

452
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,640
to continue his education.

453
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,920
This announcement has ignited

454
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,560
widespread discussion.

455
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,480
Some believe Prince Khanin
should ascend to rule.

456
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:58,160
Or this… This might be
the beginning of real change.

457
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,640
Now that is truly Prince Khanin.

458
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,440
[Jay: Would it be possible
to see you again, Your Royal Highness?]

459
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
[Trust Gangnam Clinic
for Laser Hair Removal]

460
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,960
I'll send this to June.

461
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:01,840
Calvin?

462
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,520
Can we please talk?

463
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,000
I want to talk to you, too.

464
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,880
I'm sorry

465
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,160
for hiding who I really was from you.

466
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,280
I didn't mean to hide it at first.

467
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,160
I just felt…

468
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,520
nice having you as a friend.

469
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,560
But as time went by,

470
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,760
I started feeling something deeper.

471
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,280
I kept waiting for the right moment

472
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,840
to tell you the truth about me,

473
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,600
but it just never came.

474
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,840
Your Royal Highness…

475
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,160
Please call me the way you used to.

476
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,840
I mean…

477
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,680
I admit that…

478
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,440
I was mad at first

479
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,440
because you lied to me.

480
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,280
But…

481
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,560
I don't think you really meant to.

482
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,920
I never wanted to lie to you.

483
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,320
So, why are you here?

484
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,680
Weren't you already called back?

485
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:03,880
Yes.

486
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,200
But I don't think…

487
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,440
I want to stay in Bhujar anymore.

488
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,640
What do you mean?

489
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,280
When I first came here,

490
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,960
I didn't even want to study art.

491
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,400
I was sent to this art university

492
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,360
by the royal family

493
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,000
to keep an unimportant prince like me

494
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,360
from challenging my brother
for the throne.

495
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,080
But after I met you,

496
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,400
I realized…

497
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,560
I like art.

498
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,360
And I like you.

499
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,160
I don't know if you feel the same way,

500
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,800
but you mean a lot to me, Jay.

501
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,400
I…

502
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,720
feel the same way.

503
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,080
What's confusing you?

504
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,800
I mean,

505
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,120
I like you, too.

506
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,160
Thanks.

507
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:22,840
Oh,

508
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,560
you're still up?

509
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,680
Yes, Father.

510
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,480
I have something for you.

511
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,600
A portrait of you I painted.

512
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,880
It may not be perfect,

513
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,680
but I did my best.

514
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,480
Thanks, dear.

515
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,520
There's something else I need to say.

516
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,360
It's what I once asked of you

517
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,880
that if I were to win,

518
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,760
you would honor my request.

519
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,880
Would that be too much to ask, Father?

520
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,600
Emmaly means the people,

521
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,760
and democracy belongs to them.

522
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,360
Thank you, Father.

523
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,720
You don't need to.

524
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,040
It's what I ought to do.

525
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,400
This land

526
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,760
belongs to the people,

527
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,200
not to us alone.

528
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,840
So,

529
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,880
you're leaving tomorrow, right?

530
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,600
Yes.

531
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,200
I want to thank you

532
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,160
for everything, Father.

533
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,000
Look,

534
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,720
though I wasn't there to raise you,

535
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,800
I love you

536
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,080
unconditionally.

537
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,440
Your happiness

538
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,720
brings me joy,

539
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,000
and your pain

540
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,720
brings me sorrow.

541
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,160
If something's still bothering you,

542
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,840
you can always come to me.

543
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,440
The only thing that's still bothering me

544
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,000
is the person I love.

545
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,680
I know when it comes to that,

546
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,200
you'll do whatever you want.

547
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,640
But the one in my heart won't agree.

548
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,640
You can go first.

549
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,560
I want a moment with Ran.

550
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,160
I'll wait for you there, then.

551
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,480
Take good care of yourself here.

552
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,080
I had the pearl
made into a necklace for you.

553
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,520
This is beautiful.

554
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,600
I'll put it on you.

555
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,440
Will you be waiting for me, Nin?

556
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,520
I'll never stop waiting.

557
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,320
I…

558
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,400
It's okay.

559
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,480
I totally understand everything.

560
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,040
Thank you for understanding me.

561
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,320
You've got your duties to do.

562
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,920
I know.

563
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,280
But call me

564
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,040
when you have time.

565
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,480
Call me often.

566
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,640
Okay.

567
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,480
Come to me soon, okay?

568
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,440
I'm leaving now.

569
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,880
You don't need to send me off.

570
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:47,880
It's this close.

571
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,960
I love you, Ran.

572
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,320
I…

573
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,600
Your Royal Highness…

574
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,280
Please wait for me, too!

575
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,040
Without you,

576
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,600
I don't know how I'll go on.

577
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,960
Please…

578
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,640
Please let me come with you.

579
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:26,840
Your Royal Highness!

580
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,400
Please. Please wait for me.

581
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,800
Prince Khanin… Oh!

582
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,360
Goodbye, Mr. Charan.

583
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,520
I, Chakri, am leaving for London.

584
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,720
Prince Khanin!

585
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:02,840
Wait up, please.

586
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,440
Your Royal Highness!

587
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,600
Your Royal Highness…

588
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:30,760
Look.

589
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,560
I've brought

590
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,640
Lolane Intense Care
Bond Repair Water Treatment with me.

591
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,960
Always the full name, huh?

592
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,120
Thanks.

593
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,760
However,

594
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,720
this is not the palace.

595
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,240
We talk casually here,

596
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:54,920
okay?

597
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,160
Come sit with me,

598
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,760
mate.

599
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,520
Mate?

600
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,120
Mate.

601
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:12,920
So…

602
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,200
I'll be…

603
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,640
your butler…

604
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,240
Your buddy?

605
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,840
Your bestie?

606
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:28,760
Yep.

607
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,400
I miss the palace.

608
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,880
My palace, I miss you.

609
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,160
Nin,

610
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,000
what mischief
did you pull on Chakri this time?

611
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,080
I didn't, Dad.

612
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,240
I just told him to talk to me casually.

613
01:02:58,560 --> 01:02:59,960
Finished putting things away?

614
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,320
Let's have a meal.

615
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,840
Are we having
some kind of Emmalian food?

616
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,680
Don't tell me…

617
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,040
Spaghetti.

618
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,920
I'm joking, come on.

619
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,080
I've made Beef Wellington, you know.

620
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,360
Whoa!

621
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,120
You've improved, haven't you?

622
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,880
Give me a few minutes, and we'll eat.

623
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,840
I went to see Vedish today.

624
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,080
Right now,

625
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,560
it must be nighttime over there,

626
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,000
right?

627
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,000
You're right.

628
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,320
Have you eaten yet?

629
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,600
I have.

630
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,400
Dad made…

631
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,200
Beef Wellington.

632
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,800
Chakri even had two plates.

633
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,400
Have you stopped messing with him yet?

634
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,640
I have never done that.

635
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,160
Can I believe that, though?

636
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,280
Of course you can.

637
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,480
How can I mess with anyone?

638
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,960
I am…

639
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,040
sweet.

640
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,080
Yeah,

641
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,320
you are.

642
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,240
What?

643
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,920
Why are you making me blush, Charan?

644
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,360
My heart's beating so fast.

645
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,440
I miss you.

646
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,480
Gosh,

647
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,280
that could take my life, you know?

648
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,960
Do you miss me, too?

649
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,440
I don't just miss you.

650
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,640
I wanna see you.

651
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,000
I wanna hug you.

652
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,200
I wanna…

653
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:21,960
kiss you.

654
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,760
You'll get to do it soon.

655
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,160
Sorry?

656
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,240
What did you just say?

657
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,720
I didn't catch that.

658
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,040
Nothing.

659
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:32,960
Nin!

660
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,880
Your parcel's here.

661
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:35,840
Got it.

662
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,360
Ran, I'll go get my parcel now.

663
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,600
I'll call you again tonight.

664
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,280
Okay.

665
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,920
I love you.

666
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,320
I've been reading the papers all day.

667
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,600
My eyes can't take it anymore.

668
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,160
You need some rest, though.

669
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,640
I'm worried about you.

670
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,760
Oh, right.

671
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,160
I've got an update for you.

672
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,320
Apparently, Charan…

673
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,400
is gonna be working
at the Ministry of Environment.

674
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,840
Charan? The Ministry of Environment?

675
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:27,960
Yeah,

676
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:31,600
but I'm not sure what his position is.

677
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,320
Are you ever
coming back to Emmaly, though?

678
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,120
You've been away for so long.

679
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,160
I just got here not long ago.

680
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,880
It feels like it's been forever, though.

681
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,160
Don't you wanna come back?

682
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,520
Well…

683
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,840
I gotta finish my degree first.

684
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,720
I'll think about it after that.

685
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:57,400
Gosh, all that effort,
and you didn't fall for it.

686
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,640
Have you talked to Charan at all, though?

687
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,280
Well…

688
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,480
yeah, sometimes.

689
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,440
But he's been busy these days.

690
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,400
So you don't get to talk, right?

691
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,560
I should hang up, then,

692
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,960
so you can call him, okay?

693
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,000
Goodnight, Nin.

694
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,400
Welcome to call-back service.

695
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,120
You're up?

696
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,520
Ran!

697
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,840
I'm not dreaming, am I?

698
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,479
Are you really here?

699
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,560
Yeah,

700
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:31,880
I am.

701
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:35,720
To see you.

702
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,520
Ran, did you know

703
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,760
I couldn't reach you last night,

704
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,920
so I couldn't sleep at all?

705
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,440
I'm sorry.

706
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,240
I was probably on the plane

707
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,800
when you called.

708
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,520
I wanted to surprise my dear Nin.

709
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,720
But if you're here,

710
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,000
don't you have duties
with His Majesty anymore?

711
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,160
I'm sorry

712
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,520
for how unclear I was
and for making you upset.

713
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,160
But from now on,

714
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,520
I'm staying right here with you.

715
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,720
Something's off with you lately.

716
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,120
What's with this wine night?

717
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,040
Got too much time or what?

718
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,360
I have made up my mind.

719
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,240
Made up your mind?

720
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,040
From now on, the Phithakthewas

721
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,360
will no longer serve as the royal guards
of the Assavadevathins.

722
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,320
What?

723
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,600
You mean…

724
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,240
you quit?

725
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,760
I guess that word…

726
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,600
may be right.

727
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,120
You're here, Charan?

728
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

729
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,960
What brings you here
to seek my presence?

730
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,920
I have come to make a humble request.

731
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,240
I ask that the vow
the Phithakthewas made

732
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,840
to the Assavadevathins be dissolved.

733
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,640
We shall no longer serve
as your royal guards, Your Majesty.

734
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,160
Very well.

735
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,720
It was merely a promise
between our ancestors after all.

736
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:24,080
I have no intention
of holding you to it any further.

737
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,360
I am most grateful.

738
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,640
But may I ask you something?

739
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,000
Why would someone
so resolute in his duty like you

740
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,840
choose to end the vow?

741
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,840
Because the time has come, Your Majesty,

742
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,840
for me to let go of my duty

743
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,680
and follow the calling of my own heart.

744
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,920
♫You've always been my only one, still♫

745
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,200
♫Since fate first brought us together♫

746
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:08,800
♫I've never forgotten
any of that, like never♫

747
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,800
Don't take this as a lecture,

748
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,360
but remember

749
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,440
to never keep someone you love waiting.

750
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,800
Time waits for no one, Charan.

751
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,960
♫Just for you, my one and only♫

752
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,040
I am most grateful, Your Majesty.

753
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,920
Right now, your duty is

754
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,680
to follow your heart

755
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,160
and love him with everything you have.

756
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
♫Letting other voices pass by♫

757
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,320
♫Just for a few seconds,♫

758
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,920
♫My love is for no one else,♫

759
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,400
♫But you♫

760
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,440
I resigned from my duty as a royal guard

761
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,360
and ended the vow
made to the Assavadevathins.

762
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,320
I flew across the skies

763
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:11,440
to tell you…

764
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,400
I love you, Khanin.

765
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,160
I love you, too.

766
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:55,040
♫So my heart's solely made♫

767
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,920
♫Just for you, my one and only♫

768
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:02,120
♫I'll look the other way,♫

769
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,880
♫Ignoring every word they say♫

770
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,800
♫I'll turn a blind eye♫

771
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,320
♫And just let other voices pass by♫

772
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,600
♫Just for a few seconds,♫

773
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:19,480
♫My love is for no one else,♫

774
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:22,560
♫But you♫

775
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,360
I'm up, Dad!

776
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,040
Can I come in?

777
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,680
Yeah.

778
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,160
Are you surprised?

779
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,240
You knew he'd come, didn't you?

780
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,280
Well…

781
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,240
If I told you,

782
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,720
it wouldn't be a surprise.

783
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,000
Come on, Dad!

784
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,080
Breakfast is ready.

785
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,200
Join us, Charan.

786
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,600
Okay, Dad.

787
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,440
Here you go.

788
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:58,520
Oh…

789
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,440
Here.

790
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,520
It's okay.

791
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:09,480
- Take your seat.
- Okay.

792
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:10,400
Alright.

793
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:19,080
It feels just like that time
we had a meal together.

794
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,080
But…

795
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,640
Chakri wasn't with us.

796
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,720
Did I miss something?

797
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,040
No.

798
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,480
It was totally different back then.

799
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,360
Nin had this scowl on his face

800
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,640
cause he didn't like Charan.

801
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,400
Look at him now.

802
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,560
He's glued to Charan.

803
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,240
He was trying way too hard
to be strict, you know.

804
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:54,800
I was just being quiet.

805
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,720
You should take him out after this meal.

806
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,920
Let's do that tomorrow.

807
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:03,640
He must be tired from his flight.

808
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,560
Then let's dig in

809
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:08,560
before the food gets cold.

810
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,480
Okay.

811
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,560
Enjoy your meal.

812
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,720
- I'm digging in.
- Here.

813
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,880
This soup is amazing.

814
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,240
Give it a taste, Charan.

815
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:17,320
Okay.

816
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:33,920
So sweet, isn't it?

817
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:36,880
Is it good, Chakri?

818
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,200
Chakri!

819
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:09,120
Oh…

820
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:10,400
Oh!

821
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,720
Your Royal Highness…

822
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,200
Oh,

823
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,360
right…

824
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:18,600
I can't call you that.

825
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,680
You're just "Nin" now.

826
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,320
What were you doing?

827
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:25,920
Look,

828
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,880
I was watching a series on iQIYI.

829
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:33,160
There's a lot to choose from
across different genres.

830
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,360
And the best part…

831
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,640
They've got BL series, too.

832
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,840
Are you a fan of BL series?

833
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,160
Well,

834
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,280
I'm a big fan.

835
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,200
They're just…

836
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,480
so good

837
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,560
and heart-fluttering.

838
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,120
Let me see.

839
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,480
I wanna watch some, too.

840
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:53,720
Let my heart flutter as well.

841
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,400
Sure, here you go.

842
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,640
Check this out.

843
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,440
Come on, Mr. Charan.

844
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,800
Watch it with us.

845
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,280
Come on.

846
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:16,760
- This is so cute, Ran.
- You're right.

847
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,000
Just as cute as you.

848
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,360
Oops…

849
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:26,160
This is even more heart-fluttering.

850
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:44,760
What are you doing?

851
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:45,920
Why the long face?

852
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,920
I still have no idea where to take you.

853
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:55,720
Anywhere you wanna go?

854
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,800
Ran?

855
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,720
There's one place I wanna go.

856
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,280
Can you take me there?

857
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,600
I missed this smell so bad.

858
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,680
You still smell so pleasant, Nin.

859
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,400
♫On a night when no stars grace the sky♫

860
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,760
♫And silence drifts
as the hours pass by,♫

861
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:21,240
♫No matter how deep the cold may bite,♫

862
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:27,000
♫One warm soul, standing in sight,♫

863
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:30,800
♫Can make the dark heart glow so bright♫

864
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
♫With nothing but love
to set things right♫

865
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:42,120
♫The one who could fill in
my missing part,♫

866
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,320
I can kiss you, too, you know.

867
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:52,680
♫If you're the one
destined for my heart,♫

868
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:59,760
♫Then love is near,
we're not so far apart♫

869
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:08,000
♫I need your love,
the only love I've longed for,♫

870
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,800
♫Just the word "love" from you,
and that's all♫

871
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,320
♫Let me hear it, I won't ask for more♫

872
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:22,000
♫I need your love, the only one I adore,♫

873

♫My heart's been waiting

874
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,520
Say please.

875
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:01,520
Please.

876
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,560
I missed you, good boy.

877
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,960
No, I'm a good "babe."

878
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:13,280
♫The world's a fairy tale,♫

♫I wish to stop this time,♫

881
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:27,640
♫And make you forever mine♫

882
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:35,360
♫Ooh, dancing in the moonlight with you,♫

883
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:41,200
♫Under the stars, just us two♫

884
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:49,320
♫With every beat, my heart's complete♫

885
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,800
♫You…♫

886
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,600
♫You made my dream come true♫

♫Oh, and it is only you♫

888
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:07,280
♫Hold me so tight,♫

889
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:11,960
♫All through the night♫

890
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:47,920
After I came back,

891
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,200
I started coming here often.

892
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,080
It's a bit far,

893
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,280
but it's peaceful right here.

894
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:01,600
Nin.

895
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:04,800
Yeah?

896
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,160
This ring…

897
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,960
You remember it, right?

898
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,400
You told me

899
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:39,520
this was your parents' wedding ring.

900
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:43,040
That's right.

901
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:46,440
And now,

902
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,280
this ring will be yours.

903
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:30,560
Will you marry me?

904
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:41,560
I've received permission
from His Majesty and your dad.

905
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,280
May I put this ring on your finger?

906
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:59,240
♫Do you know, my dear?♫

907
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:05,000
I'll cherish and take care of you
with all I have, Khanin.

908
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:10,480
I promise.

909
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:17,880
♫I know we'll fly beyond with no fear♫

910
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:19,360
♫Right, my dear?♫

911
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:23,240
♫I'll never fade or drift away♫

♫The only one I need each day,♫

914
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:40,920
♫It's just you, my heart won't stray♫

915
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:54,920
♫Let me just love you
as the moments fly♫

916
01:33:55,360 --> 01:34:02,280
♫That's all I ask, to call you mine♫

917
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:05,520

♫Like the sky, I'm by your side♫

921
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:25,880
♫Do you know what makes the sky shine,♫

922
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:30,080
♫Keeping it lovely up high?♫

923
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:33,920
♫It's when the majestic sea
reflects the sky♫

924
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,600
♫Just like you and me, side by side♫

925
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:44,720
♫It's enough for me, your hand in mine♫

♫And how treacherous
this journey might be,♫

946
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:51,720

I'll set out willingly,♫

♫Let love guide us, no matter how far♫

950
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:08,000
♫All I ask is
to trust in love and in me,♫

951
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:11,000
♫Take my hand and you will see,♫

952
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:15,480
♫Above the sky, we're meant to be♫
