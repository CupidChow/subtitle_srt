1
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,760
Is what people are saying
about the mine true?

2
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,680
Don't hurt them.

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,520
Did someone really die
because of the Assavadevathins?

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,439
I was…

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,040
acting under orders
from His Majesty the King

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,120
He probably thinks
he's got all the power

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
to do whatever he wants.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,000
I wish to study
the mining operations in Assavadevathin.

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,160
Leave.

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,920
I don't want you in my sight.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,840
I'm returning to Assavadevathin

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,440
with a significant event coming up soon.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,520
In that case,

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,160
let's make new memories there together.

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,680
Who are you?

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,160
Why did you save me?

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,040
I'm Vedish,

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,120
a friend of Charan.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,520
I'm glad you're here, dear.

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,480
Welcome to the Palace of Assavadevathin.

21
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,720
I'm glad to be here as well.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,640
You must be weary
and hungry from the journey.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,320
Let's go to the dining hall.

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Yes, Father.

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,960
Have a seat, Charan.

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,320
Eat up, dear.

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,320
If there's anything you want, tell me.

28
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,040
Yes, Father.

29
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,120
Alright, let's dig in.

30
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,840
Why does this spaghetti taste like…

31
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,520
I learned it from Thatdanai.

32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
You cooked this yourself, Father?

33
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,000
I figured you'd feel more comfortable

34
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,880
if the taste was something
you remembered.

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,240
I appreciate that, Father.

36
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,040
This is your first visit
to Assavadevathin.

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,960
One day,
you will be the one to govern it.

38
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,400
Would you mind

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,240
if I asked you something, Father?

40
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
Not at all. Go ahead.

41
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,160
Recently, there was a news report
about a young girl

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
who stole gold from the mine to sell

43
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,840
just so she could pay
for her mother's medical treatment.

44
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,760
Have you heard about it, Father?

45
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,480
Indeed, I have.

46
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,240
Is it true that the mine's pollution
is making miners ill?

47
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,760
As for that matter,

48
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm still looking into it.

49
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,640
But don't worry, dear.

50
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,760
I'll take care of everything.

51
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,120
For now,

52
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,360
go and enjoy the lantern procession.

53
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,440
Charan will show you around.

54
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,840
We are here, Your Royal Highness.

55
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,440
Please proceed this way.

56
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,480
When will the procession start?

57
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,920
In half an hour, I believe.

58
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,040
Why do they have this procession, Ran?

59
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,480
Back in the day,
most people worked as miners.

60
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,320
They often worked until night

61
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,800
or even dawn.

62
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,560
The way home was dark and empty,

63
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,360
making some villagers

64
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,280
fear what they couldn't see.

65
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,320
Thankfully, the starlight
served as their guide.

66
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,320
So the villagers
used lanterns as a symbol

67
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,000
to show gratitude to the starlight

68
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,200
and to ask for blessings
for a successful mining season.

69
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,080
And it has been passed down
ever since, right?

70
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,080
How come you know the answers
to all of my questions?

71
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,120
I don't know everything.

72
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,320
That's not true.

73
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,600
Whatever I ask, you've got an answer.

74
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,320
When it comes to things
I'm not familiar with,

75
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,520
I might not have the answers for you.

76
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,280
That will never happen

77
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,400
cause you're familiar with everything.

78
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,280
Well…

79
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,800
Should we get one of those?

80
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,200
Okay.

81
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Chakri,

82
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,159
let's go get a lantern.

83
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

84
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,640
Let's go.

85
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,200
Let's make a comeback, Unc-unc.

86
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,640
Fine, no holding hands.

87
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
Unc-unc?

88
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,760
Oh, are you Prince Khanin?

89
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,200
I'll take one, please.

90
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,000
- Oh, sure.
- The lantern.

91
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,240
Here you are.

92
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,560
- Thanks, young man.
- No problem.

93
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,680
Sales haven't been so great this year.
Fewer tourists are showing up.

94
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,080
- Oh, I see.
- They say…

95
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,120
it's because of the dust in the news.

96
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,320
People are afraid of getting sick,

97
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,800
so they're not coming anymore.

98
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,520
And to be fair, the dust really is bad.

99
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,840
The air's not great
around here, young man.

100
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
Sorry.

101
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,360
It's okay.

102
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,840
Just an old lady talking too much.

103
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,240
Have fun while you're here.

104
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,800
Enjoy your visit, Your Royal Highness.

105
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,040
Is something wrong?

106
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,360
He saw me.

107
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,280
Got it.

108
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,800
Dad?

109
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,000
That's my dad!

110
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,880
Let's leave now.

111
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,920
Nin.

112
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,200
Let go of me.

113
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,160
- I wanna know if it's him.
- Nin.

114
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,880
It's very crowded here.

115
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,800
You might be wrong.

116
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,720
Yeah, I wanna know if I'm wrong or not.

117
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Let me go.

118
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,880
Nin!

119
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,040
Nin…

120
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,960
Excuse me.

121
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
- Nin!
- Oh…

122
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,040
I'm sorry.

123
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,960
Are you okay?

124
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,080
We're sorry.

125
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,680
We're really sorry.

126
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,840
Stop the cover-ups. Face the air crisis!

127
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,760
- Yeah!
- Right!

128
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,320
Stop the cover-ups. Face the air crisis!

129
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,240
- Yeah!
- Exactly!

130
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,040
Stop the cover-ups. Face the air crisis!

131
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,960
- Yeah!
- Right!

132
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,320
Clean up our air!

133
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,800
- Clean up our air!
- Clean up our air!

134
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,960
Clean up our air!

135
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,800
- Clean up our air!
- Clean up our air!

136
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,480
Clean up our air!

137
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,640
Clean up our air!
[Those in power must remedy the situation]

138
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,280
Clean up our air!

139
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,080
- Clean up our air!
- Deal with the dust!

140
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,120
No dust!
[The city of dust]

141
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,760
- No dust!
- Clean up our air!

142
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,200
Clean up our air!
[We want clean air, not dust]

143
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,640
- Clean up our air!
- Clean up our air!

144
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,960
Clean up our air!

145
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,480
- Clean up our air!
- Clean up our air!

146
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,920
[The power is ours;
this land belongs to the people!]

147
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,800
Those in power must solve
the mine's problems.

148
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,360
If we go on strike,

149
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,080
will Emmaly make it?

150
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,320
- Exactly!
- Right!

151
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Everyone,

152
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,200
today,

153
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,240
let's make our voices heard
by those at the top!

154
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,440
- Right!
- Yeah!

155
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,880
[Help! Lung cancer is here!]

156
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,960
[We want our air back!]

157
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,640
I'm here to listen to all concerns

158
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,760
and calls for change.

159
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,840
We've been speaking out for ages.

160
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,000
And yet, you claim you didn't know
that lives have been lost?

161
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,360
- Yeah!
- Exactly.

162
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,160
- Right.
- Clean up our air now!

163
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,520
Deal with the dust!

164
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,440
Do it now!

but there hasn't been any progress.

172
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,400
- You don't even care we're suffering!
- Yeah!

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,400
The procession is on its way.

185
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,640
Can't you see what the real issue is?

186
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,240
You're only here to cause a scene.

187
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,160
Get lost!

188
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,080
Bring it!

189
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,880
Hey, everyone.

190
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,000
Come on.

191
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,200
Get them out of here.

192
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,920
Let them know
how much we value our tradition.

193
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,480
Get out!

194
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,120
Get out.

195
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Get out!

196
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,720
Everyone, don't use force.

197
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,120
Let's not resort to violence.

198
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,920
You are oppressing the citizens.

199
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,040
- Please calm down.
- Go away!

200
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,520
Hey!

201
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,200
- Gosh.
- Why did you do that?

202
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,480
I need to know if he's still alive.

203
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,920
But now, I'm going to help them.

204
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,720
The situation may worsen.

205
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,960
Please leave, Your Royal Highness.

206
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
Please.

207
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,880
- Nin…
- It's gonna be alright.

208
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,800
Trust me.

209
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
Hey!

210
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,160
What kind of upbringing did you have

211
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,800
to behave like this?

212
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,760
Oh…

213
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
Your Royal Highness.

214
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,160
Your voices are heard.

215
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,000
Given the urgency,

216
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,160
the issue should be
handled temporarily first.

217
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,880
N95 masks and air purifiers
shall be provided to the miners.

218
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,120
Following that,
I'll keep a close watch on the situation

219
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,080
and tackle the pollution problem.

220
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,840
I will figure out

221
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,720
how to reduce dust pollution.

222
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
I kindly ask you

223
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,200
to let the lantern procession pass.

224
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,440
I'm genuinely going to help you.

225
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
I give you my word.

226
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,960
How are we supposed to trust you?

227
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,920
That's right.

228
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,920
How can we be sure

229
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,760
that what you're doing
isn't just for show?

230
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,320
- Fake!
- Fake.

231
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
How could you do that?

232
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
Trust me.

233
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,320
I'm helping everyone.

234
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,840
Your concerns matter,

235
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,600
and I promise to address them.

236
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,160
However, the procession
doesn't cause pollution,

237
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,040
and these people are merely keeping
their tradition alive.

238
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,840
So please,

239
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,240
kindly make way for them.

252
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,440
Last night, an unrest incident broke out

253
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,880
in the square of Assavadevathin.
[Clash Breaks Out in Assavadevathin]

254
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,600
A group of protesters
advocating for environmental issues

255
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,720
blocked the lantern procession,

256
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,560
resulting in clashes.

257
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,200
There have been no reported fatalities,

258
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,200
but over 20 individuals
sustained minor injuries.

259
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,600
The situation was brought under control
by Prince Khanin,

260
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,440
the heir to the Assavadevathin clan.

261
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,960
His Royal Highness
has since been widely regarded

262
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,920
as a symbol of change

263
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,400
and a new hope for the people.

264
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
How are you doing?

265
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,160
You ended up coming back with me anyway.

266
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,520
Your safety comes first, dear.

267
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
I know you're concerned
about the mining matter.

268
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,040
I've been trying to deal with it myself.

269
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,400
But in the end,

270
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,280
I realized I don't hold
as much power as I thought.

271
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,000
I wish to talk to His Majesty
about the mining matter.

272
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

273
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,680
It'd be better to wait
until His Majesty is fully recovered.

274
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,720
I've been kept
in the dark my entire life…

275
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,600
I could use some rest, too.

276
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,720
believing everything
your grandfather told me

277
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,520
without ever questioning it.

278
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,000
If you don't want to see
it face an economic crisis,

279
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,800
do as I say.

280
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,920
I never acted on my own,

281
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,560
and that's why
things have gotten this far.

282
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,120
You have all that power

283
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,600
but still can't fix this. Just leave!

284
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,000
Get out!

285
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,320
Even though I wish
I could change things now,

286
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,400
the truth is,

287
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,160
the power still rests with him.

288
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Not everything

289
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,160
may turn out the way we expected.

290
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,160
So, had you held greater power,

291
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,920
everything would have gone
more smoothly and swiftly, right?

292
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,080
If you wish to change Emmaly,

293
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,600
one way to do it

294
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,040
is to win the Competition.

295
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,720
I'll do my best to win.

296
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,880
You shouldn't have done that.

297
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,440
My intention was merely to assist you.

298
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,240
Why is that wrong?

299
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,800
I don't need your assistance.

300
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,720
You shouldn't have gotten involved.

301
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,360
All you need to do is
practice for the Competition.

302
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I know, Grandfather.

303
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,240
And I am going to win

304
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,800
so that I can gain the power
to make real change.

305
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,920
If you are going to do nothing,

306
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,560
I will step up and do it myself one day.

307
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,880
Anyone can say that,

308
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,120
but do you really have a solution?

309
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,600
You think it'll be over
just by doing what they ask?

310
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,640
Real change takes time.

311
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,320
It takes courage and determination.

312
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,240
Waiting to know everything
means no action will be taken.

313
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,200
If there's nothing else,

314
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,480
I shall take my leave.

315
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,120
The soldiers have begun
to track you down.

316
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,440
I need to be more cautious.

317
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
Do you think…

318
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,680
Prince Khanin saw you?

319
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,560
He did.

320
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,120
So, what's your plan?

321
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,040
I'll keep a low profile for a while.

322
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,880
He should focus on the Competition.

323
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,000
I don't want to be a distraction.

324
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,360
You are…

325
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,320
genuinely a good soul.

326
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,040
You saved the heir's life,

327
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,840
yet you're forced into hiding

328
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,680
and acting like you're dead.

329
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,480
They're trying to take you out for real.

330
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,720
I understand
the King's reasoning, though.

331
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,120
Khanin has to settle into Emmaly

332
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,200
and participate in the Competition.

333
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,280
I'd rather not be the reason
he loses focus.

334
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,800
Your generation…

335
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,320
is impressive, you know.

336
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,920
You understand everything.

337
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But…

338
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,960
if I were you,

339
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,160
I'd have exposed them by now.

340
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,880
Have you ever gone fishing?

341
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,800
If the fish is stronger than your line,

342
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,280
can you reel it in?

343
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
Or will it drag you into the water?

344
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,560
I'm not someone who gives up easily.

345
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,040
If it comes to that,

346
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,360
I'll pull it up

347
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
even if it kills me.

348
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,840
What if it's the biggest fish
in the sea?

349
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,760
Big enough to swallow any smaller fish

350
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,360
whenever it pleases.

351
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,440
How could you possibly beat that?

352
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,880
If the smaller fish all stand together

353
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,920
and refuse to be prey,

354
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,200
then no matter how huge it is,

355
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,000
that fish won't last forever.

356
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
Sit down.

357
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,080
You know Thatdanai is in Emmaly,
don't you?

358
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,360
I sent my people
to keep him under control,

359
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,680
but he got away.

360
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,480
Must I command you

361
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,800
to stay away
from anything involving him?

362
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,760
I'm afraid…

363
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,680
I can no longer hide the truth
about Mr. Thatdanai from Prince Khanin.

364
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,360
But I assure you,

365
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,040
they will meet
when the time is right, Your Majesty.

366
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,720
I've shown you nothing but leniency,

367
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,200
never once holding a grudge,
because you are my grandson.

368
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,840
But now, as the King of Emmaly,

369
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,920
I hereby command you
to cease all involvement with Thatdanai.

370
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

371
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
Your Royal Highness?

372
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,520
Why didn't you tell me
you'd already found my dad?

373
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,160
Was that a command?

374
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,480
From Grandfather?

375
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,920
I understand that seeing him now

376
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,440
might put him in danger.

377
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,040
But please, just tell me he's okay.

378
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,720
That's all I want to hear.

379
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,280
He is in Vedish's care.

380
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,080
You don't need to worry.

381
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,080
Thank you.

382
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,400
I trust you, Ran.

383
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,400
The first round

384
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,440
of the Competition

385
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,520
shall be a test of wit.

386
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,080
The committee under His Majesty
will prepare the challenge

387
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,760
and deliver it to the competitors
one day in advance.

388
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,960
The second round

389
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,720
will be an archery competition.

390
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,200
With your permission, Your Majesty,

391
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,360
I propose we follow
the traditional format

392
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,280
and hold the Competition in the forest.

393
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,080
Using technology from Davichmetha,

394
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,720
we can design targets
that transmit scores

395
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,560
directly to the judges in real time.

396
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,840
I agree, Your Majesty.

397
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,160
It would make the Competition
more exciting.

398
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,080
Given that Wasin has no heir,

399
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,360
I believe it would be fair

400
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,680
to let him oversee
the competition grounds

401
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,560
in Meenanagarin.

402
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,840
If it's acceptable to all,
I have no objections.

403
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,480
The final round of the Competition

404
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,800
will be a fencing competition.

405
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,760
The winning heir

406
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,560
will secure their father's position
as the next King.

407
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,880
Shall we take a short break,
Your Royal Highness?

408
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,680
I'm totally fine.

409
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Let's keep going.

410
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,760
Your next training session is archery.

411
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,040
This way, please.

412
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,440
Is something the matter, Father?

413
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,640
I've been fully briefed
on the details of the Competition.

414
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,240
Anyway,

415
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,440
I've already found
the right coach for you.

416
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,520
You'll start training
with your new coach tomorrow.

417
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,800
What happened exactly?

418
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,600
Stop asking so many questions.

419
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,280
Just do as I say.

420
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,960
Why do I need a new coach, though?

421
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,880
Mira might be helpful,

422
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,840
but she doesn't know everything.

423
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,440
A great coach

424
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,840
will give us the upper hand.

425
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,200
I've chosen what's best for you.

426
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,680
You're lying.
It's because she's a woman, isn't it?

427
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,440
Yeah.

428
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,200
If word gets out

429
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,760
that a woman is training you,

430
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,880
don't you think
those two clans will laugh at us?

431
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,360
I have two options for you, Father.

432
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,360
First,

433
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,840
let Mira be my coach.

434
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,000
Or second,

435
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,040
I withdraw
from the Competition entirely.

436
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,760
Why can't you just listen
to your father for once?

437
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,160
If that's all,

438
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
I may return to my training now.

439
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,120
I mean…

440
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,040
Follow me.

441
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,680
It looks like
something is bothering you.

442
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,360
Is it about Ava?

443
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,360
I'm totally at a loss.

444
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,120
If you don't mind me asking,

445
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,680
may I ask what happened?

446
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,640
Having a daughter as my heir
is already a challenge.

447
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,320
And now her coach is a woman, too.

448
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,280
I fear that if anyone finds out,

449
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,360
they might look down on us.

450
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,400
Well…

451
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,640
Don't be so concerned, Chana.

452
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,720
There's nothing wrong
with having a female coach

453
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,760
as long as she helps her improve
and gets along with her.

454
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,480
Besides,

455
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,840
Coach Mira has remarkable skills.

456
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,800
Finding a perfect coach like her

457
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,200
isn't easy at all.

458
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,080
Your Royal Highness,

459
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,040
I don't want you
to face any problems with Prince Chana.

460
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,040
You belong to me.

461
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,720
Ignore what others say.

462
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,120
Just listen to me.

463
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,320
But his command…

464
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,239
He still wants me to compete,

465
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,880
so I need my coach.

466
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,400
Let's keep going.

467
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,199
Let's call it a day.

468
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,719
Please forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

469
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,440
Gosh.

470
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
Do you really have to be this strict?

471
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,800
We have less than two weeks.

472
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,200
But my brain
can't handle any more of this.

473
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,280
Fine.

474
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,320
Then…

475
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,880
Shall I go find Mr. Charan for you?

476
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,680
Well,

477
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,720
then there might be
some space left in my brain.

478
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,640
Gosh.

479
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,920
There's something with that name, huh?

480
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,560
Alright, then.

481
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,440
I shall go find him

482
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,400
if you…

483
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,560
continue reading a couple more pages.

484
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,880
Don't try to mess with me, Chakri.

485
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,480
Oh…

486
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,840
Fine.

487
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,960
I'm glad

488
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,000
Ramil is putting more effort
into practicing than he used to.

489
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,840
It's probably because you are there
to cheer him on.

490
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,880
Since you know
what you're supposed to do,

491
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,120
you won't face any punishment.

492
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Let me help you.

493
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,040
The Competition is around the corner.

494
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,680
I want you to concentrate better, Nin.

495
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,200
I'm tired.

496
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
So tired that…

497
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,080
I can fall asleep
the moment I lay my head on a pillow.

498
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,520
In the Competition,

499
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,440
every clan has its heir at stake.

500
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,520
To claim the throne,

501
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,120
something must be sacrificed.

502
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,560
What if I want something else first?

503
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,960
That needs to wait, too.

504
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,080
- Argh!
- Your Royal Highness!

505
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,880
Does it hurt a lot?

506
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,640
You can give your all physically,

507
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,160
but without proper rest,
you're only harming yourself.

508
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,360
I have never seen you this way,
Your Royal Highness.

509
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,920
Please do take some rest.

510
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,280
If you drink too much, you'll struggle
to keep up with the training.

511
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,840
You told me to rest, didn't you?

512
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,280
But you've gone too far,
Your Royal Highness.

513
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,320
You don't understand me.

514
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,560
Isn't gender irrelevant in this matter?

515
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,520
I thought he stood up for me

516
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,280
because he understood me,

517
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,680
but actually,

518
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
he was protecting his own dignity.

519
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,600
Why was I born a woman?

520
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,960
No one can truly understand another,
Your Royal Highness.

521
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,000
Only you know yourself best.

522
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,920
You may not have chosen your gender,

523
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,840
yet you can become the best version
of yourself, Your Royal Highness.

524
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,880
Your skills have gotten better.

525
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,320
♫You've always been my only one, still♫

526
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,720
♫Since fate first brought us together♫

527
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,280
♫I've never forgotten
any of that, like never♫

528
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,640
♫Like fire in the rain,♫

529
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,240
♫We aren't meant for each other♫

530
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:02,080
♫I'm begging heaven and fate♫

531
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I had this book when I was in London.

532
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,880
It was on the shelf,

533
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,160
so I took it.

534
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,000
I get that we regained independence
thanks to the alliance

535
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,560
between the four clans.

536
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,320
But now that I'm actually here,

537
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,040
now that I've actually met
the royal family,

538
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,880
it's even harder to believe that…

539
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,760
the prince from the Bhuchongpisuts

540
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,680
would willingly give up his power

541
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,120
and hold the Royal Competition
for the crown.

542
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,680
It's understandable

543
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,360
that you feel this puzzle piece

544
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,920
doesn't quite fit.

545
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,040
After all, history depends
on who writes it.

546
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,200
Yeah,

547
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,000
you're right.

548
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Even if it's based on evidence,

549
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,800
in the end, it's a written narrative.

550
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,000
What you know is the official narrative.

551
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,720
But some versions say that the prince…

552
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,920
never intended to share his power
with anyone.

553
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,640
Obviously, with all that power.

554
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,640
When he was about to lose the war,

555
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,640
he reached out to the other clans
to strike a deal.

556
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,760
They agreed to join forces.

557
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,360
After that,

558
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,080
the Royal Fencing Competition
was established as a tradition.

559
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,320
My brain's drained.

560
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,520
Your hug makes me feel so much better.

561
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,040
[Has that prince done something?
He said he'd help us!]

562
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,600
[If the prince won't take a stand,
we'll all struggle]

563
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,160
[If the mine shuts down,
my dad will lose his job]

564
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,720
[We are suffering;
how can you even sleep?]

565
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,560
[Justice for the miners!]

566
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,000
[#JusticeForMiners]

567
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,440
Your voices are heard.

568
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,400
Given the urgency,

569
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,560
the issue should be handled
temporarily first.

570
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,040
I will figure out

571
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,840
how to reduce dust pollution.

572
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,680
[Just get out if you can't fix it]

573
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,520
[What happens to the miners
if the prince says no to the mine?]

574
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,360
[The mine feeds us]

575
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,200
[I think he's working on it;
let's be patient]

576
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,040
[Prince Khanin, stand with the miners!]

577
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,000
You were just a child,
so you probably don't remember,

578
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,880
but I have never
once forgotten that moment.

579
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,080
Are you okay?

580
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,720
Yeah.

581
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,680
The truth remains the truth.

582
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,160
I hope you understand
that what happened in the past

583
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,360
has nothing to do with him.

584
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,240
I know.

585
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,440
I appreciate you telling me the truth.

586
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,960
We'll talk later.

587
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,720
Don't worry too much, Ran.

588
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,400
Talk to you later.

589
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,040
Yeah.

590
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,160
Nin?

591
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,360
Is everything alright?

592
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,280
Is that Dyrane?

593
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,400
It's very late now.

594
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,160
Why are you here?

595
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,000
I missed you; that's why.

596
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,960
Actually,

597
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,200
I would like you
to paint a portrait of me.

598
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,320
You'd better go to bed now, Nin.

599
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,000
I could do that,

600
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,200
but I'd do it here.

601
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,040
I'm feeling stressed,

602
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,280
and I need something to help me unwind.

603
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,400
Well…

604
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,400
Nin…

605
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,440
Has anyone told you…

606
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,880
that when you're relaxed,

607
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,640
you're cuter
than when you're all serious?

608
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,600
Alright, I'll stop.

609
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,320
But I really meant it when I said…

610
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,840
I wanted you to paint my portrait.

611
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,000
♫Amidst the stars so bright,♫

612
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,560
Sit here. Let me sketch you.

613
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,000
♫It's you and I,♫

614
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:36,920
♫Our hearts no longer
drift alone tonight♫

615
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,760
How about this?
♫Seeing you're here,♫

616
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,520
♫Hearing your heartbeat near,♫

617
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:56,520
♫That's what I want to hold so dear♫

618
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,920
♫Forever, year after year♫

619
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:09,400
♫From now on, I'll let my heart decide♫

620
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:16,640
♫If the world won't take our side,♫

621
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:23,920
♫I'll leave their voices far behind♫

622
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:31,000
♫From now on, it's you and I♫

623
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,040
What kind of expression should I go for?

624
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,640
The expression…

625
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,080
of someone gazing at their beloved.

626
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,360
Ran…

627
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,120
Do you like me?

628
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,480
Do you like me as much as I like you?

629
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,680
You haven't painted it yet.

630
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,080
How about doing it on me?

631
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,160
Right here.

632
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,720
And here, too.

633
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:38,960
Nin…

634
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,680
Are you nervous?

635
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,480
Good boy.

636
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:22,640
Finally, it's time for the first round
of the Royal Competition.

637
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:26,240
I have faith that
once the Royal Competition concludes,

638
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,800
Khanin will bring the throne to Tharin.

639
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,320
Don't get too worked up.

640
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,960
Just stick to what you've learned.

641
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:36,120
You must do whatever it takes
to win this Competition.

642
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,440
It could be quite risky,
Your Royal Highness.

643
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,720
I don't care, okay?

644
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:42,600
I hereby declare
the Royal Competition of Emmaly

645
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,800
officially open.

646
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,080
The competitor with the most votes is…

647
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,960
♫Let love be our guide,♫

648
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,680
