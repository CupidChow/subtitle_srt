1
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,720
Hey, Kang Ian.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,140
I feel bad even asking if you're okay.

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,350
Wasn't that senior, Juhyeok, way out of line yesterday?

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,480
I don't know.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,900
When he was Alt, he seemed like such a good person.

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,610
I saw him briefly yesterday.

7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,990
His vibe was completely different from the Alt you knew.

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,740
You must have been so shocked.

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,490
Yesterday, when I was about to leave suddenly,

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,870
he grabbed me...

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,580
I felt my whole body freeze up.

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,460
He's insane, really.

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,080
I mean, how could he just touch you like that?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,590
He looked at me so coldly and said we needed to talk.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,010
It just...

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,010
It felt like he was mocking me.

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,850
It was so scary...

18
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,940
and suffocating.

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,230
He was 100% in the wrong for that.

20
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,780
There's no excuse.

21
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,650
Hey, Kang Ian.

22
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,780
For the time being, don't run into that senior.

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,200
If you can avoid him, you absolutely should.

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,700
Okay?

25
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,670
You're him, right?

26
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,680
I'm Han Jisu, Ian's friend.

27
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,840
I heard from Ian.

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,220
That you were Alt.

29
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,430
And I know how much pain he's in.

30
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,480
Right.

31
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,640
So you're Jisu.

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,560
Ian's having a hard time, isn't he.

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,520
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,360
It's more than just "a hard time."

35
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,070
He can't even eat or sleep properly.

36
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,240
Because of you.

37
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,690
Sunbae.

38
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,110
What you did to Ian...

39
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,860
Was that really the best you could do?

40
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,410
Why did you have to go that far?

41
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,620
I know.

42
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,910
I know I hurt Ian.

43
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,420
But I don't regret it.

44
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,790
The time I spent by Ian's side as Alt, and...

45
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,260
meeting him yesterday... all of it.

46
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,920
In those moments, my feelings were genuine.

47
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,180
What did you say?

48
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,090
You don't regret it?

49
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,260
Are you out of your mind right now?

50
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:22,930
Ian is so...

51
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,520
Knowing Ian is hurting because of me is tearing me apart, too.

52
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,560
But what my true feelings are,

53
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,890
and what I really meant,

54
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,940
I believe that someday he'll understand.

55
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,150
No...

56
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,900
I want to believe it.

57
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,280
Wait a minute, Sunbae.

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,820
Don't think you can just walk away like this.

59
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,620
Ian...

60
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,870
Even though his mind is a mess, in a corner of his heart,

61
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,830
I can see that he wants to hear you out.

62
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,710
Even after being so shocked,

63
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,960
he told me he felt like the things Alt said were sincere.

64
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,840
Foolishly.

65
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,380
Really?

66
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,180
Ian said that?

67
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,930
That he felt like the things I said were sincere?

68
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,390
Yes.

69
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,770
So don't let this chance slip away.

70
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,140
If you're sincere, then go and tell him properly.

71
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,520
You have to make your own opportunities.

72
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,150
Are you just going to do nothing and give up?

73
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,820
After all the pain you've caused Ian, you're just going to let it end like this?

74
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,280
You're right.

75
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,490
I started this,

76
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,950
so I have to take responsibility for it.

77
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,350
Let's talk, Ian.

78
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,480
What more is there to say?

79
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,310
Your completely different words and actions...

80
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,690
Isn't that enough?

81
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,230
It's not enough.

82
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,400
Why I did it,

83
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,820
and why I approached you pretending to be Alt...

84
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,700
I came because I felt I had to explain properly.

85
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,120
An explanation?

86
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,120
What was I to you?

87
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,460
Just some toy to play with when you were bored?

88
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,670
I never thought of you as a toy.

89
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,540
Not even once.

90
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,590
On the contrary, you looked like you were in so much pain...

91
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,300
I just wanted to help you.

92
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,760
Ever since I first read your writing, I couldn't get you out of my mind.

93
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,400
But in real life, I didn't even have the courage to approach you.

94
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,690
So even if it meant hiding behind the name Alt,

95
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,730
I wanted to be by your side.

96
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,110
The things you said as Alt...

97
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,660
Were they all sincere?

98
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,450
When you comforted me, encouraged me, told me to hang in there...

99
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,490
Was all of that genuine?

100
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,410
Or was that all an act, too?

101
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,670
It was all sincere.

102
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,380
There wasn't a single lie.

103
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,550
I wanted to help you in any way I could,

104
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,510
and to see you smile again...

105
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,760
I genuinely wanted that.

106
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,010
That was my only wish.

107
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,180
Then why were you so cold in person?

108
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,680
You're so different.

109
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,350
The Juhyeok-sunbae I know is...

110
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,560
Because that's the real me.

111
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,020
I'm clumsy at dealing with people,

112
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,440
and I find it hard to express my feelings.

113
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,650
Especially in front of you, I don't know what to do,

114
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,160
so I unconsciously put up a wall.

115
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,780
When I was Alt, because you didn't know who I was,

116
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,530
I could just be honest.

117
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,960
Because I was wearing a mask.

118
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,000
Then why did you try to approach me?

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,300
Going to such lengths...

120
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,670
Alt is me,

121
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,510
and this flawed, awkward person in front of you is also me.

122
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,680
I wanted you to know that.

123
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,440
Ian.

124
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,940
Could you please try to see me for who I really am?

125
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:10,320
Not the person hiding behind Alt...

126
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,950
but just me.

127
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,330
Wait, Ian.

128
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,710
Why I did it,

129
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,840
what I'm truly feeling... it's...

130
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,670
I can't explain it all with just words.

131
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,840
Just...

132
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,940
What is this?

133
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,860
This was my beginning, Ian.

134
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,070
The beginning of everything related to you.
