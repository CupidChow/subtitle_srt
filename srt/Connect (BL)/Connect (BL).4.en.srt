1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,340
Ta-da!

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,840
Don't overdo it. Why don't you take a break?

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,970
Here, drink some.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,050
Thanks.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:18,010
My sugar levels were starting to drop.

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:21,980
This is nice.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,650
You've seemed a bit down lately.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,900
Is something wrong?

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,190
You can talk to me. It's okay.

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,150
I might not be able to help, but I can listen.

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,160
Honestly, with graduation coming up,

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,290
and having to manage my GPA and portfolio...

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,450
It's just crazy.

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,420
Sorry you have to see me like this.

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,960
Don't apologize.

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,420
Don't worry about me. You need to take care of yourself first.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,550
You always give me strength.

18
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,260
Just being here with you, looking at your face...

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,390
It's strange, but my cluttered thoughts just clear up.

20
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,060
I feel like I can finally breathe.

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,400
The comfort I felt when I was Alt before...

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,610
This is even better.

23
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,360
Because you're right here next to me.

24
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,200
I feel the same way.

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,120
It's comforting and I'm happy when you're by my side.

26
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,750
Is there anything I can help you with?

27
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,170
I don't know much about coding,

28
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,920
but maybe I can help with research or proofreading?

29
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,340
That's okay. Your offer is more than enough.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,220
Just stay by my side.

31
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,260
Like this.

32
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,720
That alone gives me so much strength.

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,810
Seriously.

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,320
There you go.

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,700
You two are practically dripping with honey.

36
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,860
I guess my job here is done.

37
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,660
Hey, Kang Yi-an!

38
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,840
Hey, did you finish the research for our presentation next week?

39
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,710
The professor said it's a tough one.

40
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,640
Hello, senior!

41
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,310
I heard you were super busy.

42
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,390
It's hard to catch you.

43
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,400
You two seem to have a great vibe going on.

44
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,900
Whoa!

45
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,780
Since when?

46
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,530
What am I seeing right now?

47
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,360
Awesome!

48
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,990
Congrats!

49
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,030
Congrats!

50
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,120
I knew this would happen.

51
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,240
The two of you are just so sweet.

52
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,870
Senior, isn't Yi-an's hand so warm?

53
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,830
Right?

54
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,460
You must be tired from staying up all night,

55
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,380
but holding Yi-an's hand makes the fatigue disappear.

56
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,000
Hey, stop teasing him.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,340
Huh?

58
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,920
I'm sorry, but Yi-an and I have somewhere to go.

59
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,970
How about I help you with the assignment tomorrow?

60
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,970
I'm faster at finding research materials, anyway.

61
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,520
And yes, Yi-an's hand is incredibly warm.

62
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,650
It really feels like my fatigue just disappears.

63
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,810
More than that, even.

64
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,940
Senior...

65
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,690
Aren't you being a little too sneaky?

66
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,490
Alright, fine.

67
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,780
I won't interrupt your sweet time together.

68
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,330
I'll just politely excuse myself.

69
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,500
You have to give me all the details later.

70
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,160
Text me.

71
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,340
What was that?

72
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,170
Your senior is just being honest.

73
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,590
Why?

74
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,930
I like it.

75
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,890
I want everyone to know.

76
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,930
That Yi-an is my person.

77
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,430
I can show it off, right?

78
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,020
And your hand really is warm.

79
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,230
It feels like it's warming my heart.

80
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,900
Thanks to you, I can work hard again today.

81
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,040
The first day I met you as Alt...

82
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,540
No.

83
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,590
The day you found out I was Alt...

84
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,800
I was so anxious and scared

85
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
that you'd run away and I'd never see you again.

86
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,180
My heart still sinks when I think about that day.

87
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,220
It still makes me nervous.

88
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,270
I felt so betrayed that you lied to me.

89
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,980
I felt so betrayed.

90
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,020
Honestly, if you hadn't come to me,

91
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,900
I don't think we would have ended up like this.

92
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,530
Your eyes were just so desperate back then.

93
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,280
Thinking about it now makes me mad.

94
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:55,670
I'm so sorry about that.

95
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,960
I think I was just too focused on my own feelings and hurt you more.

96
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,050
And thank you.

97
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,680
For understanding me, even like this,

98
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,140
and for letting me be by your side.

99
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,520
It still feels like a dream that you're here next to me.

100
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,600
I have to check every morning when I wake up.

101
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,730
Thank you, too.

102
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,360
For listening to me and always comforting me.

103
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,580
And for being by my side as your true self.

104
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,750
Senior...

105
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,460
You're so important to me.

106
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,290
Yi-an.

107
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,090
I like you so much.

108
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,670
No, I love you.

109
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,720
I'm going to love only you, honestly, to the ends of the earth.

110
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,220
I want to fill all my time with you.

111
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,310
Me too.

112
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,270
Senior.

113
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,070
I love you.

114
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,200
I want to stay with you a little longer.

115
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,620
Me too, Ju-hyeok.

116
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,930
It really feels like a dream, Yi-an.

117
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,560
That you're here with me like this.

118
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,770
Me too, senior.

119
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:45,270
I'm so happy.
