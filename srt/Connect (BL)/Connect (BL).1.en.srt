1
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,540
Every day, the same view.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,960
The same weight.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,840
In this suffocating cycle of reality,

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,300
perhaps the only thing that keeps me going...

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,090
...is from someone whose face,

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,180
voice,

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,560
and even name I don't know.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,270
Just a few lines of their messages.

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,520
That warmth felt like my only breathing space.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,320
Alt, how was your day?

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,740
I feel like I'm still stuck in the same place.

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,490
The new company I applied to said they'd contact me, but they never did.

13
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,870
I guess nothing ever works out for me.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,500
Am I whining again?

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,910
Ah, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,920
I'm just rambling on about my problems again, aren't I?

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,340
You must be tired too, Alt. Please don't mind me.

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,010
What's there to be sorry about?

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,800
You can always talk to me like this.

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,590
And don't be so quick to say it's hopeless.

21
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,300
It's not your fault.

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,970
I'm sure things will turn out well.

23
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,180
Thank you, always.

24
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,810
Without you, Alt, I don't know how I would've made it through.

25
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,860
To me, you're like a lighthouse in a dark sea.

26
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,820
A lighthouse? Don't be silly.

27
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,610
I get strength from talking to you, too.

28
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,070
That's what we are to each other.

29
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,080
Hey, Alt...

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,450
Do you think... maybe we could meet?

31
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,500
I want to hear your voice.

32
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,830
And see your face.

33
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,120
If you're not comfortable with it, it's okay to say no.

34
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,340
I must be crazy.

35
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,840
I just asked Alt to meet.

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,680
What should I do?

37
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,480
What's up? Calling at this hour?

38
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,610
Jisoo, I just asked Alt to meet me.

39
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,450
What? For real?

40
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,740
Hey, Kang Ian, you've finally gone and done it.

41
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,830
So?

42
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,200
What did they say?

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,830
Did you get a reply?

44
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,960
No, I'm still waiting...

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,920
Do you think it'll be okay?

46
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,790
Now that I've actually sent it, I'm scared.

47
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,920
There are no photos.

48
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,300
I don't know anything about them.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,630
What if some weirdo shows up?

50
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,640
Hey, if you set a time and place, send it to me right away.

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,010
I'll wait nearby and...

52
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,760
discreetly check them out for you.

53
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,970
If I get a weird vibe, I'll step in immediately.

54
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,350
Really?

55
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,560
You'd really come?

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,810
But it must be a hassle for you.

57
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,770
Of course.

58
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,190
I'll protect my friend, so don't you worry.

59
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:34,940
And besides,

60
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,280
I'm a little curious about this "Alt" person myself.

61
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,780
So don't freak out.

62
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,660
Share the reply with me as soon as you get it, okay?

63
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,330
Yeah. Okay.

64
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,870
Thanks, Jisoo. I'll call you.

65
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,590
You want to meet...

66
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,090
I don't know. You'll probably be disappointed if you see me in person.

67
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,300
I won't be disappointed.

68
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,760
I just want to meet you, Alt. The person.

69
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,020
The one who always genuinely listened to my stories and comforted me.

70
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,350
The real Alt.

71
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,310
Are you sure you won't regret it?

72
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,560
No matter what I look like?

73
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,740
By any chance, are you a student at our university?

74
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,530
Yes, I am.

75
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,820
I think I mentioned it in passing before.

76
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,160
Then it'll be a bit easier to set up a meeting.

77
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,450
Okay.

78
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,160
Let's meet tomorrow at 5 PM, at the bench in front of our university's main gate.

79
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,210
I'll wear a white t-shirt to make it easy to spot me.

80
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,050
Okay. I understand.

81
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,260
I'll definitely be there.

82
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,260
See you tomorrow.

83
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,980
This should be okay, right?

84
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,690
Is it too obvious I tried to look good?

85
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,150
No, it's fine. Alt is probably curious about me too.

86
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,370
To think they were from the same university...

87
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,830
Could it be someone I know?

88
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,120
Nah, no way.

89
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,170
There's no way someone that warm could be in my life.

90
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,050
Of all people, why is Juhyeok-sunbae sitting here?

91
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,720
Just pretend I don't see him.

92
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,140
Alt said they'd be wearing a white t-shirt.

93
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,060
What are you doing here?

94
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,600
Huh?

95
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,770
Looks like you're waiting for someone.

96
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,440
I'm waiting for a friend.

97
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,660
A friend?

98
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,700
By any chance...

99
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,790
A guy in a white t-shirt?

100
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,460
How did you know that...

101
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,920
Don't tell me...

102
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,380
It's me.

103
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,710
Alt.

104
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,300
You're kidding, right?

105
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,930
Sunbae, you're Alt?

106
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,060
Yeah.

107
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,810
That's right.

108
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:13,980
I'm Alt.

109
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:24,030
Then... you've been deceiving me from the start?

110
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,530
I knew everything from the beginning.

111
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,740
Who you were.

112
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,410
And your situation. All of it.

113
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,120
I'm leaving.

114
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,710
Wait, Ian.

115
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,210
Let's just talk.

116
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,000
It might not be what you think.

117
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,130
I'm serious, Ian.

118
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,510
What's different?

119
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,890
Sunbae, you deceived me from the very beginning.

120
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:56,270
Even though you knew how much I relied on you!

121
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,230
Was it fun?

122
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,780
Was it fun listening to all my struggles?

123
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,950
No. It was never fun.

124
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,240
Not for a single moment.

125
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,370
If anything...

126
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,040
every moment felt like I was walking on a tightrope.

127
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Afraid that you would find out.

128
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,330
Afraid that you would get hurt.

129
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,220
I don't know anymore.

130
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,390
Not you, Sunbae...

131
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,640
or Alt.

132
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,150
Just... please leave me alone.

133
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,160
Huh?

134
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,040
Ian.

135
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,500
What's wrong?

136
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,790
What happened?

137
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,750
Jisoo...

138
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,710
What do I do?

139
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,800
That person... it was Juhyeok-sunbae.

140
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,680
He knew everything about me.
