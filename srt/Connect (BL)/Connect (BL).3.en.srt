1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,250
I couldn't bring myself to face him.

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,420
I had no idea what to say if I saw his face,

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,350
or what expression I should make.

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,520
Between Alt's warmth and Joohyuk-sunbae's coldness,

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,650
I felt lost.

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:36,070
How can I untangle this complicated mess?

7
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,490
I feel like I'm the one who ruined everything.

8
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,620
Hey, Kang Ian.

9
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,710
What's with your face?

10
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,420
Did you cry again?

11
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,420
I heard you met that senior.

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,590
What happened?

13
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,010
Well... sunbae showed me a photo.

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,930
A photo?

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,010
What photo, all of a sudden?

16
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:58,470
Why?

17
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,680
Last spring, when I was at my lowest point...

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,850
...it was me, crying alone under a cherry blossom tree.

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,480
What?

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,310
Wait a minute. That's insane.

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,650
What? So he's been watching you for a while then?

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,480
Creepy.

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,320
So what did he say when he showed it to you?

24
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,950
He said that was the beginning.

25
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,080
For him, about me.

26
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,240
Seriously?

27
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,950
Joohyuk-sunbae is really something else.

28
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,540
What do you think?

29
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,330
I don't know either.

30
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,000
As Alt, he was such a warm person.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,880
But the Joohyuk-sunbae I know is so cold.

32
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,970
And that...

33
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:47,480
It feels like he's being sincere, but at the same time, it doesn't.

34
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,440
It's true that Joohyuk-sunbae did something wrong,

35
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,360
but don't you think he might have had a reason?

36
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,200
Something he couldn't bring himself to tell you.

37
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,780
If he wanted to hold onto you so much that he'd even show his deepest self...

38
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,370
...why don't you try hearing him out completely, just this once?

39
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,660
That's what's been bothering me, too.

40
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,210
His words, actions, the photo... it all seemed so real.

41
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:15,170
But I'm scared he'll lie to me again.

42
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,840
I don't know if I can trust him.

43
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,110
Hello?

44
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,780
Sunbae. It's Ian.

45
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,910
Yeah. I have your number.

46
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,830
I kept thinking about the photo you showed me.

47
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,290
And the things you said as Alt, too.

48
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,130
I don't know which one is the real you.

49
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,090
They're both me, Ian.

50
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,970
The clumsy part of me that acted cold to you, that's me.

51
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,430
And the part that wanted to be by your side as Alt, that's me, too.

52
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,100
I won't ask you to trust me.

53
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,890
I just hope you'll understand.

54
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,390
Why was it me?

55
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,230
There are so many struggling people in the world.

56
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,520
You just stood out to me.

57
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,570
The way you tried to act like you were okay...

58
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,780
...you looked so vulnerable.

59
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,450
Without realizing it, I found myself keep looking at you,

60
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,870
and before I knew it,

61
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,120
I was reading every single one of your posts.

62
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,790
And in doing so, I was being comforted by you, too.

63
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,330
Can we meet?

64
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,210
What?

65
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,710
I just want to see you and talk properly, face-to-face.

66
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,510
Uh, okay.

67
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,130
When and where should we meet?

68
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,470
I'll go wherever you're comfortable.

69
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,640
Tomorrow at 5.

70
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,890
Let's meet at the terrace of that café we were at before.

71
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,230
Okay. I'll definitely be there.

72
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,660
Sunbae.

73
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,030
Yeah.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,630
To be honest, I'm still not okay with it.

75
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,250
I'm still confused.

76
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,800
It's not something I can get over easily.

77
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,180
Maybe I was so lost in the fantasy of "Alt"

78
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,560
that I didn't try to see you for who you really are.

79
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,020
I might have even been trying to ignore it.

80
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:44,240
So please, show me the real you.

81
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,070
Even if you're blunt and clumsy...

82
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,490
...and prickly, that's okay.

83
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,790
I want to get to know you properly now.

84
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,710
You, sunbae. Not Alt.

85
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,840
Can we start over?

86
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,010
I never thought you'd say that.

87
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,380
I know how hurt you must have been.

88
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,930
Are you really giving someone like me a chance right now?

89
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,560
To me, Alt was...

90
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,520
...like the only way I could breathe.

91
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,990
If it weren't for you, I might have suffocated to death.

92
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,910
And now I know...

93
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,450
...that you were struggling all alone, too.

94
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,500
So from now on, please stay by my side for real.

95
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,130
It would be nice if we could become each other's reason to breathe.

96
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,010
Slowly, again.

97
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,890
Thank you, Ian.

98
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,720
Thank you for truly understanding everything I said.

99
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,860
I will never hide behind my feelings again.

100
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,570
Wait a second.

101
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,330
Sorry.

102
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,490
I was too...

103
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:21,170
No, it's not that. We're just moving a little too fast.

104
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:25,960
Ah, you're right.

105
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,970
It is fast. Sorry.

106
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,010
I was just so happy, I got carried away.

107
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,390
Idiot.
