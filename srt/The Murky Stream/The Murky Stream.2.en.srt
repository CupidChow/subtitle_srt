1
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,685
Whoa!

2
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,812
Try to dodge this.

3
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:57,933
Stay back.

4
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,935
You're all useless.

5
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,188
Can't even teach one laborer a lesson.

6
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,708
Brother, are you all right?

7
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:30,007
- You're gonna regret that.
- You're making a fool of yourself.

8
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,383
Just let it go.

9
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,921
My wage.

10
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,382
Hand it over.

11
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,925
They didn't pay us either.

12
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,303
Strike the petition drum if you want.

13
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,555
You want to die over one doe of rice?

14
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,349
Do it.

15
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:24,519
Do it!

16
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,446
If I find out this is all a lie,

17
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,199
you're as good as dead.

18
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:46,208
The Murky Stream

19
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,796
TWO. THE WIND THAT STIRS IN MAPO

20
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,720
- What now, brother?
- What?

21
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,430
Huh? What about the boat charge

22
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:04,101
- and labor charge we pocketed?
- Will you shut it?

23
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,853
They'll catch us.
And we'll be in big trouble.

24
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,272
- Don't you think so?
- I said shut it.

25
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,733
A little risk isn't worth the reward? Huh?

26
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,695
Let's go!

27
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,698
You're going?
All of them got injured, though.

28
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,450
It's hardship, so what?

29
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,202
We're bandits. We turn our backs.

30
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,664
I gotta piss.

31
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,418
Be careful as you carry that.

32
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,463
How dare you?
Where do you think you are?

33
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,638
Stop!

34
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:46,685
What do you want?

35
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,189
I'm here to collect my wages from you.

36
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,608
What are you saying?

37
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,530
No one received their wages
after the lady here went boating.

38
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,617
We merchants pay right away.
We don't make deals on credit.

39
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,454
But even so, no one was given payment.

40
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,247
One side says that they gave it.

41
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,000
The other side says
they never received it.

42
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,044
So, tell me, to whom do I enquire
to receive my wage?

43
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,422
I see you haven't had enough.

44
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,219
We said that we paid you all.

45
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,140
The Mapo bandits are likely at fault.
Talk to that lot.

46
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,476
Someone ordered our work.

47
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,356
Yet no one claims responsibility
for our payment.

48
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,525
"It's not me. Go ask them."

49
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,028
"And it wasn't us either.
Go ask again."

50
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,406
We work ourselves to death
for just one doe of rice.

51
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,826
How long will you have us
dancing around in circles?

52
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,037
I've heard enough out of you, young man.

53
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,039
We are not the ones who pocketed it.

54
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,333
How dare you cause a scene?

55
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,876
Chief Kang!

56
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,838
- What do you think you're doing?
- Are you all right?

57
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,842
You didn't say a word to those bandits.

58
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,514
But women are easier
to pick on, aren't they?

59
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,939
Here... Exchange this,
and you'll get one mal of rice at least.

60
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,691
I don't need your charity.

61
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,693
This is my wage.

62
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,987
Can't you be courteous?

63
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,866
Are you truly asking
for trouble right now?

64
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,538
Take it with you and leave.

65
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,209
How can you treat us this way?

66
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,087
It's like we're animals.

67
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,884
Do you think you can just use your money
to bribe us and order us around?

68
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,724
Well, that isn't usually
how I treat people,

69
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,185
but you seem to deserve it.

70
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,857
You've proven you'd punch anyone
for a little money.

71
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,070
Try starving for three days...

72
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,534
for a single doe of rice.

73
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,247
You'd be willing to untie
your pretty sash.

74
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,542
Really?

75
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,341
Then I dare you...

76
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:26,887
untie it.

77
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:30,849
What's wrong?

78
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,769
You're reckless, but not brave enough?

79
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,065
Halt.

80
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,206
Don't be so impolite to the lady.

81
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,835
Perhaps it's time
somebody taught you a lesson?

82
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,423
It isn't worth starting a fight.

83
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,676
That's enough. Follow me.

84
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,453
This is my share.

85
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,122
I'll give the rest to the other laborers.

86
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,211
- What's taking so long?
- He's coming.

87
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,463
What did she say?

88
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,131
So... so what did you find out?

89
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,591
Huh? Tell us.

90
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,427
- Say something.
- This is our wage from the guild.

91
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,183
Hey, hey.

92
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,519
I got it. I got it.

93
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,522
- Are you all right?
- Are you positive you paid the wages?

94
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,400
Of course.

95
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,026
Someone must have taken it.

96
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,486
Damn you.

97
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,447
Give it to me.

98
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,116
That's Mapo for you.

99
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,703
Some drifter did this to you?

100
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,123
And I'm ashamed of it.

101
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,499
That why you didn't tell me?

102
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,253
If we're crushed,
isn't it our law to never admit to it?

103
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,880
Hey,

104
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,552
if you were going to fight alone,
what was the point of joining the clan?

105
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,346
Huh?

106
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,224
No matter how strong a Tiger is,

107
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,768
it cannot fight
a pack of wolves on its own.

108
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,646
I'll keep that in mind, brother.

109
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,731
Huh.

110
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,569
Interesting.

111
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,030
You want to work out of Joseon?

112
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:55,076
I heard, you know, martial arts
and were a general of a Jurchen Tribe.

113
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,247
But with five men alone,
you can't take the Gyeonggang River.

114
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,375
You would be dealing with violent thugs.

115
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,544
Do you not think this is foolish?

116
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,713
That's why I'm here asking you to help me.

117
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,884
You must help me, too, then.
It's only fair.

118
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,385
Of course I will.

119
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,804
Otherwise you wouldn't agree.

120
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,140
Look at this.

121
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,517
It's a map of the Hanyang area.

122
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,396
The Gyeonggang River
is surrounded by the sea.

123
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,607
It's convenient
for reaching other regions.

124
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,359
If you're willing to look outward,

125
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,071
then your profits could be
greater than you ever imagined.

126
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,615
So smuggling is your idea.

127
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,496
If I take over the Gyeonggang River,

128
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,166
half of the profit
will be returned to you.

129
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,754
Listen well.

130
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,880
Hmm.

131
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,549
Your strength doesn't matter here.

132
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,552
If you disobey the law, it's over.

133
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,931
This country belongs to His Majesty.

134
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,476
And don't forget,
His Majesty is always watching.

135
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,357
Choi Jeongyeop.
He is not suitable.

136
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,275
What are you going to do now?

137
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,862
I need to find someone greedier
and more powerful.

138
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,243
Do you truly mean to build
a new foundation on this land?

139
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,869
Now is the time.

140
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,499
I cannot let my brothers and my children
live as subjects of Mongol.

141
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,918
I would rather die than see that happen.

142
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:31,589
Will I be able to live
with my child and my wife?

143
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,679
Of course.

144
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:42,851
For their sake,
we must take over the Gyeonggang River.

145
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,564
Brother.

146
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,776
Oh, shit.

147
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,820
This is not good.

148
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,655
What?

149
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,616
Yoon said he wants to have
a chat with you right now.

150
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,660
- What for?
- Ah, it's the money we pocketed

151
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,245
from the boat and all the labor.

152
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,165
- Yeah?
- Ahh! Malbok was talking about it

153
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,958
while taking a piss
and he got caught.

154
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,960
What a damn idiot.

155
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,422
- That damn babbler!
- We're in trouble.

156
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,966
Everybody knows
that Yoon's temper is really bad.

157
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,801
What do we do now?

158
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,511
Why are you asking me?

159
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,014
I think we're both going
to end up dead today.

160
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,611
Line up in order of seniority,
and start from there.

161
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,863
Right there, yes. Yes.

162
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,032
That's right.

163
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,996
There are some things
you can and cannot pocket,

164
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,248
and yet you pocketed the laborer's wages.

165
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,375
I apologize.

166
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,002
Excuse me.

167
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,922
I think this is
all a misunderstanding.

168
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,340
Please, keep on talking.

169
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,637
Hey, you're up first.

170
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,723
Yes, sir.

171
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,186
It'll go up by seniority.

172
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,236
- I swear I'll be better.
- All right. Next. Come on.

173
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,863
Oh, no. Oh, no.

174
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,449
What? You feeling sick?

175
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,659
Get down.

176
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,675
The hell is wrong with you?
You're up next.

177
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,468
Now, come on.

178
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,471
- Uh, boss, about my backdoor.
- What's wrong?

179
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,015
- It gets kind of sensitive there.
- I'll just poke it.

180
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,059
- No. Oh, no.
- Or I can beat it. You choose.

181
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,686
- Go! Stand there.
- No, no. Don't.

182
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,980
- Yeah, that's good.
- Wait.

183
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,737
Forgive me.

184
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,282
Back in line. Next.

185
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,126
Want me to hit your arm instead, huh?

186
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,558
Stop, please.

187
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,603
Why, why, why?

188
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,189
Come on.

189
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,694
Brother, your turn.

190
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,157
What are you waiting for?
Hurry and get over here.

191
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,742
- Come here now.
- Yoon.

192
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,243
Yes, boss?

193
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,248
That'll do for now.

194
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,178
What the hell are you smiling at?

195
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,472
I'm sorry. I was in such a rush.

196
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,767
I meant to let you know much sooner.

197
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,061
Is that so?

198
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,313
My actions were very wrong.

199
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,607
I'll reflect on myself.

200
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,942
Stand straighter. Chest out.

201
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,361
Uh, brother, wait.

202
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,949
Do you have to do this
with the young ones watching?

203
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,118
Yeah, they should see this.

204
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,622
I helped you when you begged
on the streets.

205
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,373
You remember that.

206
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,668
- I appreciate it.
- Yeah.

207
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,964
Stand up straight.
Shoulders up now, like a man.

208
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,633
Huh?

209
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:48,888
Square your shoulders. Like that, good.

210
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,186
Why did you do that
when you knew better?

211
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,272
Why disappoint me?

212
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,736
From now on,
I... I won't disappoint you again.

213
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,031
That will do.
Open up your shoulders again.

214
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,284
Stand up straight.

215
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,994
Yoon.

216
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,414
I said that'll do.

217
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,171
Fucking bastard!

218
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,966
How can I respect you
when you don't act your age, huh?

219
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,469
You're not worth the time and energy,
but you never shut up.

220
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,938
If you try something like this again,

221
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,690
- Okay.
- I don't care how old you are,

222
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,733
- I'm gonna lose it.
- Understood.

223
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,570
If it hadn't been
for Brother Deokgae interrupting us,

224
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,696
you'd be in a coffin.

225
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,447
Now, fuck off.

226
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,035
First one back is spared!

227
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,037
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

228
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,681
Brother!

229
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,233
Out of my way!

230
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,041
Mudeok.

231
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,585
Yes?

232
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,338
Come here. Have a drink.

233
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,466
No, thank you. I'm all right.

234
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,176
Take it.

235
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,761
Huh?

236
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,650
You don't have to kneel.

237
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,111
Oh, I'm comfortable. Thank you.

238
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,824
Are you all right?

239
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,119
- Oh, yes.
- Then drink.

240
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,414
A... All right.

241
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,716
Would you allow me
to pour you a drink?

242
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,303
Don't call me boss here.

243
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,763
We're friends.

244
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,476
Just Deokgae is fine.

245
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,103
Oh, no, boss.

246
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,732
Relax. It's just us.

247
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,279
You fool.

248
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,373
Boss.

249
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,418
I really do think
this was all a misunderstanding.

250
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,627
Mudeok, look.

251
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,629
Yes?

252
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:10,673
It's all right.

253
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,592
I understand.

254
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,469
We started this life together.

255
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,513
I rose to a thumb,

256
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,142
but you're still struggling
out in the streets.

257
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,770
Plus you're constantly beaten
and challenged by the younger men.

258
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,063
It must be hard.

259
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,781
I keep thinking about that.

260
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,659
And Mudeok...

261
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,830
This life just isn't right for you.

262
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,292
Oh, wait. Wait, but I...

263
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,793
I'm not done yet.

264
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,795
I see.

265
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,299
Why don't you return to your hometown?

266
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,762
You owe, what?
Two cows worth for gambling.

267
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,931
Is that about eighty nyang?

268
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,352
How's this? I'll settle it for you.

269
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,520
Think about it.

270
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,856
You've got no fists and no guts.

271
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,525
Your liver is about
the size of a walnut.

272
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,569
You know, you're soft-hearted.

273
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,031
Go fishing.

274
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:18,783
Catch anchovies.

275
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,619
Doesn't that sound nice?

276
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,677
D... Deokgae.

277
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:41,972
You mean...

278
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,601
You... you mean to say I should quit?

279
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,522
Deokgae. Deokgae, I won't do it again.

280
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,859
I'm not going back to my hometown.

281
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:58,197
I'm not even sure whether or not
my parents are still alive.

282
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,282
How can I go back there? Hmm?

283
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,621
I swear I could do a lot better.

284
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:06,706
Hmm?

285
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,709
Deokgae, let me
let me pour you one glass.

286
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,673
Let's head back, Brother!

287
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,633
Brother!

288
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:00,968
Let's go!

289
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,931
Leave me alone!

290
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,558
Bastards!

291
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,666
Walwal.

292
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,545
Yes, brother.

293
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,090
That kid.

294
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,136
The one who beat
Bang to the ground.

295
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,306
Where is he?

296
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,557
He must have left.

297
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,894
And if he's caught,
they'll beat him to death.

298
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,396
He won't return.

299
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,637
Set it aside.

300
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,389
I'm sick of that book.

301
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,187
Why do you take the state exams
again and again?

302
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,730
We have the trade.

303
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,650
- You should learn it.
- Father.

304
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:43,946
What's the point of having so much money
when I'd just be a merchant.

305
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,489
So the trade's not good enough?

306
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,825
Confucius said,
"There are four social classes,"

307
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,661
of those classes,
the last one listed is the merchant.

308
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:54,415
Your legacy is here.
I've poured all my blood and sweat

309
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,750
- into protecting this guild.
- Be that as it may.

310
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:59,503
You already know
this work doesn't suit me.

311
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,839
You're a fool.
If not you, then who?

312
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:03,883
Eun is right there, father.

313
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:08,554
- But she's a girl.
- She's more capable than most men are.

314
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,806
Yet you refuse
to acknowledge this.

315
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,391
Father.

316
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,227
I'll learn how to be a merchant.

317
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,645
Hey, hey.

318
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,606
I'm good with arithmetic, you said so.

319
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,400
I promise if Daeil ever wants anything,

320
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,361
I'll give him salt, wood,
or anything at all.

321
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:25,946
All right?

322
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,741
I can do this.

323
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,826
We should eat.

324
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,384
The ledger.

325
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,638
I think I might give it to Eun.

326
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,974
So... teaching her is your plan?

327
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,726
What can I do?

328
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,645
The only son I have shunts his legacy.

329
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,065
She may be a lady, but she's clever.

330
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,858
Quite strong-willed too.

331
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,861
She isn't afraid to speak her mind.
You two are similar.

332
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,738
You can stop now.

333
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,865
She has all the qualities you want.

334
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,242
She could take over the guild.

335
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,953
It's temporary.

336
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,039
Daeil will make a decision.

337
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,708
- Only until then.
- Sure.

338
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,290
A new face, huh?
He's right over there.

339
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,882
Move. Move it.

340
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:20,936
Hey, brother.

341
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,313
You busy?

342
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,483
Why aren't you answering?

343
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:28,944
Huh?

344
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,197
- Did you come here to collect my taxes?
- Look at you.

345
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,617
Aren't you a smart one.
He must be a noble.

346
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,703
Do you want a lesson?

347
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:41,206
First off, the permission fee
is two mal of rice.

348
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,208
The street fee is half a doe.

349
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,377
If the Police Bureau comes
for an inspection,

350
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,171
it's two hops of rice.

351
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,381
Understood?

352
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:56,472
Since I have nothing now
could I pay you once I sell my wood?

353
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,057
That's a no.

354
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,227
You can trust me.

355
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,979
All right.

356
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:05,773
Let's go.

357
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,276
I swear, I'll pay you.

358
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,111
I'm a man of my word.

359
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,493
I told you to go.

360
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,038
You're something else.

361
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,500
Hey. What's with this glare then?

362
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:27,252
Huh? Guess you don't wanna
keep your head.

363
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,713
Oh, don't be like that.

364
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,883
- You don't have to act so serious.
- Look at him glaring!

365
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,302
Don't be so mean right from the start.

366
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,429
Look here, pretty boy.

367
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:40,265
I'll only say this once,
because you're good-looking.

368
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,725
See? That way.

369
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,144
All the way over there
is the West Gate.

370
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,522
No one's there.
There'll be no taxes.

371
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,233
Thank you for that.

372
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,198
Hey, wait.

373
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:58,659
Leave that here.

374
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,126
I bought this carrier
with everything I had.

375
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,711
I see no reason to give it to you.

376
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,382
What passes through this alley
belongs to us.

377
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,844
That's just Seosomun's law. So leave it.

378
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,012
You don't wanna do this.

379
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,098
Just let me leave.

380
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,350
You're pressing your luck here.

381
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,685
Hey.

382
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,646
Why don't I show you
who's boss, huh?

383
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,898
Ow! Oh, my arm, my arm.

384
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,984
My arm, my arm, my arm.

385
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,361
Oh, please, please.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

386
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,449
It hurts. It hurts.

387
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,967
Let's stop here.

388
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,303
I have no reason to fight anyone else.

389
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,145
Tha... That's him.
He's the one who beat up Bang.

390
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,480
- What? Really?
- Yes.

391
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:13,108
I hear he grabbed him and knocked him out.

392
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,611
Apparently, he hasn't woken up yet.

393
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,238
That must be him, then.

394
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:19,698
The Mokpo swordsman.

395
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,116
- The swordsman?
- Uh-huh.

396
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,161
He beat a dozen men all by himself.
To make sure they were dead,

397
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,371
he skinned and filleted
their chests like fish.

398
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,081
I heard he munched the innards.

399
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,792
What the hell?
That man's not a human. He's a monster.

400
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,003
There will be
a bloodbath in Mapo soon.

401
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,254
Mark my words.

402
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,674
What if he becomes
the next thumb?

403
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,182
Now that's a fire I want to see.

404
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,817
- Gaedal.
- Who's there?

405
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,110
It's me.

406
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,323
Mudeok. What brings you here?

407
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,496
Okay. All right.

408
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,789
Keep a lookout for me.

409
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,458
Yeah, go ahead.

410
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:42,155
Here, this bundle, it's all he left.

411
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,534
- You better go.
- Okay.

412
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,043
Ah, shit.

413
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,262
Something's around here.

414
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,800
Oh! You're back.
Why are you back early today?

415
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,427
Oh, I see.

416
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,095
Wait, what is this?

417
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,973
Did you get robbed
by the Seosomun bandits there?

418
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,059
Oh, you poor thing.

419
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,312
Well, are you all right?

420
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,396
I'm fine.

421
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,024
I'm just glad you're safe.

422
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,237
Any wounds? Are you hurt?

423
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,406
No?

424
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,909
Ah. All right.

425
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,541
Well, you must be tired.

426
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,835
Get some rest inside.

427
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,047
Get your ass in there.

428
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,691
What the hell does it say? Hmm.

429
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:28,321
He passed
the last military state exam

430
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:29,865
with the highest record.

431
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,494
He is Jung Chun.
He's from Gyeongwonji, Hamgyeong-do.

432
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,338
Straight to the mark!

433
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,358
Officer Jung Chun reporting.

434
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,320
I was selected
for the Police Bureau, General.

435
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,240
Assistant Officer. Newly appointed.

436
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,870
I hear you were the finest
among those who passed the exam.

437
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:17,954
It's an honor, sir.

438
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,415
Any family history?

439
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,792
- Has anyone served in office?
- None, sir.

440
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,544
I will be the first one.

441
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,546
What a humble family you have.

442
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,551
This is his first post.

443
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,221
So I ask that you offer him guidance.

444
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,848
First things first, a celebration.

445
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,726
Going forward your top priority
is guarding His Majesty.

446
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,272
By doing so he can continue
to look after the people.

447
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:45,857
Do you understand?

448
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,776
I will keep that in mind.

449
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,110
You are dismissed.

450
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:52,572
Thank you.
I'll go back to my duty, sir.

451
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:53,657
All right.

452
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,962
I'm Captain Park.
I oversee the central territories.

453
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,673
And I'm Captain Oh,
in charge of the east.

454
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,801
You can call me Captain Ji,
I oversee the south.

455
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,347
Since this is my first day,
I'll require a lot of help from you.

456
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,100
I look forward to working together.

457
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,644
Yes, of course.
We are all here to help you.

458
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,649
Well, then, could I see
your inspection log?

459
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,109
Huh?

460
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:35,323
Well, you see, normally that isn't a task
you'd do on your first day.

461
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,119
Every single day,
the three of us run inspections,

462
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:41,579
so there's no need to worry.

463
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,331
Why aren't you moving? Go get it.

464
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,250
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

465
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,673
Wow. How nice.

466
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,425
It's beautiful.

467
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,678
Please accept this gift.
Congratulations on your appointment.

468
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,096
What's the meaning of this?

469
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,600
Um, it's actually customary.

470
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,311
Yes, and you're expected to receive it.

471
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:07,314
You should follow the rules.

472
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:11,067
Well, we'll get going now.
Lots to prepare for your procession.

473
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:12,986
Is that really necessary?

474
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,615
Uh, I think that people
want to see you out there.

475
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,575
You should show them your authority.

476
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:23,788
It's a chance to meet them face-to-face
and, well, listen to their grievances.

477
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,792
Sir, why don't we start
with the village outskirts?

478
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,545
Ah, good idea. You'd enjoy it.

479
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,548
The outskirts are filled
with wickedness.

480
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,508
Now, sir...

481
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:36,926
Come with us.

482
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,096
The bureau, you see,
has customs you'll need to get used to.

483
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,307
We're getting ready

484
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,017
for a procession on your behalf.

485
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,019
Let's go.

486
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:54,402
- Captain!
- An Assistant Officer...

487
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:58,573
receiving a nice bribe from the captains
as soon as he arrives.

488
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:08,750
It's okay. That's how you get
started around here.

489
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,752
Please understand.

490
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:23,014
It's the custom
to share what you receive.

491
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,518
Keep this in mind.

492
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,938
The left side of the police bureau
is under your watch.

493
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,481
I take the right side.

494
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,733
If you mess with my side
without permission,

495
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,860
then you'll be sorry.

496
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,249
What do you think, brother?
He seems pretty uptight.

497
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,711
He learned the world from books.
So what would he know?

498
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,046
He'll get used to it.

499
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,799
Get ready for his party.

500
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,975
Our guild uses the bridge in Sampo.

501
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,769
Deokgae's the one
in charge of collecting taxes.

502
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,521
Taxes?

503
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,984
So the country's taxes
are collected by the bandits?

504
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,777
No, not quite.

505
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,696
These are different charges.

506
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,324
There's an additional charge
when loading and unloading goods.

507
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,869
A rush charge for if the order changes,

508
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:30,081
a torch charge for night work,
bridge charges for repairs.

509
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,167
But that's unjust.

510
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,919
They're taking advantage of us.

511
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,839
We pay the bandits money
to get them to do our bidding.

512
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,551
If you don't feel like going,
you don't have to.

513
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,428
But if it's worth the money,

514
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,182
a merchant would do anything at all,
even bow down.

515
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,770
What do you say, my lady?

516
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,564
Then I have no choice.

517
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,858
There's no turning back.

518
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,903
Let's go.

519
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,502
Shut up, shut up.

520
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,593
Oh, brother.

521
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:32,143
I have someone to introduce.
The young leader of our guild.

522
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:36,105
She'll be in charge of salt and silk,
so treat her with respect.

523
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,857
Just call me Yoon.

524
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,695
Do you want to have a drink with us?

525
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,285
Lady, that look is kinda scary.

526
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,331
It's only her first time here.

527
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,959
She's truly a brave and generous person.

528
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,087
- Oh!
- Well, here.

529
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,966
This is from her.
Go and buy yourselves a drink.

530
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:07,804
Wow. I'd offer a bow,
but my knee's aren't doing so good.

531
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:11,808
Young lady, thanks it means a lot.

532
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,229
Is your boss here with you?

533
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,815
We'd like to talk.
Could you let him know

534
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,693
He's over at the tavern.

535
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:25,697
You know what?
You should head over and say hi.

536
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,492
Yeah?

537
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,079
My lady...

538
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,332
Let's come back another time.

539
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,628
I'd rather not. Please lead the way.

540
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:48,678
Wow. Wow.

541
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:56,227
This bitch.

542
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:27,050
Chief Kang, what brings you
all the way to the tavern?

543
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:31,095
Well, it was time for an introduction.

544
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,931
This is our new young leader.

545
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,141
We're here to ask for your cooperation.

546
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:38,311
Choi's guild had a son,
least what I heard.

547
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,981
Why would his daughter wanna join us
down this rough path?

548
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,362
Is this how you greet
your future business partners?

549
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,698
I know you're treating me like this
because I'm a woman.

550
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,660
How about you consider it
a part of becoming friends.

551
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,829
I'm Mapo's thumb, Deokgae.

552
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:04,837
Here.

553
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:12,053
Why don't you have a drink?

554
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,847
That drink is
too strong for a woman.

555
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,809
I'm not sure she'll be okay.

556
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,143
Of course not.

557
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:22,063
She could never drink
something that strong.

558
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,942
You don't have to drink it.

559
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,362
- Seomsoem here.
- Yes.

560
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:37,453
Oh, my.

561
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,501
Oh, oh wow!

562
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,794
Oh, she's gulping it down!

563
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,921
She's gulping it down!

564
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,756
- Good job!
- Good job.

565
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:57,432
I'm dying here.
Drink another.

566
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,142
Well done.

567
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,061
I don't intend to pay unfair taxes.

568
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,189
I highly suggest
you all keep this in mind.

569
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,316
Suit yourself then.

570
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,819
Boats will be unloaded
in the order they are docked,

571
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,113
so there won't be
a need for a rush charge.

572
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,324
The authorities inspect cargo,
so if you charge for inspection,

573
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,577
I shall report it to the police.

574
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,288
What an innocent subject you are.

575
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,832
Do you still think
the authorities are trustworthy?

576
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,169
Looks like Choi's Guild is in good hands.
Whaddya think?

577
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,338
There's a bright future ahead!
Let's cheers to that!

578
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,883
It was so nice to meet you.

579
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,054
Just don't expect
to get much help from me.

580
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,015
However, my bandits are helpful.

581
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,018
A lot more helpful than the authorities.

582
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,734
To becoming rich.

583
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,487
To becoming rich!

584
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,824
To becoming rich!

585
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:06,292
That kind of person...
I truly despise.

586
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:09,962
My lady.

587
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,924
What they said is true.

588
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:16,719
The bandits... they're much more helpful
than the authorities.

589
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,356
Are you all right?

590
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,527
- I'll carry your veil.
- No, I'm fine.

591
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:36,489
Why did you drink that strong liquor?

592
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,012
<i>Brother Yoon!</i>

593
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,640
I found him!

594
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,393
The one who had that big fight with Bang.

595
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,729
- Where the hell is he?
- <i>He's over at the West Gate.</i>

596
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:12,233
I was passing by and I saw him out there
selling wood with my own eyes.

597
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,693
Go get me Bang.

598
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,798
Hold on. Do we need this many?

599
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:39,927
There's a rumor. That rogue,
he's apparently a swordsman.

600
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:43,014
Remember you told me
not even a tiger can defeat a wolf pack.

601
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,765
Yeah, I suppose I did.

602
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:51,189
- Let's go.
- Come on.

603
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,273
Here we go!

604
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,276
Come on, come on.

605
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:12,960
There he is.

606
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,588
Bang, is that him?

607
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:18,883
Yeah.

608
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,302
Let's go say hello.

609
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,346
That bastard.

610
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,437
- Brother! Brother! Look, look.
- What?

611
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,148
GYEONGWON
JUNG CHUN

612
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,441
Come on. Hurry, hurry.

613
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:36,609
Make way!

614
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,905
Here comes the newly appointed
assistant officer!

615
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,156
Out of the way!

616
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:07,223
Make way.

617
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,059
Out of the way!

618
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,673
Hold a moment.

619
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,239
Siyul.

620
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,170
You rascal.

621
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,714
I see you're not dead.

622
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,288
JUNG CHUN

623
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:58,125
JUNG CHUN
