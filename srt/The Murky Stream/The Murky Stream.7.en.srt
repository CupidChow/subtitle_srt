If you get caught, you'll die.

4
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:14,514
Bandits don't last
all that long in prison.

5
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,808
No matter how good of a fighter you are.

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,269
You should leave while you can.

7
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,063
Go now.

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,899
I can't.

9
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,984
Leave the revenge to me, Siyul.

10
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,571
I need to stay and protect
those who are here.

11
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:33,617
Those men you were with.
The bandits, right?

12
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,621
They may lead lives
the world sees as shameful,

13
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,167
but they have become like family to me.

14
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,963
You won't have to arrest me.

15
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,757
I would never put you in that situation.

16
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:50,968
That much I promise you.

17
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,179
Siyul.

18
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,934
These evil bastards are doomed.

19
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,812
If there's any justice in this world,

20
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,731
their time is coming.

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,068
Perhaps not now.

22
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,529
But I swear they'll pay.

It's late.

31
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,697
[Jang Siyul] I couldn't sleep.

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,533
I stepped out and got a little fresh air.

33
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,618
[Walwal groggily]
You shouldn't walk around.

34
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,579
You'll get hungry.

35
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,165
Sure.

36
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:04,916
[Walwal] By the way...

37
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,377
[groans softly]

38
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,465
Why did you take the sword
with you on your walk?

39
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,301
What?

40
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,553
Thought you were just getting some air.

Wang Hae is an immigrant from up north,
not Joseonin.

51
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,426
He's taken over the docks,
and he's under Officer Lee's protection.

52
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,263
Assistant Officer Jung.

53
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,932
I'm listening, sir.

54
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,894
Right now, this country's government
is rotten to the core.

55
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,313
And across the sea,
Japan is preparing to strike.

[sword whooshing]

57
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,112
Defense must be our priority.

58
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,740
My Lord, do you really think
the Japanese will attack?

59
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,368
Care to make a wager?

60
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,871
I heard our envoys to Japan had said

61
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,582
that an invasion would not be
feasible at this time.

62
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,629
And our talk of it
would unnecessarily panic the nation.

63
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,842
They're not the least bit
concerned about the nation.

64
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,970
All they care about is the king
and how he feels.

65
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,194
This was hand-delivered to me in secret
by a delegate who returned from Japan.

66
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,376
If you put gunpowder here
and ignite a fire,

67
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:16,798
it has enough power to cut through
full armor and penetrate it entirely.

68
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:19,718
[grunting]

69
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,890
[Yu Taeseok] What are they doing?

70
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,143
Why are their soldiers being armed
with new weapons like this?

71
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,645
[♪ suspenseful music continues playing]

72
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:35,776
Your Lordship.

73
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,196
As honorable as your cause is,

74
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,158
maps are prohibited by the King himself.

75
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,286
You'll be made an example.

76
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,789
So protecting the king
means loyalty, does it?

77
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,667
But acting to protect
the people is traitorous?

78
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,587
That makes little sense to me.

79
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,672
There is war coming to our land.

80
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,717
To Joseon.

81
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,386
And these charts may yet shift our fate.

82
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,223
Once this is all over,

83
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,642
I plan to live in seclusion.

[Chief Kang] Good evening, sir.

87
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,624
Allow me to enter.

88
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,171
Were you successful?

89
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:42,092
I found a mapmaker
and a few skilled painters as well.

90
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,593
Would you like to meet them?

91
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,720
There's no need for that.

92
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,973
I trust you handled the task well.

93
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,474
[Chief Kang] Sir.

94
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:50,976
Throughout history,

95
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,355
every uprising in the country
began with the creation of a map.

96
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,566
-It's treasonous.
-Treasonous?

97
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,778
It might be misunderstood.
And it could cause you a lot of trouble.

98
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,989
That's enough. Be careful what you say.

99
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,700
I'm only using it for economic reasons.

100
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,536
I'm getting the lay of the land.

101
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,999
The flow of money and people, that's all.

102
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,501
As it should be.

103
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,880
[inhales] And Daeil?

104
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:24,718
He arrived. And I received word
he made it safely to Daegwang Temple.

105
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,802
That little brat.

106
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:32,017
He expects to study well in the mountains
when he could barely read while here?

107
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,520
[chuckles softly] The state exam again?

108
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,775
That boy's obsessed with it.
His mind is addled.

109
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,282
[Choi Jeongyeop] Eun.

110
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,702
-Are you sleeping?
-[Eun] I'm awake, Father.

111
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,787
I'm coming in.

112
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,796
Go ahead and sit down.

113
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,143
Wait, what is this?

114
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,479
Title deeds.

115
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,189
A ginseng farm in Yeoju.

116
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,734
And the other one
is a salt farm in Seocheon.

117
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,028
They're registered under Gilsang Temple.

118
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:29,658
So even if something happens to our guild,
both will be unaffected.

119
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,744
But why are they with you?

120
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,954
Joseon is a sinking land.

121
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,542
If a person with power
sets their mind to it,

122
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,294
there is nothing they cannot do.

123
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,755
Watch over them now.

124
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,218
What is the key to being a merchant?

125
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,889
The eyes.
Merchants can see an item's value.

126
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,307
It's how we survive.

127
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,310
Merchants have to have sharp eyes.

128
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,187
Try again.

129
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,064
You should start over once more.

130
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,150
-[sighs] Father.
-What is our guild?

131
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,070
It's much more than selling nice silk.

132
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,740
You must bow low and keep yourself there.

133
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,661
Because money, just like water,
flows downward.

134
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,830
I will keep that in mind.

135
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,124
[Choi Jeongyeop] Eun.

136
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,709
Our country, it...

137
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,629
It is sick and it will not stand tall.

138
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,842
Not in either of our lifetimes.
Understand?

139
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,808
[Gaechun] Line up. Line up.

140
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,519

00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,238
You're starting a bit early, aren't you?

145
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,365
So what's wrong?

146
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,701
[man 4] Get out of my way.

147
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,957
[Walwal sighs] It's driving me crazy.

148
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,169
You know you're gonna talk, so just do it.

149
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,755
Well, Siyul told me.

150
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,425
Uh, well, he told me to keep it a secret.

151
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,802
Hmm.

152
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,138
Then keep it a secret, brother Walwal.

153
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,473
Wait, wait, Gaechun.

154
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,766
Hey, Gaechun.

155
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,477
Sit down. Sit.

156
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,321
You better keep it a secret, all right?
Do you understand? Yeah?

157
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,448
You can't let it spill,

158
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,033
-I'm being serious.
-Mmm-hmm.

159
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,619
-Give me your ear.
-[softly] What?

160
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,621
Give me your ear, damn it!

161
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,887
Is that... Is that true?

162
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,431
That's the thing.

163
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,725
When it comes down to it.

164
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,103
Siyul's life has been
way harder than ours.

165
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,730
Tell me who it is.

166
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,482
Who the fuck is it, huh?

167
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,526
-Which son of a bitch...
-[groans]

168
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,486
...dared to stab his mother in the heart?

169
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,281
I'll find them and twist their head
off their fucking neck.

170
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,866
Ah, forget it! Hey!

171
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,743
Malbok, Jungbok. Come here.

172
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,870
[Walwal sighs]

173
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,500
-What?
-Grab your tools.

174
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,460
We getting invaded?

175
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,003
It's our brother Siyul.

176
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,923
He found his mother's killer
and the bastard's here.

177
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,050
That fucking scum is still breathing?

178
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,885
We're gonna find him and kill him.

179
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,971
Shit, I'm gonna
crack his head like an egg.

180
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,019
Wait a minute.

181
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,772
-So who is he?
-Yeah, who?

182
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,483
This son of a bitch we're gonna kill.

183
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,945
So, who is it, this fucker?

184
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,323
-Wang Hae.
-What?

185
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,617
Wang... Hae?

186
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,202
Oh, Wang Hae?

187
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,830
[stutters] The Wang Hae?

188
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,917
[Malbok] That bastard.

189
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,170
I'll fucking tear him to pieces.

190
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,089
Let's take revenge.

191
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,509
If someone spits in our eye,
we make sure to return the favor.

192
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,927
Ain't that the bandit's code?

193
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,222
Yeah, yeah. How touching.

194
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,057
Boss, from what I heard,

195
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,312
Wang Hae's followers are all really strong
and really good at fighting.

196
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,898
Yet Wang Hae himself is not a big deal.

197
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,567
I say we use this chance
to take apart their group,

198
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,111
and Donghonaru
will be ours for the taking, boss.

199
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,113
Get the fucker alone, and attack!

200
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,824
-Worth trying, isn't it?
-Exactly.

201
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,075
Fucking smash his head!

202
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,744
[indistinct shouting]

203
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,163
Hey, will you all shut it?

204
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,251
I feed you some good meals
and now you think you're smart?

205
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,419
[Mudeok clicks tongue]

206
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,422
What? You think Wang Hae
is just a bandit like us?

207
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,925
Do you think taking revenge
is as easy as it sounds?

208
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,552
[groans softly] I knew boss
would say shit like this.

209
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,305
-I'm not shocked in the least.
-[groans] I knew it.

210
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,599
Over there. Siyul's here.

211
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,142
Let's hear brother Siyul.

212
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,810
What the hell is there to hear?

213
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,438
Brother.

214
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,108
Brother.

215
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,695
I heard that Wang Hae killed your mother.

216
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,405
Was Walwal right or what?

217
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,074
[sighs softly]

218
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,203
What...

219
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,331
Didn't you know?
I'm Mapo's worst keeper of secrets.

220
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,166
That's me, Walwal.

221
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,584
They want revenge for you.

222
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,461
They want to all go together.

223
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,089
What do you make of that idea, huh?

224
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,718
Brother, listen. None of us
even needs to think twice.

225
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,512
If you're in, then all of us are in.

226
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,180
-No doubt.
-[Malbok] Definitely.

227
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,723
-We're in.
-[Jungbok] Yeah, yeah.

228
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,058
[birds chirping]

229
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,646
[Jung Chun] These evil bastards
are doomed.

230
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,817
If there's any justice in this world,
their time is coming.

231
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,111
I would never put you in that situation.

232
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,613
That much I promise you.

233
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,661
I must abide by the thumb's decision.

234
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,745
Yeah.

235
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,872
What?

236
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,669
Your mother was murdered,
and you're letting it go?

237
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,421
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,008
It's something I have to handle alone.

239
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,219
But, brother.

240
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,304
[stammers]

241
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,477
You heard that? Yeah?

242
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,187
Look, I understand.

243
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,566
It feels like my chest
is gonna burst with anger

244
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,694
and I want to shove a sickle
into that asshole Wang Hae's heart.

245
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,821
But what can I do?

246
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,782
Because if it goes wrong,

247
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,368
then all of Mapo is gonna flip
upside down on its head.

248
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,580
I know it's hard to hear.

249
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,582
Just let it go.

250
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,668
[exhales]

251
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,297
[Gaechun] Ah, shit.

252

[pants]

255
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,447
We're not gonna do anything?

256
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,079
What if we don't?

257
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,417
I say...

258
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,878
we teach that bastard a lesson.

259
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,214
[stutters] Just us?

260
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,216
Who's responsible for our delicious food?

261
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,009
We owe everything to brother Siyul.

262
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:49,347
If you went through all that alone
and I did nothing, how would you feel?

263
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,141
Aren't you always saying that
we're a family?

264
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,311
We eat together, we starve together.

265
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,771
If one gets knocked down,

266
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,190
we're supposed to take
revenge together, right?

267
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,485
Isn't it about time we showed them
who we really are?

268
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,823
How long do they get to walk all over us?

269
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,449
Huh?

270
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,957
Okay, then. Fine.

271
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,041
All right.

272
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,335
If Malbok's in, then I am, too.

273
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:20,837
Hmm.

274
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,964
Hey, let's get this done, brother. Yeah?

275
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,300
No.

276
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,010
-No way.
-Uh-uh.

277
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:34,725
I'm in, too.

278
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,020
Let's take revenge.

279
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,440
-[screaming]
-Yeah.

280
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,943
Yeah, let's do this.

281
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,236
Wait, wait.

282
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,281
What about what the boss said?

283
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,533
Hey, listen here, brother.

284
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,119
You're not backing out on us, right?

285
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,912
Hey, let go, damn it! [groans]

286
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,624
Hey, he's really tough.

287
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,501
Can we-- Can we take him, though?

288
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,253
But we're not taking him on.

289
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,422
How did Boss Mudeok win, right?

290
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,757
He snuck up.
That's what we all saw him do.

291
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,259
Brother Deokgae got distracted.

292
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,137
Stabbed him real good with a sickle,
remember?

293
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,389
Striking first shapes the fight.

294
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,017
-Is that right?
-Yes, of course.

295
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,101
You know what I did?

296
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,271
I used this, and Chunsik crumbled.

297
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,065

to beat either, you know.

we can totally handle it on our own!

-[Malbok] Brother?
-[Walwal] Yeah?

317
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,408
Wang Hae was traveling alone.

-I saw it myself. Yes.
-You did?

319
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,456
About twice a month, he goes to see
Hyangsim at the gisaeng house.

320
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,084
From what I saw, he always went alone.

321
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,253
[Gaechun] He goes
to the gisaeng house alone?

322

That's good. That's perfect.

Each one of you, stick to your own roles.

356
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,074
Now get in your positions.

357
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,118
-[Malbok] Yes.
-Jungbok, you're Wang Hae.

358
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,786
-Okay.
-Stand in the center.

359
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,079
-Then what?
-Hmm?

360
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,707
-Get in a circle. Come on!
-Go, go, go, go, go!

361
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,213
[Walwal] Go around!

362
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,548
No, no, the other way.

363
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,097
-Now attack.
-[screams]

364

366
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,785
Hey, we're not kidding around.

367
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,205
We have to act like this
is the real thing. Got it?

368
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,750
Be a role model.

369
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,794
He's acting like that 'cause of you!

370
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,546
Asshole.

371
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,132
-[softly] Me?
-Again.

372
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,219
Now, go, go.

00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,855
-Now, Gaechun, use your spear!

375
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,315

377
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,912
Yeah, that's nice. [claps]
Okay, team, great job.

378
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,917
I wasn't sure before, but I made
the right choice to become a bandit.

380
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,294
We eat together!

381

[in unison] And we die together!

[♪ suspenseful music playing]

385
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:13,833
A strange rumor... is spreading, My Lord.

386
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,919
Suspicious men are visiting
the Senior Guardian General.

387
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,004
I hear it's happening quite often.

388
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,340
[Lord Oh] What are you implying, then?

389
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,134
They don't seem to be merchants.

390
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,220
And they're not his relatives either.

391
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:29,098
They look like painters.

392
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,350
Or so the rumors say.

393
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,394
[woman] Bring him closer.

394
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,979
[gasps softly]

395
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,272
You may enter.

396
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,111
[Yu Taeseok] How's the progress?

397
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,445
Is everything going well?

398
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:47,032
[Choi Jeongyeop] Now we've gathered
enough small maps.

399
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,576
We can see the roads.

400
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,328
Rivers and mountains, too.

401
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:56,292
All of the hidden trails
emerging like small veins.

402
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,919
We see where people plant their roots.

403
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,673
All the places
they eventually gather to live.

404
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,760
Eight provinces,
easily visible at a glance.

405
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,518
How much longer until it's all ready,
then?

406
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,729
We're halfway through, My Lord.

407
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,817
Let's hurry things along if we can.

408
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,777
Of course.

409
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,238
[Lee Dolgae]
The Senior Guardian General...

410
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,366
is the Seoin's central pillar.

411
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:35,664
This might be bold of me to say,
but the Seoin...

412
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:40,169
are even arguing that Joseon
will be invaded by the Japanese.

413
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,837
They'll hit the Ming as well.

414
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:47,092
It seems they are using
fear of war as a pretense.

415
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,928
Bring it to me now.

416
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,974
What the Senior Guardian General
has been scheming.

417
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,476
I'll send the order now.

418
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:57,978
My fastest team will go.

419
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,606
You'll be promoted if you're successful.

420
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,776
I'll reward you with the title
of General as promised.

421

423
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,744
I express the deepest appreciation.

424

-[Lord Oh] You are excused.
-[Lee Dolgae] Yes, My Lord.

425
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,546
The proclamation
of the Crown Prince is near.

426
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,757
I am ready to receive your order.

427
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:30,469
It is only obvious that the sly Seoin

428
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,555
will use mention of war
to disturb the court.

429
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,101
You must act without ambiguity.

430
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:42,815
You must decisively take their lives
to prevent any future uprising.

431
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,567
Her Highness' will is my own.

432
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:50,072
They shall burn to ash
and that ash shall be scattered.

433
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,118
If possible, make it loud and unavoidable.

434
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,953
Set an example.

435
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,705
Silence them all for good.
