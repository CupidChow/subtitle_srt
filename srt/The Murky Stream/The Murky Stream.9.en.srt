00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:05,464
[leaves crunching]

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,092
[Eun and Seomseom panting]

3
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,099
My lady. [gasps]

4
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,019
[sinister music playing]

5
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,064
My lady, we have to get moving.

6
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,399
We're all going to die
if you waste time here.

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,694
We have to move forward, my lady.

8
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:29,613
We have to hurry!

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,075
[soldier] Find Choi's daughter!

10
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,677
[pants and whispers]
My lady, hurry. Hurry.

11
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,515
-[gasps]
-[soldier 1] Search everywhere.

12
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,642
[Seomseom] They're after you.

13
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,769
-[soldier 1] This way!
-We're blocked off.

14
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,145
We're completely surrounded.

15
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,982
[soldier 2] She can't have gone far.
Find them now!

16
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,651
The path to the outskirts is blocked.

17
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,320
There's no way we can get past them.
What do we do?

18
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,033
My lady!
You have to pull yourself together.

19
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,036
If we get caught here,
then both of us will get killed.

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,705
-Officer Jung.
-What?

21
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,959
He said if I was ever in trouble,
Mapo's Forefinger would help us.

22
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,211
We need to find him.

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,964
We'll find out where he is together.

24
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,509
[breathing heavily] All right. This way.

25
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,094
[both panting]

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,681
[sighs wearily]

27
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,811
[boatman] What are you going to do?
The sun will rise soon.

28
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,443
Chief Kang.

29
00:01:55,073 --> 00:02:00,245
Listen, if I'm not there on time,
you must go alone.

30
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,706
My lord.

31
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,626
All of our lives depend on the map,
making it safely.

32
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,462
I'm counting on you.

33
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,549
We have to go.

34
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,554
Oh, over there.

35
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,767
[breath trembling]

36
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,935
[both panting]

37
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,647
[sinister music playing]

38
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,734
-[Captain Park] That way.
-[soldiers] Yes, sir!

39
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,361
I think it's too late, my Lord.

40
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:43,205
The Murky Stream

41
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:47,876
NINE. DARK RIVER

42
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,044
[screams]

43
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,673
-[door opens]
-[Seomseom] My lady.

44
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,675
Oh, my lady. It's okay.

45
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,052
You're all right now.
You're safe. You're safe.

46
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,598
I had a nightmare.

47
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,726
A terrible nightmare.

48
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,771
What?

49
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,148
It was just a bad dream, right?

50
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,026
Right, Seomseom?

51
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:19,658
Right?

52
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,245
My lady...

53
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,163
[crying]

54
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,133
[sighs softly]

55
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,093
Where are we right now?

56
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,266
Tell me it wasn't real.

57
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,144
Oh, my lady...

58
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,566
[both crying]

59
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,027
Oh, my lady...

60
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,258
And Choi's daughter?

61
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,135
Well, Siyul had a plan.

62
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,429
He hid her at his old home.
She'll be safe there.

63
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,931
Now we're stuck taking care
of some random girl

64
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,183
that fell out of the sky.

65
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,726
Last night...

66
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,605
Choi's Guild was accused of treason,
and they were all put to the sword.

67
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,732
What does Siyul have to do with that?

68
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,734
They're chasing down the rest.

69
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,111
The ones who got out
are being hunted like dogs.

70
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,864
Can you really call that living?
I don't think so.

71
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,741
Sounds like that family's trouble.

72
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,659
Oh, shit.

73
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,495
[sighs]

74
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,497
Actually, I grew up here.

75
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,750
You and the lady should stay here.

76
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,337
Thank you very much.

77
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,005
It's a complete mess out there.

78
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,925
They've issued a warrant for your arrest.

79
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,135
They've eyes everywhere
and it's getting worse.

80
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,222
So how did this happen?

81
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,271
I have something to show you.

82
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,825
Is this... This is a map.

83
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,326
Boss, you in there?

84
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,250
What have you been able to uncover?

85
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,212
[thuds]

86
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,756
This is all...

87
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,259
I could get out of there.

88
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,943
This is...

89
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,571
This is Chun's sword, isn't it?

90
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,075
[fabric rustling]

91
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,668
[hesitates] Where is he...

92
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,087
without his blade?

93
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,716
Well, that's the thing.

94
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,012
Your friend, Assistant Officer Jung...

95
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,097
[ominous music playing]

96
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,807
He's in front of the city wall.

97
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,935
[somber music playing]

98
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,322
[Captain Park] Listen carefully.

99
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,075
"If you find any family members
or anyone connected to the traitors,

100
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,245
"you must report them immediately.

101
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,498
"If you disobey
and are caught hiding them,

102
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,960
"or helping them escape or,
assisting them in any way,

103
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,381
"the charge is treason,
and you will likewise face decapitation."

104
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,259
-[indistinct chatter]
-[breath trembling]

105
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,641
[woman sobbing] Oh, no.

106
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,352
[sobbing
]

107
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,358
[sniffling]

108
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,033
-Seomseom?
-[Seomseom sniffles]

109
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,496
[grunts] My lady?

110
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,210
Are you feeling any better now?

111
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,504
That light outside the door...

112
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,052
Is that the light of dusk
or the light of dawn?

113
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,221
The light of dawn, my lady.

114
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,348
Could we open the door then?

115
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,016
Yes.

116
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,856
[music continues]

117
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,870
This is what Chun was fighting for?

118
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,417
What he was protecting?

119
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,002
This map was created
in preparation for war.

120
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,966
And according to my lord, Choi,
it could save Joseon.

121
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,053
I'm not asking for your help
just for my sake.

122
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:37,434
Both my father and Officer Jung
gave their lives for this.

123
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,812
Help us fulfill their duty.

124
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,525
[door opens]

125
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,612
What's with
all the pointless chatter, huh?

126
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,866
-Mudeok--
-Save your breath.

127
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,870
I already heard everything,
and I'm not gonna help you.

128
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,373
So let's just pretend I didn't
hear anything or see anything.

129
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,375
It's time to get out of here. Got that?

130
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,585
Hurry your asses on out.

131
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,669
Mudeok sir...

132
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,337
Our lives are on the line here.

133
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,673
We need your help. I'm begging you.

134
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,009
Now you're just spouting some bullshit.

135
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,511
You think I'm gonna risk my life
to help you?

136
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,056
They execute those who harbor traitors,
you know that.

137
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,017
How dare you call them traitors?

138
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,351
They were righteous people.

139
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,771
That's neither here
nor there, little girl.

140
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,274
Don't even think about settling down here
and planting roots.

141
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,693
The government will hear
about you, real fast.

142
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:29,778
What if...

143
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,906
we could come to an agreement instead?

144
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,118
I know you care for money.

145
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,914
You're not serious, are you?

146
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,291
Money from a Traitor's Guild
is worth shit.

147
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,584
It's nothing but paper.

148
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,711
You should find somebody else.

149
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,843
This is a Songbang promissory note.

150
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,847
Two thousand nyang for immediate use.

151
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,725
What the... 2,000 nyang?

152
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,899
That's enough to buy several houses
in the finest neighborhood.

153
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,401
You will never have to worry
about money again.

154
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,029
And also...

155
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,907
title deeds for a ginseng farm.

156
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,119
-Everything you need and more.
-Please, my lady.

157
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,371
This is all I have to my name.

158
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,166
[Walwal] My goodness...

159
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,293
[stutters] What an offer.

160
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,378
What did I say?

161
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,381
I told you she wouldn't
take no for an answer.

162
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,342
Um... Uh...

163
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,512
I mean, we should hear her out.
Let her finish.

164
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,932
If the price doesn't please you,
I will look for someone else then.

165
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,475
-No, hold on.
-No, wait, wait.

166
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,102
-Don't go.
-Hold on.

167
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,895
[comical music playing]

168
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,566
The lady should at least
let us mull it over.

169
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,153
What are your terms, though?

170
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,953
I need a boat procured.

171
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,788
[gasps]

172
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,791
Find us a boat
that'll make it to Ganghwado.

173
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,922
[exhales]

174
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,189
-[grunts]
-Go away.

175
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,410
Have you forgotten, my lady?

176
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,037
These are bandits.

177
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,873
Who knows what it is they're scheming?

178
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,625
They could take our money,

179
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,085
hand us over to the police bureau,
or worse.

180
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,087
It couldn't get worse than this.

181
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,883
So I don't think it matters much.

182
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,220
[scoffs]

183
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,724
The way that you made that deal
reminded me of your father.

184
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,646
I may not know him well, but...

185
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,233
the Forefinger of Mapo...

186
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,486
he seems trustworthy to me.

187
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,446
Yes.

188
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,115
However, the thumb's a different story.

189
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,409
You don't trust Mudeok?

190
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,120
It's difficult to tell
what his intentions are.

191
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,292
[grunting]

192
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,920
-[yells]
-[both grunting]

193
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,927
[both panting]

194
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,387
Where is the map?

195
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,138
Where?

196
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,475
Just give me three days
to find them, General.

197
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,685
[scoffs]

198
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,187
You think you have three days?

199
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,356
You won't have a neck
in three days.

200
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,316
I blocked all the exits.

201
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,069
Every single waterway, path, and alley.

202
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,824
How could a mere disgraced woman
escape all this?

203
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,117
Fine then.

204
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,870
Just keep this in mind.

205
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,833
If you fail,
I'll shove a bull stick down your throat.

206
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,252
Understand?

207
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,670
[ominous music playing]

208
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,842
[sighs wearily]

209
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,305
Are you saying you haven't even
laid your eyes on the map?

210
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,640
[trembling] My sincerest apologies,
my lord.

211
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,226
I think I may have overestimated you.

212
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,522
Judging by the way you're
handling this situation,

213
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,026
you don't seem to deserve to be
the general of the Left Police Bureau.

214
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,570
[gasps] That's not true, my lord.

215
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,405
Do not forget...

216
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,284
your neck could easily end up
on the chopping block with the traitors.

217
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,911
I swear I will heed your warning.

218
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,706
I'll engrave it in my heart.

219
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:53,583
[Lord Oh] Leave.

220
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,427
Lord Oh.

221
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,137
Yes?

222
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,806
The culling
of the Senior Guardian General's life

223
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,475
was not the sole objective.

224
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,310
I'm well aware, Your Highness.

225
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,813
In order to wrap a noose
around the Seoin's necks,

226
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,523
we must have a clear cause.

227
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:23,488
No longer will any of these filthy and
impure forces disrupt the court's purity.

228
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,615
That aside...

229
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,910
the assistant officer who just left...

230
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,537
don't you think he knows too much here?

231
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,791
Not to mention his conduct.

232
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,585
He still has some use left as a pawn.

233
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,296
And he is more loyal than he appears.

234
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,132
Don't concern yourself
with him, Your Highness.

235
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,342
So you say.

236
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,095
Is this hard for you to comprehend?

237
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,430
Do you burn yourself to learn fire is hot?

238
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,724
[sighs] Not at all.

239
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,268
Hesitating means we lose.

240
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,728
We must be two steps ahead.

241
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:00,024
By your command, I will do as you wish.

242
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:05,238
We only have one life,
so why waste it living frugally?

243
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:12,161
At the end of it, all our bodies die
before rotting to dust.

244
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,455
Half measures get you nowhere.

245
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,252
[birds chirping]

246
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,673
[whispers] Here.

247
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,925
-Keep your word.
-Of course.

248
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,635
[grunts]

249
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,558
[suspenseful music playing]

250
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,895
[sighs wearily]

251
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,536
It's tomorrow at dawn.

252
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,707
[grunts] The boat will set off then,
at the hour of the tiger.

253
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,209
Thank you for doing this.

254
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,587
[Mudeok] Siyul...

255
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,213
Yes?

256
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,386
If you have something to say, then...

257
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,430
you should say it.

258
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,019
It's nothing important.

259
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,189
Please take care of yourself.

260
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,735
May your life be long.

261
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,945
Hey...

262
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,408
you worried that I'm gonna die?

263
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,703
[chuckles]

264
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,788
[sighs]

265
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,707
Save your worry for yourselves.

266
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,459
[laughs]

267
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,170
[groans]

268
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,255
[sighs]

269
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,216
[music continues]

270
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,024

273
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,005
[in Manchu] The doctor...
What did he say?

274
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,174
The stab wound is too deep.

275
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,510
So he cannot tell
whether she will live or not.

276
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,555
Do you blame me?

277
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,307
You took us in and raised us.

278
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,602
When my sister and I lived like beasts
eating rotten food.

279
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,773
How could we ever blame you?

280
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,693
Everyone dies.

281
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,238
The only difference is who goes first.

282
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,158

[breath trembling]

285
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,714
[Mudeok] You can bring it with you...

286
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,133
Go wherever you want.

287
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,261
I will give back
what I owe you before I do.

288
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,431
Have you considered
the consequences at all?

289
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,018
After you cause a scene
and leave us all here?

290
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,103
Do you think we can survive on our own?

291
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,314
[crying]

292
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,401
[Siyul] Take my letter...

293
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,029
and do whatever you want with it.

294
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,781
And I will do what I have to do.

295
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,535
[Mudeok] You idiot!

296
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,246
So we'll be stuck
eating filthy rice again,

297
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,914
and it'll all be thanks to you?

298
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,543
[breath trembling]

299
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,842
[mumbling]

300
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,667
You had something to say?

301
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,711
Take a seat.

302
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,930
Well, you see...

303
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,480
I know where the daughter
of the Choi Guild is hiding.

304
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,649
I can tell you, my lord.

305
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,736
What did you just say?

306
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,156
Right now...

307
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,575
she's hiding in Taeseong-ri.

308
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,578
In a vacant house on top of a hill.

309
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:07,957
You're certain of this?

310
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,792
Yes.

311
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,502
I'm certain.

312
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,587
I saw her with my own two eyes.

313
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,553
Curious...

314
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,890
Tell me, how did you figure this out?

315
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,477
I know the one who helped that woman hide.

316
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,690
A member of my own clan.

317
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,317
My forefinger!

318
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,278
He's your forefinger.

319
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,030
That can only mean Jang.

320
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,115
Yes.

321
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,993
[scoffs] What a daring man!

322
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,661
So, tell me...

323
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,165
Why would he hide that woman
from Choi's Guild?

324
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,878
By doing that, he'd be putting
his own life on the line.

325
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,505
The boy wants revenge.

326
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,509
Right now,
that's what's driving him, my lord.

327
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,137
Revenge, you say?

328
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,602
[breath trembling]

329
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,405
JUNG CHUN

330
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,573
What's this?

331
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,743
Was this letter
written by our late Officer Jung?

332
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,704
You'll want to take a look
at who it's addressed to.

333
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,500
That's Jang's true name, the one he hid.

334
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,505
Jang Siyul.

335
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,261
Jang Siyul and Assistant Officer Jung,
they were both from Gyeongwonjin.

336
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:49,225
When Siyul lost his mother during the war
and became an orphan,

337
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,062
Jung's mother took him in
and raised them like brothers.

338
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,147
[ominous music playing]

339
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:01,779
Those two may not have shared blood,
but they were basically family.

340
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,662
[bamboo creaking]

341
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,333
[Lee Dolgae] Yes.

342
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:19,171
This is all starting to make
much more sense to me now.

343
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:23,425
Every time he was involved,
Officer Jang made such a fuss.

344
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,177
I always wondered why.

345
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,263
How very interesting.

346
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:29,890
That's not all.

347
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,852
Malbok's killer, Wang Hae...

348
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,273
he was the one who killed Siyul's mother
during the invasion.

349
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:44,446
To make matters worse, he struck down
the man Siyul called brother.

350
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,617
There's no question
as to why he craves revenge.

351
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,580
[Lee Dolgae] What a truly amusing fate.

352
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,541
I'm certain of it.

353
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:01,589
If it's for the sake of vengeance,
there's nothing that can hold him back.

354
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,189
The daughter of the Choi family,
last night, she offered me a deal.

355
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,611
She said If I helped her cross the river,
then I would get a large payout.

356
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,154
So you're saying...

357
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,699
they're going to cross the river.

358
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,118
They'll run using the waterways.

359
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,078
At dawn tomorrow.

360
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,998
That's when they plan to go,
when the tide is at its highest.

361
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,084
Where will they go?

362
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,837
I can't say, my lord.

363
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,298
It was kept secret
in case someone turned them in.

364
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,429
Answer this.

365
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,973
What made you decide to turn her in?

366
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,520
That money was yours for the taking.

367
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,903
You're asking why?

368
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:12,368
I'd do anything to protect my family.

369
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,079
Either I turned my back on him...

370
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,624
or he turns his back on me.

371
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,461
I don't see any other options.

372
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:29,134
My lord, please protect us.

373
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,970
[breath trembling]

374
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,846
He's endangering my family.

375
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:39,687
I'm afraid they're going to get hurt

376
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,314
all because of this.

377
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,196
In the end, it seems...

378
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,533
life is a nightmare.

379
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,794

[grunts] The bodies are gone,
the traitors' bodies are gone.

382
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,141
-We need to report this now.
-[Captain Ji] Ha!

[panting]

385
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,907
If anyone seems suspicious
or tries to fight back,

386
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,576
you're authorized to kill them.

387

395
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:46,123
Captain, there's no one.
I don't even see a single rat.

396
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:58,802
The fire is still hot,
the traitors can't have gotten too far.

397
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,596
Be sure to search everywhere.

398
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:06,351
What was that?

399
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:09,062
Judging by the mess, they were
determined to run away.

400
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,315
Do you have men
tracking the Gyeonggang River?

401
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,234
[Captain Ji] Captain Park is currently
on his way to the dock.

402
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,697
Block all the waterways.

403
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,825
Officer Lee,
the search area is much too big.

404
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,453
Get more troops from the capital, then.

405
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,747
-To request--
-Listen to what I'm telling you.

406
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,166
Gather all the scattered
troops immediately.

407
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,336
Cut off all escape routes.
Nobody leaves the city tonight.

408
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,922
I move at your command.

409
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,466
[soldiers shouting indistinctly]

410
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,769
[Captain Park] Search the area.

411
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,069
[Lee Dolgae] Where are they?

412
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,280
[Captain Park] Sir, it seems
they haven't arrived yet.

413
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,324
Stop them no matter what.

414
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,826
Make sure not a single boat
makes it out of here.

415
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,287
Sir. Let's go.

416

418
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,428
The soldiers who were guarding the gates
seem to be moving.

419
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,682
[Walwal] It's time to leave.

420
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,725
Come on, come on.

421
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,687
The road is open. We have to go now.

You were swinging that sickle
like an animal.

441
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,150
[Siyul] They're waiting
for you in hell.

Did you really think you were
good enough to win this fight?

459

00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,793
-You know that?
-[laughs]

715
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,337
That's the opposite
of what you're always saying.

716
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:33,048
Turning away from suffering
is what a bandit does.

717
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:34,216
[sighs deeply]

718
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,301
[man] War!

719
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:38,637
They've declared war!

720
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:41,098
Hey, everyone! Hey, they declared war!

721
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,017
They declared war.

722
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,394
-War's coming!
-[Mudeok] What's he squawking about?

723
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,479
-[man 2] What's he saying?
-[man] Look there!

724
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:49,773
-[villagers speaking indistinctly]
-Oh, shit.

725
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,486
-[Mudeok sighs]
-Wait, hold on!

726
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:57,281
-What's that over there?
-Huh?

727
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,033
[villagers speaking indistinctly]

728
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,702
[Walwal] Could it be a fire?

729
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:06,749
-[Gaechun] I think it's a smoke signal.
-[Mudeok sighs, grunts]

730
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,335
[Jungbok] A real war?

731
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:14,214
♪ I can't go on ♪

732
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,091
[Gaechun] What will happen to us now?

733
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:19,053
♪ I can't go on ♪

734
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,222
♪ I can't go on ♪

735
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:25,601
♪ Because of the war ♪

736
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,404
That's it, my lady.

737
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:41,909
Once we cross this river,
we'll reach Ganghwado.

738
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:55,673
What is that?

739
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,555
[Chief Kang] Wait, my lady.

740
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,184
Someone has lit the beacon.

741
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,447
[breathing heavily]

742
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,394
[♪ slow suspenseful music playing]

743
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,406
[♪ somber instrumental music playing]

744
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:41,171
[♪ music swells]

745
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,344
[♪ music fades]
