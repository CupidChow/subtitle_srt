1
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,052
[Seomseom] My lady.

2
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,098
[gasps] My lady, have you heard?

3
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,809
You know the tall Assistant Officer,
right?

4
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,687
He was clearing all the bandits out.

5
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,357
Then all of a sudden,
they all got released,

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,526
and that officer was apprehended instead.

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,947
-Why?
-Uh, I... I'm not too sure.

8
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:40,290
[Lee Dolgae] My goodness!
Assistant Officer Jung.

9
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,711
This is quite the mess you're in,
isn't it?

10
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,838
Hmm?

11
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,216
The bandits are colluding with you.

12
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,260
Let me hear you say it.

13
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,137
Then I'll bring you some food or water.

14
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,141
I'll bring you anything.
You just have to confess.

15
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,269
Officials like you disgust me.

16
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,689
I'm sick of all the corruption.

17
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,440
[chuckles]

18
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,571
Before you arrived here,

19
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,449
we had Assistant Officer Choi.

20
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,785
He was as righteous a man as they get,

21
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,122
and he worked harder than anybody else.

22
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:25,836
If it was for the good of the commoners,
Choi never spared himself.

23
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,386
Do you wanna know how his story ended?

24
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,805
He died.

25
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,975
Why did he die?

26
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,562
Just how do you think
he ended up like that?

27
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,857
You're smart enough to figure it out.

28
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,320
If you open your mouth and say anything,

29
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,531
if you breathe at all,

30
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,243
I'll frame you for all kinds of charges.

31
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,621
You are rotten down to your bones.

32
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,457
[chuckles]

33
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,295
[sighing] You know what?

34
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:13,258
I'm actually very clean
from inside to out.

35
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:20,641
But if anyone touches what's mine,
nothing makes me more furious.

36
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,353
[growls]

37
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,190
[snarls]

38
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,611
I become a wild animal and lose control.

39
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:37,199
Then I rip my enemy to pieces!

40
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,118
I'll keep that in mind.

41
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,832
[sigh] You're one rigid bastard.

42
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,418
Just keep dreaming in there

43
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,047
while you pass away the days.

44
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:56,468
[laughs]

45
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:11,149
The Murky Stream

46
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,985
SIX. NIGHT DRIFTER

47
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,749
The price for his life?
What on earth are you talking about?

48
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,211
I mean Officer Jung,
the one you have imprisoned right now.

49
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,338
This might be a misunderstanding.

50
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,926
Assistant Officer Jung hasn't committed
a capital offense.

51
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,803
We received an anonymous letter,

52
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,680
and it's our job
to investigate thoroughly.

53
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,515
An anonymous letter?

54
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,850
Yes, that is correct.

55
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,686
The most effective
and easy way to kill someone

56
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,980
is through a quick stab of a knife.

57
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,692
Of course, this has its own problems,
as you have to get blood on your hands.

58
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,777
There is an easier method.

59
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,489
The anonymous letter.

60
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,201
Anyone who decides to,

61
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,413
will find it easy to turn a man
into a criminal.

62
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:13,879
Do you mind if I ask what your reason is
for wanting to protect Officer Jung?

63
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,882
Why don't you consider it
a trade of sorts,

64
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,842
one where we each get what we want?

65
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,846
You can't pass up on that.

66
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:29,227
Very soon, the Royal family will host
a gathering.

67
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,398
Administrator Seo is being reinstated,
so they're holding a feast for him.

68
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,525
But it's more than that.

69
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,571
If people know you're in good health
and word gets around,

70
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,157
well then, they'll see you as steady,
don't you think?

71
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,702
I think this position could be yours
for a lot longer than you anticipated.

72
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:49,748
His Highness, too,
will surely take some notice of that.

73
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,291
[chuckles]

74
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,752
Well, if you're able to do that for me,

75
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,046
that would really help out politically.

76
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,090
It's no trouble.
I consider it the right thing to do.

77
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,718
And I thank you
for speaking with me today.

78
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,554
Ah. Is that everything then?

79
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,848
Oh, there's no need to see me off.

80
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,433
You should get back to work.

81
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,063
I'll take care of what we discussed!

82
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,315
You don't need to worry any further,
my lord.

83
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,238
[Captain Park] How in the world?
How does something like this even happen?

84
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,199
Assistant Officer Jung
has been released from jail already.

85
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,283
[Lee Dolgae scoffs]

86
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,744
[scoffs]

87
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,956
[laughs]

88
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,926
You're all idiots, you know that?

89
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,597
Why are you asking me?

90
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,477
How much do they pay you?

91
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:59,442
You work till you drop,
and barely make enough to live.

92
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,445
You sweat for years and years,

93
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,907
and can you even afford a house
in Hanyang?

94
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,162
Yet you still don't know
what you need to do?

95
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,290
[sighs]

96
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,794
Whether or not
all of your families have to starve

97
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,339
depends entirely on you.

98
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,595
[sighing] Of course, sir. I'm well aware.

99
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,140
Raid the homes of those around Jung Chun.

100
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,809
-Find something to charge him with.
-[Captain Ji] Yes, sir.

101
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,020
Or make something up if you need to.

102
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,441
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

103
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,955
[Chief Kang] My lady,
did you want to see me?

104
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,416
Yes.

105
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,596
-Chief Kang.
-Yes?

106
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,098
I've been told it rained a lot
in the south,

107
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,601
and because of it
the cost of salt doubled.

108
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,979
So, the Hanyang merchants are
going through difficult times right now.

109
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,650
It sounds like the shortage is bad.
Might this be true?

110
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,985
It's as you say.

111
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,445
Then why?

112
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,075
Why's our storage
filled up to the brim with salt?

113
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,369
How is this possible?

114
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,996
The deficit is quite significant.

115
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,793
Well, it seems somebody is blocking
our salt roads.

116
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,836
Who could be doing that?

117
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,923
Perhaps the bandits?

118
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,216
It's not them.

119
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,344
They do not control those roads.

120
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,428
Then...

121
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,224
who's behind it?

122
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,144
My lady, do you know
how many roads stretch across Joseon?

123
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,854
I think.

124
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,857
Are you talking about the roads
where goods come and go?

125
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,651
Do any other roads matter?

126
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,486
[chuckles softly]

127
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,616
Out of all the roads across Joseon,

128
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,704
I believe there are exactly six
through which our goods are distributed.

129
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,122
[exhales]

130
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,541
Starting with the Gyeonggang River,
which is in the middle,

131
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,753
first is the road to Uiju, right,
that goes through Pyongyang?

132
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,549
It's used to trade with the Ming
and where envoys come and go.

133
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,219
The next one is the road
that takes you to Gyeongheung,

134
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,929
through Wonsan and Cheorwon.

135
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,851
The one after that goes through Wonju,
Gangneung as well.

136
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,769
It leads all the way to Pyeonghae.

137
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,188
To get to Dongnae,
you'd take Yeongnam road.

138
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,942
The one that goes through Jeolla
is Samnam road.

139
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,319
And Ganghwa road leads to the west coast.

140
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,363
Excluding Pyeonghae and Gyeongheung,

141
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:54,159
those four are the ones
we need for distribution.

142
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,952
[Chief Kang] That is correct,

143
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,246
and Officers sometimes block them

144
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,332
in order to halt distribution
and stop the flow of trade.

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,795
They do this to merchants who have lost
their favor to bring them in line.

146
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,131
You once said,

147
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,509
that bandits can be much more helpful
than Officers can.

148
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,011
Yes.

149
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,973
I'm starting to understand exactly
what you meant.

150
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,226
Unfortunately, whoever initiated
this road block,

151
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,605
they're unlikely to end it easily.

152
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,402
[Seomseom] My lady,
Lord Choi requests your presence at once.

153
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,655
[huffing]

154
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,118
[door opens]

155
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,128
Because of her,
we'll face serious consequences.

156
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,214
What has she done to anger you?

157
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,634
She submitted an appeal
to the Inspector General's Office!

158
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,971
Father, wait! If something is wrong,
we must try and correct it.

159
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,264
You fool.

160
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,101
The corrupt money you were speaking of,

161
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,229
do you need me to tell you
where it's all flowing to?

162
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:09,234
You see how much salt we have in stock?
You don't know why, do you?

163
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,613
The Court is compromised.

164
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,032
The Young Doctrine
and the Southern factions,

165
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,867
all the power is in their hands.

166
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,328
If you lose their favor,
you won't last long,

167
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,955
even if you have ten lives.

168
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,499
-That's just nonsense to me.
-Nothing is nonsense

169
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,876
when you're the one with all the power.

170
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,045
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,006
-Eun cannot trade any longer.
-Please wait.

172
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,883
You are not fit to work for the guild.

173

[♪ somber music playing]

174
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,943
Seo Changtae, the merchant of Uiju,
has requested to marry you.

175
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,739
His people arrive here in nine days.

I've heard at the Gyeonggang River,
there is a talented man.

They say he's brave and very skilled.

[grunts] I can't take the heat
much longer. Fine!

353
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,446
I'm risking it and going in.

354
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,699
Brother! No! What if you get into trouble?

355
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,910
Then what will you do?

356
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,620
[indistinct chatter]

357
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:33,871
I'm coming with you.

358
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,251
[indistinct chatter]

359
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,424
[Chief Kang] He's the forefinger of Mapo.

360
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,468
Everyone calls him Jang.

361
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:53,432
He's not just good at fighting,
he's also well-liked even by the laborers.

362
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,810
I admit that I thought he was a parasite
at first.

363
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,480
It would seem I was wrong about him.

364
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:04,318
He pays the laborers what they're worth,
and he eliminated the unfair charges

365
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,487
like the shade charge, and water charge,

366
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,238
and the excrement charge.

367
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,368
By all accounts,
he seems to be of good character.

368
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,079
[Seomseom] My lady,

369
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,455
what...

370
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,790
Why are you grinning like that?

371
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,960
Hmm? [chuckles]

372
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,213
Go bring us a bowl of water, if you would?

373
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,132
-[chuckles] Yes.
-[Eun chuckles]

374
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,099
My lady.

375
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,558
[inhales]

376
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,769
Do you mean to say,

377
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,313
you went to the docks by yourself?

378
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,609
I went to see the ship
that sailed across the ocean.

379
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,278
And what did you make of it?

380
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:57,621
I heard that beyond the vast ocean
lay countless lands.

381
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:02,167
Ming, Japan, and even other countries
whose names we aren't familiar with.

382
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,630
The mystery of it all is amazing.

383
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:08,924
Indeed.

384
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,636
Joseon is a cramped
and suffocating country.

385
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,393
The world changes quickly,
but we are blocking it with a high wall.

386
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:25,149
And one day, we'll pay dearly
for how slowly we acted

387
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,151
and how far behind we were.

388
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,318
[chuckles softly]

389
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,629
Hey.

390
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,717
What do you think? [exclaims]

391
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,974
It's like a pearl necklace on a swine.

392
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,893
Seriously?

393
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,521
I must look great! [chuckles]

394
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:07,941
You're flattering me a lot today. [laughs]

395
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:14,615
Siyul, right now,
a man is taking over Gyeonggang River.

396
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,325
He goes by Wang Hae.

397
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,578
You can almost smell the bloodlust.

398
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,748
If Yongsan falls, he'll be coming here.

399
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,710
We need to raise taxes. There's no choice.

400
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,546
Go find fifty men,
ones who are good at cursing.

401
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,090
The worst-tempered ones you can find.

402
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,426
If we gather people, then we need
to give them food and clothing.

403
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:36,970
Do you even have that money?

404
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:40,265
We'll up the rush charge.
Start to tax the laborers twice as much.

405
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,601
-No, we won't.
-If you cut them slack from now on,

406
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,977
we're all gonna be dead soon.

407
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,063
Remember how we agreed to live together?

408
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,774
Here you go again,
sitting there, talking nonsense.

409
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,443
I swear I'm going to slice up
you and your friend's throats.

410
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:57,282
Be respectful.
Follow orders, and no complaining.

411
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,827
There's a saying I heard.

412
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,788
-Think now's the time for it.
-Which one?

413
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,043
Fuck you.

415
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:13,841
You crazy rascal. Come back here.

416
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,843
I'm not done talking. Hey asshole!

417
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:18,595
What's with kids these days?
[clicks tongue]

418
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:23,016
That fucking arsonist.
I should report his ass.

420
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,452
Let's go!

421
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,772
[breathing] Hey.

422
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:14,151
All the thumbs from every port
are meeting here tonight.

423
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,987
If a bandit's managed
to get this far in life,

424
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,198
it's like being Chief State Councilor.

425
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,036
[♪ sinister music playing]

426
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,377
That's him there.

427
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:37,507
That's Wang Hae.
He's the man who swept Dongho.

428
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,427
He was the general of a Jurchen Tribe.

429
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,471
So he's on a whole another level.

430
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:46,183
When he swings
his powerful fists like this... [exclaims]

431
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,353
...he could take out ten men at once...
[mimicking punches] ...and they're gone.

432
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,730
[inhales] He flashes in
from all directions,

433
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,191
and he can throw you off the roof
like... [mimicking wind]

434
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,068
...laying only one finger on you.

435
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,116
It's just what I've heard, okay?

436
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:04,910
I'm going in.

437
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,333

Aren't you gonna bow to me?

449
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:50,599
Hey now. Aren't we all
of the same status here?

450
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,642
-So why should I?
-[Gangseop] Careful now.

451
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,186
You should learn to shut up.

452
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,937
No one asked you what you think.

[Osam] He's intimidated.

You fool! Giants don't listen
to voices that tremble.

458
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,744
Be a little more fearless,

459
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,579
or else you'll be eaten up too.

460
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:16,083
[stuttering] Mapo is harder...

Don't you worry!

462
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,086
All right, then.

00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,796
Shall I try taking over?

00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,257
-Oh, goodness.
-[all laughing]

465
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,093
I guess I expected too much
from the thumbs.

[Osam] Osam of Seogang,
here to pay respects.

[♪ music continues playing]

477
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,872
Do you understand now?

478
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,625
If you act without a solid plan,
you risk everything.

479
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,002
You could even be killed.

480
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,422
You need to be prepared to defend yourself
even if that means taking a life.

481
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,425
My own safety is of no concern to me.

482
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,052
However, I would need to have
a good reason

483
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,304
should I have to kill someone.

484
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,097
Is the greater good not reason enough?

485
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,474
What is your definition
of the greater good?

486
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,852
Because that matters.

487
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,688
The flow of corrupt money has to end.

488
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,692
All of the taxes the bandits collect

489
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,570
are then passed to various loan lenders
throughout the nation,

490
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,782
who in turn loan that money to those
seeking to pay the military cloth tax.

491
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,367
TAX FOR EXCLUSION FROM MILITARY DUTY

492
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:19,414
[Yu Taeseok] If one is able to pay
this tax, they can avoid military duty.

493
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,584
And understandably, many use these loans.

494
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:27,756
In the end, Joseon's national defense
will be nothing but show.

495
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,301
What can I do? Tell me.

496
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,639
You need to track down the hand
that is in control of everything,

497
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,475
and shut them down.

498
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,395
Only then will the country rise again.

[laughs maliciously]

527
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,305
[breathing heavily]

528
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,011
[♪ music continues playing]

529
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,252
[clicking]

530
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,298
[groans softly]

531
00:36:58,091 --> 00:36:59,968
Sir, a word?

532
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,052
Go ahead.

533
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,430
Regarding Lady Eun.

534
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,599
She refuses to eat.

535
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:10,103
She's had nothing but water
for the past three days.

536
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,021
[servant] My lord,

537
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,733
a messenger
from the Senior Guardian General is here.

538
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,201
Why are you here?

539
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:28,079
The Senior Guardian General
would like to see you.

540
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,414
At this hour?

541
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,584
Yes. He wishes to meet right away.

542
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,383
Please wait here a moment.

543
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,138
[♪ dramatic music playing]

544
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,582
My lord. He is here.

545
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,668
I trust you've been well, my lord?

546
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,263
I want to show you something.

547
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,601
[door creaking]

548
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,025
[door clunking]

549
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,322
[door creaking]

550
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:30,785
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

551
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:29,719
Is this?

552
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:33,681
This is a map of Naju
marking the waterways of the region?

553
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,892
-Do you recognize it?
-Yes.

554
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:42,565
This map marks all the ginseng farms
in Punggi, it seems.

555
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,235
That's the Gyeonggang River.

556
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,864
That's Gyeongsang-do.

557
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,203
And that is Chungcheong.

558
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,539
And those maps show Hamgyeong-do.

559
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,835
That's Dumangang River if I...

560
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,797
You are.

561
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,344
How on earth
did you collect all these maps?

562
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:13,346
[blows]

563
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,433
It took nearly five years.

564
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:23,523
My plan is to take each one of these
and combine them into a single whole.

565
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,274
Surely you can't mean.

566
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,152
Every map you see in this room
serves a different purpose.

567
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:31,906
But if we were to connect all the roads
and turn them into one larger map,

568
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,325
then Joseon's provinces, all eight,

569
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,285
will seem as visible
as the lines on your hand.

570
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,705
Choi Jeongyeop,

571
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:42,208
find someone who has the connections
and is skilled enough

572
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,918
to complete this task.

573
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,297
You want me to find them?

574
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:51,426
No one has better insights
into a man's nature than you do.

575
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,388
In fact, your guild travels
to every corner of the country.

576
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,517
You could find somebody
with all the right skills.

577
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,148
And should I wish to refuse,

578
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,609
what would happen then?

579
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,029
It would be unwise to refuse.

580
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,246
If you do, I will haunt your nights
and torment you endlessly.

581
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,167
[laughs] It's only a little joke.

582
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:29,338
If you don't want to do it,
then what can I do? [laughs]

583
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:35,595
The state exams will be held soon.

584
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,223
I understand your son has been preparing
to take them again.

585
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:43,019
And he's wasting his time for nothing.
He doesn't know his place.

586
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,439
If you're willing to agree to it,
I could help him.

587
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:49,484
I'll recommend him for a minor post
at the Bureau of State Records.

588
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:51,611
What do you say?

589
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,867
Forgive me.

590
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:02,413
Would it be all right
if I asked you a question?

591
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,498
Yes, you may.

592
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,835
I can't help but wonder why
you're putting this map together.

593
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,093
Well...

594
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,720
Once the map is complete,

595
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:21,307
we will understand not only the movements
of money and people,

596
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,768
but also the flow of trade
and distribution.

597
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,270
It will help bolster our country's wealth.

598
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,982
The nation will benefit greatly.

599
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,693
And you have no other reason?

600
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,456
[♪ music concludes]

601
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,211
[pants]

602
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,025
[whistling]

603
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,086
My lord, you have come a long way.

604
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:27,308
Here. These are yours.

605
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,143
PERSONAL WOODEN IDENTIFICATION TAGS

606
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,938
It's your identification.
You're Joseon now.

607
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:34,190
Your generosity is boundless.

608
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,442
Take a bath in the Gyeonggang River.

609
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:39,362
Cleanse yourself
of that filthy Jurchen Tribe stench.

610
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:45,368
I heard an Assistant Officer
is causing trouble.

611
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:48,162
Need a hand? Should I go after him?

612
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:50,414
[laughs]

613
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,128
Don't waste your energy.
You'd be chasing a minnow.

614
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:59,173
If you make even a single mistake
when dealing with him,

615
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,258
it'd be a headache.

616
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:03,010
I'm simply here to follow your orders.

617
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:06,973
There is one more thing.

618
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,688
And you know,

619
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:18,901
it worries me a little.

620
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:22,530
After you've finished
feeding off of the Gyeonggang River,

621
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,075
who's next?

622
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:28,536
That's my concern.

623
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,710
So never forget.

624
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:41,507
The rope you're clinging on to right now
is one that I threw down.

625
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:53,936
[footsteps approaching, grunts]

626
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,277
[♪ dramatic music playing]

627
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:44,820
Chun.

[groans] What are you doing?

631
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:54,288
You idiot!
You ran away just to become a bandit?

Stop this now.

636
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,391
Wang Hae, that bastard...

637
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,189
he's the man who killed my mother.
