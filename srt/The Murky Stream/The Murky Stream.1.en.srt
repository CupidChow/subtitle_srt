1
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:09,092
DURING THE JOSEON DYNASTY,

2
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:12,596
THE LARGE WATERWAY ACROSS HANYANG
WAS CALLED GYEONGGANG RIVER

3
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,598
THE MOST THRIVING AND BUSTLING DOCK

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,433
Hey, over here!

5
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,227
ALONG THE GYEONGGANG RIVER WAS MAPONARU

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,394
Come on! Come on!

7
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,313
WITH THE CONSTANT INFLUX
OF BOATS AND MERCHANTS,

8
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,981
MAPO DEVELOPED INTO A LARGE MARKETPLACE

9
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,107
Hurry up.

10
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,818
Yeah, right here. Just drop it, okay.

11
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,654
Come on, get another load.

12
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,739
THE DOCK WAS OVERFLOWING
WITH MERCHANTS AND LABORERS,

13
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,450
AND AMONG THEM WERE BANDITS
WHO OVERSAW AND CONTROLLED THE SCENE

14
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,535


15
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:35,702
Now, now!

16
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,997
I need 10 men, 10 men for salt!

17
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,836
Come on. Come on.

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,089
No, I'm here first.

19
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,717
- Hey...
Get going!

20
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,178
PEOPLE HAD TO PAY A TAX TO BANDITS
TO BE ALLOWED TO WORK.

21
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:56,098
- Pay your selection tax.
Take your pass.

22
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,849
Without the pass, you can't work!

23
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,560
Whoa! Whoa!
And make sure you grab a carrier.

24
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,404
Hurry up! Move it. Move it, move it!

25
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,699
If I see any of you slacking off,

26
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,159
I'm gonna break all of your legs
and make you crawl!

27
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,546
No, it's over there.

28
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,673
You put it over there.

29
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,510
Yeah, good. Now come on. We gotta go.

30
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,855
The Murky Stream

31
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:49,735
ONE. ROGUES

32
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,195
- Get in line.
- Next.

33
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,947
What are you looking at?

34
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,032
Pass first.

35
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,702
PASS: A SIGN TO DISTINGUISH THE LABORERS

36
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,454
So here's your wage. Your tax.

37
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,248
WAGE: MONEY OR ITEM GIVEN
IN RETURN FOR LABOR

38
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,708
Hey, stop fighting.

39
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,794
You'll get your turn. Okay.

40
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,296
- Next up.
- Good work out there.

41
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,630
- Next.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:12,924
I want more.

43
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,011
What now? What?

44
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,763
We only earn two doe of rice,

45
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,724
you take half of it back as tax.

46
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,102
The other half...
don't we at least deserve that?

47
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,521
Who are you to whine about anything?

48
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,231
- Huh?
- I need enough to eat.

49
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,276
How do you expect me to live on this?

50
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,237
Give me a full doe of rice.
As you promised.

51
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,449
You have all these complaints.

52
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,992
Go hit the drum and call.

53
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,495
See if you can call His Majesty here.

54
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,707
Hey!

55
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,252
Anyone else thinks
this rice here isn't enough, huh?

56
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,384
If you can't work, don't work.

57
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,930
Hey, go there. Take all his wages
and make sure he never comes back.

58
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,223
Listen carefully.

59
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,143
If I ever see your face over here again,
you're dead.

60
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,521
Go. Give me that and leave.

61
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,023
- Let it go!
- Huh?

62
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,149
You son of a bitch.

63
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,986
- You better back away. This isn't yours!
- Why aren't you restoring order?

64
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,114
Die!

65
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,448
Rogue. Huh?

66
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,200
Where do you think you are?

67
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,870
Get away!

68
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,622
I'll cut you open.

69
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,748
Huh?

70
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,792
- What's this?
- Try me!

71
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,544
Don't come any closer.

72
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,546
Don't! Stay away!

73
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,172
You out of your mind?

74
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,340
I swear...

75
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,758
- Hold him.
- Grab him! Grab him!

76
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,760
Let go!

77
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:39,845
Let go!

78
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,474
Stomp on him, you rogues!

79
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,651
You keep pulling the same shit!
You bastard!

80
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,113
Ah... enough. Enough.

81
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,951
He'll die that way.

82
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,380
Huh? Eat all you want.

83
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,434
Are there any more complaints?

84
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,810
Or are we done here?

85
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:36,151
Peace reigns when all you commoners
learn how to keep your big mouth shut!

86
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:39,988
Next.

87
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,075
Hurry up now.

88
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,550
He's here.

89
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,307
Sit down.

90
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,435
Now...

91
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,190
Yoon goes first, let's see the taxes.

92
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,274
Yes, boss.

93
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,115
Hmm.

94
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,576
Mapo remains as peaceful as ever,
it seems.

95
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,078
That's good.

96
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,416
And tomorrow
we can all expect a sunny day.

97
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,918
Yes, boss.

98
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,798
Two <i>pil</i> of cotton, boss.

99
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,426
Look at you, Bang,
you've settled in quick.

100
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,513
It's all thanks to you.

101
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,024
This is silk, boss.

102
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,360
Dongmak, you little shit!

103
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,697
Got a handle on it now, huh?

104
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,201
Yes.

105
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,595
What is this?

106
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,932
Sorry to say, boss, Mudeok is quite short.

107
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,851
He only has half the tax here.

108
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,020
Uh, not quite. Uh...

109
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,439
Why do you have to say that?

110
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,399
It was that Officer Park prick,

111
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,569
he took a whole mal of rice...
and messed up our...

112
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,238
Shut up and pay your taxes
or else you're a traitor.

113
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,157
There's no reason to go there.

114
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,826
I was already gonna
get it all later.

115
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,536
- So it's...
- You can delay death,

116
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,121
but can't avoid taxes.

117
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,708
Oh, hey, don't tell me you're also
gonna weigh in on this.

118
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,712
You better offer up your clothes...
to make up for the missing tax.

119
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,922
That's the rule, no?

120
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,259
Are you suggesting I loosen the sash
and walk around naked like this?

121
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,472
I must say, my dear younger brother,

122
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,308
your wit truly has no equal.

123
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,150
Feeling shy?

124
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,694
Should I untie it for you, then?

125
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,497
Listen, kid...

126
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,876
you better cut it out.

127
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,588
It wouldn't be a good idea
to get on my nerves.

128
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,843
Let's be careful
with our words now.

129
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:49,928
You can stop.

130
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:54,182
You can stop trying to act tough in front
of the boys before you regret it.

131
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,477
You're an old man
who can't fight for shit.

132
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,188
Son of a bitch!
Watch your mouth or I'll...

133
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,570
You got a death wish?

134
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,993
Look here, huh?

135
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,081
You all know I've been a bandit so long
that my bones have hardened to steel.

136
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,458
Respect your elders.

137
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,962
- Boss.
- What is it?

138
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,296
At times like this,

139
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,509
it's custom to settle things
with a proper fight to restore order.

140
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,971
Our new recruits are all watching.
I hate to set a bad example.

141
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,264
Think of their discipline.

142
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,769
Mudeok.

143
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,813
Ah. Yes?

144
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,690
What do you make of this challenge?

145
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,818
Are you willing to fight him?

146
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,487
Oh, wait, Boss,
I wouldn't even think

147
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,948
of fighting a baby still wet
from the mother's womb.

148
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,035
- That wouldn't be fair.
- Sounds like you're scared.

149
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,328
What's wrong?

150
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,457
You said you had bones of steel.

151
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,263
Shit.

152
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,770
Come on, you piece of shit.

153
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,939
- How is this gonna turn out?
- Let's go.

154
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,941
Let's take this outside, huh?

155
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,736
Brother, is this really what you want?

156
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,863
You're a pathetic son of a bitch.

157
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,198
You're dead now!

158
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,366
You don't even know
how fucking dead you are.

159
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,993
Okay!

160
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,914
Now what are we waiting for?

161
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,540
Let's take this outside, asshole!

162
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,721
He's gonna show him.

163
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,318
Go.

164
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,779
Let's go!

165
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,864
Yeah, let's go!

166
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,168
Ha!

167
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,465
Ha!

168
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,309
Let's make this quick.

169
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,441
Oh!

170
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,989
Hey. Hey.

171
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,159
Hey. Come on!

172
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,762
Kids are adults.

173
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,140
They don't listen...

174
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,143
until they've had a beating.

175
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,938
Hit him!

176
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,234
Get back here!

177
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,989
- Wait!
- Coward!

178
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,325
Stop!

179
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,952
Brother, come out here and fight.

180
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,582
Have it your way.

181
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,042
All right.

182
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,671
Are you out of your mind, Mudeok?

183
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:54,923
What's wrong with you?

184
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,507
Why don't you shut your mouth?

185
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,637
Did you forget already, huh?

186
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,764
If Deokgae stopped
the fight a minute later,

187
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,725
you'd be up there in heaven
right now with your ancestors.

188
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,229
Who was it that restored order
to Maponaru, damn it?

189
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,648
It was all thanks Deokgae and me,
the two of us.

190
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,568
Now those scavengers and insects
are trying to steal my spot.

191
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,195
You just watch.

192
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,698
I'll wipe the floor with Bang and Yoon.
Then I'll be the forefinger again.

193
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,160
Wow, what ambition you got?

194
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:28,248
Why would anyone wanna be
the forefinger instead of the thumb?

195
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,124
- You're crazy.
- Hey!

196
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,794
You gotta learn that men like us
will only go so far.

197
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,504
Chief State Councilor at best.

198
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,839
Huh? Going for the crown,
though, is treason.

199
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,468
I always knew your ambitions were small.

200
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,513
I didn't know they were this...

201
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,892
This fucking son of a bitch!

202
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,937
Hey, you! With the hat!

203
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,106
Damn it.

204
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,276
Come here. Come on over.

205
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,074
What was that?

206
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,606
You are nothing but a fool.

207
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,913
That piece of shit.

208
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,416
Did you see how scared he was?

209
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,001
Brother, wait.

210
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,004
Those people,
they don't look like they're from here.

211
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,592
You little shits.

212
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,015
None of you can fight.

213
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,225
None of you have any guts.

214
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,479
Weaklings, all of you.

215
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,356
Just get out of the fucking way!

216
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,277
No one's in your way, though.
I mean, you could...

217
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,117
Oh, right, Mudeok.

218
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,870
While we're out here,
let's find you something to wear.

219
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,164
If you show up shirtless again,

220
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,249
your wife's gonna beat you
to death tonight.

221
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,376
Who will beat their husband
like that, huh?

222
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,629
I'll throw her out in the streets.

223
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,300
Get out! You refuse to touch your wife

224
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,136
but you run around naked, huh?

225
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,472
Why don't you
take your clothes off for me?

226
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,474
How dare you hit your husband like that?

227
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,600
You'll regret this!

228
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,352
Get back here. You...

229
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,896
Forget the day job,
at least do your night job!

230
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,648
Everything's backwards here.

231
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,982
Get back here!

232
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,692
Fine, then! Run!

233
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,278
Oh, that man. Asshole!

234
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,866
<i>♪ I can't go on ♪</i>

235
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,829
<i>♪ I can't go on ♪</i>

236
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:20,128
♪ <i>I can't live</i>

237
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:25,007

238
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:30,680

239
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,515
♪ <i>A mess</i> ♪

240
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,892
Oh! You're here today, brother.

241
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,229
Oh...

242
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,607
What brings you all the way
here today, brother Bang?

243
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,111
Look at you, lounging around
without a care in the world.

244
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,113
Oh's guild needs 10 men to carry rice.

245
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,491
Oh. They told me
to put the salt first, though.

246
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,577
When the higher-ups
tell you to do something,

247
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,454
you better do it instead
of talking so much. Yeah?

248
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,791
Tell me you understand, huh?

249
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,335
Get it done.

250
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,754
Yeah, I got it. Okay. Thank you.

251
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,131
- Here.
- I'll take care of it.

252
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,300
You can count on me.

253
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,972
You rotten son of a bitch.

254
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,932
Have his manners gone into exile?

255
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,518
I'll start recruiting folks now.

256
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,020
He's dead to me.

257
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,441
I need 10 men to carry rice up.

258
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,901
All right?

259
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,033
You dropped something.

260
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,492
Gather up!

261
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,577
Two!

262
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,204
- 3!
- 4!

263
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,580
- 5!
- 7!

264
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,957
- Eight!
- Nine! And 10! The line ends here.

265
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,126
Hey, old man, no work for you.

266
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,461
Next time, all right?

267
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,005
- Come back next time.
- Everyone else, fuck off.

268
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,382
- Get out of here. Okay?
- Go, go, go.

269
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,218
- Get going!
- Okay.

270
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,595
We'll collect your selection charge.
Pay the tax!

271
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,055
Hurry. Pay the tax.

272
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,891
- Take your passes.
Pay your tax.

273
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,352
It's just a little bit.

274
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,562

Go ahead, the carriers are that way.

275
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,481
Pay your selection charge.

276
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,608
Here.

277
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,986
Here, take your pass.
Without the pass, you don't count.

278
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,137
Hey, Mudeok, what's going on here?

279
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,764
Now what's wrong?

280
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,307
This isn't the correct order.

281
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,017
The salt should be unloaded first.

282
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:43,062
I just do whatever I'm told to do.

283
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,940
When it comes to the order,
I have no say in that.

284
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,817
I docked my boat half a day ago.

285
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,070
How can you ignore that
and unload the rice before the salt?

286
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,240
Look, it's not me
that makes the decision, huh?

287
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,158
If you've got a problem,

288
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,369
go find the higher-ups
and ask them what to do.

289
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,453
Good grief.

290
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,500
That bastard, he's still showing
his face around here.

291
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,335
Shit.

292
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,087
Hey! You!

293
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,463
Damn it.

294
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,507
Here!

295
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,802
Hey, what did I tell you, huh?

296
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,596
You can't work here anymore.

297
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,888
Please allow me to work.

298
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,099
I will never complain
about the wage again.

299
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,191
Wait, are you crazy?

300
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,235
Yoon, we have to talk.

301
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,488
We docked three days ago,
I was pushed back again.

302
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,282
That's supposed to mean something?

303
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,658
Clouds are forming.

304
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,328
And? Stay patient and wait your turn.

305
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,997
If it starts to pour,
I could lose over half the salt.

306
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,416
Shut up, you idiot.

307
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,753
Look here, young man.

308
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,796
Mapo has always had certain customs.

309
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,132
We know
it's always been first in, first out.

310
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,092
Hey, look. Listen.

311
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,513
It's not like
I'm the one who makes the law.

312
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,935
We are not passing any laws. Right, boys?

313
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,315
I want to talk to your boss, then.

314
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,194
The esteemed Chief Kang
is gonna head up.

315
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,196
One more shot.

316
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,875
Lord Deokgae.

317
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,421
What do you mean by "lord"?

318
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,382
The real lord will be disappointed.

319
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,050
Hmm.

320
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,970
Would you move up my turn in line?

321
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,348
I'm carrying salt,
I'll be in trouble if it rains.

322
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,308
When rain's involved...

323
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,727
everyone's in a hurry.

324
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:47,812
Are they not?

325
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,944
Now that's a despicable tactic.

326
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,117
That covers the rush charge.

327
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,119
Can you please hurry?

328
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,788
Yoon, you hear that?

329
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,039
I hear you, Boss.

330
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,083
Chief Kang should be rushed ahead.

331
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,169
Got a rush order in for Choi's guild!

332
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,337
Much appreciated.

333
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,172
You take care now.

334
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,431
So you shift the order
and they pay a charge.

335
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,225
A rain charge for the rain.

336
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,936
A flood charge if there's a flood.

337
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,939
And the commoners'
blood and sweat,

338
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,316
you make sure to squeeze them dry.

339
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,026
Let's compare, then.

340
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,155
That's nothing.

341
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,574
A drop of piss in the Gyeonggang River.

342
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,325
An inspection charge for inspecting.

343
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,786
A training charge for training.

344
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,874
A charge for new assignments
and another charge for leaving.

345
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,671
The amount
that we're squeezed by our lords,

346
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,632
we don't have a drop of sweat left either.

347
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,720
Not a drop, huh?

348
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,681
Not a drop left, you say.

349
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,767
Not a drop.

350
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,491
I could tear you apart right now.

351
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,577
I show a bit of mercy
and he walks all over me.

352
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,870
Is that it?

353
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,414
No, I would never. My lord, I wasn't...

354
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,875
Then why do you speak when I'm speaking?

355
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,044
Come here.

356
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,799
Closer.

357
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,514
If you do not watch your tongue...

358
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,975
you could die.

359
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,311
Without a doubt, my lord.

360
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,537
Drink it.

361
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,624
Oh.

362
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,751
All right, yes, thank you.

363
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,728
What a fool. I was just joking.

364
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,566
You were so scared.

365
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,528
- Hey! Pour me a glass.
- Yes.

366
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,863
Of course, my lord. Yes.

367
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,163
Good evening, sir. Allow me to enter.

368
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,385
We finished. Everything's been unloaded.

369
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,138
You paid a rush charge, I heard.

370
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,806
I had to pay.

371
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,560
On top of everything else,
a rush charge.

372
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,061
Those thieving bastards.

373
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,105
Father.

374
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,066
The bandits are only petty thieves.

375
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,777
They're just someone else's tools.

376
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,573
The real issue is the officials
who sit around milking the rewards

377
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,491
of their corruption from the shadows.

378
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,786
What's this nonsense?
Have you been drinking?

379
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,872
We know the bandits
are reporting to someone.

380
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,081
Silence, you fool.

381
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,666
You should know when to stop.

382
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,627
We're only merchants.

383
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,923
Words like those will bring us trouble,
so we ought to be careful.

384
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,215
That's why...

385
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,676
That's why I need to become an official.

386
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,888
You can't be an official
if you don't even pass the exam.

387
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,641
You've been saying
you'd pass for 10 years now.

388
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:56,268
It's time you learned the trade.

389
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,607
That life isn't for me.

390
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,443
If one is born as a man,

391
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,363
it's his duty to rise to office
in order to rule the world.

392
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,198
Wouldn't you agree?

393
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,204
My one and only son, a rainbow chaser.

394
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,830
There's more, sir.

395
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,916
I checked the storage earlier.

396
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,502
A number of items from Ming
appear to be missing.

397
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,381
They're missing from the safe?
Who could have taken them?

398
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,715
Who else could it be?

399
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,679
SABYEOKHEON

400
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,222
These are precious.

401
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,599
So please accept my apologies in advance,

402
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,395
as I can't offer this opportunity
to everyone.

403
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,105
How precious could it be?

404
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,400
Considering you want two <i>pil</i> of silk,
let's have a look at it.

405
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,026
I'll be the judge.

406
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:55,619
As you're aware,

407
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,415
in Joseon, it's impossible to find
anything made of gold at the moment

408
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:05,045
since His Majesty had it prohibited
for being far too extravagant.

409
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,216
However...

410
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,845
this object was an offering
from a Ming envoy.

411
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,471
It could be yours.

412
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,559
- Isn't that exciting?
- Enough.

413
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,686
I will take it off your hands.

414
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,480
Yes.

415
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,776
Madam...

416
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,904
do you know Yu Rang of Qin?

417
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,074
He once spoke these immortal words.

418
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:39,246
"A meaningful man will lay down his life
for someone who sees who he is."

419
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,210
"Whether it's men or things,"

420
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:49,006
"they won't shine until they're met
with someone who sees their value."

421
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,009
That said,

422
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,803
who here would like to meet that value?

423
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,732
Oh, my goodness!

424
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,193
You look like a celestial maiden.

425
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,819
How beautiful.

426
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,447
They call it <i>wagasa</i> in Japan.

427
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,699
Look how beautiful it is.

428
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,034
Imagine you're out boating.

429
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,369
What better to give you shade
from the sun?

430
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,580
- Ten nyang!
- Five nyang more!

431
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,499
- Ten nyang more!
- Ten nyang more!

432
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,751
<i>Lift it up! High!</i>

433
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,921
Little brat.

434
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:33,383
I told you to get married,
not steal and sell someone's property.

435
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,637
I did not steal, we're family.

436
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,807
- And it was family property.
- Higher, you brat!

437
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,561
I got five <i>pil</i> of silk for it.

438
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:45,646
What?

439
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,857
It was worth two <i>pil.</i>
My profit was more than double.

440
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:52,361
You... You're telling me
you made five <i>pil?</i>

441
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,697
Father...

442
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,118
you know I want to be a merchant.

443
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,369
Right?

444
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:02,913
Please, Father.

445
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,456
A girl cannot learn the trade.

446
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,377
It's hard. Being a merchant
is nothing like dealing with ladies.

447
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,837
You may not realize, Father...

448
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,756
ladies can be as difficult
to sell to as men.

449
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,133
Ah, are you still at it?

450
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,803
I'll make my business silk
instead of salt and lumber.

451
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,429
Nice, pretty silk.

452
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,014
Raise it.

453
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,809
Lift the pot!

454
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,211
Assistant Officer Lee is here.

455
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,286
Start upstream, Ilsam.

456
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:26,747
YONGSANJIN
SEOGANGJIN

457
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,875
Ilsam of Seogang, my lord.
I hope everything has been going well.

458
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,211
Dochi of Yongsan. Pleasure, my lord.

459
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,922
YONGSANJIN

460
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,340
Deokgae of Mapo.

461
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,424
MAPOJIN

462
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,842
Here to pay respects.

463
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,347
Chadol of Dongho here.

464
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,390
DONGHOJIN

465
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,475


466
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,228
Jakdu of Nodeul. Allow me to bow.

467
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,730
NORYANGJIN

468
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,816
- Yes, yes.
Gaebong of Hangang River.

469
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,693
HANGANGJIN

470
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,905
-
Greetings, Gangseop of Dongjak.

471
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,491
DONGJAKJIN

472
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,993
You're gathered here today
for two reasons.

473
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,705
First, I want you to crack down
on nomads entering the capital.

474
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,334
Drive them off
before they dock at the port.

475
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,378
I won't hold any of you accountable...

476
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,254
should someone die.

477
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,215
Yes, my lord.

478
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,092
Inspection charge next.

479
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,010
Our coffers are empty.

480
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,638
The country's struggling financially.

481
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,266
However, exams are over
and new officials have been appointed.

482
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,518
We must celebrate.

483
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,063
So for the time being,
I'll double the inspection charge.

484
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,856
Understood?

485
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,985
Yes, understood.

486
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,987
- And Jakdu.
- Yes?

487
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,115
Your mother's 49th day since passing,
isn't it approaching?

488
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,242
Indeed, my lord.

489
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,161
I'll send <i>saeu-jeot</i>
and two quilted clothes.

490
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:51,581
- Just know that.
- You honor me deeply, my lord.

491
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,418
May you live long and prosper.

492
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,045
Right.

493
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,758
Stay focused
and tend to your duties.

494
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,930
It's Dochi, sir.
May I say a word, my lord?

495
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,891
Let's hear it, then.

496
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,977
Regarding Yanghwajin.

497
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,688
Smugglers who hail from outside

498
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,190
are starting to appear one by one
in our country.

499
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,985
I hear the court has been concerned
about it as well.

500
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,822
And the authorities,
they're not cracking down.

501
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,367
These rats roam about
with no consequences.

502
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,453
Fools like us...

503
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,329
we can't understand why that is.

504
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,414
And?

505
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:36,126
If you allow us, we can neatly
clean this entire mess.

506
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,836
We need to beat a few

507
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,962
to set an example.

508
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,006
It will not only strengthen
your position--

509
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,090
Enough!

510
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,094
I ought to fry those eyes of yours.

511
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,891
That would be a fitting reward
for this good deed.

512
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:54,436
What made you think this was a good idea?

513
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,396
To lecture your elders?

514
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,818
No, my lord. I would never dare to--

515
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,779
You think you have something to teach me?

516
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,363
And I was so generous.

517
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,327
Well, then, what were you saying?

518
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,288
What do you wish to do?

519
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,416
Huh?

520
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,335
My lord, I was only...

521
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,505
I beg your forgiveness!

522
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,800
You should just do as I say.
Who are you...

523
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:26,676
- to judge...
- My lord!

524
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,304
and decide anything?

525
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,349
Please spare me.

526
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,101
You just need to do as you're told!

527
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:35,852
I do the thinking!

528
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,105
Got that?

529
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,029
I'll say it again.

530
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,156
With everything in disarray,

531
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,242
I don't need your opinions.

532
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,286
Do as you're told and do it well.

533
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,831
My lord.

534
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,126
We dogs have been nothing but loyal.
Show us mercy.

535
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,336
Then just carry out your duties.

536
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,561
That fucking bastard!

537
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,647
- That ugly piece of shit lost his temper.
- I'm tired of this.

538
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,441
One of these days,
I'll stick a knife in his neck!

539
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,235
You'll see!

540
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,742
Hey, Jang's guild needs 12 men.

541
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,161
Good to see you, brother.

542
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,163
It's heavy cargo, all right?

543
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:21,124
So make sure to select the ones
with strong legs.

544
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,501
Hey, don't worry.
I'll take care of it, brother.

545
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,587
Who do you have here? It's Mudeok.

546
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,422
Mudeok? That's why we're worried!

547
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,758
He mouths off too much.

548
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,510
Fresh out of his mother's womb

549
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,346
yet he has no idea what respect is.

550
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,264
The selection begins now.

551
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:41,853
Twelve men to carry heavy cargo!

552
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:51,029
- Get out of my way.
- Get back in line.

553
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,199
- Count from the front.
- One.

554
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,283
- Two.
- Three.

555
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,368
- Four.
- Five.

556
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,494
- Six.
- Seven.

557
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,578
- Eight.
- Nine.

558
00:33:58,662 --> 00:33:59,663
- Ten.
- Eleven.

559
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,164
- Twelve.
- Up to there.

560
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,290
Everybody else...

561
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,758
Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

562
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,553
What's this geezer doing here?

563
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,013
Get rid of him.

564
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,098
Hey, young man!

565
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,017
Yeah, you, the fresh one. Get over here.

566
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,894
Hey, Beanpole, he means you.

567
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,604
Hey, wait!

568
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,399
How can you change the order?
It's my turn now.

569
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,693
Just take a look at how heavy
all that cargo is.

570
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,695
You're a mung beansprout.

571
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,280
- Too small and weak.
- Not fair.

572
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,282
I've been waiting here since dawn today.

573
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,784
Please let me work! Show me some mercy.

574
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,869
Aw, how diligent!

575
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:42,580
I haven't... I haven't eaten in two days.

576
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:46,293
I know I may look weak but I can do
the work of two or three.

577
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,628
So, please, please give me a chance.

578
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,755
Okay, sure. Hey, move it along.

579
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,799
Hey, if you have your pass, move.

580
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,719
- No!
- Shut up, already!

581
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,470
Stupid old man!

582
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,266
Come on, what do you think you can do?

583
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,810
Huh?

584
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,109
We're done.

585
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,820
When the boss tells you no,
you need to listen.

586
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,615
- You like living, right?
- Please.

587
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,617
I beg you, let me work today.

588
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,286
Otherwise my family will starve to death.

589
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,788
Please, give me the pass.

590
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,083
- What are you waiting for?
- Move him out of here.

591
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,253
- Let's go.
- What are you doing?

592
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:31,671
Get him back.

593
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,632
Hey, young man, you know me, don't you?

594
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,134
- Hey, hey, hey! Get him out of here.
- You know me.

595
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,345
- Tell them you won't--
- Grab him.

596
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,347
I beg you, tell them!

597
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,932
Please! Please talk to them!

598
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,018
Please, please!

599
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,646
Young man! Young man!

600
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,606
Let's go for a swim.

601
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,858
Okay, bye-bye!

602
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,450
You don't want to work?

603
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,410
Should I give it to someone else?

604
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,416
Go on!

605
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,308
Oh, shit.

606
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,310
His shoulder's like a rock.

607
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,288
Hey!

608
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,290
Come over here.

609
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,386
What the...
You little shit, wait a minute.

610
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,813
When an elder calls you,
you should bow and say,

611
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,983
"Thank you for your generosity."

612
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,246
I'm waiting.

613
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,331
Well?

614
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,753
- Thank you for your generosity.
- That's right.

615
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,464
Haven't seen you around here.

616
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,140
Whoa, look at that body!

617
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,518
What are you? Are you a runaway soldier?

618
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:52,479
No, sir, I'm not.

619
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,023
Are you on the run from the law?

620
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,068
Why are you asking me?

621
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,905
Well, you're not just some commoner.

622
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,908
Not when you've got sword scarring
like that.

623
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,075
Huh?

624
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,078
I got hurt while I was working.

625
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,955
I can tell you're lying.

626
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,749
Just by looking at the claws,

627
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,460
I can tell if it's a docile kitten
or a ferocious tiger.

628
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,176
I'd better get going.

629
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,220
To find more work.

630
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,224
Who said I was done talking?

631
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,290
I'm done.

632
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,835
Go on.

633
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,222
See you around!

634
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,936
- Hey, brother.
- Huh?

635
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,272
Who's that, a worker?

636
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,065
Was he causing trouble?

637
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,735
- Hey, Walwal.
- Yeah?

638
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,737
Find out where he lives.

639
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:26,948
- That man?
- Yeah.

640
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,130
- Yoon?
- Yes, boss?

641
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:43,715
What's the delay?

642
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:47,135
I'm guessing there's a lot to unload
because it's an envoy.

643
00:39:55,935 --> 00:40:00,732
Ah, this is quite the turnout.

644
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,567
Move your asses!

645
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,194
Hey, these things are to be offered
to the king.

646
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,988
Be careful!

647
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:12,076
Oh, come on! Would you hurry up?

648
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,621
Huh, if I see any of you slacking off,

649
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:18,333
I'm gonna break all of your legs and make
you crawl the rest of the way.

650
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,043
- Out of the way.
- Ow!

651
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,519
What the hell?

652
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,526
Pass him up.

653
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:01,918
You fool.

654
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,836
Get your priorities straight.

655
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,172
Hurry up and get the luggage out.

656
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,675
- Now!
- The luggage?

657
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:10,927
Is wealth...

658
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,889
worth more than a man's life?

659
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,935
Do you really mean to ask me that?

660
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,396
People are like pebbles on a path.

661
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,315
Nothing's more worthless than human life.

662
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,278
How dare you?

663
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,369
You bastard.

664
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,913
Keep your eyes down.

665
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,666
You want to be dragged
to the Police Bureau?

666
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,711
I apologize.

667
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,381
Forgive me, sir.

668
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,386
You fool.

669
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,139
Don't you ever glare like that.

670
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,141
- Yes, sir.
- Go and fetch it now.

671
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,518
It's worth more than you.

672
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,645
Yes.

673
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,529
The King spoke.

674
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,614
The law's clear.

675
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:17,410
By unloading the minister's luggage,
you are working for the country

676
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,287
which means it's compulsory labor.

677
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,416
In other words,
that means there will be no pay.

678
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,544
- Keep that in mind.
- No pay?

679
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,964
Why do I hear murmuring while my brother's
out here talking?

680
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,675
Shut it! If you want to be selected, stay.

681
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,969
The rest of you leave. Scatter!

682
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,888
- Get out of here!
- Get moving!

683
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,099
If you're not paying us,
we should get fed.

684
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,853
We still get fed for compulsory labor.

685
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,606
- Those bastards.
- You there.

686
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,360
Come on up here. You're too far to hear.

687
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,572
It's the law. We all need to be fed.

688
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:08,211
What was that about the law?

689
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,009
Yeah, you heard him.

690
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,719
No matter if it's compulsory labor,

691
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,971
step right up if you're hungry.

692
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:20,765
Here's something to eat!

693
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,350
Huh?

694
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,020
No one?

695
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,897
Nobody wants to eat?

696
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,776
That's too bad for you.

697
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,325
This man might die
if no one steps forward.

698
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,952
Well?

699
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,954
He's bleeding pretty bad.

700
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,044
Okay, this is your last chance, huh?

701
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:52,713
Huh?

702
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,345
Hey, you.

703
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,931
Huh?

704
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,560
What's that look in your eye?

705
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:10,022
No matter where you go, there's always
one loach that dirties the water.

706
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,202
Wow, you got some muscles on you.

707
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,288
Oh!

708
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,831
You're the man, huh?

709
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,457
What a man he is!

710
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,896
Stop looking at me like that.

711
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,530
Damn you.

712
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,077
I was gonna let all of you off easy.

713
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,329
But I've changed my mind!

714
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,496
Huh?

715
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,625
Look at you all having fun.

716
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,543
Assistant Officer Lee!

717
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,462
What brings you here?

718
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,256
I don't care where you're from
or where you're going.

719
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,176
If I ever see you again, you're dead.

720
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,553
The lot of you are no better than rogues.

721
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,347
He's an innocent man.

722
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,515
You dare beat him in broad daylight?

723
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,727
Hey, hey, all of you.
You're dismissed. Quickly.

724
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,229
Quickly. Take him away.

725
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,356
- Hurry! Scatter!
- Come on!

726
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:37,401
Didn't I tell you not to cause any scenes
and just stay quiet?

727
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:40,321
Did I or did I not, huh?

728
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:49,455
I'm no longer able to ignore
the amount of complaints I've received.

729
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:52,583
Your misconduct is well known.

730
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,297
Hey, hurry! Go fill up a mal with barley

731
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,800
and deliver it to his house.

732
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,468
Okay.

733
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,263
Right, fill it up all the way.

734
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:06,764
Keep going. Faster.

735
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:09,642
Do you know which bandit lives longest?

736
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,270
The one who can read my mind.

737
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,568
Oh, shit.

738
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:23,114
I still feel like I'm on pins and needles
every time I see his face.

739
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:29,745
I guess His Majesty is lucky that son of
a bitch is one of his officials.

740
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,580
Hey, hey!

741
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:32,790
Mix sand in with that.

742
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,709
Put two handfuls in there, huh?

743
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,585
When he eats, his teeth will fall out.

744
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:38,587
Spit on it, all of us.

745
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,798
Now, where's the sand?

746
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:48,639
Which one of you stole my rice, huh?

747
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,016
Was it you?

748
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,183
Sit down.

749
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,978
Why do you always think
I did it, huh?

750
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,688
Show me your rice bag now!

751
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,649
Then what? You can tell whose rice it is?

752
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,610
- Shit! Show me, damn it!
- Wait!

753
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:03,279
- Hey!
- You son of a bitch!

754
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:09,785
It's mine!

755
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,121
I told you...

756
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,665
No, no, no, no!

757
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,337
<i>Sir, please, I beg you.</i>

758
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,921
<i>Let me work today.</i>

759
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,716
<i>Otherwise my family will starve to death.</i>

760
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,512
Please, I beg of you.

761
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,225
<i>I haven't... I haven't eaten in two days.</i>

762
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,211
Are you in here, old man?

763
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,258
Hello?

764
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,523
Hurry up! A man is dead!

765
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,567
This way! Over here!

766
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,319
Hurry!

767
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,495
What's happened? He's dead.

768
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,289
He's dead!

769
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,086
How could this happen?

770
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:49,487
Don't fall.

771
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,072
Careful up there!

772
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,116
Get down.

773
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,165
Right there! There!

774
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,749
What a pleasant day to go boating.
The water was very calm.

775
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,543
It was, wasn't it?

776
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,465
I spent so much money
on this dress.

777
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,834
How dare you taint this
with your filthy hands?

778
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,673
We should go.

779
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:54,612
Don't you think so?

780
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,197
Sure.

781
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,411
Oh, boy.

782
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,790
We've finished unloading.

783
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:08,626
Good. Well done.

784
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:11,045
You can all go home now. Go on.

785
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,797
What? Wait a minute. Where's our pay?

786
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,091
Look at them there. You see over there?

787
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:20,304
They're not from just any noble families.

788
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,014
That's the Scholar-official's wife

789
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,642
and Second State Councilor's
daughter-in-law.

790
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,935
How can we go and ask them for the wage?

791
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,980
No pay for compulsory labor yesterday.

792
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,901
Now we can't get paid
because they're from noble families.

793
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,987
How are we to make a living?

794
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,656
I'll tell you how.

795
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,240
Have you lost your mind?

796
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,451
Why are you glaring like that?

797
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,827
Go, get lost.

798
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,832
I can't starve anymore.
Just pay us.

799
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,210
Damn you!

800
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:55,589
What are you, a cow?

801
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:59,093
Did everything I say bounce off
that thick skull of yours?

802
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,970
They didn't pay me either so why
are you whining at me?

803
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,181
Go! Get paid, then.

804
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,767
What's going on with all of you?

805
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,770
I keep seeing you idiots talking back
more and more these days.

806
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,981
I'll seriously brand you as traitors
if you don't watch your step.

807
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:14,775
Do you hear me?

808
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,569
Answer me.

809
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:19,905
Answer me!

810
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,907
Yes.

811
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,284
Return the passes and go now.

812
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,789
You'd better keep your mouth shut.
Leave now. Scatter!

813
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,291
Sons of bitches.

814
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,130
Fine.

815
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,091
But if I find out you've been lying to me,

816
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,428
I'll kill you myself.

817
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,305
What?

818
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:47,266
You...

819
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,355
Wait, where are you going?

820
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,555
That was awfully rude of you.

821
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,809
Are you the lady
I saw earlier at the port?

822
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:34,021
- You went boating.
- And?

823
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,193
Who paid today for the boat ride?

824
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:41,111
Was it one of you?

825
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,739
I was the one who paid.

826
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,745
Please pay us.

827
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:51,872
You owe us our wages.

828
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,249
Wages? What do you mean?

829
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,878
You got our labor so
someone has to pay for the work,

830
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,796
no matter how noble your family is.

831
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,591
No one should work for free.

832
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,429
That's not it, my lady.
We paid for everything up front.

833
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:11,266
As far as I was told, we paid for
both the boat and the laborers.

834
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:13,936
You heard her.

835
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,148
You're blocking the road?

836
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,069
They told me that they weren't paid.

837
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,821
You really think a Choi's guild noblewoman
would lie

838
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,198
just to save so little?

839
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,575
I'm sorry.

840
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,662
But no one received any pay.

841
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,997
Let us pass or you'll regret it.

842
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,171
Look what we have here.

843
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:44,132
Now you're really out of line.

844
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,976
My lady!

845
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,689
Tell the lady you're sorry. Go on.

846
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,068
No apology?

847
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:05,862
I haven't eaten in three days.

848
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:08,907
Brother, let's knock some sense
into him already.

849
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,412
I don't know what's going on.

850
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,250
All I know is, I wasn't paid for the work.

851
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:20,836
You haven't learned.

852
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,590
Nothing a good beating won't fix.

853
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,433
My lady, you should go.

854
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,393
Leave this fool to me.

855
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,190
- Be on your way.
- All right.

856
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,318
We should go.

857
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:47,362
Unless...

858
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,742
you'd like to witness
the death of this dog.

859
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,002
Don't just stand there.

860
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,545
Surround him.

861
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:31,698
Now that we ate,

862
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,910
let's work off a little sweat.

863
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,748
Know that I'm not a kind person.

864
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,708
That just makes it better.

865
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,752
We don't put up with rebels.

866
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:48,006
- All this for a doe of rice?
- Look at those eyes.

867
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,592
Oh, my, oh, my.

868
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,011
You bastard.

869
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:55,347
You got a real death wish, don't you?
