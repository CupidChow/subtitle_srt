Is there a reason for your concern?

That criminal wasn't even questioned yet.

So why was he released?

46

And that is that.

Malbok was the one who started the fight

Wang Hae was defending himself
against the man who tried to kill him.

How can we charge him for doing that?

If anyone is guilty,
it should be the boy who started it.

can also command the country.

180
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,845
And now maps are seen
as treasonous and forbidden.

181
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,974
This is an act of rebellion as I see it.

182
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,058
What could it be...

183
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,811
if not for treason?

184
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,898
My! It is! [laughs]

185
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,109
However, My Lord,

186
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,362
it's only a suspicion.

187
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,572
But it's true that a lot of people

188
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:05,410
still trust and follow
the Senior Guardian General.

189
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,954
Don't you think
that's actually better for us?

190
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,792
The commoners trust and follow him
as if he were king.

191
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,253
If that's not a traitor, then what is?

192
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,674
The Senior Guardian General
was an outstanding government official

193
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,967
and officer,

194
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,971
yet I never respected the General
at any point along his career.

195
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,850
Ultimately, human nature
is like a starving demon.

196
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:33,229
It's all disgusting and rotten.
It's total hypocrisy.

197
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,315
And do not forget.

198
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:39,861
His death is the only way
for you to survive.

199
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:46,034
By working tirelessly,
I'll bring to you evidence you require

200
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,910
to prove he's guilty of treason.

201
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,419

00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,901
Who's there?

204

[Jung Chun sighs]

205
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,830
It's late out. Why are you here?

206
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,666
I came all this way...

207
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,004
because I need to ask you
to do me a favor.

208
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,631
What kind of favor?

209
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,350
[sighs]

210
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,113
JUNG CHUN

211
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,239
What?

212
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,451
How did you get your hands on this?

213
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,122
Siyul was never able to leave Mapo,
you see... [inhales]

214
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,667
all because of that letter.

215
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,461
Just tell me what's happening.

216
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:25,591
I am worried that right now,

217
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,469
Siyul is heading
straight into the belly of the beast.

218
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,142
Only you can put a stop to him, My Lord.

219
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,521
Siyul needs to leave Mapo
for his own good.

220
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,358
So convince him to go.

You have my condolences.

I heard you cherished the boy
like he was a brother.

231

Are you going to be okay?

232

You seem determined not to say anything.

234
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,896
A man named Mudeok, he gave this to me.

235
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,780
Siyul, why didn't you tell me?

236
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,284
I had never expected that
my letter would put you in this situation.

237

Are you really planning on
going through with this?

Chun.

I think you'd better go.

I don't wish to talk to anyone right now.

241
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,851
You can hold it against me if you want.

242
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,938
But I don't want you to get hurt.

243

Truly.

You needn't worry.

How could I fault you for that?

246
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,494
You do what you have to do.

247
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,249
And I'll do what I have to.

248
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,960

You okay?

This letter...

257

Thank you.

258
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,878
You can bring it with you...

Go wherever you want.

261
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,887
You treat bandits as if we're snakes.

262
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,392
These days, I've been getting
really sick of seeing you.

263
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,186
If you want me to leave, I will.

264
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,397
But first...

265
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,943
I will give back
what I owe you before I do.

266
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,655
How thick in the head
could you possibly be, kid?

267
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,825
Pursuing revenge is a bad idea.

268

Wang Hae's not someone
you should mess with.

269

Whatever you say,
it won't make a difference to me.

I swear...

271
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,340
I will make him pay no matter what.

272
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,093
And then what?

273
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,804
Have you considered
the consequences at all?

274
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,849
After you cause a scene
and leave us all here?

275
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,976
Do you think we can survive on our own?

276
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,646
I'm beggin' you not to do anything
for our sakes and just go!

277
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:32,523
Sorry, but I can't.

278
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,775
You idiot!

279
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,861
So we'll be stuck
eating filthy rice again,

280

and it'll all be thanks to you?

Do you think I can't just kill you myself?

282
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,285
If I take this letter over
to the Police Bureau,

283

they wouldn't hesitate
to slice your tongue off with an axe!

00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,176

[Lee Dolgae]
You've taught me to be patient.

300
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,506
To wait...

301
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,009
Until I know that
the fruit has been ripened.

302
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,594
Absolutely.

303
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:30,850
If you pick the fruit when it's not ripe,
you cannot enjoy the sweet flavor.

304

The time is upon us.

305

No, that is exactly how it must be done.

I want you to tear him apart limb by limb

[Yu Taeseok] I know you understand
how important this map is.

550
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,796
If it ends up in the hands

551
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,506
our whole nation could be at risk.

552
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,885
Joseon and its people
could face extinction.

553

Step aside, we can let you walk away.

Shut your mouth.
