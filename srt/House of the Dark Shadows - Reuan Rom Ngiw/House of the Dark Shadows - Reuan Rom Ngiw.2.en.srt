"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 2)

19
00:01:59,483 --> 00:02:00,608
I don't believe

20
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:02,700
that my father killed my mother.

21
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:04,976
It must have been someone elses's doing.

22
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:07,108
I will find out the truth

23
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:08,749
about what happened.

24
00:02:15,647 --> 00:02:17,640
And this is Ms. Malai,

25
00:02:17,882 --> 00:02:19,195
my bride-to-be.

26
00:02:20,148 --> 00:02:21,148
Malai!

27
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,476
Miss Bu-nga!

28
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:26,453
Ms. Malai, watch out!

29
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:30,891
Dech!

30
00:02:31,344 --> 00:02:32,482
Dech helped me when

31
00:02:32,507 --> 00:02:34,349
the red cotton tree branch fell on me!

32
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:36,390
Please spare him, I beg you!

33
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:57,546
At long last, my sole younger brother

34
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,601
has found a match.

35
00:02:58,656 --> 00:02:59,976
It's a shame that the lady

36
00:02:59,992 --> 00:03:01,437
of the house has already passed,

37
00:03:01,453 --> 00:03:02,578
for she would've taken

38
00:03:02,586 --> 00:03:03,703
great pleasure in the news.

39
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:04,945
I owe you great thanks

40
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:07,250
for presenting Ms. Malai to me,

41
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:08,929
without your introduction

42
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:10,320
I might never get married.

43
00:03:11,703 --> 00:03:12,726
And where might

44
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:14,109
the bride's relatives be found?

45
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:16,108
I had hoped to make their acquaintance,

46
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:18,155
as you and the lady are soon to be wed.

47
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,326
It is I, elder brother to Malai.

48
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:29,287
Did you come alone, sir?

49
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,818
Malai is but a daughter born

50
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:32,084
of my father's concubine.

51
00:03:32,108 --> 00:03:33,841
My coming alone suffices.

52
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:36,240
Regardless, I remain grateful

53
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:37,677
for your compassion.

54
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,490
Initially, I feared Malai

55
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:40,966
might have served in the the royal halls

56
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:41,998
until her elder years.

57
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:43,466
But with the passing of Her Majesty,

58
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:44,982
we faced a dilemma.

59
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,093
It'd be wasteful for her

60
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:47,052
to remain with us.

61
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:49,420
Fear not,

62
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:52,052
once she becomes my daughter-in-law,

63
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:54,068
I shall take good care of her.

64
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:56,802
It matters not if you're

65
00:03:56,818 --> 00:03:58,185
unfamiliar with my son,

66
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:01,051
but surely you recognize me?

67
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:04,818
Indeed, sir.

68
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:06,037
I am aware

69
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,613
Malai's father had many offspring,

70
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:10,076
and upon his passing

71
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:11,621
left little wealth.

72
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:14,365
But when Malai assumes

73
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,795
the role of my daughter-in-law,

74
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:16,841
she shall no longer

75
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,935
be reliant on others.

76
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:19,240
And I hope none

77
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,326
would trouble my daughter-in-law.

78
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,639
Umm... And,

79
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,763
Where might Miss Malai be found?

80
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,162
I wish to see if she is truly as comely

81
00:04:33,178 --> 00:04:35,224
as Fueang has praised her to be.

82
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:46,851
Thank you.

83
00:05:57,932 --> 00:05:58,932
Thank you.

84
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:52,535
May you both be blessed

85
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:54,254
with offspring aplenty

86
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,205
and revel in each other's company

87
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,480
until the twilight of your years.

88
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,085
Thank you, sir.

89
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:26,229
Malai!

90
00:07:28,354 --> 00:07:29,474
Ms. Bu-nga!

91
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,287
How beautiful!

92
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,225
Are you Viscount Wisan Ratchamaitri?

93
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:55,901
My name is Bu-nga,

94
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,346
the daughter of

95
00:07:57,362 --> 00:07:58,854
the Eastern Trade Minister.

96
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:00,822
I am Malai's dearest friend.

97
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,549
Pleasure to make your acquaintance, all.

98
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:13,971
Nice to meet you, Ms. Bu-nga.

99
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:17,088
Many thanks, Ms. Bu-nga,

100
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:18,721
for gracing us with your presence

101
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:20,947
despite the suddenness of the ceremony.

102
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,408
I didn't think you could make it.

103
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:23,736
My god.

104
00:08:23,956 --> 00:08:25,291
How could I not attend

105
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:26,869
my best friend's wedding?

106
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:28,416
We shall chat later.

107
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,799
I'll perform the blessing ceremony.

108
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:30,815
Sure.

109
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:33,924
Sorry.

110
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,940
Alright, Viscount.

111
00:08:38,838 --> 00:08:40,791
You are truly fortunate

112
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:42,683
to have Malai as your wife.

113
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:48,393
May your days be filled with joy.

114
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:49,408
I wish you all

115
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:50,893
the happiness in the world.

116
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:53,494
You are truly beautiful.

117
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:55,632
Wishing you abundant happiness.

118
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,846
Thank you.

119
00:08:56,862 --> 00:08:57,909
Let me give you a hug.

120
00:08:58,917 --> 00:08:59,957
I'm so happy!

121
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:01,774
Oh, I should get going.

122
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,838
You're so pretty! Let me see your ring.

123
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:06,119
Gosh, it's so beautiful!

124
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:09,158
But it should be a bit bigger.

125
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:14,065
The red cotton flower tea has run out.

126
00:09:16,229 --> 00:09:17,494
Fear not, my lord.

127
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:19,189
We can gather the red cotton flowers

128
00:09:19,214 --> 00:09:20,681
to dry and make tea in time.

129
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:21,869
Ms. Malai, watch out!

130
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:28,875
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

131
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:33,851
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

132
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:46,726
The red cotton flower tea,

133
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:49,258
for the sake of your health, Ms. Malai.

134
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,406
Thank you, Kam.

135
00:09:52,797 --> 00:09:54,719
Extend my gratitude to all the servants

136
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:56,508
for their efforts in assisting today.

137
00:09:57,344 --> 00:09:58,624
Thank you, my lord.

138
00:10:08,313 --> 00:10:09,836
Allow me to pour the tea for you.

139
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:26,265
Please finish it.

140
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:27,617
And what of you?

141
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:29,781
Shall I pour some for you, my lord?

142
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:31,875
Red cotton flower tea is known

143
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,875
for its benefits in nurturing

144
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,047
a woman's body for fertility.

145
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:36,937
It is a cherished recipe in my family.

146
00:11:40,604 --> 00:11:42,017
Did you know,

147
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,252
today,

148
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:45,088
everyone praises my bride

149
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,973
as if she were as beautiful as a Busaba

150
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,900
that I

151
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,298
find myself wishing I were Inao.

152
00:11:55,393 --> 00:11:57,205
Oh, my lord.

153
00:11:58,229 --> 00:11:59,814
You flatter me too much.

154
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:03,369
You are

155
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,556
handsome in your own right.

156
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:11,494
I am blessed

157
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,627
that you are merciful to me.

158
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:31,175
Malai.

159
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:34,847
Malai.

160
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:39,386
Malai.

161
00:15:41,628 --> 00:15:48,440
(Three months later)

162
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:56,893
Have a great meal, my lord.

163
00:15:57,448 --> 00:15:59,382
They are all your favorites.

164
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,682
My, who was it that used to complain

165
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:02,839
that the servants here

166
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:03,948
would make me fat?

167
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:05,159
Yet now, she prepares

168
00:16:05,175 --> 00:16:06,698
my favorite dishes every day.

169
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,026
If I become a fat old man,

170
00:16:09,566 --> 00:16:11,175
please take responsibility.

171
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:14,135
Oh, my lord,

172
00:16:14,214 --> 00:16:16,347
you still remember what I said.

173
00:16:16,902 --> 00:16:18,096
It embarrasses me

174
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:19,651
to hear you use it against me.

175
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,134
Uan, is something wrong?

176
00:16:27,197 --> 00:16:28,032
Your expressions are

177
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,579
as though someone has died.

178
00:16:29,963 --> 00:16:31,485
No one has died, my lord.

179
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,440
It is just...

180
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:35,423
Why this hesitation?

181
00:16:35,463 --> 00:16:37,143
You're wasting my mealtime.

182
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:39,626
I am here only to inform you that

183
00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:41,556
the red cotton flower tea

184
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:42,634
has run out, my lord.

185
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:47,118
How did you let it run out?

186
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,298
Well...

187
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,360
I...

188
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:53,860
My apologies, my lord!

189
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:54,877
Wait.

190
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:56,571
Fear not, my lord.

191
00:16:58,775 --> 00:16:59,895
Today is sunny,

192
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,196
we can gather the red cotton flowers

193
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:03,696
to dry and make tea in time.

194
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,532
I shall assist Uan.

195
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:13,244
Thank you, Ms. Malai,

196
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:14,867
for protecting me.

197
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:16,369
Otherwise, the lord would have

198
00:17:16,392 --> 00:17:17,986
given me a hard time.

199
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:19,165
It is nothing.

200
00:17:19,182 --> 00:17:20,423
This is a trifling matter.

201
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:23,306
I fail to understand why

202
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:25,689
he must be so angry.

203
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,783
Oh.

204
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,369
Why did you not pick

205
00:17:29,394 --> 00:17:31,353
the red cotton flowers and dry them?

206
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:32,619
There was a heavy downpour

207
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:33,843
the other day,

208
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:35,376
a branch broke and

209
00:17:35,393 --> 00:17:36,493
got stuck on the tree,

210
00:17:36,518 --> 00:17:38,025
it didn't fall down, ma'am.

211
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:39,681
The male servants

212
00:17:40,314 --> 00:17:41,626
were dispatched to work

213
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:43,142
at Sanam Chan Palace for the lord,

214
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,587
so the rest of the servants

215
00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:46,736
didn't dare climb and pluck the flowers.

216
00:17:46,752 --> 00:17:48,572
They're afraid it might fall on them.

217
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,220
I see.

218
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:53,720
Next time,

219
00:17:53,745 --> 00:17:55,736
if you notice anything in short supply,

220
00:17:55,761 --> 00:17:56,939
please store it

221
00:17:57,502 --> 00:17:59,369
so you won't incur his wrath again.

222
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:01,361
I have learned my lesson, ma'am.

223
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:04,244
I shall never be careless again.

224
00:18:04,478 --> 00:18:05,478
Good.

225
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:09,864
Oh.

226
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,568
Kam is probably back.

227
00:18:12,248 --> 00:18:13,013
I shall

228
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:15,106
summon him to cut the branch down.

229
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:17,786
You can wait by the garden, ma'am.

230
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:19,653
Alright, let me help.

231
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,287
Come on.

232
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:24,073
I shall get going.

233
00:18:52,773 --> 00:18:54,706
I suppose it is this branch.

234
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:54,070
Ms. Malai, watch out!

235
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:59,390
Dech!

236
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:00,415
My lord!

237
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,929
Today I'll teach you to know

238
00:20:01,945 --> 00:20:03,272
your place, Dech!

239
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:04,796
You come from a respectable family,

240
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:06,367
you know what is fitting and what isn't.

241
00:20:06,391 --> 00:20:07,499
Never let me repeat myself.

243
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:18,640
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

244
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:25,352
Ms. Malai, watch out!

245
00:20:54,664 --> 00:20:55,664
Dech!

246
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:07,781
My lord, my lord!

247
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:09,179
Malai!

248
00:21:09,985 --> 00:21:11,195
How dare you assume

249
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,695
you could touch my wife?

250
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:15,086
My lord!

251
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,305
You have misunderstood!

252
00:21:17,383 --> 00:21:19,117
It was an accident earlier.

253
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,039
Even if it was an accident,

254
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:23,312
he should have moved away immediately.

255
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,781
He shouldn't have hugged you so tightly.

256
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:28,899
Dech!

257
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:30,001
My lord!

258
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:31,898
Today I'll teach you to know

259
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:33,320
your place, Dech!

260
00:21:33,352 --> 00:21:34,352
My lord!

261
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:35,984
Dech helped me when

262
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:38,008
the red cotton tree branch fell on me!

263
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:39,937
Please spare him, I beg you!

264
00:21:48,063 --> 00:21:49,336
Malai,

265
00:21:49,344 --> 00:21:50,695
let us talk in our dwelling.

266
00:21:51,453 --> 00:21:52,453
Come on.

267
00:21:53,016 --> 00:21:54,016
My lord...

268
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:05,055
You've ever been treated like this, huh?

269
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:07,008
Too bad for you.

270
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,500
You've said too much, Saeng.

271
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:14,031
The lord's favorite can do no wrong.

272
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:16,930
How does it feel to lose favor?

273
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,383
Malai.

274
00:22:32,391 --> 00:22:33,578
Oww!

275
00:22:36,274 --> 00:22:37,274
My lord.

276
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,039
If I have made a mistake,

277
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:42,936
I sincerely apologize.

278
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:46,164
However, what just occurred

279
00:22:46,188 --> 00:22:47,672
was genuinely an accident,

280
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,923
and Dech rescued me.

281
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:51,344
I implore you not to

282
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,023
be angry with him over this.

283
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:54,883
Then never let me witness

284
00:22:54,908 --> 00:22:56,641
anything like this again.

285
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,523
Yes, my lord.

286
00:22:58,555 --> 00:23:00,289
You come from a respectable family,

287
00:23:00,314 --> 00:23:02,187
you know what is fitting and what isn't.

288
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:03,937
Do not make me to repeat myself.

289
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:26,907
Dech.

290
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:41,914
I believe the lord

291
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:44,251
went too far this time.

292
00:23:48,024 --> 00:23:49,024
Forget it.

293
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:51,469
He must have been

294
00:23:51,494 --> 00:23:52,844
jealous of you and Ms. Malai.

295
00:23:53,414 --> 00:23:54,594
Next time, be cautious

296
00:23:54,618 --> 00:23:56,138
to avoid a repeat.

297
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:02,527
Thank you, Fueang, for your concern.

298
00:24:07,543 --> 00:24:09,831
Actually, you don't have to endure this.

299
00:24:10,605 --> 00:24:11,855
How about you and I

300
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,613
start anew somewhere else?

301
00:24:13,957 --> 00:24:15,503
Together we might work

302
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:17,208
as laborers or peddlers.

303
00:24:18,348 --> 00:24:19,620
What are you saying?

304
00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:22,449
I thought you didn't want to

305
00:24:22,465 --> 00:24:23,589
endure working here anymore.

306
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,363
The lord works you like a slave,

307
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,027
even summoning you at dusk.

308
00:24:29,777 --> 00:24:31,581
He doesn't even call others.

309
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:34,574
Never speak like this again.

310
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:36,410
Let us not overlook the fact that we,

311
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:37,934
being but two destitute children,

312
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:40,706
owe our sustenance and
refuge to a certain someone?

313
00:24:41,144 --> 00:24:42,675
Were it not for his benevolence

314
00:24:42,683 --> 00:24:43,902
in providing solace to us,

315
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:45,503
I might have become a thief,

316
00:24:45,528 --> 00:24:47,581
and you, a lady of the night.

317
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,051
I know.

318
00:24:49,683 --> 00:24:51,750
I never forgot his generosity.

319
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:54,495
But I speak because

320
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:56,613
I think you have repaid

321
00:24:56,638 --> 00:24:58,318
your debt many times by now.

322
00:24:59,004 --> 00:25:00,691
It should be enough for you to

323
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:02,583
start fresh somewhere else.

324
00:25:13,394 --> 00:25:15,777
Ms. Malai, is something wrong?

325
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:18,379
Here.

326
00:25:18,746 --> 00:25:20,546
This is a Western salve.

327
00:25:21,198 --> 00:25:22,722
Consider it an apology

328
00:25:22,747 --> 00:25:24,699
and a thank you from me

329
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,652
for you getting in trouble

330
00:25:26,677 --> 00:25:28,477
even though you helped me.

331
00:25:31,941 --> 00:25:33,699
Thank you very much, Ms. Malai.

332
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:35,324
Oh,

333
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:37,769
and please keep this encounter secret,

334
00:25:38,308 --> 00:25:40,042
or we shall all get scolded.

335
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,402
Understood, ma'am.

336
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:43,901
I shall now take my leave.

337
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:45,418
Yes, ma'am.

338
00:25:53,768 --> 00:25:55,737
Ms. Malai is most benevolent.

339
00:26:58,939 --> 00:27:01,025
Is something troubling you, Malai?

340
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,766
I've been wed to you for many months,

341
00:27:07,353 --> 00:27:08,931
yet I am still not pregnant.

342
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:11,095
I feel guilty,

343
00:27:12,189 --> 00:27:14,522
as I am not fulfilling my duty.

344
00:27:15,142 --> 00:27:16,415
Oh, Malai.

345
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:21,571
I thought it was something more serious.

346
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:24,876
Do not distress yourself over it.

347
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:26,696
In its due time,

348
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:28,532
our child shall arrive.

349
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:49,541
Malai.

350
00:27:52,877 --> 00:27:53,877
Malai.

351
00:28:05,525 --> 00:28:07,407
Phum has become pregnant, ma'am.

352
00:28:08,408 --> 00:28:09,845
She was up for a challenge.

353
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,142
Getting pregnant

354
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:13,978
at this age is just embarrassing.

355
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:15,485
A balm for bruises.

356
00:28:16,205 --> 00:28:17,205
I apologize

357
00:28:17,525 --> 00:28:18,525
for going too far.

358
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:23,855
(House of the Dark Shadows

359
00:28:24,153 --> 00:28:28,918
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

360
00:28:39,882 --> 00:28:42,053
Had I not heard this from your own lips,

361
00:28:42,077 --> 00:28:43,398
I would find it hard to believe

362
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:44,867
the lord could be so deeply in love

363
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:45,851
and so jealous.

364
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,576
Me too.

365
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:49,170
I never imagined that

366
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:50,475
he would be this angry.

367
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:53,254
And it caused trouble for Dech, too.

368
00:28:53,702 --> 00:28:54,842
Dech...

369
00:28:55,349 --> 00:28:57,272
The male servant with a handsome face

370
00:28:57,297 --> 00:28:59,097
and great physique, right?

371
00:28:59,357 --> 00:29:01,100
I would not mind if it was him.

372
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:02,827
Ms. Bu-nga,

373
00:29:03,624 --> 00:29:04,670
how can you utter

374
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:05,951
such words about a man?

375
00:29:06,624 --> 00:29:08,365
Should they reach the ears of others,

376
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,021
it would be fodder for gossip.

377
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:11,272
That would be embarrassing.

378
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:13,154
Why, I'm just speaking the truth.

379
00:29:13,264 --> 00:29:16,178
I am not a demure lady like yourself.

380
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:17,764
If I wish to make praise,

381
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,469
does anyone take offense?

382
00:29:19,553 --> 00:29:20,553
Geez, Bu-nga.

383
00:29:21,561 --> 00:29:23,397
I feel at ease hearing you said that.

384
00:29:25,483 --> 00:29:26,483
At ease?

385
00:29:27,295 --> 00:29:28,655
What do you mean?

386
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,936
You are truly fortunate

387
00:29:39,202 --> 00:29:40,959
to have Malai as your wife.

388
00:29:44,147 --> 00:29:46,256
May your days be filled with joy.

389
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:47,802
I wish you all

390
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,288
the happiness in the world.

391
00:29:50,448 --> 00:29:51,764
You are truly beautiful.

392
00:29:56,058 --> 00:29:58,128
Please make haste and bear a child.

393
00:30:01,152 --> 00:30:02,565
I shall try my best, brother.

394
00:30:02,855 --> 00:30:04,588
Mere effort shall not suffice.

395
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:06,537
You must succeed.

396
00:30:06,823 --> 00:30:07,971
Should you fail,

397
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:10,331
every piece of my treasure,

398
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,362
will be bestowed to the temple,

399
00:30:12,386 --> 00:30:14,453
leaving you without a single cent.

400
00:30:15,488 --> 00:30:16,401
Yes, Father.

401
00:30:16,425 --> 00:30:18,003
In my life, I've been successful

402
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:19,120
in every aspect,

403
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:20,557
It shall not be marred by

404
00:30:20,573 --> 00:30:22,253
the absence of an heir.

405
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,260
If you are unable to fulfill this duty,

406
00:30:25,425 --> 00:30:26,440
not only will you not

407
00:30:26,448 --> 00:30:27,690
receive my inheritance,

408
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:29,221
but I shall also curse and condemn

409
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:30,964
you even in the afterlife, Wisan!

410
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:38,260
You know well the immense wealth

411
00:30:38,285 --> 00:30:39,965
our father possesses.

412
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,604
It would grieve me deeply

413
00:30:41,628 --> 00:30:42,784
if you received nothing.

414
00:30:42,823 --> 00:30:44,354
But I am merely a concubine's son,

415
00:30:44,363 --> 00:30:45,807
having no rights whatsoever.

416
00:30:45,823 --> 00:30:46,917
Nevertheless, you,

417
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:48,471
as the son of the principal wife,

418
00:30:48,495 --> 00:30:49,542
should receive

419
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:50,698
your rightful inheritance.

420
00:30:50,722 --> 00:30:51,956
I am aware.

421
00:30:51,988 --> 00:30:53,339
Thanks, elder brother.

422
00:30:55,378 --> 00:30:56,589
Please hurry up,

423
00:30:56,753 --> 00:30:58,820
for our father's health is deteriorating.

424
00:31:10,152 --> 00:31:11,152
Malai,

425
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:12,862
are you alright?

426
00:31:14,214 --> 00:31:15,254
I am alright.

427
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:16,613
I am alright.

428
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:35,784
We are bound by blood, elder brother.

429
00:31:36,816 --> 00:31:38,167
Why do you cast me aside

430
00:31:38,192 --> 00:31:39,964
as if I were a mere swine or cur?

431
00:31:40,738 --> 00:31:42,738
You are not my sole sibling.

432
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:44,760
Should you seek refuge with me,

433
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,307
won't others follow suit?

434
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:48,676
But I have no one to rely on now.

435
00:31:49,863 --> 00:31:51,675
My lady, Her Majesty, passed away.

436
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:53,284
Father, too.

437
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,050
I am a lone woman,

438
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,476
how can I survive?

439
00:31:58,636 --> 00:32:00,236
Think for yourself.

440
00:32:01,691 --> 00:32:03,371
Even dogs can survive on their own,

441
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,948
you are a human.

442
00:32:04,972 --> 00:32:07,190
It'd be a disgrace if you can't survive.

443
00:32:07,214 --> 00:32:08,214
Brother...

444
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:21,573
My lord, are you

445
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:23,081
proposing marriage to me?

446
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:24,768
You've heard it right, Malai.

447
00:32:30,222 --> 00:32:31,721
Yet we have but encountered

448
00:32:31,746 --> 00:32:33,018
each other today.

449
00:32:38,495 --> 00:32:40,510
From the moment my eyes beheld you,

450
00:32:41,034 --> 00:32:42,612
I've been stricken akin to

451
00:32:42,637 --> 00:32:44,637
Vihayasamkham, upon sighting Busaba.

452
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:48,284
My heart belongs to you, Malai.

453
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:49,558
Why wait?

454
00:32:53,941 --> 00:32:55,034
But...

455
00:32:56,753 --> 00:32:58,753
But I possess nothing but my body,

456
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:00,495
and I fear

457
00:33:00,722 --> 00:33:02,402
I am unworthy of you.

458
00:33:02,784 --> 00:33:04,495
I am already aware of all things.

459
00:33:05,097 --> 00:33:06,792
You need not repeat

460
00:33:06,817 --> 00:33:08,542
that you only possess your body.

461
00:33:10,753 --> 00:33:12,979
What I want is your body

462
00:33:13,597 --> 00:33:15,315
and your heart.

463
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,823
Love at first sight...

464
00:33:38,636 --> 00:33:40,886
does not exist.

465
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,412
I only have a duty to fulfill.

466
00:33:54,725 --> 00:33:56,060
And yet,

467
00:33:59,022 --> 00:34:00,912
I shall never retreat.

468
00:34:30,983 --> 00:34:31,983
How is it, ma'am?

469
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,834
I am still not yet pregnant.

470
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,029
My menstrual cycle persists.

471
00:34:38,803 --> 00:34:40,163
Oh, Ms. Malai...

472
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:53,170
Still pregnant at this age.

473
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:56,003
What is the matter?

474
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,341
Phum has become pregnant, ma'am.

475
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:04,412
She was up for a challenge

476
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:06,326
and took Tid Khloi's medicine...

477
00:35:07,928 --> 00:35:09,037
Getting pregnant

478
00:35:09,062 --> 00:35:10,974
at this age is just embarrassing.

479
00:35:12,764 --> 00:35:13,964
- Miss...
- Uan.

480
00:35:14,997 --> 00:35:16,177
Weren't you

481
00:35:16,193 --> 00:35:18,130
going to clean Ms. Malai's room?

482
00:35:18,397 --> 00:35:19,677
Hurry up and go.

483
00:35:20,498 --> 00:35:21,498
No, I wasn't.

484
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
- I...
- Uan.

485
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:32,568
Go.

486
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,880
Get going, you hear?

487
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:36,559
I shall take my leave.

488
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:46,319
Fueang.

489
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:47,945
Yes, ma'am?

490
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,422
Who is Tid Khloi?

491
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:50,601
Oh,

492
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,968
Tid Khloi is a renowned local physician,

493
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:54,804
known for their fertility medicine.

494
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:56,187
But Tid Khloi's medicine

495
00:35:56,203 --> 00:35:57,366
quickly sells out.

496
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,405
Even having money is not enough,

497
00:35:59,453 --> 00:36:02,632
one must reserve it months in advance.

498
00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:04,515
Is that true?

499
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:07,796
Can you take me to see Tid Khloi?

500
00:36:07,984 --> 00:36:09,077
I am willing to wait

501
00:36:09,117 --> 00:36:10,312
for as long as it takes.

502
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:12,624
It is better than doing nothing.

503
00:36:12,694 --> 00:36:13,694
Certainly.

504
00:36:14,468 --> 00:36:15,655
But at least please

505
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,062
have a quick meal, ma'am,

506
00:36:17,117 --> 00:36:18,234
it would take a while

507
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,616
to reach Tid Khloi's abode.

508
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,573
May I humbly request

509
00:36:34,598 --> 00:36:35,549
for a deferral, my lord?

510
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,440
You don't have money to pay interest,

511
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:40,190
but you have enough to gamble?

512
00:36:41,237 --> 00:36:42,963
Do not assume that I am unaware.

513
00:36:44,761 --> 00:36:46,237
If you fail to deliver the interest

514
00:36:46,262 --> 00:36:47,299
within this month,

515
00:36:47,308 --> 00:36:49,151
be prepared to forfeit your land.

516
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:51,065
But, my lord...

517
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,090
Scram!

518
00:36:53,183 --> 00:36:54,183
Scram!

519
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:56,190
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

520
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,355
Thank you

521
00:37:10,457 --> 00:37:12,332
for investigating their gambling issue

522
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:13,730
and reporting it to me.

523
00:37:14,027 --> 00:37:15,511
It is no trouble at all, sir.

524
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:16,557
Just a minor issue.

525
00:37:20,097 --> 00:37:21,537
Come closer to me.

526
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:43,573
A balm for bruises.

527
00:37:43,987 --> 00:37:45,362
I apologize

528
00:37:45,387 --> 00:37:46,526
for going too far.

529
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,346
No apologies are necessary, my lord.

530
00:37:52,644 --> 00:37:54,776
I am indebted to you beyond measure.

531
00:37:55,112 --> 00:37:57,284
How could I ever hold you accountable?

532
00:38:09,297 --> 00:38:10,687
What a pain!

533
00:38:11,149 --> 00:38:12,609
How did he discover that

534
00:38:12,633 --> 00:38:14,476
we spent the money at the casino?

535
00:38:14,563 --> 00:38:15,633
That's right, Brother.

536
00:38:15,658 --> 00:38:16,743
He probably sent someone

537
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,048
to investigate the casino.

538
00:38:18,073 --> 00:38:20,134
It must be that lackey from that room,

539
00:38:20,158 --> 00:38:22,142
No wonder I recognized that face.

540
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:23,681
So now, where are we going

541
00:38:23,705 --> 00:38:24,939
to find money to repay?

542
00:38:24,963 --> 00:38:26,236
If our land is seized,

543
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,118
we'll have no means to earn money.

544
00:38:28,197 --> 00:38:30,150
We've been consistently losing lately.

545
00:38:36,275 --> 00:38:38,001
Why are you staring at the lord's wife?

546
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:39,853
Thinking of asking her for a loan?

547
00:38:40,096 --> 00:38:41,634
I have a better plan than that.

548
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:43,376
May I ask you something?

549
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:45,641
Yes, Ms. Malai?

550
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,900
Please tell me about

551
00:38:47,924 --> 00:38:49,857
the people in this household.

552
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:52,634
I have been here for a while,

553
00:38:52,728 --> 00:38:53,962
yet I still don't know much

554
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:55,118
about everyone's background.

555
00:38:55,135 --> 00:38:56,345
Of course, ma'am.

556
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,814
Dech and I

557
00:38:58,908 --> 00:39:00,423
were orphans.

558
00:39:02,228 --> 00:39:04,236
We were taken in by the lord,

559
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:06,394
he taught us to read and write.

560
00:39:09,572 --> 00:39:10,658
Impressive, Fueang.

561
00:39:14,025 --> 00:39:16,204
As for Dech, he's sharp-witted,

562
00:39:16,525 --> 00:39:18,353
so he became the Viscount's valet,

563
00:39:18,378 --> 00:39:20,501
always close to serving the lord, ma'am.

564
00:39:23,689 --> 00:39:24,954
My apologies, sir.

565
00:39:25,064 --> 00:39:26,447
Pay more attention, Dech.

566
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:45,070
What you are thinking of

567
00:39:45,095 --> 00:39:46,273
