Malai hasn't given me a child.

19
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:02,480
I had to find a solution.

20
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:04,720
That's a selfish thing to say.

21
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,040
What's the big deal?

22
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,329
Didn't you take me here
to be your wife?

23
00:02:11,363 --> 00:02:13,010
Why haven't you fucked me yet?

24
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:15,640
What are you doing, Dech?

25
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:18,680
I'm gonna prove that I meant it.

26
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:21,383
If you want me to die,

27
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:24,683
I'll die to make up
for the wrong I did to you.

28
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:27,509
Goodness me!

29
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:31,189
Malai!

30
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:33,249
Malai!

31
00:02:33,462 --> 00:02:34,229
Chaem!

32
00:02:35,715 --> 00:02:37,075
The tonic, ma'am.

33
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:38,415
Thanks, Fueang.

34
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:44,640
What medicine is that?

35
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,255
It's a tonic, my lord.

36
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:50,560
Count Phichit was kind enough
to bring it this afternoon.

37
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,280
But we have red cotton flower tea.

38
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,600
It works the same way.

39
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,800
It doesn't hurt to try, sir.

40
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:05,960
If it helps me conceive your child,

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,560
I won't turn away
any kind of medicine.

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,913
Then it's up to you.

43
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:22,390
What's wrong, ma'am?

44
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,520
What's wrong, Malai?

45
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,670
Why is it…

46
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,670
so sour, Fueang?

47
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,520
How can it be? I brewed it myself.

48
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,923
Are you sure
you brewed it yourself?

49
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,280
I'm sure, my lord.

50
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:42,960
May I taste it?

51
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,623
Why does it taste like vinegar?

52
00:04:01,503 --> 00:04:04,203
She's probably choked on
vinegar to death by now.

53
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,480
Serves her right.

54
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:08,120
She's trying to have
the viscount's child before I do.

55
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,560
Your plan was so clever.

56
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:14,523
Fueang had no idea.

57
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,923
Someone like her is too slow.

58
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,357
No wonder she serves that toff.

59
00:04:27,377 --> 00:04:28,810
Don't look at me like that.

60
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,490
I don't wanna see your face either.

61
00:04:31,423 --> 00:04:32,505
Then why are you here?

62
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:35,360
Someone's here to see you.
They're waiting at the gate.

63
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,760
Did they say who they were
and where they were from?

64
00:04:39,057 --> 00:04:42,137
I don't know. I've just got here.
How would I know?

65
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,600
It won't kill you
leaving the medicine pot for a bit.

66
00:04:48,273 --> 00:04:49,753
-Go on then.
-Yeah.

67
00:05:00,837 --> 00:05:01,837
Idiot.

68
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:04,520
I won't let you
boost anything, Malai.

69
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:22,556
This is the one.

70
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,080
Chaem, mark my words.

71
00:05:35,443 --> 00:05:36,590
No matter what,

72
00:05:36,597 --> 00:05:39,680
I'm gonna have the viscount's
child before that toff.

73
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:41,256
Of course you are.

74
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,870
And I'm gonna help you
any way I can, Ms. Ramphoei.

75
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,743
-By hook…
-Or by crook.

76
00:06:10,883 --> 00:06:12,120
Thank you, my lord.

77
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:15,390
It's fine that
the tonic isn't drinkable.

78
00:06:16,237 --> 00:06:17,880
You have red cotton flower tea.

79
00:06:25,097 --> 00:06:26,880
There are some tonic herbs left.

80
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:28,976
I'll brew you a new batch.

81
00:06:29,377 --> 00:06:33,056
I'll watch the pot
from start to finish this time.

82
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,690
Thank you, Fueang.

83
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,690
Yes, ma'am.

84
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,390
If there's nothing else,
I'll take my leave.

85
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:45,760
Goodness me, my lord!

86
00:06:45,963 --> 00:06:46,963
Uh…

87
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:49,864
Ms. Ramphoei's sick again.

88
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:52,270
Again? What's wrong
with her this time?

89
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,057
I don't know either,

90
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,760
but she wanted to see you, my lord.

91
00:07:15,397 --> 00:07:16,600
Where's His Lordship?

92
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,617
He said he'd come by.

93
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,964
-Really?
-Yes.

94
00:07:21,303 --> 00:07:24,076
But you have to lie down
so it looks convincing.

95
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:26,200
Lie down, ma'am.

96
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,480
Please come in, Your Lordship.

97
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,560
Thanks, Chaem.

98
00:07:41,063 --> 00:07:43,136
Fueang, who sent you here?

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,060
Where's His Lordship?

100
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,760
His Lordship sent me.

101
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,370
Who else could it be?

102
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,410
Where is he?

103
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,000
He's with Ms. Malai, ma'am.

104
00:07:57,347 --> 00:08:00,200
He doesn't have time
to take care of you, Ms. Ramphoei.

105
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,640
Fueang, get out!

106
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:04,037
Get out of my sight!

107
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:06,812
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

108
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,040
I wish you a speedy recovery,
Ms. Ramphoei.

109
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
You'll get it.

110
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,823
Arrogant, both of them.

111
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,157
This must be Malai's doing.

112
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:29,080
His Lordship would never be
this heartless with me.

113
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:30,983
Right, Chaem?

114
00:08:31,317 --> 00:08:32,317
Yes, ma'am.

115
00:08:33,437 --> 00:08:36,880
So will His Lordship come back
to you, Ms. Ramphoei?

116
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:39,482
Is that your mouth?
I'll slap it off your face.

117
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:42,356
You don't need to.
I'll do it myself.

118
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:44,560
It hurts so bad, ma'am.

119
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,080
If Malai's waging war
against me like this,

120
00:08:51,603 --> 00:08:53,283
I'll give her what she deserves.

121
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,480
This house will have
only one female master.

122
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,890
And that's me.

123
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:18,863
Malai?

124
00:09:20,223 --> 00:09:21,223
Malai?

125
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,560
Good night, Malai.

126
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:15,897
Oh!

127
00:10:16,297 --> 00:10:17,427
Phoem!

128
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,737
I want to make magic love powder.

129
00:10:20,477 --> 00:10:21,477
Use this for now.

131
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:33,523
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

132
00:10:39,863 --> 00:10:40,863
Come, Malai.

133
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,250
Come.

134
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,450
Sit down.

135
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,790
Come.

136
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,420
Thank you.

137
00:10:54,194 --> 00:10:56,160
Is your master
feeling better, Chaem?

138
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:59,121
Oh, she is, my lord.

139
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,327
She's better,

140
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,217
but why hasn't she come down
to have breakfast with us?

141
00:11:05,877 --> 00:11:07,557
I'll bring it up to her.

142
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:10,720
Whatever you do,
take good care of her.

143
00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:12,183
Yes, my lord.

144
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,320
Fueang, prepare the breakfast
for Chaem to take to Ramphoei.

145
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,720
Yes, Ms. Malai.

146
00:11:18,787 --> 00:11:20,587
Uh, that's okay, Ms. Malai.

147
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,517
I'll prepare it and bring it up.

148
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:26,637
Jeez, it's not a bother.

149
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,480
You're one of us.

150
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,310
Let's eat, Malai, while
the soft-boiled rice is still hot.

151
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,150
Yes, my lord.

152
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
-Oh!
-Oh!

153
00:12:10,353 --> 00:12:11,353
Dech.

154
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:12,713
Ms. Ramphoei!

155
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,767
What are you doing here, ma'am?

156
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:18,800
It's dangerous for a woman
to be here alone.

157
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,520
It's none of your business
what I'm doing.

158
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,057
What are you doing here?

159
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,230
I'm here on
the viscount's business.

160
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:29,960
Would you like me to wait until
you're done and accompany you back?

161
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,276
No need. I can get back by myself.

162
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Go on your way.

163
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:36,973
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,840
Out of all people
I had to run into.

165
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,680
-Oh!
-Hey.

166
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:50,087
Phoem!

167
00:12:51,593 --> 00:12:52,880
What took you so long?

168
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,380
I saw you talk to that guy.

169
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:57,893
Who is he?

170
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,200
A servant at the house.

171
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:03,040
I thought he wouldn't leave.

172
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:05,360
I was thinking of killing him.

173
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:06,840
You can't do that.

174
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,640
You being a robber on the run
got me and Dad in enough trouble.

175
00:13:15,107 --> 00:13:17,560
So what's going on
that made you called me here?

176
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:20,480
I want to make magic love powder.

177
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,440
Get me the ingredients.

178
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:27,960
How old is your husband?

179
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,160
Is he so old he's dying
and can't get it up?

180
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,780
He's still young.

181
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,840
Don't you insult my viscount.

182
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,747
Get me the ingredients I need.
Stop yapping.

183
00:13:37,987 --> 00:13:38,987
Fine.

184
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,519
I was joking.

185
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,544
I've brought this with me.

186
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,920
I was planning to sell it
and get myself some food.

187
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,090
Use this for now.

188
00:13:55,963 --> 00:13:57,683
I'll bring you more next time.

189
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:01,080
Good. As soon as I hook him,

190
00:14:01,537 --> 00:14:03,757
I'll get you whatever you want.

191
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,640
That's what I'm talking about.

192
00:14:06,617 --> 00:14:08,437
You really are my sister.

193
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:11,436
I'm gonna go.

194
00:14:11,883 --> 00:14:12,883
Go on.

195
00:14:33,617 --> 00:14:34,657
Ms. Ramphoei.

196
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,200
Why do I keep running into him?

197
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,800
Waiting for a hired boat?

198
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:43,773
Yes, Dech.

199
00:14:44,907 --> 00:14:46,720
You can come with me.

200
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,530
I'm going back too.

201
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,992
Please come back together.

202
00:14:57,003 --> 00:14:59,200
It'll be a while
before a hired boat comes.

203
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:02,880
Get in the boat.

204
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,423
Yes, ma'am.

205
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,750
Ms. Ramphoei!

206
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,650
Ms. Ramphoei!

207
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:40,600
Please sit down
or you'll fall over.

208
00:15:42,597 --> 00:15:45,760
If I fall over, get in
the water and rescue me.

209
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,520
Actually, ever since
I came down from Lampang,

210
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:54,750
I haven't talked to you much.

211
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,870
I'm a servant. What would I have
to say to the viscount's wife?

212
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,643
Jeez, don't talk
like we're strangers, Dech.

213
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:05,716
You look like you're my age.

214
00:16:06,656 --> 00:16:08,560
But I'm still a servant.

215
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:11,520
Please turn back around.

216
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,010
Ms. Ramphoei!

217
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,630
Ms. Ramphoei!

218
00:16:18,363 --> 00:16:19,403
Ms. Ramphoei!

219
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,570
Ms. Ramphoei.

220
00:16:21,617 --> 00:16:23,370
Ms. Ramphoei, don't play around.

221
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:25,216
Someone might see.

222
00:16:25,403 --> 00:16:27,280
Jeez, I'm just joking.

223
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:29,304
No need to get so serious.

224
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:34,310
Or you already have a wife and
you're worried you'll upset her?

225
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,280
I don't have a wife yet.

226
00:16:37,993 --> 00:16:41,800
But I'd like you to act like
you're the viscount's wife.

227
00:16:44,427 --> 00:16:45,600
If that's the case…

228
00:16:46,163 --> 00:16:48,280
you should get acquainted with me,

229
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:49,764
instead of acting like this.

230
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:55,120
I'm well aware
what is proper and what is not.

231
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Hey,

232
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:00,080
I mean well.

233
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:02,289
If the viscount favors me one day,

234
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,120
I was gonna give you a big reward.

235
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,400
But why are you insulting
my kindness like this?

236
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,003
Keep your good intentions, ma'am.

237
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,920
I know how the viscount is.

238
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:13,600
That no matter what,

239
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:16,284
he'll never favor someone like you.

240
00:17:18,857 --> 00:17:21,040
Dech, how dare you
talk to me like this?

241
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:24,560
Ms. Ramphoei, please sit down,
or you'll really fall over.

242
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,110
Sit down, ma'am!

243
00:17:58,117 --> 00:17:59,190
Please, Ms. Ramphoei.

244
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:14,443
The viscount will fall head
over heels for me. Just watch.

245
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,663
I'm working. What do you need?

246
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,670
I saw you were working hard

247
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:55,360
so I've brought you some snacks.

248
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:58,400
Ms. Ramphoei made it
herself, my lord.

249
00:18:59,443 --> 00:19:00,470
And what's that?

250
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:05,516
It's a frankincense pot, my lord.

251
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,157
I got my hands on
high-quality frankincense powder.

252
00:19:09,497 --> 00:19:11,844
Its aroma is very relaxing.

253
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:13,567
You're well now?

254
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:15,400
I'm better now, my lord.

255
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:16,687
Good.

256
00:19:17,307 --> 00:19:20,320
Don't you pull that prank again.

257
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,600
What prank, my lord?

258
00:19:23,473 --> 00:19:24,693
I'm not stupid, Ramphoei.

259
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,706
You intentionally
pranked Malai yesterday

260
00:19:27,717 --> 00:19:29,600
so she couldn't
attend the event with me.

261
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,480
I don't like shenanigans
in my house.

262
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,440
Goodness, my lord,

263
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,480
I was wrong.

264
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,717
I was just jealous of Ms. Malai.

265
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,537
Ever since I got here,

266
00:19:44,803 --> 00:19:46,880
we haven't spent time together.

267
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:49,724
Ow, my lord.

268
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,710
Don't do that again.

269
00:19:51,897 --> 00:19:53,817
Good women don't get jealous

270
00:19:53,963 --> 00:19:55,480
or pull dirty tricks.

271
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,037
Yes, my lord.

272
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,263
Let's go, Chaem.

273
00:20:06,377 --> 00:20:08,520
Don't bother His Lordship
while he works.

274
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:10,377
Yes, ma'am.

275
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,310
Ramphoei,

276
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:15,844
before you go,
light the frankincense for me.

277
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,640
You said it was relaxing.

278
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,390
Right away, my lord.

279
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:46,490
You smell so good, Ramphoei.

281
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:03,310
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

282
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:05,423
Let's go, Chaem.

283
00:21:05,537 --> 00:21:07,680
Don't bother His Lordship
while he works.

284
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:09,537
Yes, ma'am.

285
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,470
Ramphoei,

286
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:15,004
before you go,
light the frankincense for me.

287
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,800
You said it was relaxing.

288
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,550
Right away, my lord.

289
00:22:12,813 --> 00:22:13,813
Ow, ow, ow.

290
00:22:13,824 --> 00:22:14,824
Ow, ow, ow.

291
00:22:16,493 --> 00:22:17,880
Why did you hit me, Fueang?

292
00:22:18,173 --> 00:22:19,907
When did you two get close? Huh?

293
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:21,757
We're not close.

294
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:24,877
I went on His Lordship's business
and ran into her.

295
00:22:24,903 --> 00:22:27,200
I just accompanied her home.
That's all.

296
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,097
Unbelievable.

297
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:33,829
You know she's Ms. Malai's enemy.
Why were you nice to her?

298
00:22:34,463 --> 00:22:37,760
Duh, I'm a servant. I can't pick
and choose who I serve.

299
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,663
Ms. Malai or Ms. Ramphoei
are the same.

300
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,270
Really, Dech?

301
00:22:50,143 --> 00:22:52,003
How are Ramphoei and I the same?

302
00:22:53,963 --> 00:22:55,123
You're screwed, Dech.

303
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,263
Are you hot, my lord?

304
00:23:59,343 --> 00:24:00,343
Ramphoei.

305
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,997
If you're hot, unbutton your shirt.

306
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:13,416
Ramphoei, don't.

307
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,790
Hold on, my lord.

308
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,317
Where are you running off to?

309
00:24:23,477 --> 00:24:25,250
Are you sick, my lord?

310
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,857
Ramphoei, don't.

311
00:24:29,857 --> 00:24:30,857
Let go.

312
00:24:31,457 --> 00:24:33,644
-I'll help you cool down.
-Ramphoei.

313
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:50,461
The frankincense
smells really good.

314
00:24:55,088 --> 00:24:56,520
Smells good like you.

315
00:25:07,943 --> 00:25:09,490
You smell so good, Ramphoei.

316
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:12,480
If I smell good, kiss me.

317
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:13,950
Kiss me more.

318
00:25:14,456 --> 00:25:15,756
Kiss me more, my lord.

319
00:25:16,277 --> 00:25:17,277
I will.

320
00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:49,160
If you want to insult me,

321
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,078
be honest about it.

322
00:25:51,957 --> 00:25:53,600
How are Ramphoei and I the same?

323
00:25:54,077 --> 00:25:56,050
I never wanted
to insult you, ma'am.

324
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,040
As far as I know,

325
00:25:58,637 --> 00:26:00,600
all Ramphoei and I have in common

326
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,840
is we're both women.

327
00:26:04,043 --> 00:26:05,043
No.

328
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:07,497
We're both the viscount's wives.

329
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,240
I'd like to know
what else we have in common.

330
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,200
I was wrong, Ms. Malai.

331
00:26:20,237 --> 00:26:21,484
Ms. Malai,

332
00:26:22,103 --> 00:26:24,176
he just didn't think
before he spoke.

333
00:26:24,303 --> 00:26:26,440
That's not it, Fueang.

334
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:28,977
Well, Dech?

335
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,764
Ever since I got here,

336
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:34,303
what have I done to offend you

337
00:26:35,263 --> 00:26:36,840
and make you think badly of me?

338
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,360
It's not like that, Ms. Malai.

339
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,923
You've done nothing wrong.

340
00:26:43,097 --> 00:26:44,760
Right, I've done nothing wrong.

341
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,240
But I haven't done
anything right either, have I?

342
00:26:47,643 --> 00:26:50,103
That's why you have
a grudge against me.

343
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:52,731
Last time you took my floats.

344
00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:54,360
This time you insulted me.

345
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:20,733
Ms. Malai,

346
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,060
I really didn't think that way.

347
00:27:23,327 --> 00:27:24,327
But…

348
00:27:27,107 --> 00:27:28,107
What's that?

349
00:27:37,637 --> 00:27:39,244
It's from His Lordship's office.

350
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:00,367
Ramphoei.

351
00:29:10,837 --> 00:29:12,600
-Malai.
-My lord.

352
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,490
Ms. Malai!

353
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:38,076
Wait!

354
00:29:38,087 --> 00:29:39,087
My lord!

355
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:40,809
Let go!

356
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,080
Malai! Dech!

357
00:29:50,383 --> 00:29:52,203
What are you looking at, Fueang?

358
00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:54,350
Never seen a husband
and his wife have sex?

359
00:30:56,203 --> 00:30:57,520
Leave me alone!

360
00:30:59,883 --> 00:31:01,303
Calm down, Ms. Malai.

361
00:31:01,757 --> 00:31:03,680
Running off like this won't help.

362
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,043
Did you want me
to watch His Lordship

363
00:31:07,877 --> 00:31:10,144
being perverted with Ramphoei?

364
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:12,290
That's not what I meant, Ms. Malai.

365
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:14,429
I just…

366
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,706
Or did you want me
to see how worthless I am

367
00:31:16,717 --> 00:31:17,733
in His Lordship's eyes?

368
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,320
You're happy now, aren't you?

369
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:26,157
You don't understand.

370
00:31:27,057 --> 00:31:28,650
What don't I understand, Dech?

371
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,880
I understand
His Lordship doesn't love me.

372
00:31:34,463 --> 00:31:37,470
He did that
in the middle of the day.

373
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,550
One day you'll understand
what I was referring to.

374
00:31:46,263 --> 00:31:47,263
I don't understand

375
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:49,207
and I don't want
to understand anything else.

376
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,440
Go on, Dech. Leave. Just leave.

377
00:31:52,101 --> 00:31:53,301
Leave me alone.

378
00:31:58,723 --> 00:31:59,723
Leave!

379
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:01,323
Go!

380
00:32:02,623 --> 00:32:04,960
I said leave, Dech! Leave!

381
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:06,336
Ms. Malai.

382
00:32:06,347 --> 00:32:08,306
-Leave!
-Ms. Malai. Ms. Malai.

383
00:32:08,774 --> 00:32:10,607
-I said leave!
-Ms. Malai.

384
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:13,400
-Ms. Malai. Calm down, Ms. Malai.
-Leave!

385
00:32:13,673 --> 00:32:15,720
Ms. Malai. Calm down, Ms. Malai.

386
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:18,379
Calm down, ma'am.

387
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:21,999
Calm down, ma'am.

388
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,570
Malai!

389
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,050
Malai!

390
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:37,917
Hey, Malai!

391
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,590
Malai!

392
00:32:41,943 --> 00:32:42,943
Malai!

393
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,970
Leave us, Dech.

394
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,997
I need to talk to Malai.

395
00:32:49,337 --> 00:32:50,337
Yes, sir.

396
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,410
Hey, Malai.

397
00:33:00,057 --> 00:33:01,057
Uh, Malai.

398
00:33:01,277 --> 00:33:02,797
Malai, hear me out.

399
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,080
Malai.

400
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:09,970
Malai.

401
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,150
Malai.

402
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:15,797
Malai, don't do this.
It's unbecoming.

403
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,240
You never loved me anyway.

404
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,600
Goodness, Malai.

405
00:33:21,943 --> 00:33:24,150
I married you in a big ceremony.

406
00:33:24,283 --> 00:33:25,483
Acknowledged by everyone.

407
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,840
Ramphoei is just a mistress.

408
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,580
I'll never put her over you.

409
00:33:28,713 --> 00:33:30,440
Don't make a mountain
out of a molehill.

410
00:33:30,451 --> 00:33:33,451
Having sex in the middle of the day
is trivial you?

411
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:37,600
I can handle you having many wives.

412
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:41,685
But I can't handle you
being indiscreet.

413
00:33:42,018 --> 00:33:43,091
Malai, hey.

414
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:44,705
I sincerely apologize.

415
00:33:45,078 --> 00:33:46,680
I didn't mean for that to happen.

416
00:33:47,111 --> 00:33:48,520
It already happened.

417
00:33:52,557 --> 00:33:54,680
I promise it'll never happen again.

418
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,310
Please, Malai.

419
00:33:56,717 --> 00:33:57,717
Forgive me

420
00:33:57,983 --> 00:33:59,263
and let's go inside.

421
00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:00,603
Please.

422
00:34:02,337 --> 00:34:03,840
I can't do that, my lord.

423
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,683
I can't handle going in right now.

424
00:34:08,787 --> 00:34:10,040
So what do you want?

425
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,459
You say no to everything.

426
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:12,840
I apologized.

427
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,100
Let me stay
with Bu-nga for a while.

428
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:20,840
Give me time to come to terms
with what you did.

429
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:26,643
Then,

430
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:29,584
take Fueang to serve you
so I won't worry.

431
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:30,910
That's okay.

432
00:34:31,813 --> 00:34:33,493
I can manage with Bu-nga.

433
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,260
Thank you.

434
00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:46,270
I said take it off.

435
00:34:46,403 --> 00:34:48,503
His Lordship gave it to Ms. Malai.
It's not yours.

436
00:34:48,557 --> 00:34:50,277
-Take it off! Take it off!
-Get off her!

437
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:58,043
(House of the Dark Shadows

438
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:03,176
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

439
00:35:04,862 --> 00:35:05,862
Whoa.

440
00:35:06,077 --> 00:35:08,360
His Lordship was that fired up?

441
00:35:08,677 --> 00:35:11,720
Your clothes are all torn up
like they were ripped by a beast.

442
00:35:12,797 --> 00:35:14,480
I was surprised, too, Chaem.

443
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,516
I didn't expect him
to be that forceful.

444
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:22,870
So that means my master
pulled ahead of that toff.

445
00:35:23,837 --> 00:35:24,837
Yes.

446
00:35:25,503 --> 00:35:27,837
His Lordship's child
will come from me.

447
00:35:31,237 --> 00:35:32,337
-Chaem?
-Huh?

448
00:35:32,537 --> 00:35:34,244
You should have seen her face.

449
00:35:34,597 --> 00:35:36,037
Pale like a boiled chicken.

450
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,680
She'd probably never seen it.

451
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,090
She acted like it was unacceptable
and ran off.

452
00:35:43,503 --> 00:35:45,249
I hope she leaves for good

453
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,283
so I can rule this house easily.

454
00:35:47,907 --> 00:35:48,907
I concur.

455
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:52,320
So no one will be
in my master's way.

456
00:36:06,877 --> 00:36:09,913
By the look of His Lordship,
I didn't think he'd be so fired up

457
00:36:09,923 --> 00:36:11,720
he tore up the clothes.

458
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,680
If it didn't come from you,
I'd never believe it.

459
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,840
I underestimated him.

460
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,680
I didn't expect that either.

461
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:24,360
You came to me yesterday crying,
so I was afraid to ask.

462
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,640
But is it a good idea
to run off like this?

463
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,040
Ramphoei must feel so arrogant now.

464
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,840
Why do you expect me to do, Bu-nga?

465
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,000
If I go back,
I'll feel uncomfortable.

466
00:36:37,993 --> 00:36:39,720
That image is still in my head.

467
00:36:41,807 --> 00:36:43,680
Don't give up so easily, Malai.

468
00:36:43,847 --> 00:36:45,964
But what would
I fight her with, Ms. Bu-nga?

469
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:50,220
I married the viscount months ago.

470
00:36:50,403 --> 00:36:53,936
But I still don't know
if I had sex with him.

471
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,400
That's the reason
you have to go back.

472
00:36:56,537 --> 00:36:58,320
You can't just sigh and give up.

473
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,382
If Ramphoei gets pregnant first,

474
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:03,043
you'll be at a disadvantage, Malai.

475
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,880
The longer you stay with me,

476
00:37:06,046 --> 00:37:07,352
the more you'll have to lose

477
00:37:37,303 --> 00:37:38,680
It smells so bland.

478
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,283
No wonder it's hers.

479
00:37:44,683 --> 00:37:45,683
You bland bitch.

480
00:37:57,503 --> 00:38:00,050
Someone like her will never
win any man's heart.

481
00:38:00,103 --> 00:38:01,720
Not with her bland taste.

482
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,120
You're right.

483
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,230
Oh!

484
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,337
There must be something good
in that chest.

485
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:09,120
-Get it out, Chaem.
-Yes, ma'am.

486
00:38:11,086 --> 00:38:12,327
-Open it.
-Yes, ma'am.

487
00:38:18,192 --> 00:38:19,192
Move.

488
00:38:29,837 --> 00:38:31,517
You were right, Chaem.

489
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,080
So beautiful.

490
00:38:33,337 --> 00:38:36,160
If it's on your neck…

491
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,640
it'll be so much more beautiful.

492
00:38:55,317 --> 00:38:56,760
So beautiful, Ms. Ramphoei.

493
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,797
Let's show it to His Lordship.

494
00:38:58,843 --> 00:38:59,843
Come on.

495
00:39:02,703 --> 00:39:04,600
What are you doing
in His Lordship's bedroom?

496
00:39:08,503 --> 00:39:09,790
Ms. Malai's necklace.

497
00:39:10,437 --> 00:39:11,437
Take it off!

498
00:39:12,637 --> 00:39:13,637
I won't.

499
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:16,296
I said take it off.

500
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:18,276
He gave it to Ms. Malai.
It's not yours.

501
00:39:18,543 --> 00:39:20,520
-Take if off! Take if off!
-Get off her!

502
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,610
Take if off!

503
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:36,640
I want you to love me
both body and soul.

504
00:39:36,983 --> 00:39:38,230
Can you do that for me?

505
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:42,770
My wife's son
is nothing but a disgrace,

506
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,423
laying with men.

507
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,710
-Take it off!
-His Lordship gave it to me.

508
00:39:49,743 --> 00:39:51,296
Take it off, ma'am. Or you'll die.

509
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,857
I want Malai to suffer,

510
00:39:54,096 --> 00:39:56,409
dying on the inside slowly.

511
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,857
You got it.

512
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,083
You're a fighter.

513
00:40:00,003 --> 00:40:01,003
Dech!

514
00:40:04,997 --> 00:40:06,320
Help!

515
00:40:06,983 --> 00:40:07,983
