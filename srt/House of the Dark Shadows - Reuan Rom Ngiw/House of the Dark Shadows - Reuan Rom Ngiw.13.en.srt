"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 13)

19
00:01:59,157 --> 00:02:00,420
His Lordship wants a child

20
00:02:00,797 --> 00:02:02,633
to claim his inheritance.

21
00:02:03,877 --> 00:02:06,204
He won't dare hurt both of us.

22
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:11,549
But no matter what happens,
I'll protect you, Ms. Malai.

23
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:14,185
We'll be together definitely.

24
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:17,031
The viscount never cares about me.

25
00:02:17,384 --> 00:02:18,504
You know that.

26
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:20,807
I know how he is.

27
00:02:21,168 --> 00:02:23,248
If you or I show our feelings

28
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:25,181
and the viscount gets paranoid,

29
00:02:25,908 --> 00:02:27,555
we'll never see each other again.

30
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:32,984
Phoem?

31
00:02:36,192 --> 00:02:37,192
Phoem?

32
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:44,796
It's me.

33
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:49,426
Close the door.

34
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,317
Brother, did you
take care of Malai?

35
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:01,984
Uh, well...

36
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:04,464
You failed again, didn't you?

37
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:06,578
You're not worth your fee.

38
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:08,731
Shut up.

39
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:10,419
Are you my younger or older sister?

40
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,622
Well, you suck.
You expected a compliment?

41
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:17,503
So...

42
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:19,476
do you have another plan?

43
00:03:20,596 --> 00:03:21,636
Let me think.

44
00:03:22,353 --> 00:03:23,420
You want my help?

45
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:24,556
Who's there?!

46
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:33,137
Saeng, have you been following me?

47
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:40,103
If I didn't follow you,

48
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,063
I wouldn't have heard
something interesting.

49
00:03:44,377 --> 00:03:46,450
I suspected you

50
00:03:46,483 --> 00:03:48,976
since you asked for
His Lordship's address in Hua Hin.

51
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,160
How dare you talk to me this way.

52
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:54,963
You don't have to act
noble around me.

53
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:57,800
You don't have
a noble background anyway.

54
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,840
And if anyone finds out
your brother is a criminal,

55
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:03,863
who would respect you?

56
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,320
So you probably know

57
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:12,783
people who know too much
often die young.

58
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,930
Phoem.

59
00:04:15,663 --> 00:04:16,663
Wait.

60
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:20,284
I thought you were
smarter than this.

61
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,583
Why? Are you buying your time?

62
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:25,720
If my plan was
to reveal your secret,

63
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:28,397
I wouldn't have wasted
my effort to follow you.

64
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,750
You're gonna join me?

65
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:47,110
So what do you want?

66
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,063
Oh.

67
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
My lord.

68
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:03,215
You've been gone many days.
I have missed you so much.

69
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,337
While I was away,
what government business came up?

70
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:10,894
Official letters
were delivered to you.

71
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:12,840
I've put them
in your office, my lord.

72
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,260
You've traveled a long way.
Go rest, Malai.

73
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:19,080
I'll take care of my work.

74
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Yes, my lord.

75
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,000
Dech, bring His Lordship's
luggage for me.

76
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:26,383
Yes, ma'am.

77
00:05:40,783 --> 00:05:42,050
Let's go in, my lord.

78
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:43,923
Yes.

79
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,710
- Move!
- Oh!

80
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,757
You're blocking the way.
This is a walkway.

81
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,680
Bring it on. I'll fight you.

82
00:06:10,277 --> 00:06:11,924
What are you thinking, ma'am?

83
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,367
Do you think Malai's pregnant?

84
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:19,710
They've been gone only for a few days.

85
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,903
Isn't that too fast?

86
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,182
But don't worry.

87
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:24,743
I'll find out for you.

88
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:33,800
But if Malai's really pregnant,
you'll be in big trouble.

89
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,470
Come closer.

90
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,160
There's no way.

91
00:06:40,877 --> 00:06:44,280
I didn't get to this point
just for Malai to get everything.

92
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:48,080
Even if she's pregnant,
I'll make her miscarry.

93
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,120
You would go that far, ma'am?

94
00:06:54,153 --> 00:06:55,413
Don't go soft on me.

95
00:06:55,813 --> 00:06:57,473
It'd be just an unwanted child.

96
00:06:57,703 --> 00:07:00,840
I'll never let it
open its eyes in this world.

97
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:33,320
You're too late, my lord.

98
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:35,317
What do you mean?

99
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,320
I think you're a smart man.

100
00:07:39,003 --> 00:07:40,760
Even I could tell
from just one look

101
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,600
that your lover fell for another.

102
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Impossible.

103
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,920
Don't waste your breath
provoking me.

104
00:07:50,117 --> 00:07:52,640
They say a consummated couple

105
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:54,403
usually care about each other.

106
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,120
- Don't you agree?
- Saeng!

107
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,937
I wish I could stop time
right here, Ms. Malai.

108
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:22,817
Why?

109
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,000
Because I'm so happy right now
I don't want this time to pass.

110
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:04,137
Malai?

111
00:09:14,697 --> 00:09:15,697
My lord.

112
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,243
Ms. Malai's not here?

113
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:28,644
If Ms. Malai's not here,
you can come to my room.

114
00:09:37,783 --> 00:09:39,120
What's he so upset about?

115
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,800
I don't like sneaking around
like this, Dech.

116
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,257
Ms. Malai.

117
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,440
I want to love

118
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:56,997
the way regular people do.

119
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,110
Trust me, Ms. Malai.

120
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,920
We'll be together openly one day.

121
00:10:09,157 --> 00:10:10,157
Really, Dech?

122
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,417
I will do everything
to be with you.

123
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:18,920
I will make you proud of me.

124
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,850
Okay.

125
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,200
I'll wait for that day.

126
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,423
How is it possible?

127
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:46,823
How is it possible that
no one's seen Malai?!

128
00:10:48,837 --> 00:10:49,877
Well, Chaem?!

129
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,200
She's not in the garden either.

130
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,517
Maybe we should check the pier.

131
00:10:59,523 --> 00:11:00,720
Who would go there?

132
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:02,960
It's the middle of the night.

133
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,537
He's right.

134
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:05,997
It's scary there.

135
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:10,480
But if the goal is
to see stars and fireflies,

136
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,580
it'd be a perfect spot for lovers.

137
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:16,353
Don't you agree, my lord?

138
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,183
Don't follow me.

139
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:46,597
I swear that I will love
and be faithful to His Lordship.

140
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,363
But if one day
Dech breaks his promise,

141
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,970
he will die with excruciating pain.

142
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,963
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

143
00:11:57,409 --> 00:12:01,956
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

144
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,650
Dech! Ma...

145
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:26,920
What you do need, my lord?

146
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:30,800
What are you two doing here?

147
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,497
Dech came to lay a fish trap,
so I accompanied him.

148
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,230
I panicked when I noticed
you two were missing.

149
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:47,163
Next time let people know
before you go somewhere.

150
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,243
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

151
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,257
Ms. Malai.

152
00:13:22,797 --> 00:13:23,797
Ms. Malai.

153
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,583
Ms. Malai.

154
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,683
Ms. Malai, please follow me
back to your room

155
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,123
before anyone sees you.

156
00:13:37,643 --> 00:13:38,643
Okay.

157
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,560
Tell me right now, Dech.

158
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,470
It's what I think, isn't it?

159
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:06,840
Dech.

160
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,490
This means...

161
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,397
you're having an affair
with Ms. Malai.

162
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,923
I'm not having an affair.

163
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,720
I sleep with Ms. Malai
per His Lordship's request.

164
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,083
He ordered you?

165
00:14:24,223 --> 00:14:25,223
Duh.

166
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:28,590
You know he can't have sex
with Ms. Malai, so he uses me.

167
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:36,830
But you fell for her, didn't you?

168
00:14:42,217 --> 00:14:43,217
You knew?

169
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,120
We grew up together.

170
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:51,850
I know what you're thinking.

171
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,443
What's on your mind is not
as important as what's on her mind.

172
00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:00,320
It's mutual.

173
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,317
I know you see me
only as your sister.

174
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:22,703
But can I be honest with you?

175
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:24,557
Of course.

176
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,640
What you're doing

177
00:15:27,397 --> 00:15:29,357
is going to get
you and her in trouble.

178
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,920
His Lordship will never
let you love anyone but him.

179
00:15:34,923 --> 00:15:35,923
No way.

180
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,140
This is my life.
It's my right to choose who I love.

181
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:42,160
He can't make me.

182
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:43,967
Are you sure?

183
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:02,677
Why have you brought me here?

184
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:11,724
You must swear
before this red cotton tree

185
00:16:12,337 --> 00:16:13,680
that you will love only me.

186
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:16,164
You want me to say it
for everyone to hear?

187
00:16:16,263 --> 00:16:17,636
We're the only ones here.

188
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:18,877
Swear it right now.

189
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,137
Why must you go this far?

190
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:26,040
If I didn't rescue you and Fueang,

191
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,346
you two would still be beggars

192
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:31,440
asking for spare change
and food scraps.

193
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:32,867
Or...

194
00:16:33,437 --> 00:16:35,370
Fueang would end up in some brothel

195
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:37,400
and you would live off her.

196
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:40,240
You wouldn't live
this comfortably, right?

197
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:57,000
You must swear

198
00:16:57,303 --> 00:16:59,920
that you will only have
a physical relationship with Malai.

199
00:17:02,103 --> 00:17:05,520
But you must love only me.

200
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,000
I swear that

201
00:17:23,503 --> 00:17:24,503
I will love

202
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:27,273
and be faithful to His Lordship.

203
00:17:34,258 --> 00:17:36,831
But if one day
Dech breaks his promise,

204
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:39,788
he will die with excruciating pain

205
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:41,996
for hurting my feelings.

206
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,920
Is something bothering you, Dech?

207
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,583
You can tell me.

208
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,480
It's nothing.

209
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:32,560
My thoughts got away from me.

210
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:37,626
Why did you make me
hide last night?

211
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:41,330
It was His Lordship's desire
that I sleep with you.

212
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,510
Why did he suddenly get jealous?

213
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,496
He probably worries
he's gonna lose face

214
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,717
if he finds out
you have feelings for me.

215
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:55,677
Besides, he probably doesn't want
anyone to find out about this.

216
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,770
How long do I have to
put up with this, Dech?

217
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,600
I feel like I'm the guilty party

218
00:19:03,063 --> 00:19:05,043
when in fact I didn't start it.

219
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:08,200
Don't get ahead of yourself.

220
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,120
Go have fun and relax
with Ms. Bu-nga.

221
00:19:15,203 --> 00:19:16,203
Thanks.

222
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,730
Bye.

223
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,230
Wow.

224
00:19:46,997 --> 00:19:48,560
The potatoes look so good.

225
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:50,163
Right, Malai?

226
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,280
They look so good.

227
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,880
What now, Malai?

228
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:02,324
You just got back
from your honeymoon.

229
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,790
You should look happy.

230
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,440
How can I look that way, Bu-nga,

231
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:11,650
when I don't feel that way at all?

232
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:15,990
Don't tell me that
on this Hua Hin trip

233
00:20:16,463 --> 00:20:18,310
you still haven't slept
with the viscount.

234
00:20:27,322 --> 00:20:29,080
Keep your voice down, Ms. Bu-nga.

235
00:20:29,836 --> 00:20:31,116
It's embarrassing.

236
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,510
It's normal for a married couple
to have sex.

237
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:36,323
No need to worry.

238
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:41,376
That is not as important

239
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:43,840
as the fact that
I'm not happy with my marriage.

240
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,410
Right now I feel more like
I'm being imprisoned

241
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,250
than being married off.

242
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:55,243
Come on now.

243
00:20:55,543 --> 00:20:58,890
If you're pregnant,
things might get better.

244
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:03,917
If I'm pregnant,

245
00:21:04,857 --> 00:21:06,240
what's that gonna be like?

246
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,160
The viscount will get
his inheritance like he wants.

247
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:16,880
Afterward it's up to you if you're
gonna stay and raise your child

248
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:20,080
or ask for your
deserved cut and split.

249
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,880
You must think carefully.

250
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:27,517
Let's eat.

251
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,490
My lord.

252
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,247
I was about to go to you, my lord.

253
00:22:16,747 --> 00:22:17,747
No need.

254
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,776
Is Ms. Malai unavailable today?

255
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,270
That's not it.

256
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,800
Tonight you will be mine alone.

258
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:31,309

261

(One month later)

262
00:23:59,117 --> 00:24:00,117
- Uan!
- Oh?

263
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,700
Give it to me.

264
00:24:02,127 --> 00:24:05,327
Chaem, what the hell are you doing?
I'm in a hurry.

265
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:07,552
These are Ms. Malai's clothes, right?

266
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:09,296
Duh. You know, so give it back.

267
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,950
No need. I'll wash
Ms. Malai's clothes today.

268
00:24:14,556 --> 00:24:16,770
- You washing Ms. Malai's clothes?
- Um.

269
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,400
Even with Ms. Ramphoei's clothes,
you make someone else wash them.

270
00:24:21,037 --> 00:24:22,450
Are you drunk or crazy today?

271
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,050
Just indulge me.
I'm in a good mood today.

272
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,210
Go on if you wanna
get it on with your hubby.

273
00:24:28,797 --> 00:24:30,120
Before I change my mind.

274
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:33,297
Go on!

275
00:24:34,143 --> 00:24:35,143
Fine.

276
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,650
Just make sure they're clean.

277
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:40,520
If Ms. Malai scolds me,
I'll get you for it.

278
00:24:41,003 --> 00:24:42,003
Fine.

279
00:24:42,463 --> 00:24:43,463
Go on.

280
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:54,984
Chaem saw period blood
on Malai's clothes,

281
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,480
so she's not pregnant yet.

282
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,030
Good.

283
00:24:59,257 --> 00:25:00,690
So you still have a chance.

284
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,823
All you have to do it
get him to sleep with you often.

285
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,520
But the magic love powder
you gave me ran out.

286
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,857
I had my suspicion
so I brought some with me.

287
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:23,937
Get it done.

288
00:25:24,363 --> 00:25:26,043
This powder is not cheap.

289
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:28,600
Don't waste my investment.

290
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,920
I know that

291
00:25:31,103 --> 00:25:34,343
but my time alone with the viscount
is so hard to come by.

292
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,040
Fortunately, Malai's not pregnant.

293
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:38,960
Otherwise, I'll be inconsolable.

294
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:43,360
But I wish I could see
her face right now.

295
00:25:50,703 --> 00:25:52,696
Why don't you let me
sleep with Ms. Malai?

296
00:25:52,857 --> 00:25:53,857
Saeng!

297
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,440
- Dech!
- I think you're pissed at me

298
00:25:56,697 --> 00:25:58,657
because I'm on to you.

299
00:26:00,677 --> 00:26:05,210
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

300
00:26:05,656 --> 00:26:10,203
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

301
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,240
You're upset because
you found out you're not pregnant?

302
00:26:45,483 --> 00:26:47,056
I admit I'm frustrated

303
00:26:48,897 --> 00:26:50,720
because I want to fulfill my duty.

304
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,960
To repay you for buying me
and feeding me.

305
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,840
I never thought I'd bought you.

306
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,160
On the contrary,

307
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:06,920
I felt a bond
with you at first sight.

308
00:27:10,957 --> 00:27:12,037
Really, my lord?

309
00:27:15,257 --> 00:27:17,997
I'm well aware that you hate

310
00:27:18,757 --> 00:27:21,040
being forced to do things
you don't want to.

311
00:27:21,877 --> 00:27:23,480
But if the situation isn't dire,

312
00:27:24,117 --> 00:27:25,457
I wouldn't be doing this.

313
00:27:34,057 --> 00:27:36,480
We might not be a couple
who are nice to each other,

314
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,480
but we can be
good friends, right, Malai?

315
00:27:41,603 --> 00:27:42,603
Friends,

316
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,730
my lord?

317
00:27:46,397 --> 00:27:47,397
Yes.

318
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:49,080
Couples may change

319
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:53,392
but friendship stays
with us forever.

320
00:28:07,397 --> 00:28:09,130
It's okay
Ms. Malai's not pregnant yet.

321
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:11,480
Give me another chance, my lord.

322
00:28:13,783 --> 00:28:16,920
When His Lordship ordered you
the first time, you kept refusing.

323
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,290
You're hooked now, aren't you?

324
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,790
It's written all over your face.

325
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:23,143
Saeng!

326
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:25,837
Why? Pissed that I'm on to you?

327
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,720
What a flop.

328
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:33,083
My lord,

329
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,177
I think maybe
you should try other methods.

330
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:39,516
What methods?

331
00:28:40,883 --> 00:28:43,040
Why don't you let me
sleep with Ms. Malai?

332
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,950
I guarantee...

333
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:46,017
Saeng!

334
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,400
Dech! Stop! I said stop!

335
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:53,056
Why? Jealous over Ms. Malai, Dech?

336
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,937
If I guess correctly,

337
00:28:59,597 --> 00:29:01,797
I think he fell out
of love with you.

338
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,070
I punched you because you insulted
Ms. Malai, His Lordship's wife.

339
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:15,117
She's a person.

340
00:29:15,363 --> 00:29:17,996
She's not a pet to be bred
with anyone like you said.

341
00:29:18,203 --> 00:29:19,430
Don't give me an excuse.

342
00:29:20,743 --> 00:29:22,640
I know how you feel
about Ms. Malai.

343
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:25,563
- Saeng!
- I said stop! Both of you! Stop!

344
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,830
Saeng!

345
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,890
If you think of hurting
Ms. Malai again, I'll kill you.

346
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,457
Are you pissed
for Ms. Malai as her servant

347
00:29:49,223 --> 00:29:51,080
or her lover, Dech?

348
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,550
Hey,

349
00:29:52,837 --> 00:29:54,204
if it wasn't for His Lordship,

350
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:56,280
I'd have kicked you
to death, Saeng.

351
00:29:56,603 --> 00:29:57,920
I think you're pissed at me

352
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,600
because I'm on to you.

353
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:03,080
What are you talking about?

354
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,912
Once you have a child
with Ms. Malai,

355
00:30:06,923 --> 00:30:09,645
you and your lover will conspire
to take His Lordship's fortune

356
00:30:09,657 --> 00:30:11,160
and live off it together.

357
00:30:13,523 --> 00:30:14,523
See?

358
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,400
The shock leaves you speechless.

359
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,720
But I won't let you succeed, Dech.

360
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,490
Malai!

361
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,267
Are you all right, Malai?

362
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,953
I was so frightened
when you sent for me.

363
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,440
I just wanted
to ask for your advice.

364
00:30:52,397 --> 00:30:54,130
I'm sorry for scaring you.

365
00:30:55,943 --> 00:30:57,104
That's a relief.

366
00:30:57,503 --> 00:31:00,896
At first I thought you
and the viscount had a big fight

367
00:31:01,143 --> 00:31:02,483
and you asked for me.

368
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,870
Or...

369
00:31:05,903 --> 00:31:06,983
you're pregnant?

370
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,040
Sorry about that, Bu-nga.

371
00:31:12,563 --> 00:31:14,160
How's it going, Ms. Malai?

372
00:31:14,637 --> 00:31:16,685
You were so upset
about not being pregnant

373
00:31:16,695 --> 00:31:18,720
that you ran off to
consult your best friend?

374
00:31:19,683 --> 00:31:22,320
Gee, I feel for her. Right, Chaem?

375
00:31:22,597 --> 00:31:25,040
She went all the way
to Hua Hin, but failed.

376
00:31:25,197 --> 00:31:26,520
What a waste of a trip.

377
00:31:26,897 --> 00:31:28,577
I agree, Ms. Ramphoei.

378
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,390
Eh? Or...

379
00:31:30,817 --> 00:31:32,130
you're barren, Ms. Malai?

380
00:31:32,563 --> 00:31:33,616
Goodness gracious.

381
00:31:33,823 --> 00:31:37,004
If that's the case,
that means the one who can give.

382
00:31:37,015 --> 00:31:39,600
His Lordship a child
would be you, Ms. Ramphoei.

383
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:42,040
- You're so right, Chaem.
- Yes, ma'am.

384
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,353
Let's not fight, Ms. Bu-nga.

385
00:31:47,193 --> 00:31:48,627
No need to stop me, Malai.

386
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,447
They came all the way here
to mock my best friend.

387
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:54,760
I have to slap
some sense into them.

388
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,747
Bring it on.

389
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,200
I caved last time
because you had a weapon.

390
00:31:59,323 --> 00:32:02,560
But I won't cave today. I'll slap
you until your mouth bleeds.

391
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:04,003
So true, ma'am.

392
00:32:04,117 --> 00:32:07,037
I'm not afraid either. This time
it's two on two. Bring it on.

393
00:32:16,297 --> 00:32:18,920
I won't hurt my hands
slapping someone like you.

394
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,703
I'd scratch my beautiful hands.

395
00:32:24,563 --> 00:32:25,983
You're all talk.

396
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:28,840
You're just afraid because
I mean business. Right, Chaem?

397
00:32:28,886 --> 00:32:32,653
You're right. She's "all talk,
no action," Ms. Ramphoei.

398
00:32:32,664 --> 00:32:33,664
Wait a minute.

399
00:32:34,173 --> 00:32:36,573
I haven't finished.
Don't interrupt.

400
00:32:37,563 --> 00:32:39,317
That's people
with no manners for you.

401
00:32:40,077 --> 00:32:41,517
I was going to say

402
00:32:42,257 --> 00:32:43,600
rich people like me

403
00:32:44,137 --> 00:32:45,783
don't need to do it ourselves

404
00:32:45,803 --> 00:32:48,760
to get the two of you
slapped real good.

405
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,450
Everyone!

406
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,650
Listen up!

407
00:33:00,453 --> 00:33:02,080
Whoever can slap these two,

408
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,320
come take the money in my hand.

409
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,840
Do you mean it, Miss?

410
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:09,937
Yes.

411
00:33:09,997 --> 00:33:11,730
I always keep my promises.

412
00:33:12,183 --> 00:33:14,043
You'll get all the money
in my hand.

413
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,983
Hey, come on!

414
00:33:16,457 --> 00:33:18,440
First come, first served!

415
00:33:19,637 --> 00:33:23,280
Hey, if no one takes it,
I'll take it!

416
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:26,030
My hands have been itching.
I'll slap you real good.

417
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,987
Go on! Go slap them! Go on!

418
00:33:31,087 --> 00:33:33,167
- Where are you running off to?!
- Go slap them!

419
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:34,960
This is so much fun.

420
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:36,093
Bu-nga.

421
00:33:41,977 --> 00:33:43,030
Where are they?

422
00:33:43,716 --> 00:33:44,817
Did you find them?

423
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,963
Where the hell are they?

424
00:33:47,963 --> 00:33:49,880
Yeah, I'm wondering the same thing.

425
00:33:50,757 --> 00:33:51,757
- Hey.
- Huh?

426
00:33:51,783 --> 00:33:53,056
Let's split up and find them.

427
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:54,856
- We'll split the money.
- Yeah. Let's go.

428
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:55,903
- Go!
- Go!

429
00:33:55,942 --> 00:33:57,049
Let's go this way!

430
00:33:57,067 --> 00:33:58,240
They're very quick.

431
00:33:58,251 --> 00:33:59,329
Don't let me find you.

432
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,340
Don't let me find you.

433
00:34:00,344 --> 00:34:01,344
Let's go!

434
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,920
Bu-nga, you bitch.

435
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,430
I'll kill you one day.

436
00:34:13,157 --> 00:34:15,784
We should get going
before anyone spots us. Come on.

437
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,880
Chaem, go that way.

438
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:22,620
- Come here.
- Yes, ma'am.

439
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,200
This way, ma'am.

440
00:34:28,396 --> 00:34:29,880
That' enough, Ms. Bu-nga.

441
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,457
I don't know how those two are now.

442
00:34:35,103 --> 00:34:36,103
Screw them.

443
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:38,560
Now they know not to mess
with someone like me.

444
00:34:39,617 --> 00:34:42,997
You have to come and tell me
when those two harass you.

445
00:34:43,196 --> 00:34:44,510
So I can take care of them.

446
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,960
If it weren't for you,
I'd be out of my depth.

447
00:34:49,497 --> 00:34:51,750
Having to share the roof
with someone like them.

448
00:34:53,336 --> 00:34:55,680
Right, I forgot
because we were interrupted.

449
00:34:56,843 --> 00:34:59,383
What made you ask me to come today?

450
00:35:02,613 --> 00:35:04,000
I want to divorce the viscount.

451
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,837
Are you sure, Ms. Malai?

452
00:35:08,377 --> 00:35:09,924
This is a very big deal.

453
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,650
I'm sure.

454
00:35:14,075 --> 00:35:15,543
It's good I'm not pregnant.

455
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,263
The divorce will be easier.

456
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,723
But if you divorce him now,
you won't get anything

457
00:35:22,103 --> 00:35:24,976
because the viscount
won't get his inheritance.

458
00:35:27,223 --> 00:35:30,216
Even if I'm left penniless,
I'll get my freedom back.

459
00:35:33,063 --> 00:35:34,800
Is the viscount so horrible

460
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,010
you can't stand being with him?

461
00:35:39,363 --> 00:35:40,483
That's not it.

462
00:35:41,703 --> 00:35:43,400
The viscount's been
very good to me

463
00:35:44,903 --> 00:35:47,800
but I feel trapped
in my current situation.

464
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,503
I don't know how to explain it.

465
00:35:51,256 --> 00:35:53,183
But I don't want to live
like that anymore.

466
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:57,080
So what will you do for a living?

467
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,683
I'm not scolding you.

468
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:01,600
But I know how scared
my best friend gets.

469
00:36:03,823 --> 00:36:04,823
That's true.

470
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:07,770
I admit I'm like that.

471
00:36:08,283 --> 00:36:09,283
I'm scared.

472
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,440
Scared of being alone.

473
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:13,950
Scared of the future.

474
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,733
Scared of everything.

475
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:19,960
But I'm not scared anymore.

476
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,053
Because I know...

477
00:36:24,303 --> 00:36:25,423
I'm not alone.

478
00:36:28,976 --> 00:36:30,930
You have someone
you're gonna live with?

479
00:36:48,063 --> 00:36:49,836
I was just speaking figuratively.

480
00:36:50,537 --> 00:36:53,920
I meant if other people can manage,
then I can manage too.

481
00:36:55,577 --> 00:36:57,400
Look at my best friend,
for example.

482
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,103
You're so strong, right?

483
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:05,690
If you're this determined,
I guess you can divorce him.

484
00:37:06,482 --> 00:37:09,880
But you must have a good reason
for the viscount to agree.

485
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,497
A good reason?

486
00:37:14,373 --> 00:37:15,373
For example,

487
00:37:15,786 --> 00:37:17,842
the viscount
has hurt you physically

488
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:20,000
or emotionally
while you were married.

489
00:37:21,793 --> 00:37:24,040
He never hurt me physically.

490
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:26,123
Like I said,

491
00:37:26,843 --> 00:37:28,476
His Lordship takes good care of me.

492
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,760
But now that he has...

493
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,490
Ramphoei,

494
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:35,956
someone who'd give him
children in my place.

495
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:38,984
Without me,

496
00:37:39,983 --> 00:37:41,600
there wouldn't be any problem.

497
00:37:44,077 --> 00:37:45,920
If it's as you've described,

498
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,257
it shouldn't be hard
to divorce him.

499
00:37:58,183 --> 00:38:00,360
I wonder if Malai's back.

500
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,264
If she's back, should we
pick a fight with her again?

501
00:38:03,383 --> 00:38:04,696
To avenge us.

502
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,576
Why did you slap me?

503
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,430
Whenever there's a fight,
you're the first one to run.

504
00:38:14,441 --> 00:38:15,710
And you dared ask me?

505
00:38:17,173 --> 00:38:18,366
I'm sorry, ma'am.

506
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:21,360
And this is the viscount's house.
You want me to be scolded?

507
00:38:23,783 --> 00:38:25,920
Go. Prepare a bath for me.

508
00:38:25,983 --> 00:38:28,264
I'm so itchy from
hiding under that basket.

509
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,170
Yes, ma'am.

510
00:38:51,823 --> 00:38:55,043
You don't have to force yourself
to sleep with Dech anymore.

511
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,830
I'll have Dech sleep with Ramphoei.

(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

513
00:39:05,422 --> 00:39:09,969
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

514
00:39:10,457 --> 00:39:12,594
Go. Prepare a bath for me.

515
00:39:12,657 --> 00:39:14,938
I'm so itchy from
hiding under that basket.

516
00:39:15,844 --> 00:39:16,844
Yes, ma'am.

517
00:39:39,303 --> 00:39:40,890
Are you all right, Ms. Ramphoei?

518
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:45,083
Uh...

519
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,630
I'm fine.

520
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,290
I'm sorry.

521
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:53,149
I was helping Kam carry these.
I didn't see you.

522
00:39:55,069 --> 00:39:56,589
Just be careful next time.

523
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,020
Yes, ma'am.

524
00:39:58,867 --> 00:39:59,867
I'm sorry.

525
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:51,043
You're really going to
divorce His Lordship?

526
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,160
Why do you look shocked?

527
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,430
If I divorce him,

528
00:41:01,017 --> 00:41:03,750
we can start over
somewhere else together.

529
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,530
Or you're...

530
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,480
worried about struggling with me?

531
00:41:16,977 --> 00:41:18,650
It's not that, Ms. Malai.

532
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,000
Don't misunderstand me.

533
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:25,117
I was a beggar as a child.

534
00:41:25,422 --> 00:41:26,869
I've been a servant all my life.

535
00:41:27,456 --> 00:41:29,137
Why would I worry about struggling?

536
00:41:29,817 --> 00:41:31,497
So what's the problem?

537
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:32,857
Tell me.

538
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:40,177
I just don't want you
to make a mistake.

539
00:41:42,717 --> 00:41:44,784
Dech, I've thought it through.

540
00:41:45,763 --> 00:41:47,696
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

541
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,280
Because I have you.

542
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,680
You've made me brave,
you know that?

543
00:41:57,497 --> 00:41:58,604
Unless...

544
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,723
you don't want to be
with me anymore.

545
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,240
That's not true, Ms. Malai.

546
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:13,080
I love you.

547
00:42:14,943 --> 00:42:16,200
More than life itself.

548
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,480
As long as I'm with you,

549
00:42:20,197 --> 00:42:21,930
I don't need anything else.

550
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:27,769
We have our brains.

551
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,589
We have our hands.

552
00:42:32,077 --> 00:42:35,800
It beats me having to live
this bittersweet life until I die.

553
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:41,590
Leave the Dark Shadow
House with me.

554
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:46,410
Yes, ma'am.

555
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,050
Dech?

556
00:43:13,823 --> 00:43:14,823
Come in.

557
00:43:22,663 --> 00:43:23,663
What, Malai?

558
00:43:26,743 --> 00:43:28,200
I need to talk to you.

559
00:43:28,503 --> 00:43:30,240
I need to talk to you too.

560
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:32,480
Then you can go first, my lord.

561
00:43:36,003 --> 00:43:39,223
You don't have to force yourself
to sleep with Dech anymore.

562
00:43:39,463 --> 00:43:40,463
Why?

563
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:49,310
My lord.

564
00:43:50,357 --> 00:43:51,640
You don't want...

565
00:43:52,457 --> 00:43:54,523
me to give you an heir anymore?

566
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:02,730
Actually,

567
00:44:03,529 --> 00:44:05,596
I love you very much, you know?

568
00:44:05,823 --> 00:44:06,949
So much that...

569
00:44:07,443 --> 00:44:10,720
I can't watch you sleep
with another man anymore.

570
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,716
We've gone this far.

571
00:44:13,976 --> 00:44:15,656
Are you still talking about this?

572
00:44:15,815 --> 00:44:18,889
The one who's hurt and became
damaged goods is me alone.

573
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,857
I'll take the blame
for everything so far.

574
00:44:26,183 --> 00:44:28,114
You can call me names all you want.

575
00:44:28,823 --> 00:44:30,480
What I'm trying to say is...

576
00:44:30,683 --> 00:44:32,903
I don't mind that you've slept
with someone else.

577
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,513
All I ask is
for you to love me again.

578
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,400
Didn't you say we'd be good friend?

579
00:44:43,177 --> 00:44:44,329
There's nothing wrong

580
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,720
with us being both friends
and a married couple.

581
00:44:49,307 --> 00:44:51,267
- What about your inheritance?
- That...

582
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,133
I'll find a solution

583
00:44:54,087 --> 00:44:56,487
without making you unhappy again.

584
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:00,810
Please forgive me.

585
00:45:24,276 --> 00:45:25,889
I have something important

586
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,360
to tell the people
I trust most in this house.

587
00:45:28,803 --> 00:45:31,458
How can I serve you, my lord?'
I'm happy to...

588
00:45:31,468 --> 00:45:33,609
You don't have to sleep
with Malai anymore.

589
00:45:34,202 --> 00:45:36,102
I'm revoking this order
permanently.

590
00:45:42,616 --> 00:45:43,656
Yes, my lord.

591
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,963
You want me to go in his place?

592
00:45:48,283 --> 00:45:49,283
Saeng!

593
00:45:49,343 --> 00:45:50,350
Quiet!

594
00:45:50,702 --> 00:45:51,823
And let me finish.

595
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:54,910
Like Dech said,

596
00:45:55,657 --> 00:45:57,337
Ms. Malai isn't a pet

597
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,230
to be bred with random guys.

598
00:46:02,563 --> 00:46:03,843
I'm just worried

599
00:46:04,483 --> 00:46:06,603
if Dech can't get
Ms. Malai pregnant,

600
00:46:07,277 --> 00:46:09,717
where will you get
your father an heir?

601
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,783
Ramphoei.

602
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:17,817
You mean...

603
00:46:18,377 --> 00:46:21,319
You're gonna have me sleep
with Ms. Ramphoei for you?

604
00:46:27,881 --> 00:46:29,657
I'll have Dech sleep with Ramphoei.

605
00:46:41,683 --> 00:46:45,770
The guy I'll have you sleep with
isn't a stranger, but it's Dech.

606
00:46:45,877 --> 00:46:47,960
I promise he can be trusted.

607
00:46:51,263 --> 00:46:52,800
If that's what you want,

608
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:55,983
can I ask one thing from you?

609
00:46:56,223 --> 00:47:00,543
If you're gonna take my child,
give me enough money to start over.

610
00:47:00,563 --> 00:47:03,480
You're not leaving with Fueang.
You're leaving with Malai.

611
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:04,377
No way!

612
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:06,336
Then I won't sleep
with Ms. Ramphoei.

613
00:47:06,383 --> 00:47:08,003
No matter what happens,

614
00:47:08,023 --> 00:47:10,756
there's only you
in my heart, Ms. Malai.

615
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:13,520
Please forgive me, Ms. Malai.

616
00:47:13,836 --> 00:47:14,943
What's wrong, Dech?

617
00:47:15,296 --> 00:47:16,490
I can't do this, ma'am.

618
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,160
I want to divorce you, my lord.
