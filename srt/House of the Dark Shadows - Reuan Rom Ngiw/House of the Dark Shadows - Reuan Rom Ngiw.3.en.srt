"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 3)

19
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,400
As for Kam and Uan,

20
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:04,760
they were already married
when they came here.

21
00:02:05,143 --> 00:02:07,600
But they've only been here
for a few years.

22
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:09,545
They had a paddy field once,

23
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:11,835
but it failed
and they became indebted.

24
00:02:13,089 --> 00:02:14,122
This way, please.

25
00:02:15,162 --> 00:02:17,382
So they asked
His Lordship for help

26
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:19,920
and became his servants in return.

27
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:29,200
As for other servants,
they come and go as you see.

28
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,880
What about you, Fueang?

29
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:33,643
Do you want to leave
and lead your own life?

30
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:36,542
I do, ma'am.

31
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:39,896
I've been saving my pay
from His Lordship

32
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:42,629
in case I want to settle down
and go into trade.

33
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:46,484
But His Lordship's kindness
makes it hard to tell him.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,760
If he and I have a child,

35
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,800
I can tell him for you.

36
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:52,093
Really?

37
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:58,176
If you really leave,
I'll be very sad.

38
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:02,423
You've been very good
to me, you know?

39
00:03:02,856 --> 00:03:05,760
In this house,
I trust you the most.

40
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:08,400
I'm very fond of you
as well, ma'am.

41
00:03:09,596 --> 00:03:11,600
Let's get going or we'll be late.

42
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:12,850
- Let's.
- Let's go.

43
00:03:13,456 --> 00:03:14,560
Watch your step.

44
00:03:22,997 --> 00:03:25,124
- Let's go.
- Where are you going, Ms. Malai?

45
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:28,817
The market.

46
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:32,600
What do you want?
I'll get it for you.

47
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:34,720
Nothing. Thanks.

48
00:04:01,863 --> 00:04:03,663
Those are His Lordship's debtors.

49
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:11,680
Don't mention the kindness
I've been showing you.

50
00:04:12,797 --> 00:04:15,677
Right now I'd rather you
think about what's proper

51
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,590
and what is not.

52
00:04:18,137 --> 00:04:21,640
From now on I'll be careful
not to offend you again, sir.

53
00:04:21,877 --> 00:04:22,877
Good.

54
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,160
I actually don't want to…

55
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,583
Come in.

56
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,683
Here, my lord.

57
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:34,857
Thanks.

58
00:04:37,263 --> 00:04:38,943
As for your trip to Lampang,

59
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,903
I've arranged everything, sir.

60
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:44,397
Thanks.

61
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:47,600
After Dech, it's you,
Saeng, that I trust

62
00:04:48,283 --> 00:04:51,240
to carry out all my orders.

63
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:53,753
Thank you, sir.

64
00:05:01,777 --> 00:05:03,080
Oh, Your Lordship,

65
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:06,560
earlier did your debtors
come to pay their debt?

66
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,000
Those two who just left?

67
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:12,906
They didn't have my money.
They asked for a delay.

68
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:14,247
But I refused.

69
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:16,726
If they don't pay me this time,

70
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,340
I'll take their land.

71
00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:25,680
What did they say to you?

72
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:31,230
I was wondering

73
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:35,410
why they had to cover their faces
and act suspicious on their boat.

74
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,440
But I was on the bank.

75
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,240
They probably didn't notice me.

76
00:05:39,377 --> 00:05:40,870
Where did you see them?

77
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:42,480
In the canal

78
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,856
when they followed Ms. Malai.

79
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:52,690
Maybe they had
malicious intent toward Ms. Malai.

80
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:54,970
Malai.

81
00:06:49,177 --> 00:06:50,177
Hey, hurry.

82
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,363
Why are you rowing so fast, Fueang?

83
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,463
I'm not sure either,
but better safe than sorry.

84
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,237
This is not good.

85
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:10,417
Hurry up.

86
00:07:10,557 --> 00:07:11,640
Yes, Ms. Malai.

87
00:07:13,677 --> 00:07:15,230
At least find someone's house.

88
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:17,344
- Yes, Ms. Malai. Yes.
- Hurry, Fueang!

89
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:23,156
Hey, hurry.

90
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,630
Hurry, Fueang!

91
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:41,717
Let's go, Fueang!

92
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,600
Where are they now?

93
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,310
Hurry up!

94
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:01,321
Yes, sir!

95
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,990
It's okay, Ms. Malai. Hold on!

96
00:08:04,997 --> 00:08:05,997
Go straight.

97
00:08:07,297 --> 00:08:08,297
Hurry.

98
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,560
- Hurry.
- Don't!

99
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:11,966
Help!

100
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:13,799
Where are you going?

101
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:15,292
Where are you going?

102
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:19,673
Hurry! Faster!

103
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:21,606
Come on!

104
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:27,449
Where are you going?

105
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,276
Let her go! Let Ms. Malai go!

106
00:08:31,382 --> 00:08:33,469
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

107
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:36,369
Let go! Let go!

108
00:08:39,123 --> 00:08:40,123
Go!

109
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:41,129
Ms. Malai!

110
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:42,800
- Help!
- Watch out, Ms. Malai!

111
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,256
Let go!

112
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:48,409
Release Ms. Malai!

113
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:51,123
Hey!

114
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,490
Malai!

115
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,010
Ms. Malai!

116
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:07,640
- Malai!
- Ms. Malai?!

117
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:13,474
- Dech!
- Ms. Malai!

118
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:17,474
You!

119
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,990
Hey!

120
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,130
Dech!

121
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,430
Dech!

122
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,110
Dech!

123
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:46,123
Ms. Malai!

124
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,303
Malai!

125
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,090
Ms. Malai!

126
00:10:20,297 --> 00:10:21,297
Ms. Malai!

127
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,150
Ms. Malai!

128
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:02,483
Ms. Malai.

129
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:03,677
Ms. Malai!

130
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,440
Saeng, hurry up!

131
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,530
Ms. Malai!

132
00:11:07,157 --> 00:11:08,960
- Malai!
- Ms. Malai!

133
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,037
Malai?

134
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,510
Malai?

135
00:11:12,843 --> 00:11:13,956
- Ms. Malai?
- Ms. Malai?

136
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:16,610
Saeng, hurry. Lift her.

137
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:18,383
Malai?

138
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,040
- Ms. Malai?
- Malai?

139
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,840
Malai? Malai?

140
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:24,883
Are you okay, Malai?

141
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:27,109
Your Lordship.

142
00:11:27,716 --> 00:11:28,716
Malai.

143
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:39,663
Why did you take my floats
that I made a wish on, Dech?

144
00:11:39,851 --> 00:11:41,994
Don't you want
His Lordship to have children?

145
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:43,223
You're evil!

146
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:51,989
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

147
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:56,922
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

148
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,476
You're awake, Malai.

149
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:25,123
Your Lordship.

150
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:27,243
Get up slowly.

151
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,440
Don't be scared. You're safe now.

152
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:38,650
What about… What about…

153
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,823
Those bastards…

154
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,370
One is dead,

155
00:12:41,783 --> 00:12:43,130
the other was arrested.

156
00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:47,163
You don't have to worry that
they'll come back and hurt you.

157
00:12:49,963 --> 00:12:52,120
If you didn't rescue me in time,

158
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:55,040
I would have…

159
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,176
Come here.

160
00:12:59,743 --> 00:13:00,743
It's over.

161
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:03,656
It's over now.

162
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:13,880
How is Ms. Malai doing?

163
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,964
Is she hurt or feverish?
Is she awake?

164
00:13:18,037 --> 00:13:19,484
So many questions.

165
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:22,080
Which one do you want
answered first?

166
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,000
Pick one and answer me.
I'm worried.

167
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:26,723
Get it together.

168
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:28,797
Who are you to Ms. Malai?

169
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:31,188
She's His Lordship's wife,

170
00:13:31,584 --> 00:13:32,584
not yours.

171
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:36,257
Sit.

172
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:47,560
We've known each other
since we were kids.

173
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:50,697
I know what you're thinking.

174
00:13:55,277 --> 00:13:58,280
But what you're thinking
is impossible.

175
00:13:59,883 --> 00:14:01,240
Do you know the saying,

176
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,320
"Finding a beautiful tree
when the ax is chipped"?

177
00:14:04,383 --> 00:14:06,303
And that wood is already taken.

178
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,096
What are you talking about?

179
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,683
I'm not thinking anything.

180
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,437
I was just worried
about my master's wife.

181
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:19,960
Go lie to someone else.

182
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:21,270
Don't lie to me.

183
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,070
Why…

184
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:30,120
don't you try looking for
something that's possible?

185
00:14:41,183 --> 00:14:42,640
I know you like me.

186
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,383
Thanks a lot

187
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:48,657
for being fond of me.

188
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,477
But to me, you're my sister

189
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:55,657
who can never be anything more.

190
00:14:58,123 --> 00:14:59,360
You understand, right?

191
00:15:13,857 --> 00:15:17,137
So you had Fueang take you
to buy tonic from Tid Khloi.

192
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:19,716
I was wondering
why your left suddenly.

193
00:15:22,063 --> 00:15:24,360
We've been married for months now.

194
00:15:25,517 --> 00:15:27,720
But I'm not with child yet.

195
00:15:29,343 --> 00:15:32,200
I feel horrible
for not doing my duty.

196
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,350
That's why I…

197
00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:35,760
Goodness, Malai.

198
00:15:36,497 --> 00:15:38,630
I've never reprimanded you once.

199
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:41,040
Why are you so worried?

200
00:15:41,797 --> 00:15:43,797
How can I not be worried?

201
00:15:44,217 --> 00:15:45,832
If I don't give you a child

202
00:15:45,842 --> 00:15:48,520
in the time frame
your father gave you,

203
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,840
you won't get
your inheritance because of me.

204
00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:53,597
You…

205
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,443
You knew about that?

206
00:15:57,377 --> 00:15:58,377
Uh…

207
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:00,800
I'm sorry, my lord, for…

208
00:16:01,463 --> 00:16:03,480
learning your personal business.

209
00:16:04,683 --> 00:16:07,560
Still, I'm already
your wife, Your Lordship.

210
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:11,040
I will give you children.

211
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:17,756
I'm happy just knowing
you mean well.

212
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:19,896
About my inheritance,

213
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,840
I'll figure something out.

214
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,023
Don't worry about it.

215
00:16:24,377 --> 00:16:25,497
Your Lordship,

216
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,563
the fact that
you're not reprimanding me

217
00:16:31,897 --> 00:16:33,680
worries me even more.

218
00:16:34,063 --> 00:16:35,320
That's enough, Malai.

219
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,560
I said not to worry.

220
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,120
I'm not upset with you at all.

221
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,880
Get some rest.

222
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,720
I'll sit with you
until you fall asleep.

223
00:16:47,063 --> 00:16:48,063
Come on.

224
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,250
- Yes, my lord.
- Come on.

225
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:54,517
Careful.

226
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,023
Goddess of Water,

227
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:45,960
please help me

228
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:48,680
conceive a child soon.

231
00:18:20,595 --> 00:18:21,595
Dech!

232
00:18:24,948 --> 00:18:26,122
What's in your hands?

233
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:31,480
Why are you hiding it from me?

234
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,520
It's nothing.

235
00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:34,435
You don't need to know.

236
00:18:35,362 --> 00:18:37,042
So why did you call me?

237
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:39,160
Rice was delivered at the pier.

238
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:42,640
I wanted you to help me
carry it to the kitchen.

239
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:45,480
Let me put my stuff back.
I'll be right behind you.

240
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:50,133
- Hurry.
- Mm.

241
00:18:53,214 --> 00:18:54,494
What's with him?

242
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:02,437
Oops.

243
00:19:02,497 --> 00:19:04,030
Where are you running off to?

244
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,683
A government official came to
get a document from the viscount.

245
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:09,363
But he left it with Dech.

246
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,840
The official said
it was an urgent matter.

247
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:16,194
If I delay him, I'm afraid
His Lordship will scold me.

248
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,813
Then we'll find it together
to save time.

249
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,173
You go out front.
I'll check the servant house.

250
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Yes, ma'am.

251
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,010
Dech!

252
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,950
Dech!

253
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,630
Dech?

254
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,883
I'm here to get the document
His Lordship left with you.

255
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
Dech?

256
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,010
Dech?

257
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,400
Why did you take my floats
that I made a wish on, Dech?

258
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,596
Did I do something to anger you

259
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:02,830
that made you do this to me?

260
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:06,867
You know I want children.

261
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:08,960
So I made these offerings.

262
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:13,720
They gave me a little hope.

263
00:21:13,953 --> 00:21:15,646
Must you destroy it?

264
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,506
It's not what you think, Ms. Malai.

265
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:22,120
- Ms. Malai! Ms. Malai!
- Not what I think?

266
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,873
Not what I think, Dech?!

267
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,920
You can be angry with me
all you want.

268
00:21:29,907 --> 00:21:32,294
But aren't you
grateful to the viscount?

269
00:21:32,654 --> 00:21:34,779
Don't you want him
to have children?

270
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,140
Why?

271
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:39,486
Is his rice not good enough
so you're doing this to me?

272
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:45,196
If I'm ungrateful as you say,

273
00:21:45,623 --> 00:21:47,757
I would have left this place
a long time ago.

274
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,240
I'm still here
because of the word "gratitude"!

275
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,110
Gratitude you'll never understand!

276
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,120
That's how you see me.

277
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:58,707
Good.

278
00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:00,320
I'm gonna tell His Lordship.

279
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,927
So that he will be careful

280
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:04,360
since the confidant

281
00:22:04,587 --> 00:22:06,374
he trusts thinks this way.

282
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,560
Let me warn you, ma'am.

283
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,046
If His Lordship
finds out about this,

284
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,560
it's you who will be in trouble.

285
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:20,746
You dare threaten me?!

286
00:22:22,737 --> 00:22:24,654
You foiled my chances
of having children,

287
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,383
now you're threatening me.

288
00:22:27,343 --> 00:22:29,283
I shouldn't have
thought you decent.

289
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,610
Evil! You're evil!

290
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,047
Actually, I wanted to
ask for your advice.

291
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:42,487
I was kissed.

Ms. Malai, where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

297
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,550
Ms. Malai?

298
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,290
Why are you flushed?

299
00:24:12,043 --> 00:24:13,320
Are you sick?

300
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:15,243
Are you hurt anywhere?

301
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:21,320
Say something, ma'am. I'm worried.

302
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,350
I'm fine.

303
00:24:24,043 --> 00:24:25,320
Please tell Dech.

304
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:27,880
His Lordship wanted
the government document.

305
00:24:28,596 --> 00:24:29,596
Yes, ma'am.

306
00:25:16,443 --> 00:25:17,443
You're evil!

307
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:31,320

I'll be humiliated.

00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,069
Dech?

310
00:26:45,857 --> 00:26:47,120
What's wrong with you?

311
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,410
Hey!

312
00:26:52,163 --> 00:26:53,163

315
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:00,000
Tell me what's wrong.

316
00:27:00,597 --> 00:27:02,800
You usually don't drink this much.

317
00:27:04,383 --> 00:27:07,560
It's none of your business.
You don't need to know, Fueang.

318
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,960
I have to go up north

319
00:27:48,203 --> 00:27:51,200
but I can't take you with me
because the journey will be rough.

320
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,280
I must entrust this house
to you until I return.

321
00:28:03,363 --> 00:28:05,176
Malai, what's wrong?

322
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,880
What, Your Lordship?

323
00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:11,010
Did you hear me when I said

324
00:28:11,383 --> 00:28:13,320
that I'd go up north for work?

325
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:20,120
Are you sick? You look pale.

326
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,750
Uh…

327
00:28:22,923 --> 00:28:24,256
it's probably…

328
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:26,517
a mild case of heat stroke.

329
00:28:27,523 --> 00:28:29,310
The sun was very strong today.

330
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,360
Then you should get some rest.

331
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,600
I'll have a wash and change.

332
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
I won't bother you.

333
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:23,383
You did this, Dech.

334
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,843
You'll be away for so long.

335
00:29:34,723 --> 00:29:37,036
Please take good care of yourself.

336
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,880
Don't worry, Malai.

337
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,560
I'll have Dech and Saeng with me.

338
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:43,863
It's just three months.
I'll be home soon.

339
00:29:48,017 --> 00:29:51,600
While I'm away, help Ms. Malai
take care of the house, Fueang.

340
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,110
Yes, sir.

341
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,600
I'm gonna go, Malai.

342
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:00,533
Have a safe trip, my lord.

343
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:02,859
Goodbye.

344
00:30:18,157 --> 00:30:19,796
Dech, let's go.

345
00:30:19,997 --> 00:30:21,117
Pay attention.

346
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,800
Forgive me, my lord.

347
00:30:55,877 --> 00:30:57,664
You invited me
to worship the Buddha.

I wanted to worship the Buddha
for my peace of mind. That's all.

350
00:31:08,023 --> 00:31:11,840
I'm gonna take your invitation
as a chance to learn my fortune.

351

Actually, I wanted to
ask for your advice.

352
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:25,056
I was kissed.

353
00:31:28,196 --> 00:31:29,440
Do you like it, my lord?

354
00:31:29,743 --> 00:31:31,543
Of course. I like it a lot.

355
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:33,409

00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:22,080
What did you say?

365
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,320
I was kissed.

366
00:32:25,657 --> 00:32:27,760
I don't know what to do, Bu-nga.

367
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,697
Being kissed is normal.

368
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:33,280
Why are you excited?

369
00:32:33,607 --> 00:32:35,000
You're married now.

370
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,950
Why?

371
00:32:37,037 --> 00:32:38,803
Has the viscount never kissed you?

372
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,310
Well…

373
00:32:43,123 --> 00:32:46,103
You must have done more than
kissing on your wedding night.

374
00:32:46,103 --> 00:32:47,416
No way you haven't kissed.

375
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,430
Or…

376
00:32:53,697 --> 00:32:55,320
you never had sex
with the viscount?

377
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,017
You brought this stuff up yourself.

378
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,746
But you wouldn't answer
when I asked.

379
00:33:03,757 --> 00:33:04,770
At this rate,

380
00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:07,520
even if I want to help,
I won't be able to help you.

381
00:33:08,597 --> 00:33:10,440
It's an awkward subject.

382
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,680
Say it in a low voice.

383
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,133
No one is listening in.

384
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,760
It's just you and me.

385
00:33:19,273 --> 00:33:23,140
I have sex with His Lordship
almost every night.

386
00:33:23,213 --> 00:33:26,760
Except for when I get my period.

387
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,660
Then…

388
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,440
tell me in detail what it's like.

389
00:33:32,153 --> 00:33:34,100
Don't be a pervert, Bu-nga.

390
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,960
I'm embarrassed just saying this.

391
00:33:37,593 --> 00:33:39,593
If you've really had sex with him,

392
00:33:39,747 --> 00:33:41,400
you must be able to describe it.

393
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,207
How about this?

394
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,400
Nod when I get something right.

395
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:48,740
Shake your head if I'm wrong. Okay?

396
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,100
All right.

397
00:33:54,343 --> 00:33:55,543
Were you naked?

398
00:34:04,103 --> 00:34:05,360
Kissed each other's cheek?

399
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,480
Did he put it in?

400
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:12,757
Bu-nga!

401
00:34:13,523 --> 00:34:14,963
How could you ask that?

402
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,017
I can't answer that.

403
00:34:19,077 --> 00:34:20,480
You can't answer me

404
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,443
because you're embarrassed

405
00:34:22,483 --> 00:34:24,616
or because what I asked never happened?

406
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:29,069
I don't remember

407
00:34:29,336 --> 00:34:31,962
if what you asked
actually happened.

408
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:36,156
Then I have only one conclusion.

409
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:39,640
You never had sex
with the viscount.

410
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:47,409
So who was it that kissed you

411
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,477
and left you so shaken up
you had to go worship the Buddha?

412
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:53,637
Nobody.

413
00:34:55,023 --> 00:34:56,229
Someone like you,

414
00:34:56,443 --> 00:34:58,676
who could you have kissed
if not your own husband?

415
00:34:58,923 --> 00:34:59,923
Eh?

416
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:03,137
But if it was with the viscount,
why were you so shaken up?

417
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,070
I knew you were old-fashioned,

418
00:35:09,381 --> 00:35:11,560
but I didn't think
you were this bad.

419
00:35:12,488 --> 00:35:13,488
Hm?

420
00:35:27,723 --> 00:35:28,843
Coffee, my lord.

421
00:35:30,077 --> 00:35:31,077
Thanks, Dech.

422
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,840
It's my pleasure.

423
00:35:41,769 --> 00:35:42,909
What's that sound?

424
00:35:43,023 --> 00:35:45,120
A roar. Probably a tiger.

425
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,840
Argh!

426
00:35:48,643 --> 00:35:49,643
That's a man.

427
00:35:50,376 --> 00:35:51,836
I'll take a look, my lord.

428
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,903
Saeng, look after His Lordship.

429
00:35:55,996 --> 00:35:57,776
- Wait, Dech! Dech!
- You can't, sir.

430
00:35:58,043 --> 00:35:59,670
- Dech!
- It's dangerous. You can't.

431
00:36:00,803 --> 00:36:01,803
Damn it.

432
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:14,696
With Dech and Saeng away
with His Lordship,

433
00:37:15,143 --> 00:37:16,776
the house is very quiet.

434
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:20,537
You're right.

435
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,603
I wonder where His Lordship is now.

436
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:29,477
Once he arrived, he'll send word.

437
00:37:30,137 --> 00:37:32,137
You don't have to worry, Ms. Malai.

438
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,750
Thanks.

439
00:37:34,717 --> 00:37:36,600
If you're done here, you can go.

440
00:37:37,123 --> 00:37:38,123
Yes, ma'am.

441
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,440
This is a waste of time.

442
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,640
We let him rest here. Now we're
wasting our medicine on him too?

443
00:38:20,437 --> 00:38:22,800
I didn't want to leave
an injured man alone.

444
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:27,200
You can go on ahead with Saeng.
I'll be right behind you.

445
00:38:27,703 --> 00:38:28,703
Fine.

446
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:30,017
Of course I'll go.

447
00:38:30,777 --> 00:38:32,357
Who's gonna wait for a servant?

448
00:38:34,877 --> 00:38:36,157
Let's go, Saeng!

449
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,170
Yes, sir.

450
00:38:44,403 --> 00:38:45,703
I'm sorry, son.

451
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:48,520
You were scolded because of me.

452
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:49,996
It's okay.

453
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:53,616
I came across a man in trouble.
How could I possibly leave him?

454
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,440
At first I thought
you might kill me.

455
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,500
I didn't think you could
kill a tiger with one dart.

456
00:39:01,913 --> 00:39:03,320
What's your secret?

457
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
This.

458
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,360
It's deadly.

459
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:17,347
I've heard someone
stole my friend's kiss.

460
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,200
Do you have any idea who that was?

461
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:24,020
I swear that
if I offend you again,

462
00:39:24,107 --> 00:39:25,494
I will die painfully…

463
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:29,713
Mark my words, Chaem.

464
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:33,200
I'm gonna get Malai
kicked out of this house.

465
00:39:33,877 --> 00:39:34,877
Oh!

466
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,360
Phoem!

467
00:39:36,463 --> 00:39:38,800
I want to make magic love powder.

468
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,590
Use this for now.

469
00:39:43,777 --> 00:39:45,430
