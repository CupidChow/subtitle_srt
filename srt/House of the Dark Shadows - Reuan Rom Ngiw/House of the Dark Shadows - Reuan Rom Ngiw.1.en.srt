What's wrong?!

3
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:21,683
Get off me!

4
00:01:22,043 --> 00:01:23,043
Get off!

5
00:02:21,357 --> 00:02:22,357

"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 1)

24
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,230
(1940)

25
00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:46,477
It's just a rumor.

26
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:48,103
Ghosts don't exist!

27
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:49,943
It's not a rumor, Mr. Sing.

28
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:52,520
The guy who survived has gone mad.

29
00:04:52,743 --> 00:04:55,000
He's been telling everyone
in the market.

30
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:56,716
- It's true.
- How about this?

31
00:04:57,103 --> 00:04:58,783
I'll double your fee.

32
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,076
Demolish it or burn it down.

33
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:01,843
Just make sure
the Dark Shadow House is gone.

34
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,623
Even for ten or twenty times
more money, we won't do it.

35
00:05:05,963 --> 00:05:08,370
We'd rather keep our lives
to be with our families.

36
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:10,437
Here's your deposit.

37
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,340
- You idiots are just...
- Goodbye.

38
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,446
Go, go.

39
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,093
What the hell? They're all useless.

40
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,400
It's the same every damn time!

41
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,940
I've paid them.

42
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,720
I've threatened them.

43
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:25,360
No one has come through.

44
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,666
It's the ghost of…

45
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,513
The ghost is so vengeful.
So who would dare demolish it?

46
00:05:32,313 --> 00:05:34,853
Sing, we're already rich.

47
00:05:35,113 --> 00:05:37,960
We have more money than
we'll ever need in this life.

48
00:05:38,146 --> 00:05:40,326
Not to mention
our assets and farms.

49
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,466
Why do you need that piece of land?

50
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,400
Have you any idea

51
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,600
how much those foreigners

52
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:49,353
offered me?

53
00:05:50,113 --> 00:05:52,746
More than decades of running the
rice mills would ever make me.

54
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:55,000
Not selling it right now
would be stupid.

55
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:00,240
You're gonna keep
that house to shame yourself?

56
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,240
Has there ever been
a night you sleep soundly?

57
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:07,366
Let's demolish it

58
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,320
for our peace of mind

59
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:12,793
and our son.

60
00:06:14,553 --> 00:06:15,553
Of course.

61
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:18,400
But no one would accept the job.

62
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:20,072
Who's gonna demolish it for us?

63
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:23,640
The problem is not
who's gonna demolish it.

64
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,199
The problem…

65
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:31,599
is the ghost haunting that house.

66
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:51,600
(Buddhist chant)

67
00:06:56,157 --> 00:06:58,597
You finally showed up,
you malicious ghost.

68
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:01,216
Please forgive me.

69
00:07:02,057 --> 00:07:03,800
This must be done.

70
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,257
Please leave
and be reborn, Ms. Malai.

71
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:09,543
You died, Ms. Malai.
Why do you care about this place?

72
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,120
Give it to me, please.

73
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:21,840
I thought you'd be better.

74
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:00,537
Open!

75
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:02,143
Hey, what the hell?!

76
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,223
Ms. Malai,

77
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,480
don't hurt me, please.

78
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:11,997
Forgive me.
I won't step in here again.

79
00:08:12,003 --> 00:08:13,003
Hey!

80
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,630
Why are you begging?

81
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,320
Stop being scared!

82
00:08:17,183 --> 00:08:18,760
Come out if you dare!

83
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,117
- Come out!
- Sing!

84
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,143
Don't dare her like that.

85
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,550
Hey!

86
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,000
Come out, Malai! Come out!

87
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,830
Come out!

88
00:08:38,837 --> 00:08:39,837
Malai.

89
00:08:54,443 --> 00:08:55,443
Sing?

90
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,360
Sing? Sing?

91
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
Sing?

92
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:08,283
Sing?

93
00:09:08,737 --> 00:09:09,737
How are you?

94
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,040
Does this mean your amulet to
defeat Malai's ghost...?

95
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,450
Sing?

96
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,960
Sing, let go. Sing?

97
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:25,543
Let go, Sing. Sing!

98
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:38,796
Ms. Malai, let me go, please.

99
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,437
Wait for your husband in hell.

100
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,703
I'm asking because the Dark Shadow
House's ghost is very spiteful.

101
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,440
You want her to break your neck?

102
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:27,910
People who went in there
either ended up dead or mad.

103
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:32,840
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

104
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:37,710
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

105
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,363
I don't believe

106
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,600
that my father killed my mother

107
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,590
and killed himself.

108
00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:49,560
But there aren't any signs
of struggle at the scene.

109
00:11:51,183 --> 00:11:54,120
- Is it possible they had problems…
- No way.

110
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,080
Ever since I was born,

111
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,280
I've never seen my father
hit my mother once.

112
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,080
They never argued.

113
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,120
It must have been someone's doing.

114
00:12:09,383 --> 00:12:13,560
I will find out the truth
about what happened.

115
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,650
Son,

116
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,520
are you sure you want me to drop
you off at the Dark Shadow House?

117
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,640
Of course. Why would I lie to you?
We've come this far.

118
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,590
Do you really not know

119
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:36,117
the ghost there is very vengeful?

120
00:12:38,017 --> 00:12:40,720
I had an inkling
when I tried to hire a boat.

121
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:42,400
Everyone refused.

122
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:46,577
Would you mind telling me
what the deal is with that house?

123
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:50,520
Help! Get off! Get off me!

124
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:53,115
Go to that pier.

125
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:54,360
- Help!
- You got it.

126
00:12:55,322 --> 00:12:56,322
Get off!

127
00:12:56,563 --> 00:12:57,563
Help!

128
00:12:58,216 --> 00:12:59,576
Who are you guys?

129
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:00,869
Get off me!

130
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:02,183
Hurry up.

131
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:04,209
Get off me!

132
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:06,320
Who are you guys?

133
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:07,888
I said get off me!

134
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:10,280
Help me! Help!

135
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:12,200
Help! Get off me!

136
00:13:13,135 --> 00:13:14,135
Get off me!

137
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:16,000
Hey, who are you guys?

138
00:13:16,141 --> 00:13:17,640
Let me go if you dare!

139
00:13:20,235 --> 00:13:21,235
Help!

140
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,268
Smartass bitch.

141
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:24,568
You bastards!

142
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Take that.

143
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,560
You hit like a girl, you loser!

144
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
- Mind your business!
- Get him!

145
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:35,793
Take that!

146
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,759
Take that!

147
00:13:39,973 --> 00:13:40,772
- Take that!
- Bring it!

148
00:13:40,783 --> 00:13:41,783
- Help!
- Ow!

149
00:13:44,243 --> 00:13:45,243
Ow!

150
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:47,343
Come here.

151
00:13:48,402 --> 00:13:49,436
Mister, watch out!

152
00:13:57,957 --> 00:13:58,957
Come here.

153
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,675
Miss!

154
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,130
Mister…

155
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:14,040
Help! Help!

156
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:25,200
Lieutenant Rat, watch out!

157
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,083
Who are you?!

158
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,840
Don't. Don't.

159
00:14:45,357 --> 00:14:46,357
Let's go!

160
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:55,743
Are you hurt, Rerai?

161
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,800
No, thank you very much,
Lieutenant Rat.

162
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,303
Uh, but…

163
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:01,703
you'd better check on him.

164
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:04,189
No need. I'm okay.

165
00:15:08,903 --> 00:15:09,903
Ow, hey.

166
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,583
Be gentle.

167
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,457
You whine like a girl.

168
00:15:13,636 --> 00:15:15,800
I got hurt saving you.

169
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,150
You didn't save me. There.
It's Lieutenant Rat who did.

170
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,673
I'm glad you're both safe.

171
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,033
What was that about, Rerai?

172
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:29,400
I have no idea.

173
00:15:30,046 --> 00:15:31,826
They tried to kidnap me
out of the blue.

174
00:15:31,857 --> 00:15:34,139
But I'd suspect Kla first

175
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,240
because I know his voice.

176
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:38,286
And out of all my suitors,

177
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:40,412
he's the most evil one.

178
00:15:41,393 --> 00:15:43,680
And then this guy…

179
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:46,139
Mai. My name is Mai.

180
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:49,723
The guy who helped you first
and didn't get your gratitude.

181
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,320
Mr. Mai, what are you
doing out here?

182
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,280
I haven't seen you before.

183
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:59,280
Can you tell me
where the Dark Shadow House is?

184
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,113
How did you know that place?

185
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:03,959
And why are you going there?

186
00:16:04,686 --> 00:16:05,713
It's my business.

187
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:07,880
I'm asking because…

188
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:12,920
because the Dark Shadow
House's ghost is very spiteful.

189
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,747
You want her to break your neck?

190
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:18,446
People who had gone in there
either ended up dead or mad.

191
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,100
I don't believe you.
Don't scare me.

192
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:24,400
- I'm being serious.
- Mr. Mai?

193
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,953
Walk straight that way.

194
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:28,493
You'll get there after a while.

195
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:36,944
Thank you, Lieutenant.

196
00:17:00,463 --> 00:17:04,120
I'm asking because the Dark Shadow
House's ghost is very spiteful.

197
00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:06,163
You want her to break your neck?

198
00:17:06,197 --> 00:17:09,690
People who had gone in there
either ended up dead or mad.

199
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,677
It's just a rumor, Mai.

200
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,920
You must find out
who killed your parents.

201
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,570
Ow!

(House of the Dark Shadows

204
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,400
Come in, Mai.

205
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,510
I've been waiting for you.

206
00:18:43,897 --> 00:18:45,000
Who are you?

207
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,600
How did you know me?

208
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,240
I'm sorry.

209
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:54,924
May I call you "sister"?

210
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:57,800
How did you know me, sister?

211
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,770
Maybe you knew my parents.

212
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:17,323
This is for you.

213
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,350
No boat.

214
00:24:04,337 --> 00:24:07,680
I'll take you back
to witness the entire story.

215
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,850
Follow me.

216
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:55,053
(1920)

217
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,283
- Thanks.
- Thank you, ma'am.

218
00:27:40,837 --> 00:27:41,837
Ow!

219
00:27:52,063 --> 00:27:54,040
And this is Ms. Malai,

220
00:27:54,303 --> 00:27:55,543
my bride-to-be.

Miss!

225

Miss!

226
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:38,656
Miss,

227
00:28:39,076 --> 00:28:41,200
what are you trying to do, huh?

228
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:45,499
- Miss? Miss? Miss!
- No, I want to die!

229
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,200
I want to die!

230
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:49,306
Miss?

231
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:54,632
Please sit down, Miss.

232
00:28:56,806 --> 00:28:59,120
If you won't, I'll sit far away.

233
00:29:00,426 --> 00:29:01,426
That's okay.

234
00:29:02,306 --> 00:29:03,520
Don't mind me.

235
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:05,899
Please sit.

236
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,720
Our suffering is like
rivers and rain, Miss.

237
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:31,200
It comes and goes.

238
00:29:32,777 --> 00:29:35,120
No matter what
caused your suffering,

239
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,800
I believe it shall pass soon.

240
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,880
- You!
- You!

241
00:30:07,497 --> 00:30:08,497
Uh…

242
00:30:09,803 --> 00:30:10,843
Are you hurt?

243
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,570
No.

244
00:30:18,843 --> 00:30:19,843
I'm sorry.

245
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:22,320
I didn't mean to offend you.

246
00:30:22,383 --> 00:30:25,096
I just noticed the red cotton
flower stamens in your hair.

247
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,110
Excuse me.

248
00:30:55,377 --> 00:30:57,200
You're helping me
carry my suitcase.

249
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,150
I don't know your name.

250
00:31:00,977 --> 00:31:02,164
I'm Malai.

251
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
I'm Dech.

252
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:06,997
Oh.

253
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:12,200
Uh, there's…

254
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,880
a red cotton flower stamen on you.

255
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,320
Don't worry about it, Malai.

256
00:31:17,937 --> 00:31:20,850
Your handkerchief is clean.
Don't dirty it on my account.

257
00:31:21,483 --> 00:31:25,000
Please take it.
As my thanks for helping me.

258
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,360
You've arrived, Malai.

259
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,720
I'm on my way to wait at the pier.

260
00:31:57,477 --> 00:31:59,584
I arrived just now, Your Lordship.

261
00:32:00,183 --> 00:32:03,763
I ran into Dech
in the red cotton garden.

262
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:06,677
So he offered to carry my suitcase
and show me the way.

263
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,120
I'm glad you two met.

264
00:32:09,123 --> 00:32:12,800
That's Dech, my valet and confidant.

265
00:32:13,343 --> 00:32:15,360
He's the one
I trust most in this house.

266
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,080
Thank you for trusting me, my lord.

267
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:20,789
And this is…

268
00:32:21,763 --> 00:32:22,903
Ms. Malai,

269
00:32:23,837 --> 00:32:25,240
my bride-to-be.

270
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,683
You must be tired from the journey.

271
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:39,560
Come in the house and rest,

272
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,117
so we can discuss
our wedding tomorrow.

273
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:44,463
Of course.

274
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,423
Dech,

275
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:51,023
bring Ms. Malai's suitcase
to the house.

276
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:53,037
Yes, my lord.

277
00:32:53,683 --> 00:32:54,683
Come on.

278
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,830
Watch your step.

279
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:58,943
Yes.

280
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,190
Are you tired?

281
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,490
Not at all.

282
00:33:15,803 --> 00:33:17,240
Welcome, Ms. Malai.

283
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:20,650
When I found out you were coming,

284
00:33:20,663 --> 00:33:23,763
I came up here
and prepared the room.

285
00:33:23,923 --> 00:33:25,400
Will this do, ma'am?

286
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,723
Of course it will.

287
00:33:36,283 --> 00:33:37,516
Thanks very much, Fueang.

288
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,680
No need to thank me, ma'am.

289
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,360
It's my duty.

290
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,650
If you thank me every time,

291
00:33:43,783 --> 00:33:47,110
you'll be thanking me all day.

292
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,013
Oh, Fueang, that's okay.
I can do it myself.

293
00:33:52,153 --> 00:33:54,000
You can't possibly do that.

294
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:58,040
You're here to be
the viscount's wife.

295
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:01,040
So you'll be another master
of this house.

296
00:34:01,267 --> 00:34:03,267
This is my duty, ma'am.

297
00:34:06,647 --> 00:34:07,647
Or…

298
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,317
are there valuables in it?

299
00:34:12,328 --> 00:34:14,880
If there are,
you can take them out first.

300
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,077
- Forgive me.
- There's not.

301
00:34:17,383 --> 00:34:19,960
I don't have many belongings.

302
00:34:20,223 --> 00:34:22,957
There are only
a few outfits in the case.

303
00:34:23,943 --> 00:34:25,943
I just didn't want to bother you.

304
00:34:28,377 --> 00:34:29,560
Ms. Malai,

305
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,040
you're so lovely.

306
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,800
You don't want to bother the help.

307
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,923
- Here.
- That's okay, ma'am.

308
00:34:38,517 --> 00:34:39,640
It's okay, ma'am.

309
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:23,120
Who is playing
a fiddle at this hour?

310
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:53,709
And this is…

311
00:36:54,683 --> 00:36:55,823
Ms. Malai,

312
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:58,160
my bride-to-be.

313
00:37:10,497 --> 00:37:11,704
Why did you stop?

314
00:37:11,817 --> 00:37:13,160
It sounded beautiful.

315
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,840
So sweet I thought
you were in love.

316
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,400
Eh, maybe you are.

317
00:37:22,603 --> 00:37:23,803
Whose daughter?

318
00:37:24,463 --> 00:37:26,320
Want me to tell His Lordship?

319
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,520
Get to your point. Stop yapping.

320
00:37:30,757 --> 00:37:32,360
His Lordship sent for you.

321
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,783
May you two have
many children and grandchildren.

322
00:37:53,963 --> 00:37:54,963
Malai!

323
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,097
My name is Bu-nga,

324
00:37:57,463 --> 00:38:00,000
the daughter of
the Eastern Trade Minister.

325
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:02,920
Release Ms. Malai!

326
00:38:10,863 --> 00:38:11,863
Malai!

327
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:14,369
Dech!

328
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,910
Who are you to Ms. Malai?

329
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:17,642
She's His Lordship's wife,

330
00:38:18,082 --> 00:38:19,082
not yours.

331
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:22,880
From now on, Ramphoei will
live here as my other wife.

332
00:38:25,709 --> 00:38:27,989
Why did you take my floats that
I made a wish on, Dech?

333
00:38:28,177 --> 00:38:30,320
Don't you want
His Lordship to have children?

334
00:38:30,496 --> 00:38:32,636
