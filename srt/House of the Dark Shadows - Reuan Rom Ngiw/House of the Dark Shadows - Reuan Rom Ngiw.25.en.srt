18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You're quite wicked, Dech.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You look innocent, but you know
how to embezzle money.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Then why did you
bed a servant like me, my lord?

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Now that we've shared a bed,

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
we should be able
to talk about everything.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If you weren't close to Dech,

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I would have already
kicked you out long ago!

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Then why did you
bed a servant like me, my lord?

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now that we've shared a bed,

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
we should be able
to talk about everything.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If you weren't close to Dech,

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I would have already
kicked you out long ago!

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Come in.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Why are you here? I need to focus.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Please don't be so dismissive
with me, my lord.

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I've noticed we've been
fighting a lot lately,

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
so I wanted to please you
for a change.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I brewed red cotton
flower tea for you.

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I know you like it.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You don't need to
pretend to please me.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You just have to leave Dech alone.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I will.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
My lord, the red cotton flower tea.

41
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Sorry, it's too hot.
I dropped the cup.

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's okay. I'll get another cup.

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Why do you want me
to drink it so much?

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Is there a reason?

45
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Instead of cleaning up
the broken tea cup,

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
so I wouldn't step on it,
you rushed to get another cup.

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
As if to make sure
I drink this tea.

49
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Uh...

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I drink red cotton
flower tea regularly.

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's not something urgent.

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Most importantly,

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I dropped the cup on purpose.

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why are you making
things up like this?

55
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
As if I tried to poison you.

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And am I right?

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Jeez.

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I brought this on myself.

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You find fault with my kindness.

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't drink it. I'll throw it out.

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Ow, my lord!

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What are you doing, my lord?
Let go of me.

63
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm gonna test your loyalty.

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Open your mouth right now.

65
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You won't? Come here.

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Come here.

67
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Here.

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Open your mouth.

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I said open.

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Open your mouth.

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Open.

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Open.

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What's going on here?

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That snake tried to poison me.

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's not true. It's you
who's trying to frame me.

76
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Don't deny it.

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
If you dare,
drink it in front of me.

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Come.

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Dech.

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
-No, Dech!
-Dech!

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Dech! What are you doing?! Dech!

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Dech.

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
See?

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
There's no poison.

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Or he would be writhing
in pain and dying right now.

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No good deed goes unpunished.

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That was close.

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Why didn't Dech's poison work?

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Dech, both you and your poison suck.

90
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Thanks.

91
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't want you to be
too suspicious of Ms. Ramphoei.

92
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Why?

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Living with that kind
of feeling every day,

94
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
will you know happiness?

95
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
A jealous person like Ramphoei

96
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
suddenly did something nice for me.

97
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's impossible for me
not to be suspicious.

98
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I cleaned up
all the pieces, my lord.

99
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And I finished wiping the floor.

100
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Please excuse me.

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Go on.

102
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I said that
because I care about you.

103
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm very happy just knowing
you care about me.

104
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Get some rest.

105
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm gonna work a bit longer.

106
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes, my lord.

107
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Go.

108
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Now Ramphoei will poison
the viscount for us.

109
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's so satisfying.

110
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Uan and I will not suffer anymore.

111
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The potion Ramphoei took

112
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
is not the poison.

113
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What, Dech?

114
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I went out of my way
to make sure she overheard me.

115
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Was that for nothing?

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Then...

117
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
the viscount will be okay.

118
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So how long do we have to wait?

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I've served him for over a decade.

120
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He's suspicious
and untrusting by nature.

121
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Poisoning him isn't an easy task.

122
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You're using Ramphoei as a decoy?

123
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Fooling him into believing
Ramphoei wants him dead.

124
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
After he's convinced he's safe,

125
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
we'll treat him well
for another month.

126
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Once all his doubts are gone,

127
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
it's time for us to take action.

128
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Thanks a lot.

129
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I cleaned up
all the pieces, my lord.

130
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Please excuse me.

131
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Go on.

132
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Get some rest.

133
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm gonna work a bit longer.

134
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
When the time comes,

135
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
we have to say goodbye
to each other,

136
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
my lord.

(House of the Dark Shadows

139
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
(One month later)

140
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh.

141
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm just in time.

142
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's rare I get to eat with you.

143
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
If you wake up
this early every day,

144
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
we'll eat together every day.

145
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Uan.

146
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yes, ma'am?

147
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Go get the pickled ginger I made.

148
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So His Lordship knows
I have culinary skills too.

149
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yes.

150
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
No.

151
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Why not?

152
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't want it.

153
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Eh? I saw you have it
with boiled rice the other day.

154
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Why today have you...?

155
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You're still suspicious
of me poisoning you?

156
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's been a month.

157
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Dech, I'm full.

158
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes, my lord.

159
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Jeez!

160
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You've all gone insane!

161
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Ms. Ramphoei,

162
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
do you still want pickled ginger?

163
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm not eating anymore.

164
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Give it all to dogs.

165
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yes, ma'am.

166
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But Ms. Ramphoei was right.

167
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's been almost a month.

168
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You're still suspicious of her?

169
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Better safe than sorry.

170
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I don't trust that kind of person.

171
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You're the only one I trust.

172
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
From now on,
you're in charge of my food.

173
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yes, my lord.

174
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Living with paranoia like that,

175
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
how can he find happiness?

176
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He probably doesn't.

177
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But the viscount
chose to live that way.

178
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Without his fortune, he suffers.

179
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
With it, he suffers

180
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
from fear that
it might be taken away.

181
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
If I could choose,

182
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'd choose to have enough to get by

183
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
with someone I love.

184
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But I doubt that day would come.

185
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It would come.

186
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I promise

187
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'll find a way
for us to live together

188
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
without the viscount
hunting us down again.

189
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I hope it becomes true
one day, Dech.

190
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Come on, go back to the department.

191
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He's getting off work soon.

192
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
He'll get suspicious
if he doesn't see you.

193
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yes, ma'am.

194
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Thanks.

195
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If there's nothing else,
I'll take my leave.

196
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Hey.

197
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'll stop by
after I finished my work.

198
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Don't sleep yet.

199
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes, my lord.

200
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
There are no vows.

201
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Burn them all.

204
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Hey.

205
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll stop by
after I finished my work.

206
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Don't sleep yet.

207
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yes, my lord.

208
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I guess it's time.

209
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Huh?

210
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What?

211
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Huh?

212
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What?

213
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
H... Help...

214
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Help...

215
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Help me.

216
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Anyone.

217
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Help me.

218
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Help me.

219
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Who's out there?

220
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Who's out there?

221
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I've never forgotten your kindness

222
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
for giving me a good upbringing.

223
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But kindness...

224
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
is one thing.

225
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Vengeance...

226
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
is another.

227
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Whatever you did to me,

228
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I never took offense.

229
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
But you sent Kam to kill Ms. Malai.

230
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
The woman I love
more than life itself.

231
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I can't forgive that.

232
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Since you...

233
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
wouldn't let me...

234
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
and Ms. Malai,

235
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'll stay and take care of you

236
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
for the rest of my life.

237
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I forgot to tell you
something important.

238
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I was the one who poisoned you.

From now on,
I'll represent His Lordship,

253
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
overseeing everything
in the Dark Shadow House.

254
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Male servants will report to Kam.

255
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Female servants report
mainly to Fueang and Uan.

256
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
As all of you know,

257
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
His Lordship was in an accident
that left him paralyzed.

258
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Something that
shouldn't have happened.

259
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So he ordered us to ax
all the red cotton trees

260
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
because they're considered bad luck

261
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
that brought on bad things
in this house.

262
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
You must swear
before this red cotton tree

263
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
that you will love only me.

264
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You must swear

265
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
that you will only have
a physical relationship with Malai.

266
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But you must love only me.

267
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I swear that

268
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I will love

269
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
and be faithful to His Lordship.

270
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
But if one day
Dech breaks his promise,

271
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
he will die with excruciating pain

272
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
for breaking my heart.

273
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Cut them down
and pour gasoline on them.

274
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Burn their stumps.

275
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Don't let them grow again.

276
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Dismissed.

277
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Burn them all!

278
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Go!

279
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Burn it!

280
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
No!

281
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I'll do it.

282
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
There are no vows.

283
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Burn them all.

284
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
What really happened, Dech?

285
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
His Lordship must have
fallen down the stairs last night.

286
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
By the time I found him,
it was dawn.

(House of the Dark Shadows

289
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Don't if you're not willing.

290
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Can I do that, ma'am?

291
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Ramphoei, how did
the viscount fall down the stairs?

292
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
How should I say this?

293
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I don't know which words to use.

294
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Between your brother
being down on his luck

295
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
or just clumsy.

296
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Eh? How could you say that?

297
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
He's your husband.

298
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Eh? When it happened, I was asleep.

299
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
How else could I answer you?

300
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Please excuse me.

301
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I have an important matter
to attend to.

302
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
What a wicked woman.

303
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Her husband's badly injured

304
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
but she's not even sad.

305
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Ignore her.

306
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Let's go see him.

307
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
What really happened, Dech?

308
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
We saw Ramphoei earlier
being her unpleasant self.

309
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So we didn't find out
what happened.

310
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
His Lordship must have
fallen down the stairs last night.

311
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
By the time I found him,
it was dawn

312
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
when I came in
to oversee things in the house.

313
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Here you go, ma'am.

314
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Chaem.

315
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Lay out seven
or eight outfits for me.

316
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm going out for drinks tonight.

317
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I don't know you why
need to try on anything.

318
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Eh? Why not?

319
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Why else?

320
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Because you're beautiful
in everything.

321
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
They say

322
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
women look especially glowing
after having their first child.

323
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I think it's true.

324
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I like how you speak.
I'll reward you.

325
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Thank you, ma'am.

326
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Finally I get to be the lady
of the Dark Shadow House

327
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
as I wished.

328
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
The deities are on my side.

329
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
The viscount is paralyzed

330
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
and my son gets all
the viscount's fortune.

331
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Which means...

332
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
all his fortune
is essentially yours.

333
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Uh...

334
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Eh?

335
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Why are you suddenly quiet?

336
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Say what you have to say.
I won't scold you.

337
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
-Can I really say it?
-Yeah!

338
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I think...

339
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
you should...

340
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
put on a sad face in front of
other people sometimes.

341
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Otherwise people will talk

342
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
that your husband is bedridden
but you don't feel anything.

343
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I mean it.

344
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I see.

345
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
-That.
-It's true, ma'am.

346
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Idiot!

347
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Eh?

348
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
You said you wouldn't scold me.

349
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
-Jeez.
-You kicked me.

350
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
You see me acting like this
because I'm in the house!

351
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
There are only servants around.

352
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Why should I pull a sad face?
It's a waste of time.

353
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
If anyone wants to gossip, let them.

354
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
But you shouldn't act that way

355
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
in front of the count
and Ms. Ranchuan.

356
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
The viscount already
got his fortune.

357
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Why should I care
about that old couple?

358
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It's no use.

359
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Well, but the viscount
is a vegetable right now.

360
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And he probably won't
get his salary anymore.

361
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
He will only have
his father's fortune.

362
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Which can be gone
if no one makes it grow.

363
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Jeez.

364
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
This long spiel of yours

365
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
is just you worrying
I won't be able to pay you.

366
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
That issue...

367
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I've already had a plan for.

368
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And what did the doctor say?

369
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
The doctor said
we found His Lordship too late

370
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
to do anything for him.

371
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
His Lordship...

372
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Say it, Dech.

373
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Whatever it is, I can take it.

374
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
The doctor said...

375
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
His Lordship will be
paralyzed for life.

376
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Goodness.

377
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Good heavens.

378
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
The viscount has just had an heir.

379
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I feel so bad for him.

380
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
His son is still a baby.

381
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Don't worry.

382
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'll find good doctors to cure you.

383
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
The doctor said
he needed a lot of rest.

384
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It might help his condition.

385
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Then take care of him for me.

386
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
If you need anything,
send someone to let me know.

387
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I'll send him medicinal dishes.

388
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I thank you both on behalf of
His Lordship for your compassion.

389
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I'll take good care of him

390
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
to repay him for fostering me
for over a decade.

391
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Ms. Ranchuan and I
will visit again.

392
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Viscount,

393
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'll take my leave.

394
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
May you get well soon.

395
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I'll walk you out.

396
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
The viscount is lucky
to have a loyal servant like you.

397
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Please take care of him for me.

398
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Are you a thief?

399
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Ghost!

400
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Malai!

401
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
You and Ramphoei
conspired to hurt His Lordship,

402
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
leaving him paralyzed

403
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
the same way
you conspired to fake her death.

404
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I believe Saeng.

405
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
The viscount didn't fall down
the stairs and become paralyzed.
