"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 4)

19
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:01,478
Let go of Malai now!

20
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:10,627
Malai!

21
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:13,361
Dech!

22
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,697
Why did you take my floats

23
00:02:14,722 --> 00:02:15,978
that I made a wish on, Dech?

24
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,306
Don't you want His Lordship

25
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:18,352
to have children?

26
00:02:18,377 --> 00:02:19,377
The worst!

27
00:02:19,603 --> 00:02:20,697
You are the worst!

28
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:24,345
Does it please you, my lord?

29
00:02:24,635 --> 00:02:26,259
Yes, I am very pleased.

30
00:02:26,548 --> 00:02:28,244
My lord, who are you praising?

31
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,681
I want to consult with you.

32
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,970
I got kissed.

33
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:48,369
What is this?

34
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:50,729
This is my secret poison formula.

35
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:52,337
It is very effective.

36
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:55,572
Smear it on the tip of an arrow,

37
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:56,947
and a mere touch on an elephant,

38
00:02:56,972 --> 00:02:58,181
and it meets its end,

39
00:02:58,197 --> 00:02:59,797
let alone a tiger.

40
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:01,243
No wonder,

41
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:03,197
when I laid eyes on that tiger's corpse,

42
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:05,056
I marveled at how you dealt with it.

43
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:08,259
I've been a hunter for so long,

44
00:03:08,283 --> 00:03:09,368
I wouldn't fail

45
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:10,923
on a small matter like this.

46
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,712
I shall hand it to you.

47
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:16,525
No thank you.

48
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:17,603
I am no hunter,

49
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:19,064
I would have no use for it.

50
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:21,462
Take it. Use it for self-defense.

51
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,493
This potion

52
00:03:23,518 --> 00:03:26,051
is not solely for taking down beasts,

53
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:28,353
a human may be

54
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,954
paralyzed if they consume it.

55
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:35,533
All the more reason not to accept it.

56
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:37,134
Take it, son.

57
00:03:37,423 --> 00:03:38,665
I have no other means

58
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,010
to repay you for your kindness.

59
00:03:40,026 --> 00:03:41,066
Just take it please.

60
00:03:54,298 --> 00:03:55,634
I heard that the viscount has been

61
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,736
assigned work in the north.

62
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:58,494
I never expected Ms. Malai to come here.

63
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,478
Is there anything I can help you with?

64
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:02,259
Well...

65
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:07,423
Malai has something to

66
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:08,876
discuss with both of you.

67
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:12,307
What is it?

68
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:16,267
It's about the viscount, what else?

69
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:18,580
My younger brother? What about him?

70
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:19,962
Malai is concerned that

71
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,414
despite being married for many months,

72
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,086
there are no signs of pregnancy.

73
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:26,009
I suspect that the viscount may be...

74
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:30,212
The viscount may be

75
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:31,895
unaware of how it's done.

76
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,080
That's enough, Bu-nga.

77
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,033
It's too embarrassing.

78
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:37,064
Geez.

79
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:38,681
Why are you so embarrassed?

80
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:39,775
You'll get in trouble

81
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:40,915
if you're not pregnant,

82
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,486
you won't get the inheritance.

83
00:04:45,174 --> 00:04:46,298
It seems my presence

84
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:47,462
is inappropriate here.

85
00:04:47,713 --> 00:04:48,713
Excuse me.

86
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:50,697
Let's go.

87
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,462
Go with your dad.

88
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:02,361
Does the count

89
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,817
dislike me?

90
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,848
No,

91
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:11,332
it's a bit difficult to talk about it.

92
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:13,724
You see, the count is...

93
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:16,176
infertile.

94
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:17,872
- Excuse me?
- Excuse me?

95
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:20,520
Yes, you heard it correctly.

96
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,590
Rat is the child of a distant relative.

97
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:27,778
His parents passed away,

98
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:28,971
the count, out of mercy,

99
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,526
adopted him into our family.

100
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,778
Dear me,

101
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:34,832
I had no idea.

102
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,785
He doesn't want others to know about it.

103
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:42,168
That's just how men are.

104
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:45,847
Anyway, your matter, Ms. Malai,

105
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:47,910
is there anything I can assist you with?

106
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:52,973
Ms. Bu-nga suspects that

107
00:05:53,044 --> 00:05:54,450
the viscount may not be willing to

108
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:55,840
sleep with Ms. Malai?

109
00:05:55,864 --> 00:05:56,950
Indeed,

110
00:05:56,975 --> 00:05:58,418
based on what I've heard from Malai,

111
00:05:58,427 --> 00:05:59,528
it sounded strange.

112
00:05:59,552 --> 00:06:01,692
They've married for quite some time now,

113
00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:03,599
so why is Malai still unaware of

114
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:04,824
how it is done?

115
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:06,489
Geez, Bu-nga.

116
00:06:07,504 --> 00:06:08,395
Ms. Malai,

117
00:06:08,403 --> 00:06:09,729
there's no need to be bashful.

118
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:11,106
We are all women here.

119
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,837
Well, we do have one progressive woman

120
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:16,972
among us who speaks her mind freely.

121
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:18,769
Oh.

122
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:21,486
My apologies, sister,

123
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:22,987
for my behaviour.

124
00:06:26,355 --> 00:06:27,940
It's not a bad thing, really.

125
00:06:28,675 --> 00:06:30,307
If Ms. Malai didn't have a friend

126
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:32,089
like Ms. Bu-nga who is outspoken,

127
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:35,256
both of us would have remained clueless.

128
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,479
Thankfully, I can offer some assistance.

129
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:51,714
When I first got married to the count,

130
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:53,050
we rarely engaged

131
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:54,182
in intimate activities.

132
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,440
However, when I made

133
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,057
a few changes here and there,

134
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,456
he hardly left my side.

135
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,870
Oh.

136
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:12,829
I knew bringing Malai to you

137
00:07:12,854 --> 00:07:14,550
was the right decision, Ms. Ranchaun.

138
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:16,620
I really like this.

139
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,995
Achieving such goals

140
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,925
sometimes demands a bit of cunning.

141
00:07:21,956 --> 00:07:22,956
But...

142
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:24,612
isn't this dress a bit excessive,

143
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,620
Ms. Ranchaun?

144
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:27,995
Ms. Malai, it's not excessive.

145
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:29,635
It also depends on

146
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:31,057
the viscount's preferences.

147
00:07:31,706 --> 00:07:32,706
Umm...

148
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,010
It feels overwhelming for me.

149
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:36,901
Oh, come on, Malai.

150
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:39,229
Are you giving up already?

151
00:07:39,503 --> 00:07:40,713
If you continue like this,

152
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:42,120
when will you ever get pregnant?

153
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:44,112
Ms. Bu-nga is right.

154
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:45,776
This kind of thing,

155
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:47,784
you won't know unless you give it a try.

156
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:50,862
Look at the count and I,

157
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:54,300
we are intimate almost every day,

158
00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:57,581
but due to the count's infertility,

159
00:07:57,605 --> 00:08:00,659
[there's been nothing.] Otherwise, I would
have conceived many children already.

160
00:08:02,597 --> 00:08:03,667
So,

161
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:06,182
you have no excuses, got it Malai?

162
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:11,932
Let me see.

163
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:25,253
(Three months later)

164
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:40,052
Alright, hurry up, everyone.

165
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,005
The viscount's arrival is imminent.

166
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,747
If it's not done,

167
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:45,099
be prepared to face
the consequences.

168
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:46,442
Hey, sweep downwards.

169
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,898
Hurry up. The stairs too.

170
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:04,421
Come out, Malai.

171
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:05,601
You'll be late in

172
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,820
welcoming the viscount.

173
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:09,093
Ms. Bu-nga is correct, Malai.

174
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,585
The viscount might feel disappointed

175
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,290
if he doesn't meet you.

176
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:17,554
Malai, please come out.

177
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:19,476
Trust me,

178
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:21,109
the viscount will

179
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:23,218
adore your new appearance.

180
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,421
Have confidence that

181
00:09:25,446 --> 00:09:27,593
you look beautiful in anything you wear.

182
00:09:30,422 --> 00:09:31,862
Please come out, Malai.

183
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:40,734
Wow.

184
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:45,203
Malai...

185
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,609
Where is Malai, Fueang?

186
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:55,968
Ms. Malai...

187
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:58,437
Welcome home, my lord.

188
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,171
Are you truly Malai?

189
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,421
As if you were a different person.

190
00:10:27,758 --> 00:10:29,312
Does it please you, my lord?

191
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,155
Yes, I am very pleased.

192
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,046
My lord, who are you praising?

193
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:43,702
Malai hasn't given me a child yet,

194
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:45,796
and I must address this issue.

195
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,132
Doesn't that sound too selfish?

197
00:10:55,867 --> 00:11:00,632
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

198
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:05,765
Does it please you, my lord?

199
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:07,608
Yes, I am very pleased.

200
00:11:12,843 --> 00:11:14,499
My lord, who are you praising?

201
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:24,268
Please come here, Ramphoei.

202
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,440
From this day forward, Ramphoei shall

203
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:30,104
live here as another one of my wives.

204
00:11:48,963 --> 00:11:50,971
Nice to meet you, Ms. Malai.

205
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:58,051
My lord, let's go upstairs.

206
00:11:58,505 --> 00:11:59,918
It has been a long journey,

207
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:01,942
and I'm sure you'd like to freshen up.

208
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:04,137
Ramphoei truly understands me.

209
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:05,457
Let's go.

210
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:06,497
Let's go.

211
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,173
Hey!

212
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,290
Why did you kick me?

213
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,492
Oh my, I thought it was nothing,

214
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:27,063
I didn't realize it was a person.

215
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:28,352
- Why, you little...
- Stop, Fueang.

216
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:30,790
What is your name?

217
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:32,680
I am Chaem, ma'am.

218
00:12:32,743 --> 00:12:34,305
I am Ms. Ramphoei's servant.

219
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:35,290
Ms. Malai is

220
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,016
the primary wife of the viscount.

221
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,227
Consider her feelings

222
00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:39,438
in all your actions.

223
00:12:41,173 --> 00:12:42,298
Yes, ma'am.

224
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:46,345
But for now, I shall accompany my lady.

225
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:56,351
Like master, like servant.

226
00:12:58,156 --> 00:12:59,578
Are you alright, Malai?

227
00:12:59,898 --> 00:13:00,906
I am fine.

228
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,539
I was just taken aback.

229
00:13:05,055 --> 00:13:07,046
Fueang, I entrust the task of arranging

230
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,804
Ms. Ramphoei's quarters to you.

231
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:10,302
Yes, Ms. Malai.

232
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:33,891
Where did Malai and Ms. Bu-nga go?

233
00:13:36,423 --> 00:13:38,492
Bu-nga is probably comforting Ms. Malai.

234
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:41,399
Why would she need comforting?

235
00:13:41,424 --> 00:13:43,096
I just arrived home.

236
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,102
Why are you acting ignorant?

237
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:50,008
Bringing a new wife home

238
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:51,570
without even consulting

239
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:52,955
your primary wife

240
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:55,211
it's natural to feel hurt.

241
00:13:57,157 --> 00:13:58,157
Ah, women.

242
00:13:59,657 --> 00:14:01,516
Malai hasn't given me a child yet,

243
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:03,258
and I must address this issue.

244
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:05,797
As for Rampoei, she is unfortunate.

245
00:14:05,883 --> 00:14:07,703
Her father couldn't repay his debt,

246
00:14:07,712 --> 00:14:09,289
so he gave his daughter to me.

247
00:14:09,313 --> 00:14:10,753
I couldn't refuse.

248
00:14:11,313 --> 00:14:12,313
Viscount,

249
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,586
doesn't that sound too selfish?

250
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:19,360
Ms. Malai is absolutely wonderful,

251
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:22,243
and comes from a good family.

252
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,717
If you were to have a first child

253
00:14:23,742 --> 00:14:25,352
with someone, it should have been her.

254
00:14:25,377 --> 00:14:27,383
It would be honorable for the lineage.

255
00:14:30,022 --> 00:14:31,546
Do you think I am unaware of that?

256
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,430
The matters of lineage and such.

257
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:34,836
Have you forgotten about

258
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:36,211
my brother's background?

259
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,195
It is common for men

260
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,649
to have multiple wives.

261
00:14:42,946 --> 00:14:45,000
There's no need to make a fuss about it.

262
00:14:45,462 --> 00:14:47,274
When Malai can give me a child,

263
00:14:47,907 --> 00:14:49,016
I'll elevate her to

264
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,415
the number one position,

265
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:52,742
just as my father did for me.

266
00:14:53,641 --> 00:14:55,117
As the number one position,

267
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:56,336
a concubine's offspring

268
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:57,719
can't steal the family's assets.

269
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,289
If you insist on

270
00:15:02,298 --> 00:15:03,601
being disrespectful like this,

271
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:05,406
then let's not continue speaking.

272
00:15:06,251 --> 00:15:07,813
I only warned you

273
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:10,063
as your true sister-in-law.

274
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,266
I will take my leave.

275
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:03,682
It's alright, Malai.

276
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:05,205
No matter what,

277
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,565
I will always support you.

278
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,995
Thank you, Bu-nga.

279
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:11,745
But it seems I won't be able to

280
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:14,041
win the viscount's affection.

281
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:16,581
Don't give up so easily, Malai.

282
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:20,784
How could the viscount

283
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:21,877
stoop so low and

284
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:23,580
make that woman another wife?

285
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,065
Just by looking at her,

286
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:26,393
I can tell she's low-class.

287
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:27,534
That low-class woman.

288
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,627
Maybe it's my fault

289
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,689
for not getting pregnant.

290
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,651
If that's the case,

291
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,453
all the more reason not to give up.

292
00:16:39,151 --> 00:16:40,682
No matter how you look look,

293
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:41,846
she seems dangerous.

294
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:43,557
Her manners indicate

295
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:45,346
she's quite sly.

296
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:52,968
Please come in.

297
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,470
Umm...

298
00:17:09,142 --> 00:17:10,243
Please place the viscount's

299
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:11,454
belongings over there.

300
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:13,509
I will have Fueang handle it later.

301
00:17:14,556 --> 00:17:16,478
Please continue with your tasks, Dech.

302
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:19,053
Yes, Ms. Malai.

303
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,162
I'll be right back, Malai.

304
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:30,370
What's been troubling you, Dech?

305
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,355
Is there something

306
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,839
I can assist you with, Ms. Bu-nga?

307
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:37,526
Yes.

308
00:18:37,793 --> 00:18:39,269
You see, I am really curious

309
00:18:39,294 --> 00:18:40,831
to know who caused my friend

310
00:18:40,856 --> 00:18:41,862
so much distress

311
00:18:41,894 --> 00:18:43,269
around three months ago.

312
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:48,081
Hey!

313
00:18:48,957 --> 00:18:50,894
Wow! So beautiful!

314
00:18:51,657 --> 00:18:53,111
It's incredibly beautiful,

315
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:54,916
the room is so spacious, Ms. Ramphoei.

316
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:57,456
I have never seen

317
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,822
a more stunning house in all my life.

318
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,050
I feel truly blessed.

319
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:03,558
Indeed, ma'am.

320
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:04,925
My viscount is

321
00:19:05,074 --> 00:19:08,581
as generous as this grand house.

322
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,433
Chaem, did you hear

323
00:19:12,706 --> 00:19:15,042
squeaking noises around here?

324
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:16,824
Just like a rat.

325
00:19:17,668 --> 00:19:18,800
Yes, ma'am.

326
00:19:20,753 --> 00:19:23,596
I suspect there might be a rat here.

327
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:24,737
Hey.

328
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:25,893
You should get rid of the

329
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:27,690
rats in my master's room.

330
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,133
Really?

331
00:19:30,063 --> 00:19:30,734
This house...

332
00:19:31,164 --> 00:19:32,633
What's wrong with him? Dammit.

333
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:34,460
You took me as your wife,

334
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:36,202
why didn't you do it?

335
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:39,255
What are you doing, Dech?

336
00:19:39,802 --> 00:19:41,240
I am proving to you

337
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,944
that I meant what I said.

338
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,888
If Ms. Malai desires me to die

339
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:46,982
as a way to make up for my wrongdoing,

340
00:19:47,006 --> 00:19:48,325
then I will do so willingly.

(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

342
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:58,215
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

343
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,029
It's impeccably clean

344
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:01,959
because Ms. Malai

345
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,670
is extremely meticulous.

346
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:06,365
She has this house cleaned regularly.

347
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:09,841
If there were a rat,

348
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:11,693
it would only be because

349
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:12,959
some uncouth individuals

350
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:14,287
brought it in with them!

351
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:17,552
We've only just arrived,

352
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:19,084
you're already picking on my lady?

353
00:20:19,108 --> 00:20:20,474
Why did you all pick on me first?

354
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,154
- And did you not say it first?
- So what?

355
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:23,990
You're the one who has to leave!

356
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:27,302
Don't make me report what you
just said about me to the viscount,

357
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:28,591
lowly servant!

358
00:20:34,882 --> 00:20:36,210
Close the door for me too!

359
00:20:39,086 --> 00:20:40,086
Vile!

360
00:20:42,343 --> 00:20:43,960
What are you looking at?

361
00:20:45,656 --> 00:20:46,749
That little...

362
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:48,804
I heard that

363
00:20:49,218 --> 00:20:51,124
someone stole a kiss from my friend.

364
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,077
Do you have any idea who it might be?

365
00:20:57,242 --> 00:20:59,437
Who would dare do such a thing, ma'am?

366
00:20:59,812 --> 00:21:01,405
Ms. Malai is a master, after all.

367
00:21:02,156 --> 00:21:03,960
Indeed, Ms. Malai is your master,

368
00:21:04,836 --> 00:21:06,109
and I know that

369
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,851
you would dare do that to her.

370
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:11,921
You are a servant, so act accordingly.

371
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:14,288
Anyone who troubles my friend

372
00:21:14,828 --> 00:21:16,628
will face the consequences.

373
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:19,984
I would never cause

374
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,710
any trouble for Ms. Malai, ma'am.

375
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,084
I believe the potential troublemaker

376
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:25,928
is someone else.

377
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,104
You must be referring to Ramphoei.

378
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,198
An enemy appears

379
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:43,057
after we arrived, Ms. Ramphoei.

380
00:21:43,277 --> 00:21:44,456
I couldn't care less.

381
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,393
Soon enough,

382
00:21:45,426 --> 00:21:47,331
she'll be prostrate herself at my feet.

383
00:21:48,136 --> 00:21:49,565
You're right, ma'am!

384
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:52,464
But it's a shame

385
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:54,315
that the viscount already has a wife.

386
00:21:57,422 --> 00:21:59,429
Even if I am a concubine,

387
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:00,929
it doesn't mean

388
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,593
I can't become his favorite wife.

389
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,007
To marry such a wealthy husband and

390
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:07,116
become a concubine

391
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:08,507
is already a great fortune.

392
00:22:08,804 --> 00:22:11,452
You're right again, Ms. Ramphoei.

393
00:22:14,351 --> 00:22:15,359
I've heard that

394
00:22:15,695 --> 00:22:18,015
he's a viscount, and incredibly wealthy.

395
00:22:18,508 --> 00:22:20,188
If you become his wife,

396
00:22:20,226 --> 00:22:21,570
you'll be set for life.

397
00:22:21,788 --> 00:22:23,366
Will it be possible, Dad?

398
00:22:23,788 --> 00:22:25,507
He's both handsome and rich.

399
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,820
What a strange question.

400
00:22:28,203 --> 00:22:29,710
Marrying a wealthy and handsome man,

401
00:22:29,735 --> 00:22:31,038
isn't that a good thing?

402
00:22:32,062 --> 00:22:33,593
Indeed, it is a good thing.

403
00:22:34,383 --> 00:22:36,038
Are you unwilling to go

404
00:22:36,531 --> 00:22:38,624
because of that guy in the village?

405
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,812
Believe me,

406
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,374
it's much better to become

407
00:22:44,703 --> 00:22:46,109
the viscount's wife.

408
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:48,835
Dad, I never said

409
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:50,530
I didn't want to become his wife.

410
00:22:50,554 --> 00:22:52,312
He's handsome and wealthy.

411
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:54,023
I'd be foolish to refuse.

412
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:04,320
Mark my words, Chaem.

413
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,734
I will definitely succeed in

414
00:23:06,742 --> 00:23:07,859
driving that Malai woman

415
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:08,952
away from this house.

416
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,577
Wonderful, Ms. Ramphoei!

417
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:14,780
I am more than willing to assist you

418
00:23:14,805 --> 00:23:17,390
with every matter, Ms. Ramphoei!

419
00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:08,080
You've surprised me twice, Malai.

420
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:10,611
You're wearing a new outfit tonight,

421
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,960
and I like it.

422
00:24:16,714 --> 00:24:18,409
Please don't be angry, Ms. Malai.

423
00:24:21,636 --> 00:24:23,963
How can I be angry with you, my lord?

424
00:24:24,565 --> 00:24:27,065
You didn't even consult with me.

425
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,768
Come on, Malai.

426
00:24:31,495 --> 00:24:33,175
Please don't say that.

427
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:34,862
It was a sudden decision.

428
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,932
By the time I wrote a letter to you,

429
00:24:36,957 --> 00:24:38,174
I would have already arrived.

430
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:40,120
You would have found out regardless.

431
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,870
And did you not think that

432
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,119
I would be hurt?

433
00:24:45,753 --> 00:24:46,753
I even...

434
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,550
Malai?

435
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:52,315
What do you mean?

436
00:24:54,776 --> 00:24:56,190
It's not important, my lord.

437
00:24:57,737 --> 00:24:58,401
Hey.

438
00:24:58,417 --> 00:24:59,518
No, Malai.

439
00:25:00,128 --> 00:25:01,690
Please don't act like that.

440
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,581
I know that I am wrong.

441
00:25:04,206 --> 00:25:05,275
I apologize.

442
00:25:16,008 --> 00:25:17,109
Malai.

443
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:19,573
Please forgive me.

444
00:25:25,696 --> 00:25:27,250
You took a concubine

445
00:25:28,024 --> 00:25:29,219
because I...

446
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:32,648
didn't fulfill my duties as your wife.

447
00:25:32,813 --> 00:25:34,680
Even if Ramphoei is my concubine,

448
00:25:35,508 --> 00:25:37,508
you are still my primary wife.

449
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,398
I will never place anyone above you.

450
00:26:07,138 --> 00:26:08,504
Who is it at this late hour?

451
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,598
Oh my, my apologies, my lord, Ms. Malai.

452
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,653
You see...

453
00:26:11,678 --> 00:26:13,745
Ms. Ramphoei is feeling unwell.

454
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:15,498
What's wrong?

455
00:26:15,522 --> 00:26:17,037
She seemed fine earlier in the evening.

456
00:26:18,116 --> 00:26:19,717
I'm not sure,

457
00:26:19,733 --> 00:26:20,935
but Ms. Ramphoei keeps

458
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,224
calling for you, my lord.

459
00:26:52,575 --> 00:26:54,246
How are you feeling, Ramphoei?

460
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:55,465
Where does it hurt?

461
00:26:58,215 --> 00:27:00,059
Just seeing your face,

462
00:27:00,403 --> 00:27:02,083
I already feel better, my lord.

463
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,262
So, what is wrong?

464
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:05,441
If it's serious,

465
00:27:05,473 --> 00:27:07,199
I can call a doctor to check on you.

466
00:27:17,364 --> 00:27:19,324
I don't need a doctor.

467
00:27:19,965 --> 00:27:22,426
I need you, my lord.

468
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:26,793
Never joke about your health again.

469
00:27:26,918 --> 00:27:28,012
I hate it!

470
00:27:30,635 --> 00:27:32,596
I'm not joking, my lord.

471
00:27:33,557 --> 00:27:35,491
I am simply feeling lonely...

472
00:27:38,245 --> 00:27:40,752
Then let Chaem accompany you.

473
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:51,861
Ugh!

474
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:53,891
What's wrong with him? Dammit.

475
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:55,885
You took me as your wife,

476
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,267
why didn't you do it?

477
00:28:31,504 --> 00:28:32,878
Ms. Malai,

478
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,980
Ms. Malai,

479
00:28:35,074 --> 00:28:36,988
I want to apologize to you, Ms. Malai.

480
00:28:40,456 --> 00:28:41,573
Apologize for what?

481
00:28:42,683 --> 00:28:44,104
I don't recall you needing

482
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:45,649
to apologize to me.

483
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:48,072
Oh, Ms. Malai...

484
00:28:49,753 --> 00:28:51,448
Please don't say that, Ms. Malai.

485
00:28:52,308 --> 00:28:53,643
Ever since that incident,

486
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:55,182
I have been feeling uneasy.

487
00:28:55,597 --> 00:28:56,682
I never want to hear

488
00:28:56,698 --> 00:28:57,987
about this matter again.

489
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,620
I don't want to be reminded of it.

490
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:02,323
Do you understand?

491
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:05,346
Understood, Ms. Malai.

492
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,729
Are you apologizing

493
00:29:08,754 --> 00:29:10,580
out of fear of punishment?

494
00:29:11,753 --> 00:29:12,838
That is not the case.

495
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:14,463
I genuinely regret it.

496
00:29:16,706 --> 00:29:18,815
If you're willing to forgive me,

497
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,198
then I am ready

498
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:22,119
to die right now, Ms. Malai.

499
00:29:22,425 --> 00:29:23,729
What are you doing, Dech?

500
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:25,752
I am proving to you that

501
00:29:25,784 --> 00:29:27,166
I meant what I said.

502
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:29,479
If Ms. Malai desires me to die

503
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:31,672
as a way to make up for my wrongdoing,

504
00:29:31,697 --> 00:29:33,103
then I will do so willingly.

505
00:29:33,128 --> 00:29:34,854
There's no need to go that far.

506
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:37,798
Do you see me

507
00:29:37,806 --> 00:29:39,267
as such a heartless person?

508
00:29:42,488 --> 00:29:44,478
I only ask that you never do it again.

509
00:29:46,064 --> 00:29:47,306
Understood, Ms. Malai.

510
00:29:50,564 --> 00:29:52,618
If I ever misbehave

511
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:54,360
towards Ms. Malai again,

512
00:29:55,384 --> 00:29:57,184
I shall face a brutal death...

513
00:30:03,572 --> 00:30:04,572
Oops!

514
00:30:07,189 --> 00:30:08,189
Malai!

515
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:10,244
Malai!

516
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:11,267
Chaem!

517
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:16,368
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

518
00:30:16,491 --> 00:30:21,256
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

519
00:30:21,793 --> 00:30:23,783
I only ask that you never do it again.

520
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:26,611
Understood, Ms. Malai.

521
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,534
If I ever misbehave

522
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:33,743
towards Ms. Malai again,

523
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:35,948
I shall face a brutal death...

524
00:30:41,113 --> 00:30:42,972
Don't take such oaths lightly.

525
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,475
I...

526
00:31:01,015 --> 00:31:02,342
no longer hold any resentment

527
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:03,366
towards you.

528
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,600
Perfect timing, Malai.

529
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:55,085
What is it, my lord?

530
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,350
I'll be attending a banquet

531
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,757
tonight hosted by an elder acquaintance.

532
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,288
I want you to accompany me.

533
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:04,365
Why not let me attend as well, my lord?

534
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,522
Because Malai is my primary wife.

535
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,796
If I am taking anyone,

536
00:32:12,124 --> 00:32:13,444
it can only be Malai.

537
00:32:14,703 --> 00:32:16,710
But I didn't prepare anything.

538
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,499
I don't have an outfit, my lord.

539
00:32:19,265 --> 00:32:20,538
It's not that formal.

540
00:32:20,718 --> 00:32:22,452
Just dress appropriately, Malai.

541
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:24,850
Please go dress up,

542
00:32:24,867 --> 00:32:26,307
or we'll be late.

543
00:32:27,303 --> 00:32:28,343
Yes, my lord.

544
00:32:35,264 --> 00:32:36,295
In that case,

545
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:37,795
I will take my leave as well.

546
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:25,724
Beautiful,

547
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:28,177
incredibly beautiful, Malai.

548
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:31,818
Please don't praise me too much,

549
00:33:34,006 --> 00:33:35,006
I feel shy.

550
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:40,447
Yes, Ms. Ramphoei!

551
00:33:40,648 --> 00:33:41,749
I'll get rid of the water

552
00:33:41,757 --> 00:33:43,350
and return to iron clothes...

553
00:33:46,061 --> 00:33:47,061
Oops!

554
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,710
Oh!

555
00:33:51,773 --> 00:33:52,749
Malai!

556
00:33:52,774 --> 00:33:53,774
Chaem!

557
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,960
Umm...

558
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:56,506
My apologies,

559
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,194
I really didn't mean to, my lord!

560
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:01,374
Malai...

561
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:03,569
My apologies, my lord.

562
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,406
Oh no, Ms. Malai.

563
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,906
Come here, Chaem!

564
00:34:12,273 --> 00:34:13,406
What were you doing?

565
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:14,852
Look, Ms. Malai is all wet!

566
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,540
I really didn't do it on purpose!

567
00:34:19,617 --> 00:34:21,258
You'd better remember this, Chaem.

568
00:34:21,283 --> 00:34:22,352
Never let this happen again.

569
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,040
Understood!

570
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:26,751
I will be more careful in the future!

571
00:34:26,955 --> 00:34:27,955
Useless.

572
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:30,899
Miss..

573
00:34:36,602 --> 00:34:37,820
What was that liquid?

574
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:39,562
Mop water, ma'am.

575
00:34:43,024 --> 00:34:44,024
Oh dear.

576
00:34:45,172 --> 00:34:46,414
It's alright.

577
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,242
It can't be helped.

578
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:49,789
Que sera, sera.

579
00:34:52,953 --> 00:34:55,008
Who will attend the banquet, my lord?

580
00:34:57,235 --> 00:34:59,109
I suppose Ramphoei will have to go.

581
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:00,945
- But...
- No buts.

582
00:35:01,211 --> 00:35:03,047
Hurry and dress up. Don't be slow.

583
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:04,523
I don't want to be late.

584
00:35:06,032 --> 00:35:07,453
Yes, my lord.

585
00:35:09,469 --> 00:35:10,969
Come, Chaem, help me dress up.

586
00:35:10,994 --> 00:35:13,039
Yes, right away.

587
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:14,758
I apologize.

588
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:17,445
Malai,

589
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:19,984
please go and wash up.

590
00:35:20,664 --> 00:35:22,024
You are all dirty.

591
00:35:24,672 --> 00:35:25,712
Yes, my lord.

592
00:35:33,486 --> 00:35:34,486
Here.

593
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:36,338
Whoa...

594
00:35:36,603 --> 00:35:38,181
Impressive work, Chaem.

595
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:39,720
Not only did that damn Malai

596
00:35:39,744 --> 00:35:41,148
not get to attend the banquet,

597
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:42,712
you even let me slap you.

598
00:35:42,924 --> 00:35:44,298
You've earned your reputation.

599
00:35:46,408 --> 00:35:47,806
If Ms. Ramphoei rewarded me

600
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,884
this generously,

601
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:49,986
next time

602
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:51,814
you can slap me my face on both sides.

603
00:35:51,947 --> 00:35:52,947
Oww!

604
00:35:53,103 --> 00:35:54,658
Oww!

605
00:35:55,658 --> 00:35:58,423
Sure, I wouldn't hold back next time,

606
00:35:58,643 --> 00:35:59,775
especially if it helps

607
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,447
that annoying Malai leave sooner.

608
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,017
A toff like her...

609
00:36:04,384 --> 00:36:06,072
The viscount will grow tired of her.

610
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,689
No one can compare

611
00:36:07,714 --> 00:36:09,392
to my Ms. Ramphoei.

612
00:36:10,314 --> 00:36:11,626
Well said, Chaem.

613
00:36:12,244 --> 00:36:13,994
But don't expect a pay raise.

614
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,205
Go find me an outfit to change into.

615
00:36:18,314 --> 00:36:20,400
Or else we'll be late.

616
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:21,884
Those upper-class people are waiting.

617
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:22,893
Understood.

618
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,652
Do you not have any work?

619
00:37:14,113 --> 00:37:16,050
Why are you sitting here slacking off?

620
00:37:16,543 --> 00:37:18,698
I noticed Ms. Malai standing alone.

621
00:37:18,723 --> 00:37:19,863
You didn't look well,

622
00:37:20,622 --> 00:37:22,207
and I was afraid you might faint.

623
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,559
I feel fine,

624
00:37:23,887 --> 00:37:25,543
I wouldn't faint.

625
00:37:26,434 --> 00:37:27,434
Yes, ma'am.

626
00:37:28,168 --> 00:37:29,723
Go and attend to your duties.

627
00:37:29,973 --> 00:37:31,316
Why are you sitting here?

628
00:37:31,622 --> 00:37:34,155
No duty is as important as Ms. Malai.

629
00:37:36,057 --> 00:37:37,181
What are you saying?

630
00:37:41,307 --> 00:37:42,556
Ms. Malai seems sad,

631
00:37:43,158 --> 00:37:45,064
but I don't know how to console you.

632
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:47,767
I can only sit quietly like this.

633
00:37:49,775 --> 00:37:51,165
If Ms. Malai is angry

634
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:53,033
or needs to vent any frustrations,

635
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:55,494
I will gladly listen.

636
00:37:56,924 --> 00:37:58,470
That is not a servant's duty.

637
00:37:59,393 --> 00:38:00,548
Return to work,

638
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:02,962
or I will report to the Viscount

639
00:38:03,025 --> 00:38:04,306
that you're slacking off.

640
00:38:06,346 --> 00:38:07,197
Yes, ma'am.

641
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,181
Ms. Malai!

642
00:38:10,611 --> 00:38:11,884
What is it, Fueang?

643
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,462
Count Phichit came,

644
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:17,142
he is waiting inside the house, ma'am.

645
00:38:17,189 --> 00:38:18,001
Thank you.

646
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,010
No problem, ma'am.

647
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:35,501
My lord,

648
00:38:36,033 --> 00:38:37,713
what brings you here?

649
00:38:38,518 --> 00:38:40,318
I am here to see you, Ms. Malai.

650
00:38:47,307 --> 00:38:49,267
I heard everything from Ranchaun.

651
00:38:54,689 --> 00:38:56,353
I've brought you some medicine.

652
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:57,577
It's tonics.

653
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,250
They say they're very effective.

654
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,110
Thank you, my lord.

655
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:04,475
What medicine?

656
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:06,790
No need to thank me.

657
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,710
Actually,

658
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,343
I should be the one

659
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:19,640
who apologizes to Ms. Malai.

660
00:39:19,765 --> 00:39:20,827
Despite having

661
00:39:20,851 --> 00:39:22,616
a wonderful lady like Ms. Malai,

662
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:23,936
my younger brother

663
00:39:24,148 --> 00:39:25,890
took another,

664
00:39:26,108 --> 00:39:28,021
random, unknown woman as his wife.

665
00:39:28,303 --> 00:39:29,303
Absolutely useless.

666
00:39:30,982 --> 00:39:32,422
About that matter,

667
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,044
I am starting to get over it.

668
00:39:36,904 --> 00:39:39,771
But I appreciate your consideration.

669
00:39:40,185 --> 00:39:41,771
To be honest, Malai,

670
00:39:42,201 --> 00:39:43,208
I...

671
00:39:43,303 --> 00:39:45,107
truly want to scold my little brother.

672
00:39:45,146 --> 00:39:46,130
But...

673
00:39:46,904 --> 00:39:48,497
I am just a son of a concubine,

674
00:39:49,295 --> 00:39:50,654
and no matter what I say,

675
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,279
he will turn a deaf ear to it.

676
00:39:52,654 --> 00:39:53,685
This is

677
00:39:53,981 --> 00:39:55,021
all I can do.

678
00:39:56,115 --> 00:39:57,138
I'm already

679
00:39:57,154 --> 00:39:58,575
very grateful for this, my lord.

680
00:39:58,584 --> 00:39:59,997
Even though I'm infertile,

681
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:01,185
believe me,

682
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,755
this medicine

683
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:04,411
has worked for some people.

684
00:40:06,794 --> 00:40:08,818
I must inform Ms. Ramphoei about this.

685
00:40:08,856 --> 00:40:10,656
Maybe I'll get some reward.

686
00:40:12,982 --> 00:40:15,154
You must have a child with the Viscount.

687
00:40:15,224 --> 00:40:16,607
I am eager to see its face.

688
00:40:17,357 --> 00:40:18,357
Yes, my lord.

689
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,810
Oh!

690
00:40:31,131 --> 00:40:32,131
Phoem!

691
00:40:32,365 --> 00:40:34,857
I want to make a magic love powder.

692
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,505
Use this first.

693
00:40:38,506 --> 00:40:39,946
You smell so good.

694
00:40:46,412 --> 00:40:47,707
(Next episode)
Take it off, you hear?

695
00:40:47,732 --> 00:40:48,810
(Next episode)
The viscount gave it to Ms. Malai,

696
00:40:48,826 --> 00:40:49,810
(Next episode)
it doesn't belong to you!

697
00:40:49,818 --> 00:40:50,693
(Next episode)
Back off!

698
00:40:50,718 --> 00:40:52,116
