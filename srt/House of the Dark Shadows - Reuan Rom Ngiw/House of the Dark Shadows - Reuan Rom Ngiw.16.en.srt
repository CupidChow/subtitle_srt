00:02:00,876 --> 00:02:02,688
my desire is to remain with you, Malai.

20
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,398
I place no trust in your words, my lord.

21
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:08,124
Do you find me so disgusting?

22
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,421
I am by no means unattractive.

23
00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:12,054
In fact, you should consider

24
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,234
yourself fortunate

25
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,593
to have the opportunity

26
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:16,298
to share a bed with me!

27
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:18,951
In the end, my lord,

28
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:20,420
you still need to resort to

29
00:02:20,445 --> 00:02:22,125
a vile woman like me,

30
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,102
for you are incapable

31
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:25,290
of having a child!

32
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:28,882
I've warned you before

33
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,163
not to act like this.

34
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:31,531
Why did you not listen to me?

35
00:02:32,414 --> 00:02:33,726
And why should I listen?

36
00:02:39,398 --> 00:02:40,398
Ramphoei.

37
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,625
Please take a rest.

38
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,742
Do not order me around!

39
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,757
I will act as I please!

40
00:02:52,898 --> 00:02:55,298
Please stop! This has gone too far!

41
00:02:57,492 --> 00:02:58,492
Let go!

42
00:03:00,858 --> 00:03:02,515
Leave, you parasite!

43
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,607
Ms. Ramphoei, cease troubling Ms. Malai!

44
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,398
Why?

45
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,386
Why I can't give her trouble

46
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:11,810
when I carry the Viscount's child!

47
00:03:13,522 --> 00:03:14,522
And she...

48
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:17,209
she's nothing more than a leech!

49
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:18,577
Scram!

50
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:22,131
Ms. Malai, please step aside for now.

51
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:23,507
I'll handle this.

52
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,490
- But...
- Please don't worry.

53
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,951
I would never harm Ms. Ramphoei.

54
00:03:30,405 --> 00:03:32,405
Indeed, because you're my...

55
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:36,779
Ms. Ramphoei is very intoxicated.

56
00:03:36,804 --> 00:03:38,459
Ms. Malai, please pay no mind to her.

57
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,693
I won't take it to heart.

58
00:03:42,694 --> 00:03:45,193
Ramphoei, please stop throwing tantrum.

59
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:46,982
Remember, you're pregnant

60
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:48,076
with the Viscount's child.

61
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,162
Nosy!

62
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:55,123
- Scram!
- Ms. Ramphoei!

63
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:56,592
I don't want to see your face!

64
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:57,951
Scram!

65
00:03:58,444 --> 00:03:59,564
Ms. Ramphoei!

66
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:28,134
Ms. Malai, please step aside for now.

67
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,510
I'll handle this.

68
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:31,227
Please don't worry.

69
00:04:31,252 --> 00:04:32,938
I would never harm Ms. Ramphoei.

70
00:04:32,963 --> 00:04:34,963
Indeed, because you're my...

71
00:04:37,697 --> 00:04:38,978
Ms. Ramphoei is very intoxicated.

72
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:40,658
Ms. Malai, please pay no mind to her.

73
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:48,548
Please stop, Ms. Ramphoei.

74
00:04:49,642 --> 00:04:50,391
Ouch!

75
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,477
How much trouble will you keep making?

76
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,360
I'm not causing any trouble.

77
00:04:56,853 --> 00:04:58,516
I never expected you

78
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,689
to enjoy using force.

79
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:04,071
I have no filthy thoughts

80
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,266
as you might assume.

81
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,072
Oh, please, Dech,

82
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:09,321
why do you speak as if

83
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:11,477
nothing happened between us?

84
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:16,212
No matter how much you deny,

85
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:17,931
I am still your wife.

86
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,118
I am not your husband.

87
00:05:22,415 --> 00:05:23,501
This is solely due to

88
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:24,658
the Viscount's orders,

89
00:05:24,697 --> 00:05:26,087
nothing beyond that.

90
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:27,923
You must stop acting like this,

91
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:28,979
Ms. Ramphoei.

92
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:31,446
If you want me to stop,

93
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,602
then act like a good husband.

94
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:38,321
Take care of me.

95
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:39,852
Be with me.

96
00:05:41,665 --> 00:05:42,977
Otherwise,

97
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:44,782
I'll find a way to rid

98
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:46,407
myself of the child,

99
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:48,423
and then no one will

100
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,649
get what they desire.

101
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:52,985
I'm not asking for much,

102
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:55,391
just don't

103
00:05:55,493 --> 00:05:56,493
be stubborn with me.

104
00:05:58,681 --> 00:06:00,641
Fulfill my desires, that's I'm asking.

105
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:12,230
If that is your wish,

106
00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:16,425
I'll comply.

107
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:49,613
What are you planning...

108
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:11,300
What am I planning?

109
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:15,011
I am simply ensuring that

110
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:16,683
you won't go out

111
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,004
and cause trouble again.

112
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:22,593
Why, you little...

113
00:07:26,878 --> 00:07:28,863
Release me!

114
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:31,512
Good night,

115
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:34,427
Ms. Ramphoei.

116
00:07:38,902 --> 00:07:40,480
Release me!

117
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:41,613
Dech!

118
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,659
Dech!

119
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:47,238
Dech!

120
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:56,237
Ms. Malai...

121
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:57,668
It seems you handled Ramphoei

122
00:07:57,684 --> 00:07:58,707
quite effectively.

123
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:00,926
Ms. Malai, why...

124
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:01,988
I got worried.

125
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:04,222
I feared you might struggle

126
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:05,582
dealing with Ramphoei.

127
00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:09,074
I'm a man. I'm much stronger

128
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:10,619
than Ms. Ramphoei.

129
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:12,574
I know,

130
00:08:12,817 --> 00:08:14,316
but I still have concerns.

131
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:18,058
Ramphoei is not easy to handle.

132
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,199
And she has a foul mouth.

133
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,754
I never expected to

134
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:26,168
hear you say something like that.

135
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:30,449
I'm not that virtuous.

136
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:34,043
Did Ramphoei do anything to you?

137
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:36,941
She was heavily intoxicated,

138
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:38,074
even with all her strength,

139
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:39,777
there's only so much she can do.

140
00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:42,965
Now, let me escort you

141
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:44,121
back to your room.

142
00:08:46,238 --> 00:08:47,238
Alright.

143
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:11,761
You appear quite carefree, Dech.

144
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:13,801
My lord.

145
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:24,543
I need to discuss something with you.

146
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,630
Yes, my lord.

147
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:35,925
I'll show you

148
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:37,768
that you and I

149
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,738
are not equal.

150
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:47,034
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

151
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:51,918
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

152
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,575
I need to discuss something with you.

153
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:06,577
Come here.

154
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,717
I struck you

155
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:10,460
because of your dishonesty.

156
00:10:10,624 --> 00:10:11,795
Behind my back,

157
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:14,070
you've been doing things with Ramphoei!

158
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,764
My lord, you've misunderstood.

159
00:10:17,038 --> 00:10:18,249
I heard that Ms. Ramphoei was

160
00:10:18,274 --> 00:10:19,452
causing trouble to the point

161
00:10:19,477 --> 00:10:20,561
- where Ms. Malai...
- Oh.

162
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:22,764
So you're concerned about Malai.

163
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:26,757
I returned after Fueang informed me that

164
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:27,852
Ms. Ramphoei got drunk

165
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,884
and went on a rampage.

166
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:30,546
Moreover, you assigned

167
00:10:30,562 --> 00:10:31,719
Saeng to watch over her,

168
00:10:31,743 --> 00:10:32,757
but he returned to

169
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,061
the servants' quarters, my lord.

170
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:35,186
I felt anxious and

171
00:10:35,211 --> 00:10:36,585
went to check, that's all.

172
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:39,054
To ensure Ramphoei

173
00:10:39,545 --> 00:10:41,162
didn't misbehave towards Malai.

174
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,108
Your silence

175
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:46,593
implies I was correct.

176
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:49,499
It seems you want to be free

177
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:51,468
and be with Malai,

178
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,882
just as I expected.

179
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:56,538
Who I associate with

180
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,397
is unrelated to this, my lord.

181
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:02,960
Your tantrum is irrational, my lord.

182
00:11:03,374 --> 00:11:04,374
Dech!

183
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:08,655
You dare speak back to me, Dech?

184
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,483
You no longer consider me your master?

185
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:19,311
I always love

186
00:11:19,632 --> 00:11:21,624
and respect you as my master, my lord.

187
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:23,179
However, this situation

188
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:25,491
is entirely tied by your decisions.

189
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:26,679
Knowing how to tie

190
00:11:26,702 --> 00:11:27,718
should also involve untying.

191
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:30,062
Dech!

192
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:32,968
Don't you dare teach me!

193
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:34,499
From now on,

194
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:37,115
never get involved with Ramphoei again!

195
00:11:38,218 --> 00:11:39,741
Did my lord assume I'd willingly

196
00:11:39,788 --> 00:11:40,982
be involved with her?

197
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:42,171
You ordered me to do so

198
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:43,546
for the sake of the inheritance!

199
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:45,031
- Dech!
- Punch me.

200
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:46,367
Punch me, my lord.

201
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:47,921
If you believe hitting me

202
00:11:47,945 --> 00:11:49,007
will solve anything,

203
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:50,171
go ahead and hit me

204
00:11:50,202 --> 00:11:51,225
to your heart's content.

205
00:11:54,304 --> 00:11:56,046
But I stand by my words that

206
00:11:56,187 --> 00:11:57,694
all of this is happening

207
00:11:57,726 --> 00:11:58,999
because of you, my lord.

208
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:02,647
If you hadn't brought Ms. Ramphoei here,

209
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:04,054
this household wouldn't be

210
00:12:04,054 --> 00:12:05,007
in this turmoil.

211
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:06,264
And what should I do?

212
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:08,733
If I don't have a child soon,

213
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,936
I won't inherit my father's assets.

214
00:12:11,132 --> 00:12:12,179
Where will I get the money

215
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:13,186
to support you all?

216
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:18,897
Since you're so smart,

217
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:20,460
tell me

218
00:12:20,617 --> 00:12:23,093
what other options do I have?

219
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:25,823
I lack the wisdom to provide

220
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:26,862
an answer, my lord.

221
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,510
However, by supporting Ms. Ramphoei

222
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:31,205
simply because she's pregnant,

223
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:32,471
and now with her no longer

224
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,705
respecting authority figures,

225
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,440
all this chaos is

226
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:40,346
a result of your own unfair decisions,

227
00:12:40,362 --> 00:12:41,385
isn't it, my lord?

228
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Fueang!

229
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:33,314
Fueang!

230
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,330
Fueang!

231
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,041
Fueang!

232
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,330
Won't you untie me?

233
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:44,580
Untie me now!

234
00:13:45,228 --> 00:13:46,126
Now!

235
00:13:46,143 --> 00:13:47,143
Yes, ma'am?

236
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,447
Untie me now!

237
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:50,556
Yes, ma'am?

238
00:13:50,587 --> 00:13:51,830
Untie me now!

239
00:13:51,855 --> 00:13:53,275
Oh, a moment please.

240
00:13:58,643 --> 00:13:59,822
Who ordered you to come here?

241
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,009
Ms. Malai, ma'am.

242
00:14:02,322 --> 00:14:03,564
She asked me to bring you

243
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:04,767
some soft-boiled rice,

244
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,728
in case you might be still too drunk

245
00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:08,433
to join for breakfast.

246
00:14:09,946 --> 00:14:10,946
Nosy...

247
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:15,048
Hurry up and untie this for me.

248
00:14:15,073 --> 00:14:16,073
So tardy.

249
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:17,775
Yes, ma'am.

250
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:27,790
Ms. Ramphoei, please eat quickly.

251
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:30,330
Before it gets cold and is no longer tasty.

252
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,960
Ms. Malai even cooked it herself.

253
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,439
Really,

254
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:40,167
Malai made this?

255
00:14:41,408 --> 00:14:42,408
Yes, ma'am.

256
00:14:44,913 --> 00:14:45,913
Come here!

257
00:14:46,374 --> 00:14:47,374
Come here!

258
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:49,655
Stop!

259
00:14:53,835 --> 00:14:55,608
Ms. Ramphoei, what are you doing?

260
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:00,842
What's going on?

261
00:15:01,655 --> 00:15:02,655
Ms. Malai,

262
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,656
Ms. Ramphoei poured

263
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:05,053
the soft-boiled rice on me!

264
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:07,483
I didn't do it.

265
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:09,460
I just woke up.

266
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:10,866
My hands were still weak.

267
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:12,967
It's not true, ma'am.

268
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,233
Ms. Ramphoei intentionally

269
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:15,538
poured it on my head!

270
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:19,664
Whoa!

271
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:20,742
Oh no!

272
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,750
Fueang!

273
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:22,797
What's going on?

274
00:15:22,836 --> 00:15:24,500
Why did you make such a mess?

275
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:26,554
I should have served

276
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,890
Ms. Ramphoei myself.

277
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:28,985
Useless.

278
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:30,023
Quiet, Chaem.

279
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:33,922
Ramphoei,

280
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:36,172
doing this to Fueang isn't right.

281
00:15:38,914 --> 00:15:40,367
What's not right about it?

282
00:15:40,562 --> 00:15:42,162
Fueang is a servant,

283
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:44,148
I can do whatever I want with her.

284
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:45,789
If I want to slap her right now, I can.

285
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:47,437
If you're going to slap Fueang,

286
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,836
you'll have to get through me first.

287
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,109
I won't allow you to mistreat

288
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:51,101
the servants like this.

289
00:15:51,126 --> 00:15:53,367
My, don't assume I don't dare.

290
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:55,633
Let go!

291
00:15:55,658 --> 00:15:56,806
Ms. Ramphoei...

292
00:15:56,883 --> 00:15:57,883
Let go!

293
00:15:58,477 --> 00:15:59,640
It's going too far.

294
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:01,820
Even if you're pregnant

295
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,093
with the viscount's child,

296
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:04,593
I'm still

297
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:06,642
the primary wife of the viscount.

298
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,195
I won't allow you to act like

299
00:16:09,211 --> 00:16:10,250
a lowlife with me.

300
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:14,328
I'd like to know

301
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:16,078
how much longer

302
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:18,258
you can deceive yourself.

303
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:20,992
Even if I'm the lowly one,

304
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,734
right now I'm higher than

305
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,695
the viscount's primary wife like you.

306
00:16:26,477 --> 00:16:27,374
But

307
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:28,922
if you don't believe me,

308
00:16:29,664 --> 00:16:30,784
I'll show you.

309
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,328
Oww!

310
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,734
Ms. Ramphoei,

311
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:40,226
what are you doing?

312
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:42,093
Don't worry about me.

313
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:43,687
You go and get the viscount right now.

314
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,351
- But...
- I ordered you to go!

315
00:16:46,094 --> 00:16:47,094
Yes, ma'am.

316
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,945
Oww!

317
00:16:48,953 --> 00:16:49,827
Ramphoei!

318
00:16:50,297 --> 00:16:51,336
What are you doing?

319
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,140
You're still carrying

320
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:53,289
the viscount's child.

321
00:16:53,836 --> 00:16:55,500
I'll show you

322
00:16:55,696 --> 00:16:57,211
that you and I

323
00:16:58,211 --> 00:16:59,331
are not equal.

324
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,008
Oww!

325
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,187
My lord, please help me!

326
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:07,812
Oww! It hurts so bad, my lord!

327
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:09,686
Oww!

328
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:11,742
My lord, please help me!

329
00:17:14,726 --> 00:17:15,968
It shows that you're not fit

330
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:17,349
to be the viscount's wife.

331
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:19,122
At most, you'll just be

332
00:17:20,162 --> 00:17:21,037
a bed mate.

333
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:22,038
Malai!

334
00:17:23,805 --> 00:17:28,711
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

335
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:33,734
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

336
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:35,172
Come here!

337
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,484
You are bullying Ramphoei

338
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,672
because you want her to miscarry?

339
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:39,467
Ms. Malai!

340
00:17:40,531 --> 00:17:41,851
No, my lord.

341
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,209
Ramphoei did everything to herself.

342
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:46,000
I can testify to that, my lord.

343
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:48,773
Be quiet, Fueang.

344
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:50,234
You're Malai's servant.

345
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:51,664
Of course, you'll side with her.

346
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:55,078
Go take a shower or something!

347
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,220
You look pitiful.

348
00:17:56,227 --> 00:17:57,297
I refuse, my lord.

349
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:58,999
You can't side with

350
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:00,055
the wrong person, my lord.

351
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,883
Shut up!

352
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,086
You're just a servant.

353
00:18:03,117 --> 00:18:04,414
How dare you talk back to me!

354
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:05,578
My lord!

355
00:18:05,828 --> 00:18:07,648
You have to be reasonable, my lord!

356
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:11,046
If you lack fairness like this,

357
00:18:11,672 --> 00:18:12,859
how are you going to

358
00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:13,952
govern this household?

359
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:15,015
Another one

360
00:18:15,414 --> 00:18:16,921
saying that I'm unfair.

361
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:19,023
I'm just protecting my child.

362
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,031
How am I wrong?

363
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:22,007
If you've got your child as you desire,

364
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:24,023
then let me go, my lord.

365
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:26,679
I don't want to stay here with you

366
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,734
and Ramphoei as

367
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:29,132
a third wheel any longer!

368
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,554
Divorce me already!

369
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:33,960
We won't have to be on bad terms

370
00:18:33,976 --> 00:18:35,023
with each again.

371
00:18:48,348 --> 00:18:49,442
Let us go, Fueang.

372
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,981
You can go take a shower

373
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,316
and then come help me take care of

374
00:18:53,348 --> 00:18:54,543
other matters in the house.

375
00:18:56,005 --> 00:18:57,045
This morning,

376
00:18:57,817 --> 00:18:58,942
we've wasted enough time

377
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,325
on unnecessary matters.

378
00:19:01,856 --> 00:19:03,056
Yes, ma'am.

379
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:11,057
Each one of you,

380
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,096
are so good at causing trouble.

381
00:19:13,276 --> 00:19:15,042
I can't have even a  little peace of mind.

382
00:19:44,144 --> 00:19:45,846
They had quite a serious argument?

383
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:47,307
Indeed, the Viscount's voice

384
00:19:47,323 --> 00:19:48,540
was so loud, it could be

385
00:19:48,565 --> 00:19:50,237
heard all the way from his room.

386
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:52,010
Serves her right.

387
00:19:52,027 --> 00:19:53,518
She likes to act so highly,

388
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,276
I'm a good match for her.

389
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:59,370
Ms. Ramphoei, you're truly the best.

390
00:20:00,456 --> 00:20:01,690
Absolutely, Chaem.

391
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:03,831
Now that I have this baby,

392
00:20:03,878 --> 00:20:05,581
I can do anything in the future.

393
00:20:06,823 --> 00:20:07,909
The young master must have

394
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:08,909
a lot of good deeds.

395
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:10,331
He's already bringing

396
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:12,139
blessings to Ms. Ramphoei.

397
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,776
You're right, Chaem.

398
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:15,675
Even though it hasn't been born yet,

399
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:17,330
it already gave me many things.

400
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:18,565
And it gave me control

401
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,030
over the Viscount.

402
00:20:20,705 --> 00:20:22,905
Soon, I'll be living comfortably.

403
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,230
Yes, ma'am.

404
00:20:24,613 --> 00:20:25,573
In that case,

405
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:27,081
I'll make sure to take good care

406
00:20:27,113 --> 00:20:28,065
of the young master.

407
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,050
My beloved.

408
00:20:43,694 --> 00:20:44,725
Ms. Malai,

409
00:20:45,116 --> 00:20:47,592
I truly feel angry for you, ma'am.

410
00:20:49,858 --> 00:20:51,069
The more days that pass,

411
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:52,631
the more arrogant she becomes.

412
00:20:53,007 --> 00:20:54,155
If you leave,

413
00:20:54,764 --> 00:20:56,233
I'll request to join you.

414
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,092
I can't bear to stay here any longer.

415
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:02,467
Thank you, Fueang, for your empathy.

416
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:04,764
But I don't have any assets.

417
00:21:05,272 --> 00:21:06,553
If you go with me,

418
00:21:07,303 --> 00:21:08,709
the payment may not be as high

419
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:10,381
as what the Viscount pays you.

420
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:12,178
It doesn't matter, ma'am.

421
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:14,264
I'm happy to serve you.

422
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:16,694
It's better than staying here

423
00:21:16,702 --> 00:21:18,780
and serving someone like Ms. Ramphoei.

424
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:21,686
Just thinking about it makes me

425
00:21:21,711 --> 00:21:23,061
feel like breaking down.

426
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,436
Actually,

427
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:31,350
if you wish to get back at Ramphoei,

428
00:21:32,397 --> 00:21:34,077
I can make it happen for you.

429
00:21:34,553 --> 00:21:35,553
How, ma'am?

430
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:47,709
You'll see.

431
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:50,178
My apologies.

432
00:21:50,678 --> 00:21:52,178
Malai is still getting dressed.

433
00:21:52,772 --> 00:21:54,537
No worries, it's normal for women

434
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:56,362
to be meticulous like this.

435
00:21:57,663 --> 00:21:58,663
My lord!

436
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:01,108
Where are you going, my lord?

437
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:04,037
Why didn't you tell me

438
00:22:04,062 --> 00:22:05,554
you were attending a ball?

439
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:07,584
Because attending a ball

440
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,670
doesn't suit you.

441
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:11,498
Why not?

442
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:13,858
I am the Viscount's wife,

443
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:15,686
I've attended one before.

444
00:22:15,913 --> 00:22:17,342
It's a "High society" event.

445
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:19,412
When did you ever become a lady?

446
00:22:21,577 --> 00:22:23,600
But I know that someone around here

447
00:22:23,616 --> 00:22:26,569
didn't have noble origins, right?

448
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:28,811
Having a mother as a servant.

449
00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:31,384
Enough, Ramphoei.

450
00:22:31,704 --> 00:22:33,094
Why, my lord?

451
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,766
I'm merely speaking the truth.

452
00:22:38,696 --> 00:22:40,507
Taking someone with no manners to a ball

453
00:22:40,532 --> 00:22:42,469
will only humiliate the viscount.

454
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:45,243
Please don't mind her.

455
00:22:55,962 --> 00:22:56,962
Malai.

456
00:22:58,017 --> 00:22:59,422
As they say,

457
00:22:59,642 --> 00:23:02,243
"you can't teach an old dog new tricks."

458
00:23:03,086 --> 00:23:04,321
Humans can't easily change

459
00:23:04,345 --> 00:23:05,586
their nature, after all.

460
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,735
Ms. Malai is right.

461
00:23:07,478 --> 00:23:09,297
Some people are born both beautiful

462
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,055
in appearance and manner,

463
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:13,125
fitting to be the child of

464
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,350
a noble family.

465
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:17,648
Oh, my lord.

466
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:19,523
If you keep praising her,

467
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,749
Ms. Malai might float with happiness.

468
00:23:24,706 --> 00:23:25,940
You're taking Ms. Malai

469
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:27,041
to attend the ball

470
00:23:27,065 --> 00:23:28,862
and leave me here cooped up

471
00:23:28,887 --> 00:23:30,567
with your unborn child?

472
00:23:31,455 --> 00:23:32,611
You've only been pregnant

473
00:23:32,636 --> 00:23:33,657
for a few months.

474
00:23:33,682 --> 00:23:35,400
I don't want you to strain your body.

475
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:37,151
My lord,

476
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,455
why didn't you say so directly,

477
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,113
that you don't want to bring someone

478
00:23:41,138 --> 00:23:42,232
with no manners

479
00:23:42,257 --> 00:23:44,146
to attend a ball and humiliate yourself.

480
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:50,253
She's directly berating you, ma'am.

481
00:23:50,402 --> 00:23:51,714
I am aware.

482
00:23:55,316 --> 00:23:57,448
But I can learn, my lord.

483
00:23:58,677 --> 00:24:00,044
Not today, Ramphoei.

484
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:01,531
Another time.

485
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:03,333
But I'm your wife,

486
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,700
and I'm about to become

487
00:24:04,725 --> 00:24:05,833
the mother of your child.

488
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:07,208
Why don't you take me out

489
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:08,934
and announce it to everyone?

490
00:24:09,052 --> 00:24:10,052
Ramphoei!

491
00:24:10,388 --> 00:24:11,388
My lord,

492
00:24:12,466 --> 00:24:14,146
please don't be upset.

493
00:24:14,982 --> 00:24:16,895
I'll talk to Ramphoei for a moment.

494
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:19,153
Maybe she'll understand better.

495
00:24:19,778 --> 00:24:21,130
Do whatever you want quickly.

496
00:24:21,161 --> 00:24:22,403
I don't wish to be late.

497
00:24:23,435 --> 00:24:24,286
Yes, my lord.

498
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,403
Ramphoei, come with me.

499
00:24:26,825 --> 00:24:28,676
Why should I follow your orders?

500
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:31,020
If you wish to attend, come with me.

501
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,834
Fueang, come with us.

502
00:24:39,255 --> 00:24:40,255
Yes, ma'am.

503
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,193
Follow her.

504
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:56,327
What is this?

505
00:24:57,108 --> 00:24:58,677
I want you to try eating Western food

506
00:24:58,702 --> 00:25:00,076
and see how you manage.

507
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:03,092
And where's the food?

508
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:04,896
Consider it a simulation.

509
00:25:04,935 --> 00:25:06,107
I'll say it only once.

510
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:07,802
If you can't do it,

511
00:25:07,827 --> 00:25:08,982
don't bother going to the ball

512
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,047
in my place.

513
00:25:11,826 --> 00:25:14,170
Fine. How difficult could it be?

514
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:17,315
I'll begin by serving a soup.

515
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,787
Do you know what "serve" means?

516
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,357
To serve is to bring the food

517
00:25:23,373 --> 00:25:24,826
up to the table.

518
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:27,201
And what's this thing called 'soup'?

519
00:25:27,663 --> 00:25:29,443
Soup is like a Western-style curry.

520
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:32,170
When eating, you have to use the spoon.

521
00:25:33,537 --> 00:25:34,748
You can try

522
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:37,045
to pick the spoon for soups?

523
00:25:55,577 --> 00:25:57,178
Why do we have to use a spoon?

524
00:25:57,288 --> 00:25:59,458
Can't I just sip it directly?

525
00:25:59,483 --> 00:26:00,483
Oww!

526
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:02,475
Oww!

527
00:26:02,513 --> 00:26:03,951
You have to use a soup spoon.

528
00:26:04,014 --> 00:26:06,014
How can you do this, Ramphoei?

529
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,225
If someone sees it,

530
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,467
people will think

531
00:26:08,717 --> 00:26:11,115
the viscount's wife is a savage.

532
00:26:12,365 --> 00:26:13,545
Malai!

533
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,119
Are you mocking me?

534
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:16,537
I'm not.

535
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:21,021
The next dish is often fish,

536
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:23,943
and you'll need a knife and a fork.

537
00:26:24,694 --> 00:26:26,178
Try picking them out.

538
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,701
Ugh,

539
00:26:52,202 --> 00:26:54,006
it's too complicated. I'm not going!

540
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,154
You said it yourself

541
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:57,460
that you're not going.

542
00:26:58,014 --> 00:26:59,842
Fine. I'm not going!

543
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:02,271
This ceremony is too complicated.

544
00:27:03,405 --> 00:27:04,678
That's good.

545
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,428
So you can cease eagerly

546
00:27:06,436 --> 00:27:08,053
wishing to attend the ball.

547
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,178
Why can't I be eager

548
00:27:11,203 --> 00:27:13,203
when I'm the viscount's wife?

549
00:27:13,952 --> 00:27:15,014
Being a wife

550
00:27:15,178 --> 00:27:16,381
doesn't only involve matters

551
00:27:16,389 --> 00:27:18,076
within the house or in bed.

552
00:27:18,311 --> 00:27:19,467
It's a life partner that

553
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,935
the viscount can take out

554
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,279
to events with dignity.

555
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,420
If you are not capable of it,

556
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:27,553
it shows that you're not fit

557
00:27:27,578 --> 00:27:28,943
to be the viscount's wife.

558
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:31,154
At most, you'll just be

559
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,092
a bed mate.

560
00:27:33,108 --> 00:27:34,108
Malai!

561
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,943
I'm simply trying to teach you

562
00:27:42,968 --> 00:27:45,029
to know your place

563
00:27:45,491 --> 00:27:46,998
and be aware of your position,

564
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,545
and don't assume

565
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:49,834
that you're equal to me.

566
00:27:50,092 --> 00:27:51,310
Someone like you is only good

567
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,810
because you were born into nobility!

568
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:54,545
Both of us have two feet and hands!

569
00:27:54,577 --> 00:27:56,162
I don't see what's different about us.

570
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,389
You just want to show off

571
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:58,662
that you're noble.

572
00:27:58,772 --> 00:28:00,795
I'm not showing off.

573
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,279
I'm just letting you see that

574
00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:06,006
being noble doesn't depend on

575
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:07,357
one's background,

576
00:28:07,405 --> 00:28:08,685
but on manners.

577
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:10,748
Even if in the future,

578
00:28:10,764 --> 00:28:11,818
you'll be the mother of

579
00:28:11,842 --> 00:28:12,998
the viscount's heir,

580
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:14,045
but ultimately,

581
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,337
you'll still just a lowly mongrel!

582
00:28:16,968 --> 00:28:17,913
Damn you, Malai!

583
00:28:22,545 --> 00:28:23,530
If you're going to fight,

584
00:28:23,555 --> 00:28:24,365
then fight with me!

585
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:25,404
I won't let my master's

586
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:26,499
energy be wasted!

587
00:28:26,703 --> 00:28:27,903
It is alright, Fueang.

588
00:28:29,586 --> 00:28:31,070
If you want to create another issue,

589
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:32,155
then go ahead.

590
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:33,929
I'm warning you for your own good.

591
00:28:34,156 --> 00:28:35,921
How dare you teach me?

592
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,445
Why can't I?

593
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:40,124
I'm still the Viscount's primary wife.

594
00:28:41,281 --> 00:28:42,679
The one who should know

595
00:28:42,695 --> 00:28:43,812
their position is you.

596
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:47,273
If you want to plot and act like

597
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:48,335
you'll slip and have

598
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,530
a miscarriage again,

599
00:28:49,547 --> 00:28:51,210
do it after I return from the ball

600
00:28:51,226 --> 00:28:52,273
with the viscount.

601
00:28:52,304 --> 00:28:54,171
I've wasted enough time on you.

602
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,030
Malai!

603
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,570
Go ahead!

604
00:29:17,781 --> 00:29:18,898
Look at Dech, my lord.

605
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:21,749
He seems even more anxious than my lord.

606
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:28,617
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

607
00:29:28,703 --> 00:29:33,609
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

608
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:40,789
Ms. Ramphoei.

609
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,835
Why are you here, Ramphoei?

610
00:29:45,226 --> 00:29:46,390
Please leave immediately.

611
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:48,234
It won't be good if anyone sees you.

612
00:29:48,296 --> 00:29:49,515
Oh please, Dech.

613
00:29:49,937 --> 00:29:51,484
What are you afraid of?

614
00:29:51,648 --> 00:29:53,382
No one is at home today.

615
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,070
They all went out to attend the ball.

616
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:57,301
Even so, you shouldn't come here.

617
00:29:58,101 --> 00:29:59,476
If any servant sees you,

618
00:29:59,492 --> 00:30:01,125
they might condemn publicly,

619
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:02,796
and the viscount will be furious.

620
00:30:04,328 --> 00:30:06,093
Let them condemn publicly.

621
00:30:07,086 --> 00:30:08,366
It's not like we've been

622
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,640
having an affair without

623
00:30:09,656 --> 00:30:11,226
the viscount knowing, right?

624
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:18,632
Actually,

625
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:21,226
I have something

626
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:23,451
I've wanted to confess to you for ages.

627
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,750
What is it, ma'am?

628
00:30:28,406 --> 00:30:29,421
I've

629
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,124
liked you since we first met.

630
00:30:33,218 --> 00:30:34,445
Now that you know,

631
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,931
you think you can just reject me?

632
00:30:38,968 --> 00:30:40,468
You're the viscount's wife.

633
00:30:40,484 --> 00:30:41,966
I would never like you back,

634
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:43,093
Ms. Ramphoei.

635
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:47,726
You have no choice but to love me,

636
00:30:47,751 --> 00:30:48,970
I am your wife.

637
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,124
You can't just abandon me.

638
00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:53,398
Ms. Ramphoei!

639
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:55,304
Dech!

640
00:30:55,726 --> 00:30:58,093
Return the money you borrowed from me!

641
00:30:58,671 --> 00:30:59,764
Dech!

642
00:31:00,648 --> 00:31:01,688
How annoying.

643
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:02,929
No, ma'am.

644
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,773
If Fueang finds out,

645
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:09,390
then every servant will know.

646
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:11,304
And your child won't

647
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:12,929
receive the inheritance.

648
00:31:16,015 --> 00:31:17,249
So what do I do?

649
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:19,711
Dech,

650
00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:21,839
open the door right now, Dech.

651
00:31:22,194 --> 00:31:23,874
I know you're in there!

652
00:31:23,914 --> 00:31:24,843
Dech!

653
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:26,155
You have to escape first.

654
00:31:27,132 --> 00:31:28,077
Escape?

655
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:30,124
How am I supposed to do that?

656
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:32,016
Fueang is blocking the door.

657
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,856
Just climb out of the window.

658
00:31:37,578 --> 00:31:39,405
You want me to climb out of the window?

659
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,444
Hurry up and go. There's no other way.

660
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:45,554
Oww...

661
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:49,569
- But...
- Do you want to be caught

662
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:51,281
and be denied inheritance?

663
00:31:59,413 --> 00:32:00,693
Hurry up and go, ma'am.

664
00:32:01,178 --> 00:32:02,366
Fine. I'll climb.

665
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:04,859
Ouch!

666
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:18,593
Shh...

667
00:32:26,217 --> 00:32:27,694
You're a troublemaker.

668
00:32:28,374 --> 00:32:29,436
Why did you agree to

669
00:32:29,453 --> 00:32:30,686
the viscount's request to have

670
00:32:30,711 --> 00:32:31,929
a child with Ramphoei?

671
00:32:31,937 --> 00:32:34,007
Look at this mess, just as I warned you.

672
00:32:35,023 --> 00:32:36,421
I didn't want to do it either,

673
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:37,757
but it was necessary.

674
00:32:38,718 --> 00:32:39,921
When this is over,

675
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:41,147
you and I will be freed

676
00:32:41,163 --> 00:32:42,608
from the viscount's control.

677
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,355
But is it worth it?

678
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,374
Are you really willing to

679
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:48,772
abandon your own child?

680
00:32:51,327 --> 00:32:53,124
In exchange for our freedom

681
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,132
and a sum of money to establish oneself,

682
00:32:56,171 --> 00:32:57,257
I'll accept it.

683
00:32:57,446 --> 00:32:58,897
Let's see if you really mean it.

684
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:01,390
I'm afraid once the child is born,

685
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:02,952
you'll delay to leave

686
00:33:02,992 --> 00:33:04,257
and be stuck here.

687
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:05,702
No,

688
00:33:06,437 --> 00:33:07,671
I've made my decision.

689
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:21,358
(Eight months later)

690
00:33:22,015 --> 00:33:23,015
Push it out, ma'am!

691
00:33:23,343 --> 00:33:24,343
Push it out, ma'am!

692
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,820
Push it out, ma'am!

693
00:33:28,845 --> 00:33:30,796
Push it out with more force, ma'am!

694
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:40,579
Push it out with more force, ma'am!

695
00:33:41,806 --> 00:33:43,016
- Come out already!
- Push it out, ma'am!

696
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,166
It hurts!

697
00:33:45,743 --> 00:33:47,204
One more push, Ms. Ramphoei,

698
00:33:47,228 --> 00:33:48,268
almost there.

699
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,993
Come out now you damn child!

700
00:33:56,525 --> 00:33:57,766
Almost there, Ms. Ramphoei!

701
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:58,791
Push it out, ma'am!

702
00:33:58,806 --> 00:34:00,406
- Endure it, ma'am.
- One more push.

703
00:34:00,548 --> 00:34:01,563
How many hours have passed

704
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:02,446
in "just a moment?"

705
00:34:02,478 --> 00:34:04,368
It hurts!

706
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,462
Inhale deeply, ma'am.

707
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,876
Inhale deeply and push it out, ma'am.

708
00:34:08,908 --> 00:34:09,860
Inhale deeply.

709
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,001
Look at Dech, my lord.

710
00:34:22,736 --> 00:34:24,665
He seems even more anxious than my lord.

711
00:34:25,134 --> 00:34:26,259
Nonsense, Saeng.

712
00:34:26,284 --> 00:34:27,360
Dech is just excited

713
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,188
to see the young master

714
00:34:29,204 --> 00:34:30,095
quickly, right Dech?

715
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:31,686
Yes, my lord.

716
00:34:34,095 --> 00:34:35,895
Has she given birth, my lord?

717
00:34:35,947 --> 00:34:36,688
Not yet.

718
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:37,805
If she gives birth,

719
00:34:37,814 --> 00:34:39,087
do you think I and these people

720
00:34:39,112 --> 00:34:40,266
will still be standing here?

721
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,274
What a question.

722
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:43,266
I apologize, my lord.

723
00:34:43,486 --> 00:34:44,899
Yesterday, Uan also gave birth,

724
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:45,962
and today there's another

725
00:34:45,978 --> 00:34:47,172
person giving birth.

726
00:34:47,196 --> 00:34:48,796
- It's chaotic.
- Silence, Fueang.

727
00:34:49,251 --> 00:34:50,618
I'm trying to listen.

728
00:34:56,243 --> 00:34:57,555
Oww, it hurts!

729
00:34:58,478 --> 00:34:59,678
Push it out harder!

730
00:35:05,915 --> 00:35:07,938
When will it come out?

731
00:35:07,954 --> 00:35:09,493
Almost there, ma'am!

732
00:35:09,518 --> 00:35:11,134
A little more, one last time!

733
00:35:11,408 --> 00:35:12,649
One last push!

734
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:13,794
Alright, push!

735
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:17,775
Hurry!

736
00:35:27,845 --> 00:35:28,930
She has given birth!

737
00:35:29,343 --> 00:35:31,477
Dech! Did you hear it like I did?

738
00:35:32,087 --> 00:35:33,207
Yes, my lord.

739
00:35:33,962 --> 00:35:35,360
Congratulations, my lord.

740
00:35:36,048 --> 00:35:37,728
Congratulations, my lord.

741
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,477
Thank you very much, Saeng, Fueang.

742
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:52,136
Here you go, ma'am.

743
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:54,683
It's a baby boy, ma'am.

744
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:56,644
It's truly cute!

745
00:35:59,771 --> 00:36:02,154
Such a sweet little face, Ms. Ramphoei.

746
00:36:08,201 --> 00:36:09,732
A son? What blessed fortune.

747
00:36:10,904 --> 00:36:11,904
My lord.

748
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:13,724
May I see?

749
00:36:13,748 --> 00:36:14,748
Yes, my lord.

750
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,271
I'd like to see the young master's face.

751
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,091
I wonder if he looks like

752
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:32,177
the viscount or not.

753
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,939
Look at Saeng!

754
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,366
Just let it be.

755
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,650
Dech.

756
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:52,462
Why don't you go inside,

757
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,587
so you can see the baby's face

758
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:55,556
at least once?

759
00:36:56,353 --> 00:36:57,553
I'd better not.

760
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:22,205
How adorable.

761
00:37:36,432 --> 00:37:37,439
Look at how he is

762
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,578
from seeing the baby's face,

763
00:37:38,603 --> 00:37:40,205
what will he be like in the future?

764
00:37:40,228 --> 00:37:41,525
Now you've admitted that

765
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:42,978
you're eloping with Malai!

766
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:44,540
Ms. Malai isn't your wife, my lord.

767
00:37:44,565 --> 00:37:45,933
She is actually my wife!

768
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:47,377
Dech!

769
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:49,134
If Ms. Malai abandons me, my lord,

770
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:51,159
I'll reveal all of your secrets.

771
00:37:51,307 --> 00:37:52,798
How dare you threaten me?

772
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:54,205
Acting so high and mighty

773
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,658
when you're having an affair

774
00:37:55,683 --> 00:37:56,595
with a servant!

775
00:37:56,603 --> 00:37:58,124
Everything that happened between us,

776
00:37:58,149 --> 00:37:59,392
just what were we?

777
00:37:59,643 --> 00:38:01,626
I'm merely acting out of a sense of duty

778
00:38:01,643 --> 00:38:03,103
to repay your kindness, my lord.
