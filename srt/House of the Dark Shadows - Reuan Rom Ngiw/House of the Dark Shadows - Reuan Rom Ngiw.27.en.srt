Ms. Malai.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Why are you hugging me?

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If it weren't for you,

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I would have died.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
-Her brother is a criminal...
-Saeng!

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
-Saeng!
-I'm gonna kill you!

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
-Get out! Go!
-Get off me!

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You and Ramphoei conspired
to paralyze His Lordship.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
the same way
you conspired to fake her death!

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is the Dark Shadow House
where I live.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's so beautiful, my lord.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But you won't live here.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You'll be in the small house.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If you behave,

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll let you live here
and serve me.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Just buying me from the brothel

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
is more kindness than I can repay.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
From now on,

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I will give my whole life to you.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Alas, my dear viscount.

38
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What's wrong, Ms. Malai?

39
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why are you making that face?

40
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I was just curious

41
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
why Saeng said you conspired
to hurt the viscount

42
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
when it was an accident.

43
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Goodness, Ms. Malai,

44
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't listen to Saeng.

45
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's in his nature to blame others.

46
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And Saeng said Ramphoei
had a criminal for a brother

47
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and talked him into
killing the viscount.

48
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Was that true?

49
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You have to ask her.

50
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But if you ask me,

51
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't believe him.

52
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He was vindictive.

53
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He could have made up anything.

54
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But Saeng seemed very convinced.

55
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Actually when I heard
about the accident,

56
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I didn't want to believe it either.

57
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The viscount was
cautious by nature.

58
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He shouldn't have been
that reckless.

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Ms. Malai, even since I knew him,

60
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Saeng has always been
an instigator.

61
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The viscount's plans to kill you,

62
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
he had a hand in them.

63
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Or he wouldn't have looked
that shocked to see you.

64
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But if you believe Saeng

65
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
instead of me who was there,

66
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I have nothing else to say.

67
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Come on, Dech.

68
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Don't sulk.

69
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Will you tell me

70
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
how it happened?

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That night
the viscount worked late.

72
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Are you all right, my lord?

73
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm fine. Just a little headache.

74
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But you don't look so good.

75
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Maybe I should take you.

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I said I was fine!

77
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Just get the documents in order.

78
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I will.

79
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
My lord!

80
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
My lord!

81
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
My lord! My lord?

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
My lord!

83
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Kam! Uan!

84
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Get the doctor!

85
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
My lord?

86
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
My lord?

87
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But even though Kam and Uan
got the doctor to the viscount,

88
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
it was too late.

89
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You did the best you could.

90
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Even though the viscount
had hurt a lot of people,

91
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I never wished this on him.

92
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No one can escape the law of karma.

93
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The viscount probably
didn't expect it either.

94
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Despite the viscount's
kindness to many,

95
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
kindness is one thing,

96
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
sins are another.

97
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He has to pay for them.

98
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You're probably right.

99
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Dech.

100
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Ms. Ramphoei.

101
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Why are you here?

102
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If anyone finds out,
we'll be in trouble.

103
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Who will be in trouble? You or me?

104
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What do you want, ma'am?

105
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I should be the one asking.

106
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You bringing Malai back here

107
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
to betray me, aren't you?

108
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What betrayal?

109
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I never told you

110
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I would cooperate with you.

111
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Dech, you dared fool me?! Dech!

112
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
-Dech!
-Stop!

113
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I won't!

114
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You think you can use me
and get rid of me that easily?!

115
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let go!

116
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I've been telling you

117
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I love only Ms. Malai.

118
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It was all in your head

119
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
that I would do it for you.

120
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I never said that.

121
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Bastard!

122
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll never let you
be happy with Malai.

123
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I won't let you!

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
-I won't let you!
-Do it!

125
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Without me,
you can't manage the fortune.

126
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Even though it belongs to Mueang,

127
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
he's still a baby.

128
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
By the time he's an adult,

129
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
you would have squandered it.

130
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Dech! Let go of me!

131
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
If I were you, I would do nothing.

132
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I wouldn't make a scene.

133
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And I would realize

134
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm not as heartless
as the viscount.

135
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The profits from Mueang's fortune,

136
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
we'll each get half.

137
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And don't interfere
with me and Ms. Malai.

138
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Remember that.

139
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What about Saeng?

140
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
How do we deal with him?

141
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What about him?

142
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I believe what he said.

143
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The viscount didn't fall down
the stairs and become paralyzed.

144
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Dech!

145
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Ramphoei!

146
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You bastards, watch me.

147
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll get you to pay for this!

148
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Watch me, Dech.

149
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll tear off your mask!

150
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You traitor!

151
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
My dear viscount.

152
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
My lord.

153
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
He's just a whore.

154
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
No one will listen to him.

155
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Everyone knows

156
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
he was the viscount's
closest servant after you.

157
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If he goes around telling people

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
the viscount didn't
fall down the stairs,

159
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
someone will believe him.

160
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The best thing to do

161
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
is nip the problem in the bud.

162
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Are you gonna kill him?

163
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Of course.

164
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I will never let a thorn in my side

165
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
keep bothering me.

166
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm gonna see the viscount!

167
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Dech.

168
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Ramphoei.

169
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You bastards!

170
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Where's the hell is my boat?

171
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Where's my boat?!

172
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'll get you for this.

173
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Degenerates!

174
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Watch out!

175
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm gonna go in that house

176
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and get all of you for this!

177
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Even though he's a thorn,

178
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
he's not powerful enough
to warrant getting killed.

179
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'll never hurt anyone
more than necessary.

180
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You won't but I will.

181
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't wanna lock the stable
after the horse has bolted.

182
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
This way the both of us

183
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
won't have to be worried
if someone will suspect us.

184
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Don't use me as an excuse.

185
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You're doing this
because he exposed you today.

186
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Whatever the reason is,

187
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
we both will benefit from it.

188
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Because we have shared a bed.

189
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Ms. Ramphoei!

190
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Dech.

191
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Keep your voice down.

192
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Because no matter
how much you protest,

193
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
there's no use.

194
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Because I already
made my decision.

195
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You bastards conspired.

196
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Conspired to have me kicked out!

197
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'll kill you!

198
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Why don't we
get rid of Ms. Ramphoei?

199
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We can't. Saeng just died.

200
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Don't worry.

201
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I won't let Ms. Ramphoei
be the only one with the power.

Ramphoei.

208
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Dech.

209
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You.

210
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I...

211
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Does that feel good, my lord?

212
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yes.

213
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How do you like it here?

214
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Like I was reborn, my lord.

215
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Good.

216
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Behave now that you live here.

217
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
If you don't bring me
problems or discomfort,

218
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'll always take good care of you.
Would you like that?

219
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yes, my lord.

220
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I promise to be faithful

221
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and obey all your orders.

222
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'll serve you
for the rest of my life.

223
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Hey, it's that drunkard.

224
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What's that? What's in his hand?

225
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Take a look.

226
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What's that?

227
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What's that, officer? I wanna know.

228
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's a picture of two people.

229
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Excuse us. Let us in.

230
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Goodness.

231
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Saeng!

232
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's really Saeng, honey.

233
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
This is getting out of hand.

234
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I know.

235
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I didn't expect it to come to this.

236
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Let's hurry home.

237
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Or we'll be in trouble. Let's go.

238
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes.

239
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I didn't think Ramphoei
would do what you told us.

240
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Saeng got stabbed to death.

241
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Will our lives really be
in Ramphoei's hands?

242
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't like this either.

243
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What she did...

244
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
it's tricky to respond.

245
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Because she knows a lot.

246
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And she has Outlaw Phoem
on her side.

247
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Why don't we
get rid of Ms. Ramphoei?

248
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
We can't.

249
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Saeng just died.

250
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
If another person
related to this house dies,

251
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
it'll look suspicious.

252
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Ms. Ramphoei
probably realized this

253
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
so she had Outlaw Phoem do it.

254
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
She had Saeng killed
so he wouldn't blab.

255
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And she twisted our arms
to not be able to hurt her.

256
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Killing two birds with one stone.

257
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So what do we do?

258
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We can't do this.
We can't do that.

259
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I thought without the viscount,
I'd have a less stressful life.

260
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
But what's this?
I know only worries.

261
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Don't worry.

262
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I won't let Ms. Ramphoei
be the only one with the power.

263
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Let us know if we can help.

264
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Dech, we're in the same boat now.

265
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Thanks a lot, Kam.

266
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Why don't we
get rid of Ms. Ramphoei?

267
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We can't. Saeng just died.

268
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Don't worry.

269
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I won't let Ms. Ramphoei
be the only one with the power.

272
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Please have some, my lord.

273
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So you'll recover quickly.

274
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
My lord!

275
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Why did you do that?
You got it all over her!

276
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's okay, Fueang.

277
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Fueang, get me some water.

278
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Yes, ma'am.

279
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Here, Ms. Malai.

280
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Thanks.

281
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Have some water, my lord.

282
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Ms. Malai, get up! He peed!

283
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The bed is soaked!

284
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You don't have to yell, Fueang.

285
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
He didn't mean to.

286
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
This is what being paralyzed is.

287
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It was like this
when I took care of Bu-nga.

288
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Get me some warm water
and clean cloth.

289
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'll wipe him down
and change his clothes.

290
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yes, ma'am.

291
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's okay, my lord.

292
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'll have someone change the sheets

293
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and sun dry them.

294
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Let's get back to your meal.

295
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You don't actually have to
tend to him like that.

296
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It should have been
Ms. Ramphoei's duty.

297
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Let her tend to her child.

298
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
If she tends to His Lordship,

299
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I suspect his condition
will only get worse.

300
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That would be great.

301
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It'd serve him right
for what he did to others.

302
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I really don't understand

303
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
why you're taking care of him

304
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
when he went out of his way
to have you killed.

305
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Even since my return, it seems
to me you hate him a great deal.

306
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Can you tell me

307
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
how he hurt you?

308
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
In case I can help.

309
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Why is he left alone like this?

310
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's okay, darling. I got you.

311
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm here.

312
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
He won't stop crying.

313
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
My goodness, he must be hungry.

314
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Fueang, get Uan to nurse him.

315
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Yes, ma'am.

316
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I got you.

317
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm here, darling.
I'm here, darling.

318
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What now, Chaem?

319
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm not Chaem, Ramphoei.

320
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
What do you want with me?

321
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You can't raise
your child half-heartedly.

322
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Why can't I, ma'am?

323
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Since I already have
Uan to nurse him.

324
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But you left him cry all alone.

325
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
What would you do
if I didn't find him

326
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and he fell and hurt himself?

327
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Not a thing, ma'am.

328
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You found him just in time.

329
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Nothing happened.

330
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Ramphoei!

331
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That's your child.

332
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
How could you say
such heartless thing?

333
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
If you want to raise him
as your own, be my guest.

334
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I won't stop you.

335
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Because I'm busy as it is.

336
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I don't have time to coddle him.

337
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Busy with what? Huh?

338
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I don't see you
take on anything serious.

339
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Even since His Lordship
became paralyzed,

340
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I haven't seen you visit him.

341
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Why would I do that?

342
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
There are plays I have to attend.

343
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
There are many things to buy
from foreign shopping malls.

344
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And there is so much jewelry

345
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I haven't bought yet.

346
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Money is there to spend.

347
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It'll be a shame to just save it.

348
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Someone like you

349
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
will always be a lowlife.

350
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Now that you've returned
to this house,

351
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
feel free to oversee everything.

352
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But I'm not as dumb as you are.

353
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Meddling in things
and acting like a saint.

354
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Getting nothing in return

355
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and trouble for yourself.

356
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It was my fault
to expect more from you.

357
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You don't possess even
an ounce of conscience.

358
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm glad you're not raising him.

359
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Because if you are,

360
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
he will grow up without
knowing right from wrong.

361
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Go ahead and enjoy your plays.

362
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Feel free to squander
your son's fortune in a day or two.

363
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I won't stop you.

364
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Darling.

365
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Who do you belong to?

366
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Hm?

367
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Who do you belong to?

368
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Who do you belong to?

369
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Hm?

370
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Who do you belong to? Hm?

371
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It's you. Quiet as a mouse.

372
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I saw you play with Mr. Mueang.

373
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I didn't want to interrupt.

374
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You wouldn't.

375
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
He was just nursed. He's full.

376
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Wanna hold him?

377
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Uh...

378
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Give it a try.

379
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yes, ma'am.

380
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Here we go.

381
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Look.

382
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Look.

383
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Look.

384
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Look.

385
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
There, there.

386
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
There, there, Mr. Mueang.

387
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You're so adorable, Mr. Mueang.

388
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Peekaboo, peekaboo.
Mr. Mueang, sir.

389
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Mr. Mueang, sir.

390
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
With the viscount's son,

391
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
you have it this bad.

392
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
If you have your own children,

393
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
how much would you love them?

394
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
If you want to find out,

395
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
have a child with me.

396
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Dech.

397
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You always come back
to this subject.

398
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Peekaboo.

399
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Are you gonna fall?

400
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Peekaboo.

401
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Why don't we
get rid of Ms. Ramphoei?

402
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
We can't. Saeng just died.

403
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Don't worry.

404
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I won't let Ms. Ramphoei
be the only one with the power.

406
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

407
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Use it once.
You'll miscarry for sure.

408
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Miscarriage drugs
work after one dose?

409
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Of course.

410
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I've prepared this formula
for so many women.

411
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
It works wonder.

412
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Don't worry.

413
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's worth every penny.

414
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
If I don't miscarry...

415
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You will.

416
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I guarantee it.

417
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Brew and drink it.

418
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
After a while,
you'll start bleeding.

419
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Your belly will hurt some.

420
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
But with a little rest,
you'll be right as rain.

421
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I won't bleed to death?

422
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I wouldn't sell
something so dangerous.

423
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I assure you.

424
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I'm leaving.

425
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What a shame.

426
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I wish he had been born to you.

427
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
He shouldn't have come
from the wrong womb.

428
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
We can't compete
on luck and fortune

429
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
any more than
we can choose our parents.

430
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I mean it.

431
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Take me for example.

432
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I was born to a noble family,

433
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
but only to my father's mistress.

434
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Plus I was born a girl.

435
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Neglected by my father.

436
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
After my mother died,

437
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I was sent to the palace.

438
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
But everyone in my family

439
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
treated me like I was a burden.

440
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
But it's my conviction

441
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
if I have children,

442
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I will raise them
with love and care.

443
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I'll be a good mother.

444
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'll be what I didn't have.

445
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Fueang!

446
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Fueang!

447
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
What happened?!

448
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I couldn't do it.

449
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Are you all right?

450
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I couldn't do it.

451
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I really couldn't do it.

452
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I knew how depraved he could be,

453
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
but I didn't expect this.

454
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's in the past.

455
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It's no use yelling about it now.

456
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It was all my fault

457
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
you fell victim to this atrocity.

458
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Don't blame yourself.

459
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Please don't blame yourself.

460
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Forget it.

461
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's nothing, right?

462
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It's not nothing, Fueang!

463
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
The viscount raped you!

464
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
You weren't there.

465
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
You weren't there.

466
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You weren't there!

467
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
You weren't there.

468
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Where were you?

469
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I'm sorry, Fueang.

470
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I didn't mean to.

471
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I promise.

472
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
From now on,

473
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'll take good care of you both.

474
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Don't worry.

475
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You son of a bitch.

476
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Fueang is like my sister

477
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
but you didn't spare her.

478
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
How could you do that
just to get back at me?

479
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You're truly an abomination.

480
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You shouldn't have been born.

481
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I once regretted doing this to you

482
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
because you'd fostered me.

483
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
But today I've realized

484
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
my actions were justified.

485
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
An animal like you

486
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
deserves this suffering
as punishment.

487
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Thank you very much,
Count and Countess,

488
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
for giving us information.

489
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
We just were just talking to him.

490
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Saeng ran off when he found out
the viscount had fallen ill.

491
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Who knew we'd never see him again.

492
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It's like how people say...

493
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
life is unpredictable.

494
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
As I told you,

495
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Saeng went to see Dech at the house.

496
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Probably angry with Dech

497
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
for letting the viscount
fall and become paralyzed.

498
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You can recheck with
the people at the house

499
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
if Saeng had seen
someone else before he died.

500
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I will.

501
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Let me know what you find out.

502
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
At least Saeng was
the viscount's servant.

503
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Though we weren't close,
we crossed paths.

504
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I will.

505
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So I'll take leave and go to
the Dark Shadow House.

506
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Please.

507
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You suspect Dech had a hand
in Saeng's death?

508
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It's just a hypothesis.

509
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I've known Dech for over a decade.

510
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
He doesn't seem heartless.

511
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Not enough to kill someone.

512
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
We don't know

513
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
if Saeng went there
and got into a fight with Dech.

514
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Aren't you curious, Ranchuan,

515
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
after the viscount had
gotten my father's fortune,

516
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
he fell ill.

517
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And now Saeng is dead.

518
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
You're right, my lord.

519
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm worried more people will die.

520
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Why would you think that?

521
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Think about it, Ranchuan.

522
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
How considerable
is my father's fortune?

523
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Whoever gets it
will be set for life.

524
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You're right.

525
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It's like how they say...

526
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
all is fair in money.

527
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Your father's fortune

528
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
has become a bloody inheritance.

529
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It's so sour. How can you eat it?

530
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
You know
what pregnant women crave.

531
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I'm sorry.

532
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
It's okay.

533
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I get it.

534
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Dech!

535
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Dech!

536
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Dech!

537
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Dech!

538
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
We're screwed.

539
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
What's going on?

540
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
The police.

541
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Metropolitan police
are here for you.

542
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Dech!

543
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Why are you looking for Dech here?

544
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Why can't I look for him
at this hour

545
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
when Dech and I have shared a bed?

546
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
