"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 11)

19
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:01,316
Why do you like Dech so much

20
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:03,944
that you let him sleep
with Ms. Malai, your wife?

21
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,118
I know now

22
00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:08,497
what's going on.

23
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:10,431
I'll reward you handsomely.

24
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,497
Bu-nga, you bitch!

25
00:02:13,743 --> 00:02:16,843
Malai, I don't want you
to socialize with her again!

26
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:19,229
And tonight
you must sleep with Dech.

27
00:02:19,283 --> 00:02:20,510
I'm not asking you.

28
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:21,803
This is an order!

29
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:22,989
Watch out!

30
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,603
Or are you worried
people will question

31
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,511
how Dech get into
Ms. Malai's chamber?

32
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:32,757
Why did you have to
get her physically hurt?

33
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:34,914
What do you want from me?

34
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:36,808
Take me instead of Dech, my lord.

35
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:41,854
We're traveled to the sea.

36
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:43,994
Won't you go take a walk

37
00:02:44,427 --> 00:02:45,427
or…

38
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:47,061
play in the water?

39
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:49,265
I'm not in the mood to frolic.

40
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:51,289
We all know why we're here.

41
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:52,834
It's just one night.

42
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,977
Don't overthink it.

43
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,823
Think of it as
helping yourself and me.

44
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:03,229
Yes, my lord.

45
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:43,237
Dech.

46
00:03:46,364 --> 00:03:48,863
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

47
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:52,664
This hurts me more than anyone
but I have to do it.

48
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:54,071
My lord…

49
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,747
Do it for me, please.

50
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:33,660
You must get it done tonight, Dech.

51
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,766
But this will hurt
Ms. Malai even more.

52
00:04:37,504 --> 00:04:39,271
I heard what Malai said earlier.

53
00:04:39,524 --> 00:04:41,031
She knows what she has to do.

54
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:42,490
It's you I don't get.

55
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:44,478
Or are you going to disobey me?

56
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,235
I asked you to do this for me.
Can't you do it?

57
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:48,770
That's not it, my lord.

58
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:52,104
I just don't want
to force myself on anyone.

59
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:53,370
You're not.

60
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:55,070
Malai knows what's what.

61
00:04:55,177 --> 00:04:57,596
Although she's not willing,
she knows it must be done.

62
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:00,627
It's you who has to stop resisting.

63
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:02,137
Go, get in there.

64
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:03,630
But it's not right, my lord.

65
00:05:03,697 --> 00:05:04,737
- Go.
- My lord.

66
00:05:04,857 --> 00:05:05,857
Come here.

67
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:07,313
- No, get in there.
- My lord.

68
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:08,183
My lord.

69
00:05:08,997 --> 00:05:09,883
My lord!

70
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:11,510
Let me out, my lord!

71
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:13,145
My lord!

72
00:05:13,156 --> 00:05:14,990
If you and Malai
don't consummate tonight,

73
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,483
I won't let you out.

74
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:17,857
My lord!

75
00:05:18,003 --> 00:05:19,830
Everything must be done tonight.

76
00:05:20,057 --> 00:05:22,840
There's not much time left.
I must have a child.

77
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,950
I'll unlock this door
tomorrow morning.

78
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:33,987
My lord!

79
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
My lord!

80
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:38,820
Do I disgust you, Dech?

81
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,880
You think I want you
to sleep with Malai?

82
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,760
I'm heartbroken too, Dech.

83
00:06:13,023 --> 00:06:14,656
I've been thinking
for a while that…

84
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,640
what you said to me that day,

85
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:22,480
that how much of it is true?

86
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,030
It was actually
the effect of the fever.

87
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:27,000
That's not the case, Ms. Malai.

88
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,920
- I was just…
- Forget it.

89
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:32,203
It's a waste of time talking about it.

90
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:47,200
I'm worried about you, Ms. Malai.

91
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:51,400
I don't want
to force myself on you.

92
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:54,800
If you're not willing,

93
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:56,343
I don't want to force you.

94
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,640
We've talked this enough, Dech.

95
00:07:01,823 --> 00:07:04,880
You heard His Lordship.
He'll never back down.

96
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,110
Thank you.

97
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,760
Thank you very much.

98
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:17,377
For worrying about me.

99
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:22,917
Does that mean…

100
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,943
you're willing, Ms. Malai?

101
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,486
I've decided…

102
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:37,277
I'd do as His Lordship said.

103
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,643
If that's the case…

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,520
may I, ma'am?

105
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:16,197
It must be this house,

106
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,317
the only one with the lights on.

107
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,760
Ramphoei said
there's only a few people.

108
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,547
A piece of cake.

109
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,570
Ms. Malai?

110
00:09:03,163 --> 00:09:06,000
If you're forcing yourself,
let's stop it here.

111
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
If I stop,

112
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,193
His Lordship will force me

113
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,400
to do this again.

114
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,637
Or did you stop because…

115
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:28,843
you don't love me anymore
like you told me.

116
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,280
That's not it, Ms. Malai.

117
00:09:31,763 --> 00:09:33,320
I love you so much

118
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,690
that I don't want to see you…

119
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:37,837
cry and in this much pain.

120
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,330
If you suffer like this,

121
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:48,680
I'd rather suffer in your place.

122
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,440
I won't let His Lordship
hurt your feelings anymore.

123
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:05,800
Dech, what are you doing?

124
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:18,843
You never love anyone but yourself!

125
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,480
- Dech!
- My lord!

126
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:29,683
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

127
00:10:30,136 --> 00:10:34,683
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

128
00:10:41,797 --> 00:10:42,797
Dech!

129
00:10:46,783 --> 00:10:48,517
Dech, why are you out here?

130
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,416
I can't do
what you ordered anymore.

131
00:10:51,577 --> 00:10:54,120
I can't do it no matter
how many times I'll try.

132
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:55,237
But I have to.

133
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,216
Did you forget my kindness?

134
00:10:57,363 --> 00:10:59,480
I'll never forget
your kindness, sir.

135
00:10:59,837 --> 00:11:01,713
But no matter
how deep your kindness goes,

136
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:04,240
you can't force me to rape anyone!

137
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,040
Dech, you dare defy me?!

138
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:09,830
You never love anyone but yourself!

139
00:11:10,073 --> 00:11:11,882
All you do is using
your kindness as leverage.

140
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:13,462
If you loved Ms. Malai
even a little,

141
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,013
this wouldn't have happened.

142
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Stop talking.

143
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:18,314
You fooled Ms. Malai
into a fake marriage

144
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,580
and lied to her, having her take
sedative from the tea every night,

145
00:11:21,591 --> 00:11:23,006
destroying her self-esteem,

146
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,735
letting her think
she failed in her duties,

147
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:28,104
when it's actually you
who's failed in your duties!

148
00:11:28,643 --> 00:11:30,676
Dech, stop talking right now!

149
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:31,863
Why?!

150
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,923
I'm telling the truth.

151
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,277
You're being selfish.

152
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:36,960
You never sympathize.

153
00:11:37,303 --> 00:11:39,920
You can't make a baby,
so you force me and Ms. Malai.

154
00:11:40,297 --> 00:11:42,064
Don't you feel bad at all?!

155
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,720
- Dech!
- My lord!

156
00:11:48,137 --> 00:11:49,137
Malai.

157
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,777
Is everything Dech said true?

158
00:11:56,997 --> 00:11:58,080
Come on, Malai.

159
00:11:58,503 --> 00:11:59,800
Don't listen to a servant.

160
00:12:00,843 --> 00:12:03,600
It doesn't matter that he's
a servant if it's the truth.

161
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:07,710
If what he said is true,

162
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,040
why did you marry me?

163
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:13,170
Uh, Malai…

164
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,683
You think I'm stupid?!

165
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:18,123
That I can't tell…

166
00:12:19,317 --> 00:12:21,024
who lies and who tells the truth?

167
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:22,777
Malai.

168
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,230
- Ms. Malai! Ms. Malai!
- Hey, Dech! Dech!

169
00:12:26,743 --> 00:12:27,743
- Dech!
- Hey!

170
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,110
Dech!

171
00:12:31,137 --> 00:12:32,544
I'm ordering you to come back!

172
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,630
Dech, come back to me!

173
00:12:34,763 --> 00:12:36,320
I'm ordering you to come back!

174
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:37,997
Dech!

175
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,210
Ms. Malai!

176
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,130
Ms. Malai!

177
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:43,843
Ms. Malai, where are you?!

178
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:46,377
Ms. Malai!

179
00:13:07,677 --> 00:13:08,957
Ms. Malai, where are you?!

180
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:10,557
Ms. Malai!

181
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:12,263
Ms. Malai!

182
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:15,503
Don't resist.

183
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,097
I can't fight my strength.

184
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:19,230
Just die easily.

185
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,890
Ms. Malai!

186
00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:31,863
Dech!

187
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:46,669
Dech!

188
00:13:48,877 --> 00:13:49,877
Dech!

189
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,037
Dech!

190
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,710
Dech.

191
00:14:02,787 --> 00:14:03,974
Are you okay, Ms. Malai?

192
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:06,534
I should be asking you.
Does that hurt badly?

193
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,053
Not at all, ma'am.

194
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,400
And you were
talking all tough, Dech.

195
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,170
Saying it didn't hurt.

196
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:31,073
It clearly does.

197
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,366
Don't tease me, Ms. Malai.

198
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:43,307
You're something else.

199
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:47,613
You'd just regained your health
and now you fought that bandit.

200
00:14:48,507 --> 00:14:50,006
He was hurting you.

201
00:14:50,486 --> 00:14:51,826
How could I not fight him?

202
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:55,652
Yes. Next time if you're hurt again,

203
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:57,998
I won't nurse your wounds.

204
00:14:58,745 --> 00:15:00,684
I'll laugh in your face instead.

205
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:04,999
You won't do that. I know it.

206
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,013
It's pretty late now.

207
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:12,800
I think we should hurry back.

208
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:19,531
I don't want to see His Lordship.

209
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:22,422
At least right now.

210
00:15:23,678 --> 00:15:27,528
I didn't mean for you
to be at odds with him.

211
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:30,578
I just didn't want him

212
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:32,958
to take advantage of you
and force you anymore.

213
00:15:45,787 --> 00:15:46,787
Dech!

214
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:49,267
Can you hear me?!

215
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,840
Dech!

216
00:15:53,214 --> 00:15:54,214
Dech!

217
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,740
Can you hear me?!

218
00:15:57,395 --> 00:15:58,675
Come back to me!

219
00:15:59,728 --> 00:16:00,728
Dech!

220
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,280
I didn't know
there were fireflies here.

221
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,329
I knew there were fireflies here
like at the Dark Shadow House

222
00:16:29,593 --> 00:16:31,661
when I came here last time
with His Lordship.

223
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:36,811
Seeing them is comforting.

224
00:16:39,284 --> 00:16:40,324
You're right.

225
00:16:40,757 --> 00:16:41,757
Fireflies…

226
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:44,417
are as beautiful as if the stars

227
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:47,264
came down
and shined for us up close.

228
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:54,261
Exactly my thought.

229
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,979
It's like you being
one of those stars

230
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:04,525
that came down
and shined for me up close.

231
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:11,549
Even though I can't get you a star,

232
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:16,498
at least I'll get you a firefly.

233
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:20,352
To put it under your pillow

234
00:17:20,785 --> 00:17:22,585
so you have sweet dreams.

235
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:29,351
What sweet dreams, Dech?

236
00:17:30,785 --> 00:17:34,062
I don't have anything good left
in my life to dream about.

237
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:37,880
But you'll always have me, ma'am.

238
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:40,145
I promise you that

239
00:17:40,516 --> 00:17:42,476
I'll live to protect you

240
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,018
and make you happy.

241
00:18:20,928 --> 00:18:22,305
Trust me, please.

242
00:19:12,908 --> 00:19:14,279
Was that your mother?

243
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,285
Yes. Her name is Fueang.

244
00:19:16,492 --> 00:19:19,685
If you don't want to die,
leave that house alone.

245
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:26,272
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

246
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:31,272
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

247
00:19:46,762 --> 00:19:48,429
You think I wanted this?

248
00:19:50,462 --> 00:19:52,382
To watch you bed a woman?

249
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,784
My heart is broken too, Dech!

250
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:06,987
Dech!

251
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:12,534
Dech!

252
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,940
Dech!

253
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,413
♪ If love ends in vengeance ♪

254
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:30,653
Where are you?!

255
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:35,459
♪ Will you still embrace it? ♪
Dech!

256
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:43,370
♪ If love is gained
in exchange for someone's life ♪

257
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:49,748
♪ Will you still say this love… ♪

258
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:52,022
The love between me and Dech

259
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:54,969
was just the beginning
of the tragedy.

260
00:20:55,891 --> 00:20:58,356
I'll let you go back to the present

261
00:20:58,864 --> 00:21:01,057
and you will encounter people

262
00:21:01,504 --> 00:21:04,331
and a story you wouldn't expect.

263
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:14,266
(1940)

264
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:15,732
Calm down.

265
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:17,652
No need to act
like you saw a ghost.

266
00:21:18,232 --> 00:21:19,232
You?

267
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,465
How did you get here?

268
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:25,006
If I weren't here,
you would have drowned.

269
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,627
I haven't heard a thank you.

270
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:32,937
Thank you.

271
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,106
So what happened?

272
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:36,910
What else?

273
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:39,604
It was all because
you didn't heed my warning.

274
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,389
So I followed you
and saw you fall in the canal.

275
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:43,805
I fell in?!

276
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,030
You did.

277
00:21:45,463 --> 00:21:47,631
Hey, you almost got me killed too.

278
00:21:47,843 --> 00:21:49,744
I had to save you in the dark.

279
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,259
Because the Dark Shadow House's
ghost is very spiteful.

280
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,442
People who had gone in there
either ended up dead or mad.

281
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,810
This is for you.

282
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:28,547
How long are you gonna sit there?

283
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:31,187
Get up, so you can get changed.

284
00:22:31,487 --> 00:22:32,800
Or you'll catch a cold.

285
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:38,998
Dark Shadow House.

286
00:22:41,522 --> 00:22:43,056
Was what I saw real

287
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:44,559
or a dream?

288
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:46,927
Hey, are you coming or not?

289
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:49,015
Or you want me to leave you here?

290
00:22:50,522 --> 00:22:52,057
Yes, I'm coming.

291
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,250
Hurry up.

292
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,716
You're a woman.

293
00:23:05,577 --> 00:23:08,357
What were you thinking bringing
a man home at night, Rerai?

294
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:10,823
What would people say
if they saw you?

295
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,285
- Ow! Ow, Mom!
- So improper. So improper.

296
00:23:13,296 --> 00:23:14,634
You wayward child!

297
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:15,914
Gee, Mom.

298
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,553
Don't just hit me.

299
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:20,845
I saved someone from drowning, Mom.

300
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,390
And if anyone finds out

301
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,101
and asks you, just tell them that.

302
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:29,763
Hey, I made merit
by saving someone's life, Mom.

303
00:23:30,697 --> 00:23:32,160
You have a smart mouth.

304
00:23:32,356 --> 00:23:35,320
You keep arguing with me.
You don't care about seniority.

305
00:23:35,477 --> 00:23:36,640
Gee, Mom.

306
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:38,320
I was telling the truth.

307
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:42,720
Besides, I didn't spend the night
with that guy by myself.

308
00:23:43,283 --> 00:23:45,200
Jon was also there.

309
00:23:45,903 --> 00:23:47,720
Don't just scold me.

310
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,770
I found out from Jon.

311
00:23:50,277 --> 00:23:52,360
If he was robber
trying to rape you,

312
00:23:52,757 --> 00:23:54,197
what would you do, Rerai?

313
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,170
Jon wouldn't be able to help you.

314
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:58,040
My goodness, Mom.

315
00:23:58,473 --> 00:24:01,903
Nothing happened. Don't cross
the bridge till you come to it.

316
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:03,253
Take that.

317
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:05,643
I'm warning you
because I'm worried...

318
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:07,036
Aww.

319
00:24:07,186 --> 00:24:09,773
I know you mean well.

320
00:24:12,593 --> 00:24:13,593
That's good.

321
00:24:15,823 --> 00:24:17,336
I'm gonna go to the temple.

322
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:19,370
Yes. Please don't be long.

323
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,000
- Don't be long, Mom.
- You're such a child.

324
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,240
She looks like
the woman in my dream.

325
00:24:57,673 --> 00:24:58,673
Or...

326
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,480
Hey, what's wrong now?

327
00:25:00,787 --> 00:25:02,160
Was that your mother?

328
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,720
Yes. Why?

329
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,360
What's her name?

330
00:25:07,717 --> 00:25:09,800
Her name is Fueang.
What are you asking?

331
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,377
You seem worried.

332
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,080
Is there anything I can help?

333
00:25:44,353 --> 00:25:47,060
Someone's meddling with
the Dark Shadow House again.

334
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,087
Why were they there?

335
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,760
I don't know yet.

336
00:25:53,737 --> 00:25:55,550
He almost drowned last night.

337
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,360
Fortunately,
Rerai rescued him in time.

338
00:26:02,773 --> 00:26:04,840
I shouldn't have told you that.

339
00:26:06,187 --> 00:26:08,800
I'm troubling you with nonsense.

340
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,580
It's okay.

341
00:26:10,857 --> 00:26:12,440
I can't escape my karma.

342
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,923
I just try not to
create more bad karma.

343
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:32,650
Oh!

344
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,430
Goodness, son.

345
00:26:35,497 --> 00:26:37,010
You appeared so quietly.

346
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
I'm sorry.

347
00:26:40,003 --> 00:26:42,803
It's just that
I have something to ask you.

348
00:26:44,677 --> 00:26:45,677
What's that?

349
00:26:47,303 --> 00:26:49,605
I was wondering
if you know the servant

350
00:26:49,615 --> 00:26:52,103
who used to work
at the Dark Shadow House nearby?

351
00:26:54,203 --> 00:26:56,370
What do you want
to know about that house?

352
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,520
It won't help make things better.

353
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,840
I'm begging you.

354
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,080
My parent died there suddenly.

355
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,360
I need to know about that house.

356
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:09,480
It must have something
to do with my parents' deaths.

357
00:27:11,283 --> 00:27:13,770
Your parents already died.
Don't dig around.

358
00:27:14,316 --> 00:27:15,823
It won't make a difference.

359
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,623
Please, ma'am.

360
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,710
At least tell me if you know Dech,

361
00:27:21,997 --> 00:27:23,960
a servant who used to work there.

362
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,440
Or Viscount Wisan,
the house's owner.

363
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,040
- So I can...
- I don't.

364
00:27:41,603 --> 00:27:43,823
I know nothing. You should leave.

365
00:27:44,757 --> 00:27:46,610
And don't meddle
with that house again.

366
00:27:50,943 --> 00:27:52,263
I'm not going anywhere.

367
00:27:52,743 --> 00:27:55,040
I have to find out the truth
about that house.

368
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:59,000
The killer of my parents must have
something to do with that house.

369
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:01,723
Especially,

370
00:28:02,877 --> 00:28:04,240
the story about Ms. Malai.

371
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,640
If you don't want to die,

372
00:28:12,737 --> 00:28:14,400
leave that house alone.

373
00:28:15,783 --> 00:28:16,783
Especially,

374
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:20,863
the person called Ms. Malai.

375
00:28:23,757 --> 00:28:25,297
That's all I can warn you about.

376
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,960
Her protest proves that it's true.

377
00:28:35,503 --> 00:28:36,750
Even if I have to die,

378
00:28:37,043 --> 00:28:39,320
I will find out
what happened in that house.

379
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:46,320
It can't be true.
It was just a dream.

380
00:28:46,663 --> 00:28:47,880
How can it be true?

381

382
00:28:57,463 --> 00:29:02,010
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

383
00:29:06,397 --> 00:29:07,397
Rerai!

384
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:15,390
Lieutenant Rat,
I'm sorry for being late.

385
00:29:15,663 --> 00:29:16,663
It's because...

386
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,440
that guy walked slow.

387
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,750
Uh...

388
00:29:24,437 --> 00:29:25,437
That's Mai.

389
00:29:26,317 --> 00:29:27,657
Why did he come with you?

390
00:29:28,523 --> 00:29:31,240
It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.

391
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,960
Hey, you're so slow.

392
00:29:34,123 --> 00:29:35,640
I have a lot more to do.

393
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:41,123
Hey, put them down gently.

394
00:29:41,297 --> 00:29:42,617
You'll bruise the vegetables.

395
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,904
We meet again, Lieutenant.

396
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,630
So have you visited
the Dark Shadow House?

397
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,030
Uh...

398
00:29:54,437 --> 00:29:57,080
Let's go to the kitchen.
I'm late as it is.

399
00:29:57,397 --> 00:29:58,910
I can't serve dinner late.

400
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Sure, Rerai.

401
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,440
I'm lucky to eat your food today.

402
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,600
My mom always praises you.

403
00:30:07,017 --> 00:30:08,017
Come.

404
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:09,983
Can I help you?

405
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,770
- Sure...
- No need.

406
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,080
Mai can carry them.
They're so light.

407
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,260
Let's go to the kitchen.

408
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,040
Hey, be gentle.

409
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,360
Where's your man?

410
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,600
Show me some respect.

411
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,800
Lieutenant Rat is not my man.

412
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,760
And I'm no one's woman.

413
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,280
He went to get his mother.

414
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Rerai.

415
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:42,000
It's been a while.
Are you well, Countess?

416
00:31:43,023 --> 00:31:44,470
As well as my age allows.

417
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,650
Thank you for worrying
about an old lady.

418
00:31:47,003 --> 00:31:48,990
Jeez, who's old?

419
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,190
You're still so beautiful
some girls feel ashamed.

420
00:31:54,737 --> 00:31:57,240
You're a flatterer.
No wonder my mom loves you.

421
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,543
She's been complaining nonstop
she wanted to see you.

422
00:32:16,983 --> 00:32:17,983
Young man,

423
00:32:18,963 --> 00:32:20,223
is something bothering you?

424
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,360
Why are you looking
at me like this?

425
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:25,130
Uh...

426
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,280
I apologize.

427
00:32:30,423 --> 00:32:32,663
Hey, why haven't you
greeted her properly?

428
00:32:32,957 --> 00:32:34,170
Do you know who she is?

429
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,280
We've bothered you enough.

430
00:32:43,443 --> 00:32:44,443
So...

431
00:32:44,643 --> 00:32:46,250
we'll let you get back to work.

432
00:32:46,837 --> 00:32:47,837
Sure.

433
00:32:48,397 --> 00:32:49,760
Let's leave, Mom.

434
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:54,480
- I'm gonna go.
- Yes.

435
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,360
Why does he look familiar?

436
00:33:17,777 --> 00:33:19,040
It can't be true.

437
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:21,103
It was just a dream.

438
00:33:21,817 --> 00:33:22,960
How can it be true?

439
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:12,640
What's wrong, Mom? You startled me.

440
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,520
Saeng, have you been following me?

441
00:36:28,877 --> 00:36:32,696
They say a consummated couple
usually care about each other.

442
00:36:32,742 --> 00:36:33,742
