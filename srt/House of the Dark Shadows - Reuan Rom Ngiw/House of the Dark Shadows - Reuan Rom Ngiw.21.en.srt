My lord! My lord, no! My lord!

19
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:11,080
You're just the beginning, Fueang!

20
00:02:11,503 --> 00:02:15,103
Everything he holds dear,
I'll destroy it all.

21
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,560
You bastard!

22
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,843
No matter what,
Dech must come back to me

23
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:23,097
and atone for what he did to me!

24
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,530
If you fail again,

25
00:02:25,243 --> 00:02:26,640
your son will die.

26
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:46,937
Dech!

27
00:02:47,663 --> 00:02:49,000
You startled me.

28
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,710
You didn't make a sound.

29
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,950
You're too easily scared,
Ms. Malai.

30
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:57,120
Who else would be here
but you and me?

31
00:03:00,357 --> 00:03:01,397
You're right.

32
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,970
What's going on?

33
00:03:04,737 --> 00:03:06,200
Why are you being so nice?

34
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,640
I found a way for us to start over.

35
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:11,970
How?

36
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:14,970
I've noticed you're a good cook.

37
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,843
So I figured we'd rent a row house
near the market

38
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:19,280
and sell hot meals.

39
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,650
Is that a good idea?

40
00:03:20,997 --> 00:03:23,010
The market is full of people.

41
00:03:23,523 --> 00:03:25,290
What if someone recognizes me?

42
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,440
I checked it out.

43
00:03:28,203 --> 00:03:31,170
The morning customers
are either the locals

44
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:33,483
or servants of powerful people.

45
00:03:34,343 --> 00:03:36,130
No one will recognize you.

46
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:38,920
It's not impossible.

47
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:42,064
What if the viscount finds out?

48
00:03:42,176 --> 00:03:43,840
He'll never find out.

49
00:03:44,743 --> 00:03:49,080
Besides, I already spent
my life savings on the rent.

50
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,070
Gee, Dech.

51
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,160
You're not mad I took
the liberty of doing that, right?

52
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Not at all.

53
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,760
On the contrary, it's good
you could manage all that.

54
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,743
The idea never occurred to me.

55
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,240
So what food
do you think I should sell?

56
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,800
There are many dishes in my head.

57
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,320
Easy dishes like...

58
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,120
boiled eggs in sweet brown sauce,

59
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,480
spicy and sour soup.

60
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,320
or stir-fried minced pork
with salted fish.

61
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,097
These aren't
your favorite dishes, are they?

62
00:04:28,553 --> 00:04:30,040
Jeez, Ms. Malai.

63
00:04:30,713 --> 00:04:32,680
Even if they're not
my favorite dishes,

64
00:04:33,783 --> 00:04:36,480
everything you make is delicious.

65
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,800
Such a sweet talker.

66
00:04:42,377 --> 00:04:43,377
Ms. Malai.

67
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,080
Thank you very much, Dech.

68
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,280
Thank you for giving me a new life.

69
00:04:58,483 --> 00:04:59,723
Without you,

70
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,600
I don't know if, in this life,

71
00:05:03,663 --> 00:05:07,120
I would ever get to live
the way I wanted to.

72
00:05:15,243 --> 00:05:17,243
I should be thanking you

73
00:05:18,203 --> 00:05:20,703
for giving me courage
to break free from the viscount.

74
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,030
Otherwise, my life would have been dictated
by my debt for the rest of my life.

75
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:59,960
Please make good on your promise
about letting Fueang and me leave.

76
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,733
Are you sure you're leaving
with just Fueang,

77
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,952
and not my wife as well?

78
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:07,852
If you mean
Ms. Malai who is my wife,

79
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:09,526
you understand correctly.

80
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:11,035
Dech!

81
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:51,574
You must swear

82
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:54,940
that you will only have
a physical relationship with Malai.

83
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:58,960
But you must love only me.

84
00:07:01,177 --> 00:07:02,787
I swear that

85
00:07:03,076 --> 00:07:04,076
I will love

86
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:05,843
and be faithful to His Lordship.

87
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:07,937
If one day Dech breaks his promise,

88
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:10,432
he will die with excruciating pain

89
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:12,634
for hurting my feelings.

90
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,423
No matter what,

91
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:20,560
you will keep
your promise to me, Dech.

92
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:23,320
I'll never let you
be happy with anyone

93
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,963
but me.

94
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,640
If our shop thrives,

95
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:54,520
we'll need a couple more helpers.

96
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,120
You're hiring more people
before we open our shop?

97
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,040
I don't mean hired help.

98
00:08:03,307 --> 00:08:04,307
Dech!

99
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,383
You have a dirty mind.

100
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,320
I'm not being dirty.

101
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,557
Just imagine.

102
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:13,600
If we have a couple of kids
running around,

103
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,320
it would be nice.

104
00:08:16,423 --> 00:08:17,823
One boy and one girl?

105
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:23,376
Let's think about it
when our shop is actually thriving.

106
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:28,280
But I want to think about it now.

107
00:08:28,903 --> 00:08:29,903
Dech.

108
00:08:32,557 --> 00:08:33,557
Picture it.

109
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:37,350
If we have a girl,
she will look a lot like you.

110
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,520
She will be so adorable.

111
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,070
If we have a boy...

112
00:08:48,117 --> 00:08:49,600
he'll be reliable like you.

113
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,223
It'd be nice if he's the oldest.

114
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,880
So he'd take care
of his little sister.

115
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,710
I'd raise him to be
nothing like my brother.

116
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,480
I'll help you.

117
00:09:03,863 --> 00:09:06,720
If he picks on his sister,
I'll punish him harshly.

118
00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:10,230
If he hates you

119
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,690
but loves me
and comes to me for comfort,

120
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:14,050
you'll be screwed.

121
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Great.

122
00:09:16,457 --> 00:09:18,837
I'll let you comfort me
about him hating me.

123
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:20,443
Dech!

124
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,720
You always take advantage
for your own benefit.

125
00:09:34,037 --> 00:09:35,080
From now on,

126
00:09:35,883 --> 00:09:37,883
our lives will know only happiness.

127
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:44,056
I'll do everything to make sure
that happens, Ms. Malai.

128
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,950
I'm sorry, Dech.

129
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:42,080
What happened, Dech?

130
00:10:44,163 --> 00:10:46,360
I'm smelling smoke, Ms. Malai.

131
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,380
Fire!

132
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:51,693
Fire!

133
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:55,746
Move, I'm begging you.

134
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:56,947
I'm not moving.

135
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,193
If you're gonna shoot,
kill me along with Ms. Malai.

136
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:01,267
I can't!

137
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:05,980
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

138
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:10,979
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

139
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:13,639
There's fire, Ms. Malai.

140
00:11:14,386 --> 00:11:16,720
How's that possible?
We're the only people here.

141
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:19,320
Let's just leave first, Ms. Malai.

142
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:26,960
Hurry, Ms. Malai.

143
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:39,323
What's going on?

144
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,160
We were fooled.

145
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,040
Who would fool us?

146
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,280
Ms. Malai, watch out!

147
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:17,283
Move.

148
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:27,183
Fueang's here, my lord.

149
00:12:30,357 --> 00:12:31,380
Thanks, Saeng.

150
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,960
Leave us.
I'll call if I need something.

151
00:12:34,397 --> 00:12:35,397
Yes, sir.

152
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:46,920
You had Saeng release me.

153
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:48,880
You're probably thinking...

154
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,790
Kam killed Ms. Malai successfully.

155
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,560
You're really too smart
to be a servant.

156
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:01,509
Let go!

157
00:13:02,077 --> 00:13:03,160
Come here. Don't move!

158
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:06,720
Why are you fighting me?

159
00:13:08,006 --> 00:13:09,723
You responded to me too.

160
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:11,579
Perv!

161
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:14,760
Instead of calling me names,

162
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,503
you should be thanking me

163
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:19,600
for reuniting you and Dech.

164
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,360
Someone like you
will never be loved by anyone.

165
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,543
The more you behave this way,

166
00:13:24,577 --> 00:13:26,470
the more Dech will hate you.

167
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,830
Let him hate me.

168
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:29,600
Because no matter what,

169
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:32,397
I'm the one who owns his life.

170
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,200
He can't refuse me.

171
00:13:34,317 --> 00:13:36,210
There's nowhere for him to run.

172
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,520
Pathetic.

173
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:47,600
You might appear to be
a man who has everything.

174
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:51,400
But your heart is darker
than everything.

175
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:54,516
How can anyone
love someone like that?

176
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:56,103
Fueang!

177
00:13:57,517 --> 00:13:58,720
You crossed the line!

178
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,470
You can't handle me
telling the truth, my lord?

179
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:05,636
You committed so many sins.

180
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:09,470
You've done nothing but evil.
Karma will catch up with you!

181
00:14:09,777 --> 00:14:11,670
-Stop talking, Fueang!
-I won't!

182
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,417
All you do is flex your power.

183
00:14:15,976 --> 00:14:17,123
No compassion.

184
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,080
One day you will die alone

185
00:14:20,597 --> 00:14:22,120
with none who loves you

186
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,320
and all who hate you!

187
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,363
Fueang!

188
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,480
Mark my words, my lord.

189
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:33,860
You will be alone as a homosexual.

190
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:37,000
No one will truly love you.

191
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,280
No matter how much money you have,

192
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,760
you will die a pathetic death!

193
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:44,073
Fueang!

194
00:14:45,153 --> 00:14:46,320
Stop talking!

195
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
Ms. Malai.

196
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:01,287
Ms. Malai.

197
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,206
Dech!

198
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:11,317
Ms. Malai!

199
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:13,183
Are you okay, Ms. Malai?

200
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,750
Don't move.

201
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,133
If you don't want to die.

202
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:23,760
If you're gonna kill Ms. Malai,

203
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,540
you have to kill me first.

204
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,540
Move!

205
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:27,906
I'm not here to kill you.

206
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
I'm not moving.

207
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:31,967
Dech!

208
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:33,930
Dech!

209
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:42,423
Kam!

210
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,120
Why are you doing this?!

211
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,200
It's the viscount's order.
I don't have a choice.

212
00:15:47,383 --> 00:15:48,983
Don't make this harder, Dech!

213
00:15:49,163 --> 00:15:50,796
I ran away this far.

214
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:53,280
Why is he so vindictive toward me?!

215
00:15:53,657 --> 00:15:54,657
I'm sorry.

216
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,017
I don't have a choice.

217
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:58,640
He took Mai hostage.

218
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,737
If I don't kiss Ms. Malai,
he will kill my son!

219
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,890
Dech.

220
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:08,317
Dech!

221
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:18,523
Dech!

222
00:16:23,897 --> 00:16:24,897
-Dech.
-Move!

223
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:30,000
Don't be afraid, Ms. Malai.

224
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:32,664
I won't let him kill you.

225
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,043
I'm the only one
you're here to kill, right?

226
00:16:45,143 --> 00:16:46,143
Ms. Malai?

227
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,080
What are you doing?

228
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,237
If he's here just for me,

229
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,140
I'd rather let him kill me

230
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,360
and let you go.

231
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,680
So it's finally over, Dech.

232
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,917
We have nowhere else to run.

233
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,970
No, Ms. Malai.

234
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,040
-I won't let you.
-But I don't want to run anymore.

235
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,640
I want this to end.

236
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:14,240
Even if we keep running,
he will send someone to kill us.

237
00:17:14,453 --> 00:17:15,553
But I won't let you.

238
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:18,040
If you die, I'll die with you.

239
00:17:20,187 --> 00:17:22,100
Dech! What are you doing?

240
00:17:22,353 --> 00:17:23,353
Dech.

241
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:24,964
Move, I'm begging you.

242
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:26,165
I'm not moving.

243
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:29,496
If you're gonna shoot,
kill me along with Ms. Malai.

244
00:17:29,545 --> 00:17:30,545
I can't!

245
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:32,880
His Lordship wants you back!

246
00:17:34,313 --> 00:17:35,513
Or my son dies!

247
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:40,657
Dech.

248
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,336
Ms. Malai,

249
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:54,696
I'm sorry!

250
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,203
Dech!

251
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,510
Dech!

252
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,850
I said let go!

253
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:28,180
Sounds like you're having fun.

254
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Hello, Father.

255
00:18:34,987 --> 00:18:39,520
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

256
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:44,513
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

257
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,017
I said let go!

258
00:19:14,183 --> 00:19:15,183
Ms. Malai!

259
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:20,440
After the sound of that gunshot,

260
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:22,610
no one could predict

261
00:19:22,943 --> 00:19:24,280
if I lived or died.

262
00:19:25,883 --> 00:19:28,560
I will take you back
to your present

263
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,790
so that you...

264
00:19:30,843 --> 00:19:33,159
get to see something...

265
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,560
unexpected.

266
00:19:52,510 --> 00:20:00,640
(1940)

267
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:05,603
Ms. Malai.

268
00:20:22,836 --> 00:20:23,836
Mai.

269
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:25,493
-Mai.
-Rerai.

270
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:28,079
Mai! Mai!

271
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:29,453
Mai!

272
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,200
Mai? Mai?

273
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:33,659
Mai?

274
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:35,226
-Mai?
-Rerai.

275
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,320
Mai? Mai?

276
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,130
Mai?

277
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Hey!

278
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,330
Are you sure it was Kla's gang?

279
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,630
I'm sure.

280
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,520
I saw his face when I woke up
at the Dark Shadow House.

281
00:21:06,027 --> 00:21:08,080
Why would he take you there?

282
00:21:09,197 --> 00:21:10,384
What's there?

283
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,440
He wanted some ghost
to break my neck.

284
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,910
Because I happened
to be his sworn enemy.

285
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:16,177
Sworn enemy?

286
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,597
You're not joking, right?

287
00:21:18,963 --> 00:21:20,080
I'm not.

288
00:21:20,443 --> 00:21:22,383
I really heard Kla say that.

289
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:25,337
That's crazy.

290
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,583
It's nonsense.

291
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,777
It's ridiculous.
Why would they do that?

292
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,990
It's ridiculous things like this
that make people do bad things.

293
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,010
What do you mean?

294
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:43,920
I mean what I said.

295
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,883
There are only few things
people kill each other over.

296
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:53,720
It's either money...

297
00:21:56,137 --> 00:21:57,137
or women.

298
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,365
Hey.

299
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:07,680
Do you agree

300
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:10,800
if some ghost hasn't
already broken his neck,

301
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:13,377
it must have scared him
into insanity.

302
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,680
Either way,

303
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,280
he's doomed.

304
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:19,570
It'd be crazy if he survived!

305
00:22:27,022 --> 00:22:28,056
What's this?!

306
00:22:29,177 --> 00:22:30,395
What's going on?!

307
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:34,000
What's the hell is this?!

308
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:37,697
Mai survived.

309
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:39,057
But you're doomed.

310
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,410
Yeah?

311
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:54,920
Keep your strength
for the interrogation, Kla!

312
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,383
How the hell did you survive?

313
00:23:05,043 --> 00:23:07,136
I thought some ghost
already broke your neck.

314
00:23:07,783 --> 00:23:09,370
How can ghosts kill people?

315
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:10,527
Nonsense.

316
00:23:10,753 --> 00:23:12,173
People die every day.

317
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:14,593
Wouldn't their ghosts
kill people everywhere?

318
00:23:21,397 --> 00:23:22,640
Move! Let's go!

319
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:31,384
Did he really think
some ghost would kill you?

320
00:23:32,483 --> 00:23:34,840
I met Ms. Malai's ghost
at the Dark Shadow House.

321
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,629
If you don't believe in ghosts,

322
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,333
why would you go there
to rescue me?

323
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:45,046
I went because
I thought it was late.

324
00:23:45,553 --> 00:23:48,240
Ghosts can't kill people
but criminals are real.

325
00:23:50,227 --> 00:23:51,347
Rerai's right.

326
00:23:51,873 --> 00:23:54,240
Living people are
scarier than ghosts.

327
00:23:57,873 --> 00:23:59,300
Sounds like you're having fun.

328
00:24:01,463 --> 00:24:02,463
Hello, Father.

329
00:24:15,457 --> 00:24:16,457
Who's this, Rat?

330
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,840
I've never seen him.

331
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,920
His name is Mai, Father.

332
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,383
Count.

333
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:38,444
Apologies for my bad manners.

334
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:40,563
Count.

335
00:24:40,703 --> 00:24:44,440
How can you call him "Count"?
He's a marquis now.

336
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:46,683
You have to call him "Marquis."

337
00:24:47,017 --> 00:24:48,017
It's okay, Rerai.

338
00:24:49,883 --> 00:24:51,480
Why did you call me "Count"?

339
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,990
Forgive me.

340
00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:55,344
I heard that

341
00:24:55,617 --> 00:24:57,810
you were Viscount Wisan's
older brother.

342
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,010
You knew the viscount, my brother?

343
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:08,040
I didn't expect you to be
the Dark Shadow House's owner.

344
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,520
My parents were killed there.

345
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,600
I'm looking for their murderer.

346
00:25:16,157 --> 00:25:17,197
It's a shame.

347
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,600
If your parents were still alive,

348
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,202
I'd have liked to ask them

349
00:25:21,213 --> 00:25:23,200
about the whereabouts
of Mueang, my nephew.

350
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:25,909
Have you ever heard his name?

351
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:27,423
Never, Marquis.

352
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,607
Too bad.
I'd like to find my nephew

353
00:25:30,967 --> 00:25:32,547
so I can return his inheritance.

354
00:25:32,993 --> 00:25:35,193
He's probably about your age now.

355
00:25:40,397 --> 00:25:43,240
I'm signing this
only for my grandson's sake.

356
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,800
Here, take it.

357
00:25:46,393 --> 00:25:48,020
(I, Marquis Srisombat, aged 75...)

358
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,553
(I'm giving all my fortune
to Wisan's child...)

359
00:25:49,573 --> 00:25:50,940
(Marquis Srisombat)

360
00:25:59,263 --> 00:26:00,837
From the way you talk,

361
00:26:01,023 --> 00:26:02,863
does that mean
Mr. Mueang is missing?

362
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:05,543
Yes.

363
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,880
Many incidents have happened
over the years.

364
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,240
Mueang went missing during them.

365
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:16,080
I'd tried looking for him,
but there were no leads.

366
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,400
So his fortune fell to me.

367
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,440
But it seems like
you're taking good care of it.

368
00:26:21,803 --> 00:26:23,196
No matter how well I've done,

369
00:26:23,477 --> 00:26:25,440
I know full well it's not mine.

370
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,680
It will never make me happy.

371
00:26:28,117 --> 00:26:29,377
That's why I'm asking you

372
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,837
if you know the whereabouts
of Mueang, my nephew.

373
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:34,880
I have no idea, my lord.

374
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,480
If I find a lead,

375
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,680
you'll be the first to know.

376
00:26:43,257 --> 00:26:44,360
I'm counting on you.

377
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:49,597
As for the Dark Shadow House,

378
00:26:49,963 --> 00:26:51,643
if you're uncomfortable to keep it,

379
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,400
I'd like to buy it from you.

380
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:57,320
You can name your price.
I'm willing to pay.

381
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:08,610
Thanks, Mom.

382
00:27:10,283 --> 00:27:12,680
Here. For my room and board.

383
00:27:16,963 --> 00:27:17,963
Take it back.

384
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,804
I already told you
I didn't want it.

385
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,030
Mom.

386
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:24,297
He's living with us.

387
00:27:24,463 --> 00:27:25,640
He has to pay us.

388
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,430
How can he live here for free?

389
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,190
Who said it'd for free?

390
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:32,304
I'm not letting him live here.

391
00:27:33,323 --> 00:27:35,920
You can live here
for as long as you want.

392
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,423
You just have to pay me on time.

393
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:39,839
Rerai!

394
00:27:40,466 --> 00:27:41,839
You never listen to me!

395
00:27:42,593 --> 00:27:45,080
Gee, Mom. He's willing to pay.

396
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:47,844
I don't see
where the harm is in that.

397
00:27:51,357 --> 00:27:52,597
Do whatever you want.

398
00:27:53,017 --> 00:27:55,690
But if something happens,
don't say I didn't warn you.

399
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,357
You no-good child.

400
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,663
Your mom's gonna hate me even more.

401
00:28:08,257 --> 00:28:09,257
Whatever.

402
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:10,289
Wait!

403
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,160
I have another favor to ask.

404
00:28:16,483 --> 00:28:17,483
What now?

405
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,440
If you can take me to the former
servants of the Dark Shadow House,

406
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,290
I'll pay more.

407
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:30,610
But if...

408
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,590
the person I'm taking you to

409
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:34,950
is not the former servant,

410
00:28:35,877 --> 00:28:37,800
but someone related to the house,

411
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,336
does that count?

412
00:28:42,523 --> 00:28:43,523
Who?

413
00:28:48,037 --> 00:28:49,720
Red roses.

414
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,117
Red!

415
00:28:54,517 --> 00:28:55,517
Three.

416
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:58,083
Fly!

417
00:28:58,783 --> 00:29:00,143
Why wouldn't they fly?

418
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:02,190
Why wouldn't they fly?

419
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,130
Malai!

420
00:29:09,297 --> 00:29:10,297
Ms. Bu-nga.

421
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,640
Ms. Bu-nga was viciously attacked.

422
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,560
Been a vegetable for a long time.

423
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,240
She ended up like this when she woke up.

424
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:20,423
Thank goodness
she has a lot of money.

425
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,803
And her relatives didn't wanna sin
by taking advantage of her.

426
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,500
Giving her the rents
she's owed every month.

427
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,323
So she still lives comfortably.

428
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,160
I've brought you snack and tea.

429
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,000
I'll help, Lieutenant Rat.

430
00:29:41,953 --> 00:29:42,993
I'll take it.

431
00:29:48,473 --> 00:29:50,343
-Wow.
-Doesn't it look good?

432
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:52,120
Everything looks good.

433
00:29:53,326 --> 00:29:54,326
I'll feed you.

434
00:29:56,943 --> 00:29:57,943
Yes.

435
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,250
Good?

436
00:30:02,503 --> 00:30:03,840
Very good, Lieutenant Rat.

437
00:30:10,483 --> 00:30:12,496
Hey, where did you get these?

438
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,430
The kitchen.

439
00:30:22,047 --> 00:30:23,047
Beautiful.

440
00:30:23,507 --> 00:30:24,840
Red.

441
00:30:50,237 --> 00:30:52,103
I know what happened to you.

442
00:30:54,077 --> 00:30:55,657
But the viscount passed away.

443
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:58,360
I can't get you justice anymore.

444
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,720
What viscount?

445
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:03,440
Forget it, Ms. Bu-nga,

446
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:06,440
I know you and Ms. Malai
were good friends.

447
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,463
And you loved her a lot.

448
00:31:09,283 --> 00:31:13,863
Even though I don't know
if her spirit killed my parents,

449
00:31:15,729 --> 00:31:17,080
but I think...

450
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,943
her and my parents' deaths

451
00:31:20,536 --> 00:31:22,040
must be connected.

452
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:27,317
Ms. Bu-nga,

453
00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:28,800
let's go have some snack.

454
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:30,337
Beautiful.

455
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,070
Mai!

456
00:31:51,516 --> 00:31:52,330
Ms. Bu-nga!

457
00:31:52,341 --> 00:31:53,110
Help!

458
00:31:53,903 --> 00:31:54,903
Help!

459
00:31:54,928 --> 00:31:55,637
Ms. Bu-nga!

460
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:58,543
You.

461
00:31:58,543 --> 00:31:59,436
Mai?

462
00:31:59,523 --> 00:32:00,296
Mai!

463
00:32:00,307 --> 00:32:01,307
-Ms. Bu-nga!
-Mai!

464
00:32:01,856 --> 00:32:02,856
Ms. Bu-nga!

465
00:32:03,523 --> 00:32:04,523
Ms. Bu-nga!

466
00:32:04,563 --> 00:32:05,760
Lieutenant Rat, help!

467
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:07,109
Lieutenant Rat!

468
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,688
-Ms. Bu-nga, calm down.
-Ms. Bu-nga!

469
00:32:08,699 --> 00:32:10,240
-Ms. Bu-nga, let go.
-Ms. Bu-nga, let go.

470
00:32:10,642 --> 00:32:12,449
-Ms. Bu-nga, let go.
-Ms. Bu-nga! Ms. Bu-nga!

471
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,460
Ms. Bu-nga.

472
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:16,409
Ms. Bu-nga.

473
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:18,816
Ms. Bu-nga, calm down.

474
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:20,063
Ms. Bu-nga.

475
00:32:20,703 --> 00:32:22,043
Ms. Bu-nga, calm down.

476
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,150
Calm down, Ms. Bu-nga.

477
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,284
Ms. Bu-nga, calm down.

478
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,200
Help.

479
00:32:28,817 --> 00:32:29,817
Calm down.

480
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,110
Calm down.

481
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:33,720
Ms. Bu-nga, close your eyes slowly.

482
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,190
Slowly.

483
00:32:35,857 --> 00:32:36,857
Very good.

484
00:32:37,263 --> 00:32:38,400
Deep breath.

485
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,350
Yes.

486
00:32:40,997 --> 00:32:42,197
Breathe slowly.

487
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,920
I didn't do anything wrong.

488
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,940
Why do you have to care

489
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,160
what blabbermouths are talking about

490
00:32:57,953 --> 00:32:59,440
when it's not the truth?!

491
00:33:01,107 --> 00:33:02,107
Rerai!

492
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:08,540
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

493
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:13,533
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

494
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:22,444
Why are you looking at me
like that, Lieutenant Rat?

495
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,477
For as long as I can remember,

496
00:33:25,457 --> 00:33:27,080
Ms. Bu-nga never behaved that way.

497
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:32,083
Yes. No matter how unstable
she was, she never hurt anyone.

498
00:33:32,597 --> 00:33:34,224
I'm probably the lucky one.

499
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,080
I should be asking you

500
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:39,497
if you said or did anything
that justified her attack?

501
00:33:39,943 --> 00:33:40,943
I didn't.

502
00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:42,536
Why are you accusing me?

503
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,523
-It's the truth.
-Enough, please.

504
00:33:44,877 --> 00:33:47,640
Your loud voices
will wake Ms. Bu-nga.

505
00:33:51,136 --> 00:33:52,597
Hey, are you mocking me?

506
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,050
-Yes.
-Huh?

507
00:33:55,023 --> 00:33:56,023
Yes.

508
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,720
Sorry for being too loud.

509
00:34:00,183 --> 00:34:01,183
Mai!

510
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,760
You're good.

511
00:35:34,313 --> 00:35:36,399
I've noticed when your mom fainted.

512
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,200
You handled
Ms. Bu-nga well today too.

513
00:35:40,246 --> 00:35:41,246
Of course.

514
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,400
Despite my appearance,
I intended to study medicine.

515
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,700
Why didn't you?

516
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,186
Well...

517
00:35:47,766 --> 00:35:49,073
My mom wouldn't let me.

518
00:35:49,243 --> 00:35:50,919
That's why I'm saving up for it.

519
00:35:53,113 --> 00:35:54,993
No wonder you're so stingy.

520
00:35:55,233 --> 00:35:57,537
Hey, you always call me stingy.

521
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,506
Of course I am.

522
00:35:59,517 --> 00:36:02,160
I'm not a rich man with
unlimited supply of money like you.

523
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,306
Hey, I didn't mean to offend you.

524
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:07,086
But I'm starting to understand

525
00:36:07,087 --> 00:36:09,794
why your mom doesn't like
when you try to make money.

526
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
That's why.

527
00:36:13,827 --> 00:36:16,250
I don't understand
why she wouldn't let me.

528
00:36:30,577 --> 00:36:31,720
Beautiful fireflies.

529
00:36:37,677 --> 00:36:38,440
Hey.

530
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,000
Don't touch them. They'll die.

531
00:36:41,303 --> 00:36:42,303
They won't.

532
00:36:48,982 --> 00:36:50,400
I said don't touch them.

533
00:37:56,283 --> 00:37:57,440
You no-good child.

534
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,360
Out with a man until dark.

535
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:02,920
I'll lose face if anyone finds out.

536
00:38:03,183 --> 00:38:05,383
Why are you being so unreasonable?

537
00:38:06,123 --> 00:38:07,963
I just went somewhere with Mai.

538
00:38:08,223 --> 00:38:09,803
There's nothing wrong with that.

539
00:38:10,043 --> 00:38:12,310
What do you have to
blow it out of proportion?

540
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,943
You always talk back.

541
00:38:15,723 --> 00:38:17,170
You were out all day with a man.

542
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,920
Getting home late at night.

543
00:38:19,623 --> 00:38:23,200
And then what?
And then what?  And then what?

544
00:38:23,503 --> 00:38:24,283
Huh?!

545
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:26,680
People will call you a slut!

546
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,440
You don't care about that?

547
00:38:29,857 --> 00:38:31,127
I didn't do anything wrong.

548
00:38:31,487 --> 00:38:33,147
Why do you have to care

549
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:35,367
what blabbermouths are talking

550
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,647
when it's not the truth?!

551
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:40,314
Rerai!

552
00:38:46,154 --> 00:38:48,960
But if you want it
to be true, then fine.

553
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:52,956
I'll elope with Mai next time

554
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,400
and won't come back,
so you'll get what you want!

555
00:38:57,637 --> 00:38:58,637
Happy now?

556
00:39:04,497 --> 00:39:05,497
Rerai!

557
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,690
Rerai!

558
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,190
Rerai!

559
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:09,840
Come down here, Rerai!

560
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:36,320
Why don't you
ever understand me, Mom?

561
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,590
Fueang?

562
00:39:52,236 --> 00:39:53,423
It's all your fault!

563
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,520
You turned my daughter against me!

564
00:40:02,197 --> 00:40:03,520
I'm sorry, Fueang.

565
00:40:04,297 --> 00:40:06,324
If there's anything I can do,

566
00:40:06,462 --> 00:40:08,120
-you can...
-Leave this place!

567
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:10,456
The longer you stay here,

568
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:12,676
the more damaged
Rerai's reputation will be.

569
00:40:14,589 --> 00:40:15,960
Don't you get it yet?!

570
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,210
Yes.

571
00:40:20,076 --> 00:40:21,116
I get it now.

572
00:40:24,263 --> 00:40:25,840
I'll return your rent

573
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,840
so we're not indebted to you.

574
00:40:29,297 --> 00:40:30,297
It's okay.

575
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,160
Keep it for Rerai.

576
00:40:35,137 --> 00:40:36,564
I'm gonna pack.

577
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,030
Goodbye.

578
00:40:55,337 --> 00:40:57,680
Hey, hurry up.
Someone might see us.

579
00:41:00,117 --> 00:41:02,237
It's so heavy. How can I hurry?

580
00:41:02,537 --> 00:41:03,920
Hey, go back and take more.

581
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,920
Don't fuss. Hurry up.

582
00:41:09,657 --> 00:41:10,957
It's a sin to steal, son.

583
00:41:13,923 --> 00:41:15,000
Venerable Brother.

584
00:41:30,023 --> 00:41:31,600
Let's go. Hurry!

585
00:41:36,117 --> 00:41:37,204
Thieves! Thieves!

586
00:41:37,517 --> 00:41:38,597
Call the police!

587
00:41:38,657 --> 00:41:40,477
Thieves! Thieves! Thieves!

588
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:44,957
Venerable Father!
Venerable Father!

589
00:41:45,123 --> 00:41:46,123
Venerable Father?

590
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,557
Why is Dech still alive?

591
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:55,197
I thought you'd had
a traitor like him killed too.

592
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,960
I'll never hurt Dech.

593
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,423
Mark my words!

594
00:42:02,096 --> 00:42:02,804
Help!

595
00:42:02,957 --> 00:42:04,870
-Tell me or else!
-A guy called Saeng

596
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,003
hired me, my lord.

597
00:42:06,016 --> 00:42:07,016
Saeng!

598
00:42:11,803 --> 00:42:13,485
You think this small
amount of money

599
00:42:13,496 --> 00:42:16,596
can buy my silence about
all the vile acts you committed?!

600
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:17,810
