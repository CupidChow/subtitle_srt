"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 35)

19
00:01:59,544 --> 00:02:01,165
Get in through your head

20
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:02,534
whose slave

21
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:04,371
you are now.

22
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:07,080
Otherwise, I'll tell the police.

23
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:10,080
You can't do whatever
you want for much longer.

24
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,103
Help...

25
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:25,689
You...

26
00:02:29,923 --> 00:02:32,806
No one stands in the way
of our happiness now.

27
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:34,413
Then I have a condition.

28
00:02:34,556 --> 00:02:35,556
What condition?

29
00:02:42,683 --> 00:02:44,280
Whose baby are you?

30
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,230
Peekaboo!

31
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,953
Look at how you play.

32
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:03,266
You're like a kid.

33
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:05,362
Well, I'm playing with a kid.

34
00:03:06,128 --> 00:03:07,128
Peekaboo!

35
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,229
Peekaboo!

36
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:09,309
Young Master.

37
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:11,375
Young Master Mueang, peekaboo!

38
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,473
Hold him carefully, Dech.

39
00:03:18,936 --> 00:03:19,936
Peekaboo!

40
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,242
Young Master Mueang.

41
00:03:22,363 --> 00:03:23,363
Young Master Mueang.

42
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:28,490
Look, look, look.

43
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,790
What are you doing, Dech?

44
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:22,870
I just want to hold
and kiss you as I imagined.

45
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
Is that so wrong?

46
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:27,227
You're taking liberty.

47
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:28,683
I have to.

48
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:30,857
If you leave me again,

49
00:04:31,143 --> 00:04:33,750
I won't know how to beg
your forgiveness again.

50
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,210
But I've been able
to do that every time.

51
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:40,694
You're talking this way.
Does it mean...

52
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,760
there's something else
I don't know?

53
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,010
There's nothing else.

54
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,550
I swear to you.

55
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,810
Enough. Stop making vows.

56
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,737
You're making too many vows.

57
00:04:51,363 --> 00:04:52,363
Yes.

58
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,200
I won't make a vow.

59
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:00,697
Tonight...

60
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,097
let me sleep with you here.

61
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,013
You have your own room
in this house.

62
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:08,494
How can you sleep with me?

63
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:12,833
We'll get in trouble
if other servants find out.

64
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:15,670
No one will find out.

65
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,047
There's only Fueang here.

66
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:19,727
Or Kam and Uan.

67
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,336
They already know

68
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:24,110
how much you and I

69
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:25,286
love each other.

70
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,753
Listen to yourself.

71
00:05:29,187 --> 00:05:31,459
You're shameless
in front of spirits and deities.

72
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,347
What do you say, Ms. Malai?

73
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,450
Are you kicking me out?

74
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,997
Are you kicking me out?

75
00:05:50,623 --> 00:05:51,916
Suit yourself.

76
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,090
I'm going to bed.

77
00:06:30,017 --> 00:06:31,924
May I hold you, Ms. Malai?

78
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,960
I'm gonna kiss your cheeks.

79
00:06:52,603 --> 00:06:54,036
If you don't mind,

80
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,923
let me kiss your lips, please.

81
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:08,143

What's Bu-nga's condition, Doctor?

88
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:01,649
Everything's normal, Ms. Malai.

89
00:08:01,803 --> 00:08:03,320
I just don't know

90
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,920
when she's gonna wake up.

91
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:06,847
There's no way to know?

92
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:08,163
It's hard to say.

93
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:11,913
Ms. Bu-nga might be sleeping
for the rest of her life.

94
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,512
And even if she wakes up,

95
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:15,060
I'm not comfortable to say

96
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:16,660
she'll return to normal.

97
00:08:16,882 --> 00:08:19,126
That's like a living death, Doctor.

98
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:21,013
If that's your verdict,

99
00:08:21,643 --> 00:08:23,053
we have to let it be.

100
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:26,249
You can't catch a break, Bu-nga.

101
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:30,600
Don't lose hope, Ms. Malai.

102
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:34,482
I believe Ms. Bu-nga
won't let herself be in this state.

103
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:37,748
If we take good care of her,
she might wake up.

104
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:46,857
You're right.

105
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:58,500
Try to put her somewhere
with good ventilation.

106
00:08:58,942 --> 00:08:59,942
I will.

107
00:09:01,423 --> 00:09:04,480
Then I'll take my leave, Ms. Malai.

108
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,987
Thank you very much, Dech,

109
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,573
for letting me bring Bu-nga here.

110
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:22,937
It's okay, ma'am.

111
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:26,126
I told you I was willing
to do anything for you.

112
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:28,560
This is nothing, ma'am.

113
00:09:29,022 --> 00:09:31,447
If Bu-nga knows
you're so generous,

114
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:33,526
she must be happy.

115
00:09:34,876 --> 00:09:35,876
Yes, ma'am.

116
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:29,277
Malai.

117
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,143
Bu-nga!

118
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:50,297
Bu-nga!

119
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:54,503
Bu-nga.

120
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:05,867
Why are you so upset
about this, my lord?

121
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,370
How can you expect me
to be indifferent

122
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,853
when you know my nephew
is being raised by that degenerate?

123
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:15,163
You should give up the idea
of taking and raising Mueang.

124
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:18,073
How could you say that?

125
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:22,647
If you're angry about Dech raising
Mueang, that I can understand.

126
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:24,576
But deep down I disagree

127
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,660
with raising Mueang here.

128
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:28,042
Why?

129
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:30,646
Why can't I take Mueang here?

130
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,130
My lord,

131
00:11:32,536 --> 00:11:33,959
please calm down.

132
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:36,340
I don't want to oppose you,

133
00:11:36,603 --> 00:11:38,603
but with our financial status,

134
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:42,393
just raising Rat is hard enough.

135
00:11:42,677 --> 00:11:45,587
If you bring Mueang
here too, I'm afraid...

136
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,403
things will get out of control.

137
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,766
But I don't want Mueang there.

138
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:53,743
I don't know what Dech's up to.

139
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,600
You saw Malai the other day.
How was it?

140
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,594
Nothing much, my lord.

141
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:06,887
But it's strange that

142
00:12:07,156 --> 00:12:09,400
the viscount,
her husband, just died,

143
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:12,147
and Dech was the main suspect.

144
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:16,167
But Malai sided with Dech
and defended him.

145
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:17,920
When you think about it,

146
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,080
it looks suspicious to me, my lord.

147
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,163
You're thinking Malai and Dech
are having an affair?

148
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:26,460
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, my lord.

149
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:29,043
Maybe Malai's just
taking a pity on Dech

150
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:31,153
as the viscount's closest servant.

151
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,700
We don't know for sure what kind
of relationship they have.

152
00:12:36,043 --> 00:12:37,043
I don't think

153
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,296
you should jump to conclusions.

154
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,593
With Malai siding
with Dech like this,

155
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:47,740
to get Mueang here

156
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,570
is probably unlikely.

157
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:15,591
The aroma reached the farm.

158
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:16,973
It made me so hungry

159
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:18,720
I left my chores there.

160
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:20,930
Hey!

161
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:22,030
This is Ms. Malai's.

162
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:23,470
Yours is over there.

163
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,230
Ms. Malai's?

164
00:13:25,797 --> 00:13:26,797
Why is it so much?

165
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:28,263
Can she finish it?

166
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,210
She can.

167
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,140
She eats a lot lately.

168
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:35,434
She even ordered two portions.

169
00:13:36,957 --> 00:13:38,064
I was meaning to ask.

170
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:40,734
Is it for Im, Ms. Bu-nga's servant?

171
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:43,534
We walked past each other
but never really talked.

172
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:44,757
It's not.

173
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,469
Im comes and goes between
here and Ms. Bu-nga's house

174
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,563
because she has to
oversee things there too.

175
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,106
She's not here today.

176
00:13:51,516 --> 00:13:52,516
Hey.

177
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:54,000
Maybe Ms. Malai's pregnant?

178
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,863
Hey.

179
00:13:58,643 --> 00:13:59,643
Nonsense.

180
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,673
It's not nonsense. It's true.

181
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:05,613
Dech already moved into the house.

182
00:14:08,283 --> 00:14:09,993
A man and a woman living alone.

183
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,240
With no one getting in their way.

184
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:14,240
And they're crazy about each other.

185
00:14:14,423 --> 00:14:16,306
It's not strange
for them to have sex.

186
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:17,663
Jeez.

187
00:14:17,943 --> 00:14:19,906
I think it's too soon.

188
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:21,714
The viscount just died.

189
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:24,413
Ms. Malai wouldn't be
so disrespectful.

190
00:14:26,756 --> 00:14:28,700
Ugh, I'm not talking
to you two anymore.

191
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:31,060
I should take the food to her.
She's waiting.

192
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,270
- This is it, right?
- Yes.

193
00:14:40,737 --> 00:14:41,939
You think she's pregnant?

194
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,603
Jeez, what a strange question.

195
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:45,197
She is.

196
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,453
Tell Kam and Uan I'm not pregnant.

197
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:54,976
I thought as much.

198
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:57,306
Your shape looks the same.

199
00:14:57,729 --> 00:14:59,469
Nothing like a pregnant woman.

200
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:02,129
It's probably because...

201
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:03,980
Bu-nga moved here.

202
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,707
It puts my mind at ease
and improves my appetite.

203
00:15:06,964 --> 00:15:07,964
It's possible.

204
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,853
To happy people,
everything tastes good.

205
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,081
And all the troublemakers are gone.

206
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,707
Uh, give it to me, Fueang.

207
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:20,029
I'll bring it into Bu-nga's room
myself so I can watch her.

208
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,091
Oh, it's okay, ma'am.

209
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:22,474
I can bring it in for you.

210
00:15:22,831 --> 00:15:24,781
It's okay. It's nothing.

211
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,001
You're pregnant.

212
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:28,928
Give it here, I'll help.

213
00:15:30,077 --> 00:15:31,794
- Sure.
- Just seeing you carrying it

214
00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:33,800
makes me feel bad.

215
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:35,877
Be careful, Ms. Malai. It's heavy.

216
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:38,278
Go rest. Thanks very much.

217
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:39,289
Yes, ma'am.

218
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:00,133
I'm sorry, Malai,

219
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:03,533
that you have to take care
of the sick like me.

220
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,503
I'm just glad you're better,

221
00:16:10,343 --> 00:16:11,760
moving,

222
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:13,650
and talking.

223
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:18,160
You have no idea

224
00:16:18,763 --> 00:16:20,260
how happy I am

225
00:16:21,036 --> 00:16:22,807
to get my best friend back.

226
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,163
This is nothing.

227
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:30,080
Has anyone found out about me?

228
00:16:32,748 --> 00:16:34,645
No, I haven't told anyone.

229
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:36,068
Not even Dech.

230
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,509
As you requested.

231
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:42,362
So can you tell me now

232
00:16:42,522 --> 00:16:44,261
who attacked you?

233
00:16:53,163 --> 00:16:54,723
Please prepare yourself.

234
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:56,767
I'm telling you this

235
00:16:57,204 --> 00:16:59,394
because you're
the only one I trust.

236
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,583
You can tell me.

237
00:17:05,616 --> 00:17:07,305
With everything I've been through,

238
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:09,240
nothing can be worse than that.

239
00:17:16,323 --> 00:17:17,733
You know how much I love you.

240
00:17:18,183 --> 00:17:19,433
Why don't you love me?

241
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:21,720
But I never loved you that way.

242
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,240
You know that very well.

243
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:26,320
Then what have we been
to one another?

244
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:28,439
I've done it out of obligation

245
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:30,099
to repay your kindness.

246
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:42,054
You're a selfish prick.
You only think of yourself.

247
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:45,081
You're hurting the feelings
of Malai, your own wife.

248
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:47,688
No, I can't call her your wife.

249
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:50,267
Because you never did
your duty as her husband.

250
00:17:51,574 --> 00:17:52,574
My lord!

251
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:54,287
Ms. Bu-nga,

252
00:17:54,753 --> 00:17:55,943
I love Ms. Malai.

253
00:17:55,953 --> 00:17:57,673
I agreed to give
the viscount a child

254
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,407
in exchange for some money
to start over with Ms. Malai.

255
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:07,425
Bu-nga, you bitch!

256
00:18:08,985 --> 00:18:10,268
- Come here!
- My lord!

257
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:12,831
Come here! Get off me! Go!

258
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:13,939
Do it!

259
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:15,819
I'll fight back!

260
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:17,205
Bu-nga!

261
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:18,699
My lord!

262
00:18:19,072 --> 00:18:20,840
Dech, go stall Malai.

263
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,120
I'll deal with this.

264
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:24,639
Malai!

265
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:26,879
My lord!

266
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,656
Bu-nga!

267
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:54,437
- Dech!
- Ms. Bu-nga!

268
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:56,637
My lord.

269
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:11,326
You don't have to make that face.

270
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,377
Dech wasn't the one who attacked me.

271
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,580
And he was the one who asked
the viscount to not hurt me.

272
00:19:17,863 --> 00:19:19,286
Even if he didn't do it,

273
00:19:19,883 --> 00:19:22,727
he was there
when you were attacked.

274
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:24,457
And...

275
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,760
And he didn't tell me about this.

276
00:19:27,216 --> 00:19:28,216
Malai...

277
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,780
I'm sorry.

278
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:31,116
It was my fault.

279
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:32,654
It was all my fault.

280
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,313
You got in trouble because of me.

281
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,843
I'm sorry.

282
00:19:55,743 --> 00:19:58,213
Did you see Ms. Malai
eat all of it by herself?

283
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,253
She ate it in Ms. Bu-nga's room.

284
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,831
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

285
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:15,800
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

286
00:20:28,423 --> 00:20:30,400
Fueang, what happened?

287
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:32,070
Chaem's dead, ma'am.

288
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:33,371
What happened?!

289
00:20:33,737 --> 00:20:35,780
The police came this morning

290
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,827
to say Chaem's body was found
in the ditch by the road.

291
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:43,954
What happened, Fueang?!

292
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,773
His Lordship's dead!

293
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:50,883
His Lordship.

294
00:20:59,663 --> 00:21:00,663
Dech,

295
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:02,597
you didn't kill him, did you?

296
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:06,763
Uan.

297
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:08,317
What are you saying?

298
00:21:08,437 --> 00:21:10,040
How could he do that? Huh?

299
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:12,637
I saw Dech

300
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:14,810
leave the viscount's room
last night.

301
00:21:22,503 --> 00:21:25,256
Uan, what's going on?
Why did you rush here?

302
00:21:25,703 --> 00:21:27,230
Ms. Ramphoei's dead, ma'am.

303
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:30,320
And the police took Dech
to the station.

304
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,870
Why did they take Dech?

305
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:35,076
Ms. Ramphoei's body
was found this morning.

306
00:21:35,683 --> 00:21:36,863
Stabbed to death.

307
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,950
And everyone suspects Dech
right now.

308
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,215
You think the deaths of people
living in the Dark Shadow House

309
00:22:01,226 --> 00:22:02,560
are connected?

310
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:04,550
Doesn't it seem strange?

311
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:06,243
Out of a lot of people,

312
00:22:06,552 --> 00:22:08,529
only those living in my house died.

313
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:11,337
Who do you think did it, Ms. Malai?

314
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:13,940
I don't suspect anyone
in particular.

315
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:16,060
But people in my house

316
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,660
include a baby, a pregnant woman
and a sick person.

317
00:22:18,983 --> 00:22:20,236
I'm just worried

318
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:23,010
if someone's really
targeting people in my house,

319
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:24,756
I'll find a way to protect them.

320
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:28,060
I'm gonna rush this case
for your peace of mind.

321
00:22:28,422 --> 00:22:29,422
Baron.

322
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,870
Uh...

323
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,330
If I...

324
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,387
want to help investigate,

325
00:22:36,763 --> 00:22:38,194
how should I start?

326
00:22:45,243 --> 00:22:48,320
You suspect the viscount
didn't become paralyzed

327
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,506
because of the accident.

328
00:22:49,516 --> 00:22:50,853
Another possibility

329
00:22:51,182 --> 00:22:52,656
is drugs, ma'am.

330
00:22:53,316 --> 00:22:54,480
You mean...

331
00:22:55,096 --> 00:22:56,096
poison, sir?

332
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:59,119
He might have taken
the poison unknowingly

333
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:00,675
which left he paralyzed.

334
00:23:01,014 --> 00:23:04,992
If you discover the poison
that caused his paralysis,

335
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:09,627
it could be major evidence
that someone hurt him on purpose.

336
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:13,303
What did Dech do?

337
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,490
Poi...

338
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,903
(Poisoned)

339
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,503
(Me)

340
00:23:28,997 --> 00:23:30,210
"Dech poisoned me."

341
00:23:40,663 --> 00:23:42,743
Be careful.
Chilies might inflame your hands.

342
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,780
- Worried about me?
- Yes, baby.

343
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:45,869
Watch this.

344
00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:52,080
Honey, put some of it in the pot
after you chopped it.

345
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,090
You got it.

346
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:55,093
Have you seen Ms. Malai?

347
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:56,453
I've looked everywhere.

348
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:59,433
She said she wanted to
make merit at the temple.

349
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:00,929
I just left in the late morning.

350
00:24:01,588 --> 00:24:03,320
Jeez.

351
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,993
You new lovebirds can't
stay away from each other.

352
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:09,082
Reminds me of when we were young
and started dating.

353
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:10,129
Yes, baby.

354
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,280
What are you talking about?
I don't get it.

355
00:24:13,543 --> 00:24:14,543
Hey.

356
00:24:14,777 --> 00:24:16,550
You don't have to be embarrassed.

357
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,733
We're all friends.

358
00:24:19,276 --> 00:24:20,996
Hey, have you thought about it yet?

359
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:22,694
Whether you want a boy or a girl?

360
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:24,357
But I think a girl is better

361
00:24:24,368 --> 00:24:26,231
because she'll be
as pretty as her mother.

362
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:27,717
Nonsense.

363
00:24:28,104 --> 00:24:30,117
Why do you think
Ms. Malai's pregnant?

364
00:24:30,257 --> 00:24:31,257
Jeez.

365
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,680
Ms. Malai asks for
more food every day.

366
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,687
No way she's not pregnant.

367
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:39,173
Your juice is potent indeed.

368
00:24:41,543 --> 00:24:44,004
Did you see Ms. Malai
eat all of it by herself?

369
00:24:47,617 --> 00:24:49,814
Well, Fueang said that

370
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:51,890
she ate it in Ms. Bu-nga's room.

371
00:24:56,937 --> 00:24:57,937
Eh?

372
00:24:58,777 --> 00:24:59,777
Dech!

373
00:24:59,788 --> 00:25:00,788
Dech!

374
00:25:31,183 --> 00:25:32,183
Ms. Bu-nga?

375
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,050
Ms. Bu-nga?

376
00:25:37,517 --> 00:25:38,517
Ms. Bu-nga?

377
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,970
Ms. Bu-nga?

378
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:20,974
If Dech killed everyone

379
00:28:21,064 --> 00:28:22,720
like we both think,

380
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,430
no place is safe, Bu-nga.

383
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:57,659
What are you doing, Dech?

384
00:28:57,939 --> 00:28:58,939
Nothing.

385
00:28:59,146 --> 00:29:01,424
I was just checking in
while you were out.

386
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,987
Thanks a lot, Dech.

387
00:29:14,157 --> 00:29:17,053
If Bu-nga was conscious,
she would be so happy

388
00:29:17,064 --> 00:29:18,787
that you were worried about her.

389
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,670
Yes, ma'am.

390
00:29:20,817 --> 00:29:22,214
You went to make merit?

391
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,854
You didn't invite me.

392
00:29:23,983 --> 00:29:27,107
I knew you were busy
so I didn't want to bother you.

393
00:29:27,743 --> 00:29:28,844
I made merit for you too.

394
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:32,354
We can go together
when you're free next time.

395
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:35,314
- Yes, ma'am.
- Have you been back long?

396
00:29:35,597 --> 00:29:38,517
Come on, let's have some dessert
so you feel refreshed.

397
00:29:39,117 --> 00:29:40,117
Yes, ma'am.

398
00:30:10,786 --> 00:30:12,073
Dear me, Bu-nga.

399
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:15,463
Thanks heavens
you came back in time.

400
00:30:16,493 --> 00:30:19,400
If he pricked my finger,
I wouldn't be able to hold back.

401
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:20,979
This means...

402
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,837
Dech got suspicious about me
asking for more food.

403
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:28,607
I'm so worried about your safety.

404
00:30:29,903 --> 00:30:31,300
What do we do now?

405
00:30:31,657 --> 00:30:34,707
Dech probably doesn't want you
to know what happened.

406
00:30:35,243 --> 00:30:36,986
It's too bad I still can't walk.

407
00:30:37,322 --> 00:30:39,893
It would be safer
if I was back at my house.

408
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:41,029
It wouldn't be.

409
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:43,740
Chaem and Ramphoei
didn't die in the house.

410
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:45,613
If Dech killed everyone

411
00:30:46,369 --> 00:30:48,025
like we both think,

412
00:30:50,422 --> 00:30:52,542
no place is safe, Bu-nga.

413
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,947
If we let him suspect us,

414
00:30:55,263 --> 00:30:57,554
the truth will come out one day.

415
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:01,803
And if you watch me all the time,
it'll look even more suspicious.

416
00:31:06,803 --> 00:31:08,173
Is there any way

417
00:31:08,483 --> 00:31:09,760
that will allow you

418
00:31:10,563 --> 00:31:13,510
to live a normal life
without Dech's interference.

419
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:16,809
Living...

420
00:31:17,356 --> 00:31:18,356
a normal life...

421
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,650
without raising Dech's suspicion?

422
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:27,263
Malai,

423
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,190
I have an idea.

424
00:31:43,697 --> 00:31:44,984
Dech! Fueang!

425
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,783
What's going on, ma'am?

426
00:31:48,237 --> 00:31:49,754
You were calling us so loud.

427
00:31:49,984 --> 00:31:51,547
What's so exciting, ma'am?

428
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:53,127
You're smiling so wide.

429
00:31:53,403 --> 00:31:54,660
It's Bu-nga.

430
00:31:54,904 --> 00:31:56,440
It's Bu-nga.

431
00:31:56,703 --> 00:31:58,040
What's about Ms. Bu-nga?

432
00:31:58,928 --> 00:32:00,186
Bu-nga woke up.

433
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:02,333
Really, ma'am?!

434
00:32:02,735 --> 00:32:04,082
Congratulations, ma'am!

435
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:11,670
Congratulations, ma'am!

436
00:32:40,481 --> 00:32:41,481
Why is Bu-nga...

437
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,401
in this condition?

438
00:32:43,537 --> 00:32:45,514
She suffered a severe head injury.

439
00:32:46,357 --> 00:32:48,330
It must have affected her brain.

440
00:32:48,657 --> 00:32:51,004
Is there a chance
for full recovery?

441
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,707
I'm not sure either.

442
00:32:54,863 --> 00:32:56,594
She was unconscious
for several months.

443
00:32:57,064 --> 00:32:59,654
I don't even know
how long it will take her

444
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:01,377
to learn to walk again.

445
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,581
Poor Ms. Bu-nga.

446
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,314
She's rich in looks and status,

447
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,340
but she's in this condition.

448
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,460
Who was so heartless?

449
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,733
Don't worry, Bu-nga.

450
00:33:22,143 --> 00:33:24,436
I will take care of you
for the rest of my life.

451
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,790
Thanks a lot.

452
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,270
You were very convincing.

453
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,603
Gee, Ms. Malai.

454
00:33:48,876 --> 00:33:49,983
I used to be an actor.

455
00:33:50,516 --> 00:33:51,640
That was nothing.

456
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,421
Do you think people
in the house bought it?

457
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:57,061
I think so.

458
00:33:57,184 --> 00:33:59,594
So you're leaving
for the south right away?

459
00:33:59,816 --> 00:34:00,816
Yes, ma'am.

460
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,672
Luckily I ran into you first.

461
00:34:02,682 --> 00:34:04,330
Now I've got more
money to start over.

462
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:07,080
But you don't have to worry
anyone would find me again.

463
00:34:07,449 --> 00:34:08,449
Thanks a lot.

464
00:34:08,663 --> 00:34:09,893
Have a safe journey.

465
00:34:10,557 --> 00:34:11,557
Thank you, ma'am.

466
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:32,753
Your tummy's getting big.

467
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,449
Why did you bring that up?

468
00:34:35,843 --> 00:34:37,613
You knew I tried to ignore it.

469
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:40,160
I know you didn't want me
to mention it.

470
00:34:40,549 --> 00:34:41,986
But you're not alone anymore.

471
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:44,373
Start being careful
when you grab something.

472
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:46,380
I can still manage.

473
00:34:46,936 --> 00:34:48,687
Don't worry too much.

474
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,434
I'll have Uan replace you.

475
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:53,556
Mm.

00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,960
Can I ask you something?

What's that?

481
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,714
Who got Fueang pregnant?

482
00:35:52,029 --> 00:35:53,960
I've been here for a while.

483
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,403
I haven't seen Fueang's husband.

484
00:36:02,677 --> 00:36:05,124
Am I making you uncomfortable?

485
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,010
Or...

486
00:36:07,597 --> 00:36:08,597
Uh...

487
00:36:09,997 --> 00:36:11,900
It's not what you think.

488
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:14,250
If it wasn't Dech, who was it?

489
00:36:25,037 --> 00:36:26,037
The viscount.

490
00:36:27,037 --> 00:36:29,637
The viscount was
the father of Fueang's baby.

491
00:36:31,477 --> 00:36:32,477
The viscount?

492
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:35,000
How was it possible when he...?

493
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,096
He raped Fueang...

494
00:36:38,423 --> 00:36:40,436
to force her to tell him
our whereabouts

495
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,557
when we ran away together.

496
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:45,930
Poor Fueang.

497
00:36:47,756 --> 00:36:49,260
Who knows about this?

498
00:36:50,529 --> 00:36:52,260
Just Dech and I.

499
00:36:52,523 --> 00:36:53,793
We had to keep it a secret

500
00:36:54,216 --> 00:36:55,906
because if Ramphoei found out,

501
00:36:56,863 --> 00:36:58,960
she'd definitely
try to get rid of Fueang.

502
00:36:59,356 --> 00:37:00,760
But Ramphoei's dead.

503
00:37:00,935 --> 00:37:02,439
Why haven't you told anyone?

504
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:06,153
At least, she'll have
a more comfortable life.

505
00:37:06,449 --> 00:37:09,786
Make up for what he did
with his money.

506
00:37:10,376 --> 00:37:11,486
What happened...

507
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,606
made Fueang despise the viscount.

508
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:16,513
Even though she forgave him,

509
00:37:17,189 --> 00:37:20,907
she insisted she wouldn't let
her child continue his lineage

510
00:37:21,123 --> 00:37:24,940
or have anything to do with
his fortune, not even one penny.

511
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,210
Makes sense.

512
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:28,440
If I were Fueang,

513
00:37:28,975 --> 00:37:30,200
I would do the same.

514
00:37:51,137 --> 00:37:53,754
He might have taken
the poison unknowingly

515
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:55,310
which left he paralyzed.

516
00:37:55,616 --> 00:37:59,594
If you discover the poison
that caused his paralysis,

517
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:04,235
it could be major evidence
that someone hurt him on purpose.

518
00:38:50,343 --> 00:38:51,530
Or it's not in here?

519
00:39:09,823 --> 00:39:11,586
Dech's not in his room, ma'am.

520
00:39:13,722 --> 00:39:14,993
I came for Fueang.

521
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,057
This is Dech's room, ma'am.

522
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:23,060
Oh, I checked Fueang's room
but she wasn't there.

523
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:24,622
Have you seen her?

524
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,440
She's gone to the market.

525
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,714
What did you want us to do?

526
00:39:30,123 --> 00:39:31,547
It's not that important.

527
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:34,053
I'll wait for Fueang to get back.

528
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,083
- Yes, ma'am.
- Excuse me.

529
00:39:43,563 --> 00:39:45,360
That was close, Malai.

530
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,467
And I was being careful.

531
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:50,826
But Uan still found me.

532
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:51,989
But at least,

533
00:39:52,316 --> 00:39:54,413
Dech didn't find you
rummaging his room.

534
00:39:55,216 --> 00:39:58,040
Are you sure about the poison
the baron speculated?

535
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:03,020
I'm not sure
about anything right now.

536
00:40:03,236 --> 00:40:06,033
But if I don't find any evidence,

537
00:40:06,676 --> 00:40:10,597
at least I'll have a peace of mind
that Dech wasn't involved.

538
00:40:13,016 --> 00:40:15,073
I understand how you feel.

539
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,026
So much has happened.

540
00:40:17,322 --> 00:40:19,880
People around you keep dying
like they were nothing.

541
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,706
It's impossible not to suspect Dech.

542
00:40:27,441 --> 00:40:30,560
Yes. I wanna be able to be
with Dech without worries.

543
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,746
That's why I have to prove this.

544
00:40:34,235 --> 00:40:37,919
How can we get
all the servants out of the house?

545
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,502
You're right.

546
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:42,772
But it has to be convincing.

547
00:40:44,902 --> 00:40:45,902
It's so tricky.

548
00:40:47,922 --> 00:40:48,922
Bu-nga?

549
00:40:49,757 --> 00:40:51,117
I figured it out.

550
00:40:56,803 --> 00:40:58,390
I called everyone here today

551
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:00,407
because I found out

552
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,113
there was a fair
at the temple nearby.

553
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:07,082
Bad things happened
in our house almost daily.

554
00:41:07,977 --> 00:41:10,193
I wanted you guys to relax.

555
00:41:17,661 --> 00:41:18,901
What's the money for, ma'am?

556
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,496
I want you to give it
to all the servants.

557
00:41:22,116 --> 00:41:24,523
So they can donate some
and attend the fair.

558
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,800
You're so kind, ma'am.

559
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,980
I'm so happy.

560
00:41:30,216 --> 00:41:32,193
I was dying to see
this likay company.

561
00:41:33,497 --> 00:41:34,694
My handsome actor.

562
00:41:39,577 --> 00:41:40,674
Behave, Uan.

563
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,510
You're jealous?

564
00:41:47,197 --> 00:41:48,474
Join us, ma'am.

565
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:49,717
You go ahead.

566
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,537
So everyone can let loose.

567
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:54,520
I'll stay here
to take care of Bu-nga.

568
00:41:54,669 --> 00:41:57,074
Fueang's getting big.
So she can relax.

569
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:01,030
I can stay here with you.

570
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:02,756
You work harder than anyone.

571
00:42:02,997 --> 00:42:04,714
I'm giving you a day off.

572
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,454
Don't fight me.

573
00:42:07,836 --> 00:42:09,127
Thank you, Ms. Malai.

574
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,111
Everyone, get in line.

575
00:42:19,229 --> 00:42:20,229
Thanks, Dech.

576
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:39,810
