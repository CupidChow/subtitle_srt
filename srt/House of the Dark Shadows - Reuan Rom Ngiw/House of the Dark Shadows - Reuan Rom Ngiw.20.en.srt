18

Did someone find Ms. Bu-nga's body?

19
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,148
Why would you assume Ms. Bu-nga is dead?

20
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:07,157
Serves

21
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:08,182
you

22
00:02:08,207 --> 00:02:09,207
right.

23
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:11,968
"Don't count your chickens

24
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:13,015
before they hatch"!

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,120
- I won't allow!
- My lord!

26
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:16,044
I love you!

27
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:17,068
Dech is mine!

28
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,115
I refuse to let you go!

29
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,796
I listened to the

30
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:22,210
viscount's every order,

31
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:23,898
but everything has changed

32
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:25,647
since you entered my life.

33
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:28,702
If my lord is going to kill Ms. Malai,

34
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,078
I'd rather you kill me.

35
00:02:30,195 --> 00:02:31,398
How dare you have an affair

36
00:02:31,414 --> 00:02:32,625
right under my nose?

37
00:02:36,367 --> 00:02:38,984
You're just asking for death!

38
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:40,832
You're too greedy!

39
00:02:52,828 --> 00:02:54,367
If you plan to kill my sister,

40
00:02:54,392 --> 00:02:55,462
you'll have to go through

41
00:02:55,487 --> 00:02:56,492
my dead body first.

42
00:02:57,953 --> 00:02:58,805
Saeng,

43
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:00,507
why are you just standing there?

44
00:03:00,532 --> 00:03:01,532
Kill him!

45
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:05,102
I...

46
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:07,679
I...

47
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:09,609
I...

48
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,757
Wouldn't it be better

49
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:19,609
if we find a way to negotiate and

50
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:21,901
settle things peacefully, my lord?

51
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,697
Please be careful, my lord.

52
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:35,243
I've been wondering why

53
00:03:35,268 --> 00:03:36,400
you brought me as your wife

54
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,791
but haven't done anything.

55
00:03:38,495 --> 00:03:40,175
In truth, you're a queer.

56
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:41,768
You still

57
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:42,768
dare say that?

58
00:03:42,793 --> 00:03:43,964
You only got pregnant

59
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:45,489
through using the magic love powder.

60
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:46,541
You're not capable of

61
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:47,432
making men fall for you.

62
00:03:47,448 --> 00:03:48,721
How did you find out, my lord?

63
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,065
Saeng has seen all of your schemes.

64
00:03:54,456 --> 00:03:56,002
I've seen it since you used

65
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,588
the frankincense in Dech's room.

66
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:00,893
And what will you do, my lord?

67
00:04:00,918 --> 00:04:01,963
Because you are not

68
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:03,104
able to end me anyway.

69
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:07,057
If anything happens to my sister,

70
00:04:07,284 --> 00:04:08,791
I will come to kill all of you.

71
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:11,174
Don't be arrogant.

72
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:13,541
You managed to sneak in once,

73
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:14,613
but that doesn't mean

74
00:04:14,638 --> 00:04:15,463
you'll have another chance.

75
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:17,205
What's with the big talk?

76
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,783
Just a while ago, you were pale-faced and

77
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,736
trembling like a puppy.

78
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:23,979
Phoem is right, my lord.

79
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:26,089
What will we do now?

80
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,780
I'll share the assets as before.

81
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,780
Just

82
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:36,600
stop meddling with Dech.

83
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:40,467
Save that for Malai.

84
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:42,365
These days, Dech has been looking

85
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,537
for her more than you, his real husband.

86
00:04:47,616 --> 00:04:49,459
Finding Ms. Malai is not that difficult.

87
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:51,998
She probably hasn't gone far.

88
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:53,295
As long as the viscount wishes

89
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,756
to find Ms. Malai, it will be done.

90
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:17,358
I apologize for bringing you along.

91
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,577
It's okay, Malai.

92
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:21,623
How is Bu-nga doing?

93
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,155
I've finished cleaning her.

94
00:05:25,155 --> 00:05:26,544
It took some time because

95
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:28,428
dealing with her bodily functions

96
00:05:28,897 --> 00:05:31,045
required thorough care.

97
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:32,819
This saddens me.

98
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:34,662
She shouldn't have to suffer like this.

99
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:37,475
However, it's fortunate that Bu-nga

100
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,725
has a caring friend like you

101
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,381
to take care of her in this situation.

102
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:42,178
She has made a substantial good deed.

103
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:45,342
Bu-nga has been a great help to me.

104
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:48,967
I want to do whatever I can for her.

105
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:50,905
If only Bu-nga could hear you,

106
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:51,991
she would be pleased.

107
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,171
Let us head back.

108
00:05:55,195 --> 00:05:56,195
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:02,515
What are your plans now, Malai?

110
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:07,311
I wish stay at Count Phichit's residence

111
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:08,359
for another

112
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:10,179
two or three days

113
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:12,928
and then find another place to stay.

114
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:14,811
Another place?

115
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:16,921
Where will you go?

116
00:06:17,304 --> 00:06:19,249
Please don't feel like you are a burden.

117
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:21,171
Stay until you feel comfortable.

118
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:22,827
Count Phichit won't mind.

119
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:26,465
I understand that, ma'am,

120
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:27,765
but...

121
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:29,171
but...

122
00:06:30,671 --> 00:06:31,671
Ms. Malai.

123
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:46,827
Oh,

124
00:06:46,843 --> 00:06:48,140
if I remember correctly,

125
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,936
you are a servant from

126
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:51,288
Viscount Wisan's household, right?

127
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:53,366
Yes, Ms. Ranchaun.

128
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,288
The viscount is concerned

129
00:06:55,312 --> 00:06:56,991
and asked me to find Ms. Malai

130
00:06:57,304 --> 00:06:58,984
and bring her back home.

131
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:00,921
Great, now you don't have to

132
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:02,390
search for a place to stay.

133
00:07:03,163 --> 00:07:04,444
Go back to the viscount

134
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,788
and talk things through.

135
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:07,194
He's even sent a servant

136
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,499
to look for you.

137
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,921
If Ms. Ranchaun doesn't mind,

138
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,233
may I have a word with

139
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:14,585
Ms. Malai for a moment?

140
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:20,537
Go ahead, Malai.

141
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,272
In case the viscount

142
00:07:22,297 --> 00:07:23,514
has a message for you.

143
00:07:24,593 --> 00:07:25,593
Go on.

144
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,382
- Go on.
- This way, please.

145
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:43,772
You don't need to use

146
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,991
the viscount as an excuse.

147
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:47,100
If you have something to say,

148
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,202
say it quickly.

149
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,999
I don't want everything to be

150
00:07:50,023 --> 00:07:51,249
like this, Ms. Malai.

151
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:53,819
If you're here to make an excuse,

152
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:55,381
I don't want to hear it.

153
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:58,538
Please, just listen to me for a moment.

154
00:07:59,757 --> 00:08:02,424
I know I did you wrong,

155
00:08:03,226 --> 00:08:04,506
I lied,

156
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:07,015
and I...

157
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:11,455
And...

158
00:08:11,705 --> 00:08:12,884
Speak up, Dech!

159
00:08:13,298 --> 00:08:14,298
Speak up!

160
00:08:15,588 --> 00:08:16,806
What's done is done.

161
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:18,259
What's the difference now?

162
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:28,728
I physically cheated,

163
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,935
I only did it because of
how much I owe the viscount.

164
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:38,017
I know you can do anything

165
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:39,846
to repay the viscount's kindness.

166
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:43,236
You went as far as sleeping with me

167
00:08:43,268 --> 00:08:45,142
to conceive a child.

168
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,701
I don't know anymore

169
00:08:48,983 --> 00:08:50,442
how much your love

170
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:52,584
for me is genuine

171
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:56,537
since

172
00:08:57,022 --> 00:08:59,556
you can do anything to repay your debt.

173
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:03,191
I've completely repaid

174
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:04,535
the viscount's kindness,

175
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:05,980
and now I'm free.

176
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,121
I now wish to

177
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:12,169
offer my life to you, Ms. Malai.

178
00:09:16,926 --> 00:09:18,286
I don't want it.

179
00:09:19,418 --> 00:09:21,371
I'll do anything for you.

180
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:23,395
If you want me to die

181
00:09:23,903 --> 00:09:25,965
to atone for my mistakes,

182
00:09:26,176 --> 00:09:27,395
I'm willing.

183
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,355
You don't have to be sarcastic.

184
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,199
I'm not being sarcastic.

185
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:33,207
I am out of my wits on how to

186
00:09:33,232 --> 00:09:34,912
make you believe me.

187
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,191
Please grant me another chance

188
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,886
to prove myself to you, Ms. Malai.

189
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,965
Dech, please don't do this.

190
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:55,215
No,

191
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:57,136
if you refuse to forgive me,

192
00:09:57,628 --> 00:09:59,228
I'll stay like this.

193
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,261
Enough, Dech.

194
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,746
Enough, Dech!

195
00:10:04,488 --> 00:10:06,168
If you want me to forgive you,

196
00:10:08,387 --> 00:10:09,738
you have to abandon

197
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:12,777
everything and stay with me.

198
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:31,271
I'm willing to follow you everywhere,

199
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:32,966
be it heaven

200
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:34,849
or hell,

201
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:39,084
I'll never abandon Ms. Malai ever again.

202
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:40,276
My lord, is there anything

203
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:41,362
I can assist you with?

204
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:47,165
How adorable.

205
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:50,438
May I hold him for a moment?

206
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,580
Yes, my lord.

207
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:54,173
Please be careful.

208
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,961
He seems to be quite intelligent.

209
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:06,157
How are you?

210
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,047
Oh, how handsome.

211
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:09,173
My lord...

212
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:12,696
Where are you planning

213
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:14,529
to take him, my lord?

214
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:17,547
I won't take this little one

215
00:12:17,563 --> 00:12:18,735
to do anything bad.

216
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:20,454
Just borrowing him for a bit.

217
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:32,215
Yes, my lord.

218
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,416
My lord! Please bring Mai back, my lord!

219
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:38,793
My lord!

220
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:40,588
How are you?

221
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:42,808
Kam!

222
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:45,847
Kam!

223
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,549
Calm down, Uan, what is it?

224
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:50,565
Please help our little one,

225
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,651
the viscount took him away.

226
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:53,987
What?

227
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:55,776
We have to take back our baby!

228
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:57,127
I don't know what

229
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,557
the viscount plans to do with him.

230
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:00,112
Hurry up and go!

231
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,072
Little one!

232
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:07,582
My lord.

233
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:09,987
Please return the child to us, my lord.

234
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:11,011
Please.

235
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:12,455
What are you all afraid of?

236
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:13,752
I'm just adoring

237
00:13:13,768 --> 00:13:15,073
this little one, that's all.

238
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:16,260
Why are you assuming

239
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:17,299
that I would harm him?

240
00:13:17,526 --> 00:13:19,002
If you're just adoring him,

241
00:13:20,393 --> 00:13:21,893
please return him to us, my lord.

242
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,604
It's almost time for his feeding.

243
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,854
You want him back?

244
00:13:26,151 --> 00:13:28,440
Fine. I'll return your child.

245
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:32,793
After you all have completed

246
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:34,074
the important tasks I assigned.

247
00:13:48,872 --> 00:13:49,770
A gun.

248
00:13:50,223 --> 00:13:51,957
Why are you taking out a gun, my lord?

249
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:53,028
Don't worry.

250
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:54,293
I'm not taking it out to

251
00:13:54,325 --> 00:13:55,308
harm any of you.

252
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,778
Kam, take it.

253
00:13:58,369 --> 00:13:59,845
Why are you giving it to me?

254
00:13:59,877 --> 00:14:00,963
For killing Malai at

255
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:02,439
Count Phichit's house, Kam.

256
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:14,939
Why did my lord have to

257
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,454
send Kam to deal with Ms. Malai?

258
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:18,072
We could have sent that Phoem instead.

259
00:14:18,096 --> 00:14:19,728
Phoem is on Ramphoei's side.

260
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,799
He can't be trusted.

261
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:22,540
I don't know what schemes

262
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:24,017
Ramphoei might be plotting.

263
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,603
It could lead to more trouble.

264
00:14:26,385 --> 00:14:27,425
That's true, my lord.

265
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:29,447
But Kam has been

266
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,650
with this household for a long time.

267
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,705
Now that his son is in my hands,

268
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,017
the less likely they'll dare

269
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:36,087
to defy my orders.

270
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:39,282
And what if Kam fails, my lord?

271
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:40,938
Kam has been to Count Phichit's

272
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:41,875
house often.

273
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,205
If he fails,

274
00:14:43,236 --> 00:14:45,165
he should know the escape routes well.

275
00:14:45,205 --> 00:14:46,470
But with a task as simple

276
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,673
as dealing with one woman,

277
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:49,245
armed with that gun with bullets,

278
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,548
it's unlikely he'll fail.

279
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,242
In all my years, you've rarely

280
00:15:05,258 --> 00:15:07,125
invited us to dine outside.

281
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,414
It's a pity that Ranchaun

282
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:09,547
is not available today.

283
00:15:10,111 --> 00:15:11,375
So, what's the occasion?

284
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,836
We only have each other left

285
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:16,139
as a family, after all.

286
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:17,437
It would be good for us

287
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:18,812
to socialize occasionally.

288
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:21,203
I'm glad you think that way.

289
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:23,133
Speaking of which,

290
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:24,992
Ranchaun told me today that

291
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:28,273
you sent a servant to look for Malai.

292
00:15:28,602 --> 00:15:30,203
Did you two make up already?

293
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:32,651
A husband and wife quarreling

294
00:15:32,676 --> 00:15:33,582
for too long isn't good.

295
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:34,660
You should have

296
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:37,496
informed me about Malai's whereabouts.

297
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:39,543
I had to search for her for a long time.

298
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:42,921
It's my fault.

299
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:45,152
My preoccupation with work

300
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:46,949
made me neglect Malai.

301
00:15:47,371 --> 00:15:48,722
No matter what,

302
00:15:48,785 --> 00:15:50,949
Malai is the wife favored by Father.

303
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:52,925
Now that it has come to this,

304
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:55,129
do not neglect the finances

305
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,824
that Father has allocated for her.

306
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:02,371
If Malai knows that you are concerned,

307
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,075
she would be pleased.

308
00:16:39,738 --> 00:16:41,079
I implore you, Ms. Malai.

309
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:42,774
Please grant me another chance

310
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,470
to prove myself to you, Ms. Malai.

311
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:48,573
Dech, please don't do this.

312
00:16:49,105 --> 00:16:50,308
No,

313
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,035
if you refuse to forgive me,

314
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,660
I'll stay like this.

315
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:55,245
Enough, Dech!

316
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:02,849
If you want me to forgive you,

317
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,091
you have to abandon

318
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:06,319
everything and stay with me.

319
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:09,840
I'm willing to follow you everywhere,

320
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:11,535
be it heaven

321
00:17:12,286 --> 00:17:13,418
or hell,

322
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:15,934
I'll never abandon Ms. Malai ever again.

323
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:49,965
Ms. Ranchaun and Count Phichit

324
00:17:49,989 --> 00:17:51,051
went out for dinner,

325
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:52,097
and they shouldn't have

326
00:17:52,122 --> 00:17:53,254
returned so soon.

327
00:18:58,468 --> 00:19:02,140
No, my lord!

328
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:07,234
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

329
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:12,335
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

330
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:09,793
Dech!

331
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:22,162
Where did Ms. Malai go?

332
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:24,858
Dech!

333
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:28,131
Dech!

334
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,006
What's happening?

335
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:31,498
Why did you come here?

336
00:20:32,116 --> 00:20:33,873
Don't ask right now, Ms. Malai.

337
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:35,021
Just know that you

338
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:36,170
can't stay here anymore.

339
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:37,578
Dech!

340
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:39,827
- Dech!
- Fueang!

341
00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:41,843
How did you get here, Fueang?

342
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:42,873
Ms. Malai....

343
00:20:44,663 --> 00:20:45,732
The viscount has sent

344
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:47,029
someone to kill you.

345
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,428
You have to escape with Dech right now,

346
00:20:49,453 --> 00:20:51,100
or else there's no way you will survive.

347
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:53,217
Kill me?

348
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,021
How did you find out about this?

349
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,905
We have to take back our baby!

350
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:00,256
I don't know what

351
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:01,686
the viscount plans to do with him.

352
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,241
Hurry up and go!

353
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:12,194
Kam, take it.

354
00:21:13,347 --> 00:21:14,823
Why are you giving it to me?

355
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:15,934
For killing Malai at

356
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,410
Count Phichit's house, Kam.

357
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:30,294
Ms. Malai.

358
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,295
Be strong, Ms. Malai.

359
00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:37,678
I never thought the viscount

360
00:21:37,718 --> 00:21:39,287
could be this malicious.

361
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:41,967
Ms. Malai,

362
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,303
hurry and escape, ma'am.

363
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,412
Kam might have found out

364
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:47,748
that you weren't in your room,

365
00:21:48,827 --> 00:21:50,627
and could be on the way here.

366
00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:54,717
Fueang is right. Let's go quickly.

367
00:21:55,303 --> 00:21:56,983
But where do we escape to, Dech?

368
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,014
The viscount's residence in Hua Hin.

369
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:01,803
But that place belongs to the viscount.

370
00:22:01,828 --> 00:22:03,092
Won't he

371
00:22:03,117 --> 00:22:04,797
easily find us there?

372
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,334
The most dangerous place,

373
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,467
is also the safest place, Ms. Malai.

374
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:13,858
Fueang,

375
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:15,855
you should come with us.

376
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:16,792
No,

377
00:22:16,894 --> 00:22:18,628
I've decided to stay here.

378
00:22:18,949 --> 00:22:20,363
I'll be a useless burden

379
00:22:20,387 --> 00:22:21,827
if I go with you.

380
00:22:22,315 --> 00:22:24,620
Hurry, take Ms. Malai and escape.

381
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,214
- But...
- No buts.

382
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,340
Don't try to force me.

383
00:22:35,177 --> 00:22:37,777
When you change your mind, please come.

384
00:22:39,052 --> 00:22:40,317
Thank you,

385
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,458
I'll follow you when I change my mind.

386
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:44,067
For now, hurry up and go.

387
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:45,211
Please, ma'am.

388
00:22:45,513 --> 00:22:46,755
I'll get going, Fueang.

389
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,231
Hurry up and go.

390
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:49,879
Let us go, Ms. Malai.

391
00:22:52,146 --> 00:22:54,692
Please go, ma'am.

392
00:23:01,438 --> 00:23:03,219
I'm can only be your little sister.

393
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:06,937
If I go,

394
00:23:07,727 --> 00:23:10,453
it'll only bring me heartache.

395
00:23:11,946 --> 00:23:13,725
I hope you'll be happy

396
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,498
with the one you love.

397
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,781
Please be happy for me.

398
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,331
You can't even handle this simple task!

399
00:23:42,394 --> 00:23:43,573
- Useless!
- I apologize!

400
00:23:43,738 --> 00:23:44,932
I apologize, my lord.

401
00:23:45,448 --> 00:23:46,815
When I arrived,

402
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:48,370
but Ms. Malai wasn't there.

403
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:50,198
I don't know where she went.

404
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:52,776
Don't make excuses!

405
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,815
You let her escape, didn't you?

406
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:56,198
That's not true, my lord.

407
00:23:56,323 --> 00:23:58,104
My child's life is at stake,

408
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:00,518
I dare not disobey your orders, my lord.

409
00:24:00,736 --> 00:24:02,948
- Kam!
- My lord!

410
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:10,354
It's true, my lord.

411
00:24:11,478 --> 00:24:12,633
How can the servants dare

412
00:24:12,658 --> 00:24:13,846
to defy your orders, my lord?

413
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,175
You have our little one too,

414
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:19,393
please forgive us.

415
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:20,774
Please, my lord.

416
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,776
Please forgive us.

417
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:23,081
Please, my lord.

418
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:27,586
My lord.

419
00:24:27,595 --> 00:24:28,595
What now?

420
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:30,196
Dech is not in his room, my lord.

421
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:31,282
We searched everywhere

422
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:32,358
and couldn't find him.

423
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:34,101
I'm afraid he might have escaped.

424
00:24:37,372 --> 00:24:38,824
Evil woman and vile man!

425
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:41,996
Both of them eloped for sure!

426
00:24:44,223 --> 00:24:45,254
Where is Fueang?

427
00:24:45,536 --> 00:24:46,504
Fueang is working in

428
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,676
the kitchen, my lord.

429
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,278
Good!

430
00:24:55,608 --> 00:24:56,648
Little one...

431
00:25:05,729 --> 00:25:06,931
Which guy are you planning

432
00:25:06,948 --> 00:25:08,056
to use it on, my lord?

433
00:25:08,182 --> 00:25:09,619
That's none of your business.

434
00:25:09,994 --> 00:25:13,470
Geez, I didn't mean to pry, my lord.

435
00:25:14,143 --> 00:25:15,635
I was just concerned that you might

436
00:25:15,658 --> 00:25:17,689
force yourself on someone.

437
00:25:20,658 --> 00:25:23,252
Are there no men who desire you now?

438
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:26,970
I'll never need to

439
00:25:27,267 --> 00:25:29,478
resort to desperate measures like you.

440
00:25:30,158 --> 00:25:31,494
Use your time to become

441
00:25:31,526 --> 00:25:33,127
a suitable mother for the child.

442
00:25:33,252 --> 00:25:34,830
Don't interfere in my affairs.

443
00:25:57,882 --> 00:25:58,882
Oh.

444
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
My lord.

445
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:04,975
My lord, why have you come here?

446
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,428
I think you know why.

447
00:26:09,023 --> 00:26:10,725
Do you know where Dech ran away to?

448
00:26:11,218 --> 00:26:12,749
Did Dech really run away, my lord?

449
00:26:12,774 --> 00:26:14,054
I was not aware.

450
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,538
Don't pretend to be innocent

451
00:26:15,546 --> 00:26:16,491
with me, Fueang.

452
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:17,983
I did no such thing, my lord.

453
00:26:18,008 --> 00:26:19,928
I truly don't know where Dech went.

454
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,076
Fine.

455
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:24,959
You choose to be stubborn

456
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:26,115
with me, Fueang.

457
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,897
What are you doing, my lord?

458
00:26:55,749 --> 00:26:57,124
I know that you and Dech love

459
00:26:57,155 --> 00:26:58,514
each other like siblings.

460
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:00,436
You tell each other everything.

461
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:03,288
Where is he?

462
00:27:10,601 --> 00:27:12,616
This is your last chance to tell me

463
00:27:12,687 --> 00:27:13,887
where Dech went.

464
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:16,350
I don't know, my lord.

465
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:18,811
You're being stubborn!

466
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:20,069
Asking nicely didn't work.

467
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:21,631
Now you'll find out

468
00:27:21,913 --> 00:27:22,928
what consequences

469
00:27:22,953 --> 00:27:24,233
being stubborn with me entails!

470
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:26,944
Please let go, my lord! It hurts!

471
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,100
Please let go!

472
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:37,569
No, my lord!

473
00:27:37,694 --> 00:27:39,811
My lord, release me!

474
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:41,976
Not telling me?

475
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:43,499
No, my lord!

476
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,530
My lord!

477
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:47,929
Please let me go!

478
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:50,280
Let go, my lord!

479
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,061
You're just the beginning, Fueang!

480
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:56,553
Anything he loves,

481
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:58,077
anything important to him,

482
00:27:58,101 --> 00:27:59,163
I will destroy it all.

483
00:27:59,187 --> 00:28:00,413
Absolute scum!

(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

486
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,889
Ms. Malai,

487
00:28:21,757 --> 00:28:23,147
I've brought the outfit.

488
00:28:23,655 --> 00:28:24,855
Thank you, Dech.

489
00:28:24,882 --> 00:28:26,592
It's a commoner outfit,

490
00:28:26,608 --> 00:28:28,358
I'm uncertain if it will fit you.

491
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:30,780
I can wear it just fine.

492
00:28:30,804 --> 00:28:32,004
No need to try.

493
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,889
You can leave it on the table.

494
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,397
I cleaned up a bit earlier.

495
00:28:40,615 --> 00:28:41,748
Cleaning up alone must

496
00:28:41,795 --> 00:28:42,990
be tiring, Ms. Malai.

497
00:28:43,381 --> 00:28:44,741
Please let me take over.

498
00:28:45,435 --> 00:28:48,452
I'm almost done, you don't need to.

499
00:28:49,124 --> 00:28:50,483
But I want to help, really.

500
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:52,834
I said you don't have to.

501
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:55,092
Please attend to something else.

502
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:58,411
But I wish to be with

503
00:28:58,436 --> 00:28:59,787
Ms. Malai all the time.

504
00:29:01,858 --> 00:29:02,858
Excuses.

505
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,670
There are other tasks you could

506
00:29:05,686 --> 00:29:07,725
be attending to in this large house

507
00:29:07,733 --> 00:29:10,045
instead of sticking close to me.

508
00:29:14,238 --> 00:29:16,066
It's not like I've had many chances

509
00:29:16,091 --> 00:29:18,113
to be alone with you like this.

510
00:29:23,811 --> 00:29:25,473
May I stay with you for a while and

511
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:26,855
find delight in your company?

512
00:29:30,192 --> 00:29:31,192
Geez, Dech.

513
00:29:32,684 --> 00:29:33,871

How do I look, Dech?

526
00:30:20,972 --> 00:30:22,198
Absolutely beautiful.

527
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:25,293
Are you sure?

528
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,955
Without a doubt, my Ms. Malai.

529
00:30:26,972 --> 00:30:28,518
looks beautiful and elegant

530
00:30:28,543 --> 00:30:29,846
in whatever she wears.

531
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:32,534
Oh, you and your sweet talk.

532
00:30:33,104 --> 00:30:34,541
I'm speaking the truth.

533
00:30:35,222 --> 00:30:36,198
For me,

534
00:30:36,776 --> 00:30:38,182
Ms. Malai is always the most beautiful.

535
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:41,948
Thank you, Dech.

536
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,260
When I get to live like this,

537
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,409
hearing you say things like this

538
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,846
I can't help but feel like

539
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,143
I'm living in a dream.

540
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,221
You're not dreaming, Ms. Malai.

541
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:00,393
I'm here with you.

542
00:31:06,354 --> 00:31:07,713
That's what I'm afraid of.

543
00:31:08,987 --> 00:31:11,924
Sometimes I feel like my life is cursed.

544
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:16,518
Whenever there's a moment of happiness,

545
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:17,971
I often encounter sorrows

546
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,956
beyond imagination.

547
00:31:21,636 --> 00:31:22,698
So...

548
00:31:30,953 --> 00:31:32,632
Please stop speaking, Ms. Malai.

549
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:35,171
You're not cursed.

550
00:31:36,969 --> 00:31:38,726
We both deserve to live together

551
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:40,111
until we're old.

552
00:31:44,491 --> 00:31:46,171
That would be nice.

553
00:31:46,695 --> 00:31:48,054
It will be like that,

554
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,335
Because I will do everything

555
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:53,539
to make you the happiest woman

556
00:31:53,547 --> 00:31:54,667
in the world.

557
00:31:58,773 --> 00:31:59,773
Dech!

558
00:32:01,117 --> 00:32:02,117
Dech!

559
00:32:07,156 --> 00:32:08,156
Dech!

560
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:11,227
Dech!

561
00:32:11,438 --> 00:32:12,320
Let go!

562
00:32:12,336 --> 00:32:13,336
I refuse.

563
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,140
Dech!

564
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:16,165
I refuse.

565
00:32:56,905 --> 00:32:59,585
(Hua Hin Residence)

566
00:33:05,022 --> 00:33:06,264
Dech, how brave of you.

567
00:33:07,233 --> 00:33:08,834
You dare to escape to my vacation home!

568
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:11,631
Someone like you

569
00:33:13,014 --> 00:33:14,733
will never have a peaceful death!

570
00:33:17,772 --> 00:33:18,772
Hey.

571
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,794
Save your words to curse Dech.

572
00:33:22,116 --> 00:33:24,280
If it weren't for him cheating on me,

573
00:33:24,694 --> 00:33:26,678
I wouldn't even think of touching you

574
00:33:26,803 --> 00:33:28,537
and dirting my own hands.

575
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:31,639
In fact,

576
00:33:31,866 --> 00:33:33,717
if you knew how to use your brain

577
00:33:33,742 --> 00:33:35,694
and be loyal to someone,

578
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,451
your stubbornness might

579
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:40,248
have some good use, Fueang.

580
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:43,381
You're only good at harming others,

581
00:33:43,483 --> 00:33:45,233
no foolish dogs would

582
00:33:45,258 --> 00:33:46,938
pledge loyalty to you!

583
00:33:49,936 --> 00:33:51,225
That's true.

584
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:52,967
But my methods

585
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:56,084
get results. Agree?

586
00:33:59,295 --> 00:34:00,295
Revolting!

587
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:02,490
You can only resort

588
00:34:02,514 --> 00:34:03,631
to underhanded tricks!

589
00:34:03,656 --> 00:34:05,575
Self-serving bias!

590
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,912
Absolute scum!

591
00:34:11,326 --> 00:34:12,944
Dech betrayed me.

592
00:34:13,733 --> 00:34:14,990
Anything he loves,

593
00:34:15,757 --> 00:34:17,287
anything important to him,

594
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:18,990
I will destroy it all.

595
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,701
You're just the beginning, Fueang!

596
00:34:56,632 --> 00:35:00,759
No matter what, Dech
must come back to me!

597
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:04,894
If you fail this time,
your child will be killed.

(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

600
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:17,569
Go to this destination.

601
00:35:18,152 --> 00:35:20,003
This time, you must kill Malai,

602
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,597
and then bring Dech back to me.

603
00:35:24,003 --> 00:35:25,003
But...

604
00:35:25,261 --> 00:35:26,941
Will Dech agree, my lord?

605
00:35:26,996 --> 00:35:28,019
Even if he refuses,

606
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:29,722
you have to make him agree.

607
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:30,737
No matter what,

608
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,136
Dech must come back to me.

609
00:35:32,161 --> 00:35:33,339
Come and settle the score for

610
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:34,409
what he has done to me.

611
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:36,378
Understood, my lord.

612
00:35:36,894 --> 00:35:38,417
If you make another mistake,

613
00:35:38,543 --> 00:35:40,003
your child will die for sure.

614
00:35:40,668 --> 00:35:41,800
Understood, my lord.

615
00:35:46,893 --> 00:35:48,501
You can't escape from me, Dech!

616
00:36:18,684 --> 00:36:19,684
Uan.

617
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,052
Fueang.

618
00:36:21,077 --> 00:36:22,077
Uan.

619
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,676
Please release me.

620
00:36:26,692 --> 00:36:28,067
I only brought food for you,

621
00:36:28,091 --> 00:36:29,559
following the viscount's orders.

622
00:36:30,677 --> 00:36:32,114
No need to follow the orders

623
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,575
of scum like the viscount!

624
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,325
Please let me go!

625
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:37,177
Oh, Fueang,

626
00:36:37,802 --> 00:36:40,700
if I let you go, what will happen to me?

627
00:36:41,512 --> 00:36:43,231
My child is with the viscount.

628
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,810
I can't help you.

629
00:36:45,177 --> 00:36:46,598
If you don't let me go,

630
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,887
I won't be able to help Ms. Malai.

631
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:53,996
Ms. Malai has been good to

632
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:55,426
me and to you.

633
00:36:57,434 --> 00:36:59,082
I want to help Ms. Malai too,

634
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:01,434
but I also have my child to think of.

635
00:37:01,442 --> 00:37:04,962
You know how cruel the viscount is.

636
00:37:05,364 --> 00:37:07,067
My child might die.

637
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,450
Uan.

638
00:37:10,278 --> 00:37:12,345
Ms. Malai is a human being too.

639
00:37:15,273 --> 00:37:17,366
I apologize, but I truly can't help you.

640
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:18,834
Uan!

641
00:37:19,132 --> 00:37:21,545
Uan!

642
00:37:35,263 --> 00:37:37,505
I'm sorry, Dech.

643
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,060
I'm sorry.

644
00:38:01,168 --> 00:38:02,949
You seem so calm, my lord.

645
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:05,222
So unlike one who orders

646
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:07,019
his own man to kill his wife.

647
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:10,355
What are you saying?

648
00:38:13,783 --> 00:38:14,783
Geez,

649
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,790
don't feign ignorance, my lord.

650
00:38:17,454 --> 00:38:20,743
Didn't my lord send Kam to kill

651
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:22,199
Ms. Malai and Dech?

652
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,602
It's none of your business.

653
00:38:28,462 --> 00:38:31,009
How can it not be my business?

654
00:38:31,493 --> 00:38:32,649
After all,

655
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,141
Dech is my husband too.

656
00:38:44,671 --> 00:38:46,311
Dech only followed my orders.

657
00:38:46,648 --> 00:38:47,999
He is not your husband.

658
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,436
Don't meddle with Dech again,

659
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:50,358
or

660
00:38:51,093 --> 00:38:52,538
you get a peaceful death.

661
00:39:08,742 --> 00:39:09,804
If I die,

662
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:12,241
you won't survive either.

663
00:39:18,492 --> 00:39:19,843
Please step aside, I beg you.

664
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:20,859
I refuse.

665
00:39:21,117 --> 00:39:22,265
If you're going to shoot,

666
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,155
shoot me along with Ms. Malai.

667
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:25,179
No!

668
00:39:27,686 --> 00:39:28,913
How rowdy.

669
00:39:29,749 --> 00:39:30,869
Hello, Father.

670
00:39:35,578 --> 00:39:37,085
I didn't do anything wrong!

671
00:39:37,234 --> 00:39:38,914
Why must you care about what

672
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:40,975
those people are spouting

673
00:39:41,898 --> 00:39:43,311
when it's not the truth?

674
00:39:45,054 --> 00:39:46,382
