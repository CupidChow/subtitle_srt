00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:13,376
Please.

183
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:19,137
Dech! Malai!
Come out here, you traitors!

184
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,230
Dech! Malai!

185
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,600
He won't hurt you, right?

186
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,000
Your concern for me

187
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:39,910
gives me courage to face death.

188
00:17:41,283 --> 00:17:42,283
I'm not...

189
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,120
Dech! Malai!

190
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,470
Where the hell are you?!

191
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,430
If something happens to me,

192
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,880
you have to run away.
Don't worry about me.

193
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,377
Promise me.

194
00:17:58,763 --> 00:18:00,443
Promise me, Ms. Malai.

195
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,537
Come out here, you traitors!

196
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:28,807
Dech! Malai!

197
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,367
Come out here, you traitors!

198
00:18:36,177 --> 00:18:37,697
What are you gonna do, my lord?

199
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,400
I'm gonna kill Malai.

200
00:18:42,803 --> 00:18:43,803
I won't let you.

201
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,557
She knows everything now.

202
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:47,130
How can I let her go?!

203
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:51,850
If you're gonna kill Ms. Malai,

204
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:54,230
you'd better kill me first.

205
00:19:02,448 --> 00:19:03,981
Don't think I won't do it, Dech.

206
00:19:25,017 --> 00:19:26,697
whoever thinks evil thoughts,

207
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:27,997
speaks evil of others,

208
00:19:28,403 --> 00:19:29,720
may all those evil things

209
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:31,756
return to that person.

210
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,143
Sadhu!

211
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:35,770
Fueang, you dare curse me?

212
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:40,789
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

213
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:45,781
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

214
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,000
I'll talk her down for you.

215
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:16,480
All I ask is that
you don't kill her.

216
00:20:16,937 --> 00:20:18,080
How do I know

217
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,770
that Malai

218
00:20:20,323 --> 00:20:21,570
won't betray me?

219
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:23,690
You already killed Ms. Bu-nga.

220
00:20:23,877 --> 00:20:25,400
Isn't that a big enough problem?

221
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:29,840
Please don't make
things worse, my lord.

222
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:38,720
Give me the gun, sir.

223
00:20:56,177 --> 00:20:57,177
Ms. Malai?

224
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,470
Ms. Malai?

225
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:03,633
Ms. Malai?

226
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:08,093
Ms. Malai?

227
00:21:10,657 --> 00:21:12,557
I had her hide here, my lord.

228
00:21:37,017 --> 00:21:38,760
Well, did you find Ms. Malai?

229
00:21:39,203 --> 00:21:40,203
No, my lord.

230
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
I checked every room. Nothing.

231
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,160
But she packed a suitcase.

232
00:21:45,977 --> 00:21:47,440
It's still in her room.

233
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Uan and I

234
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,060
checked the garden and the pier.

235
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,360
She wasn't there either.

236
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,543
Is there something wrong, my lord?

237
00:22:00,703 --> 00:22:01,703
Last night

238
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:03,230
I had a fight with her.

239
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,760
Her feelings must be hurt
and she ran off.

240
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,200
Tell the rest of the servant
to look for her.

241
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,050
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

242
00:22:13,357 --> 00:22:14,357
You two,

243
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,120
I'm gonna check her room again
in case you left a note.

244
00:22:18,997 --> 00:22:21,240
I was shocked earlier.
I wasn't thorough.

245
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,063
Uan and I will let the
rest of the servants know.

246
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,190
Okay?

247
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,770
Let's get going.

248
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,880
Ms. Malai.

249
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:35,483
Good
ness.

250
00:22:35,793 --> 00:22:36,793
Ms. Malai.

251
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,000
Why are you people
wasting time looking for her?

252
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:45,880
She must have run off with a man

253
00:22:46,403 --> 00:22:48,305
or gotten hit in the head
and left for dead

254
00:22:48,315 --> 00:22:50,240
in a ditch somewhere
like her friend.

255
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:57,357
Lord Buddha,

256
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:00,183
whoever thinks evil thoughts,

257
00:23:00,502 --> 00:23:01,502
speaks evil of others,

258
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:03,232
may all those evil things

259
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:05,242
return to that person.

260
00:23:05,456 --> 00:23:06,629
Sadhu!

261
00:23:07,203 --> 00:23:09,256
Fueang, you dare curse me?

262
00:23:10,183 --> 00:23:11,720
Watch yourself.

263
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,830
If your master really ran off,

264
00:23:14,483 --> 00:23:16,670
you won't have anyone
protect you anymore!

265
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:18,600
If I don't have a master,

266
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,590
at worst I'd leave this house.

267
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,770
As for those with wicked tongues,

268
00:23:24,383 --> 00:23:25,596
I can't guarantee

269
00:23:26,177 --> 00:23:28,480
they won't be slapped
and bleed from their mouths.

270
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,983
Fueang, you're getting insolent!

271
00:23:33,337 --> 00:23:35,117
Come back here and let me slap you!

272
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:53,520
We looked for her until dawn
without sleeping.

273
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:55,730
And now you're so anxious

274
00:23:55,988 --> 00:23:57,800
you have to go out
and look for her.

275
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,090
Why did you ask
if you already knew?

276
00:24:04,497 --> 00:24:06,084
If it was me who went missing,

277
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,800
would you look for me like this?

278
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,000
Or would you curse me to die?

279
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:12,920
If you went missing,

280
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,210
I would look for you too.

281
00:24:19,923 --> 00:24:21,360
If I couldn't find you,

282
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,710
I would stop looking.

283
00:24:25,057 --> 00:24:26,330
But if it was Ms. Malai,

284
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,160
I would rather die
if I couldn't find her.

285
00:25:33,623 --> 00:25:34,896
Dear me, Malai.

286
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,110
Ms. Ranchuan.

287
00:25:46,257 --> 00:25:47,537
What did you need?

288
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,337
The servants told me

289
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,497
you've been sitting here all day.

290
00:25:55,503 --> 00:25:56,920
So I came to check on you.

291
00:25:57,737 --> 00:25:59,400
I didn't feel like going anywhere.

292
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,400
The viscount is unbelievable.

293
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:06,480
He's always bringing you problems,

294
00:26:07,037 --> 00:26:09,990
to the point you had to come
to me and the count.

295
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:16,800
But even if you won't tell me,

296
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,960
I can guess the viscount
was the reason.

297
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,217
Please don't blame him.

298
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,150
It...

299
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,760
was my own fault
that I couldn't give him a child.

300
00:26:32,243 --> 00:26:36,600
If that's the case, you have to
go back and confront him

301
00:26:36,983 --> 00:26:38,409
and find a solution.

302
00:26:40,237 --> 00:26:44,070
Malai, I can understand
why you fled here.

303
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,120
But in some issues,

304
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,920
you have to be firm.

305
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:54,623
I won't force you, Malai.

306
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:57,670
The count and I will support you
in everything.

307
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:03,403
Malai,

308
00:27:04,097 --> 00:27:07,041
the money the marquis
promised you in his will,

309
00:27:07,883 --> 00:27:09,160
did you get it?

310
00:27:10,577 --> 00:27:11,910
I don't know yet, ma'am

311
00:27:13,137 --> 00:27:15,990
I don't even know
where we're at in the process.

312
00:27:17,097 --> 00:27:18,097
Goodness.

313
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,160
I'll ask the count for you.

314
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:24,880
Thank you, Ms. Ranchuan.

315
00:27:28,363 --> 00:27:29,363
What?

316
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,083
Malai hasn't received
my father's money

317
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,783
and doesn't know where
they're at in the process?

318
00:27:35,046 --> 00:27:36,046
Yes, my lord.

319
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:39,140
Why do you look
so shocked, my lord?

320
00:27:40,947 --> 00:27:42,840
How can I not, Ranchuan?

321
00:27:43,397 --> 00:27:46,264
Even if this doesn't impact us
directly, but it's worrisome.

322
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,770
Worrisome?

323
00:27:49,183 --> 00:27:50,223
How, my lord?

324
00:27:50,757 --> 00:27:51,757
I don't follow.

325
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,043
Think about it.

326
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:02,036
My father's grandson has someone
like Ramphoei for a mother.

327
00:28:02,503 --> 00:28:04,343
Do you think
she'll give Malai her share?

328
00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:06,600
That's just the first hurdle.

329
00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:08,249
In the future,

330
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:12,642
she might squander all my father's
money and become destitute.

331
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,957
My goodness,
that hasn't occurred to me.

332
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:21,363
But...

333
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,440
what if the viscount refuses?

334
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:29,120
With Malai running off and hiding
here despite being his wife,

335
00:28:29,337 --> 00:28:32,257
I don't dare hope
the viscount would do anything

336
00:28:32,957 --> 00:28:35,480
to a vulgar and greedy
woman like Ramphoei.

337
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:40,590
No matter vile she is,
she gave the viscount a child.

338
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:51,126
Serves you right.

339
00:28:52,993 --> 00:28:55,000
How is it still crumpled
after you ironed it?

340
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,880
You're trying to fool me?!

341
00:28:57,253 --> 00:28:58,253
I ironed it!

342
00:28:58,786 --> 00:29:00,684
You're picking a fight
with me on purpose!

343
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:05,173
-Get off me! Get off me!
-Why would I?

344
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,200
So you can hurt my master?

345
00:29:09,297 --> 00:29:11,664
I said... I said get off me!

346
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,160
Chaem, grab her.

347
00:29:16,343 --> 00:29:17,343
Yes, ma'am.

348
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,830
That's a knife.

349
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,040
If I pick a fight
with you on purpose,

350
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,680
what can you do about it?

351
00:29:25,237 --> 00:29:28,120
Malai, your master isn't here
to protect you anymore.

352
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,680
You still can't rule this house.

353
00:29:30,957 --> 00:29:32,370
You don't have the prestige.

354
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,937
You only pull rank.

355
00:29:34,143 --> 00:29:36,830
I still outrank you.

356
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,397
I can slap you...

357
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,600
as many times...

358
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:45,920
as I want!

359
00:29:52,983 --> 00:29:56,160
You're still not my master!

360
00:29:56,783 --> 00:29:58,110
-Chaem.
-Yes?

361
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,310
Hold her in place.

362
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:01,363
I'm gonna teach her a lesson!

363
00:30:11,957 --> 00:30:14,880
Ms. Ramphoei,
what are you doing here?

364
00:30:21,157 --> 00:30:25,690
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

365
00:30:26,135 --> 00:30:30,682
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

366
00:30:34,443 --> 00:30:36,057
Just run away with me, Fueang.

367
00:30:36,857 --> 00:30:39,280
Or you'll always be
harassed by Ms. Ramphoei.

368
00:30:41,123 --> 00:30:42,956
You speak like you found Ms. Malai.

369
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,737
Even if she's still missing,

370
00:30:49,623 --> 00:30:51,160
I'll find her eventually.

371
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,440
I hope you find her soon.

372
00:30:58,123 --> 00:30:59,336
I'm afraid that...

373
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:02,480
the longer you stay in this house,

374
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,437
the harder it will be
to get away from His Lordship.

375
00:31:12,197 --> 00:31:14,570
Thanks a lot, Fueang, for caring.

376
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,343
But no matter what,

377
00:31:17,777 --> 00:31:19,720
I won't be separated
from Ms. Malai.

378
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,280
I'll find a way for us to get away.

379
00:31:56,483 --> 00:31:59,406
Ms. Ramphoei,
what are you doing here?

380
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,863
What's so strange about
a wife visiting her husband?

381
00:32:09,717 --> 00:32:11,280
Get out, ma'am! Go!

382
00:32:18,223 --> 00:32:19,223
No.

383
00:32:21,603 --> 00:32:22,603
Get out, ma'am!

384
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:26,200
I won't let you force
yourself on me again!

385
00:32:31,163 --> 00:32:32,603
But as I recall,

386
00:32:34,743 --> 00:32:36,560
you were willing
to have sex with me.

387
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,840
I didn't force you.

388
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,923
You don't love me.
I can understand that.

389
00:33:16,837 --> 00:33:19,440
But you're gonna abandon our son?

390
00:33:20,257 --> 00:33:21,920
Don't you love him?

391
00:33:25,223 --> 00:33:27,477
I want you to think it through.

392
00:33:28,376 --> 00:33:30,000
If you stay here with me,

393
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:33,160
you get to watch him grow.

394
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,383
Think about it.

395
00:33:35,837 --> 00:33:39,600
His Lordship transferred
all his fortune to our son.

396
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,880
It won't be hard, Dech,

397
00:33:42,797 --> 00:33:44,690
for me to give you

398
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,310
your share as...

399
00:33:51,297 --> 00:33:52,657
our son's father.

400
00:34:53,617 --> 00:34:57,010
I promise I'll live to protect you.

401
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:14,840
But my sun rose on that day,
the day we first met.

402
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,377
I fell in love with you that day

403
00:35:18,003 --> 00:35:20,903
even though I knew
we'd never meet again.

404
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,920
My Ms. Malai.

405
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,770
Ms. Ramphoei?

406
00:35:44,937 --> 00:35:45,977
Ms. Ramphoei?

407
00:35:46,997 --> 00:35:48,804
Dech, what's wrong?

408
00:35:52,737 --> 00:35:53,737
Dech?

409
00:35:54,877 --> 00:35:55,877
Dech?

410
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,560
I... I apologize.

411
00:36:01,003 --> 00:36:02,003
Dech?

412
00:36:05,157 --> 00:36:06,157
Dech!

413
00:36:06,863 --> 00:36:07,863
Dech!

414
00:36:08,157 --> 00:36:09,157
Dech!

415
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:10,543
Dech!

416
00:36:11,317 --> 00:36:12,317
Dech!

417
00:36:14,003 --> 00:36:15,003
Dech!

418
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:25,950
Dech!

419
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,850
You love me
but sleep with His Lordship.

420
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,583
Don't you know
you're the one I love the most?

421
00:37:05,843 --> 00:37:07,750
But you still lied to me.

422
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,680
Saeng, how dare you
treat me like this?

423
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:40,480
Don't yell at him.

424
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,640
It was my order, you harlot.

425
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:50,040
My lord, why are you
speaking to me this way?

426
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,400
I haven't done anything wrong.

427
00:37:52,411 --> 00:37:54,850
You still insist
you've done nothing wrong?

428
00:37:56,457 --> 00:37:57,457
My lord,

429
00:37:57,723 --> 00:37:59,480
this woman has no shame.

430
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,523
Saeng, stop provoking him.
Why are you doing this?

431
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:04,163
You still ask for a reason?

432
00:38:04,503 --> 00:38:06,880
It's clear I have only
one master, the viscount.

433
00:38:07,797 --> 00:38:08,797
No one else.

434
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,600
Enough, Saeng.

435
00:38:11,317 --> 00:38:13,090
You'll wake
the rest of the servants.

436
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
As for you,

437
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,400
how dare you have
an affair under my nose?

438
00:38:23,597 --> 00:38:25,040
What affair, my lord?

439
00:38:25,183 --> 00:38:26,750
That's never crossed my...

440
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,730
Don't lie to me.

441
00:38:31,823 --> 00:38:34,760
I know you went to his room
to seduce him.

442
00:38:35,557 --> 00:38:37,520
You're caught in the act.

443
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:39,464
I can kill you right here.

444
00:38:40,103 --> 00:38:42,423
You're that possessive
of me, my lord?

445
00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:47,000
You're the one
who ordered me to sleep with Dech.

446
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,184
Why are you being...?

447
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:51,120
I would never feel possessive of
a traitor like you. Remember that!

448
00:38:55,317 --> 00:38:57,463
But Saeng worked
with me many times.

449
00:38:57,483 --> 00:38:59,560
Why don't you punish him too?

450
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:02,560
Even though I've worked with you,

451
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,080
I've never betrayed His Lordship

452
00:39:05,723 --> 00:39:07,350
the way you've been doing.

453
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,670
His Lordship always has my loyalty.

454
00:39:12,681 --> 00:39:14,136
Saeng, you bastard.

455
00:39:14,258 --> 00:39:16,364
You're a two-faced opportunist.

456
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,710
My lord, you must believe me.

457
00:39:22,977 --> 00:39:24,880
I wasn't cheating on you.

458
00:39:25,223 --> 00:39:27,957
But you told me
to have a child with Dech.

459
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,000
I was following your order.

460
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,843
I didn't tell you to continue.

461
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,960
No one can get involved
with my Dech

462
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:38,857
without my permission.

463
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,523
You're courting death.

464
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:45,617
Your greed knows no bound.

465
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:10,653
Wicked man and woman,
they must have run off together.

466
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,350
Kam, take it.

467
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:15,840
Use it to kill Malai
at the count's house.

468
00:40:17,056 --> 00:40:20,535
Everything he holds dear,
I'll destroy it all.

469
00:40:20,549 --> 00:40:22,720
You're just
the beginning of it, Fueang!

470
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:24,170
Bastard!

471
00:40:28,707 --> 00:40:29,707
Dech!

472
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,060
Dech!

473
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,870
