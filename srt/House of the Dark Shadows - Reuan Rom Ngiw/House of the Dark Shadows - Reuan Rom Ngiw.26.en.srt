Even wild beasts nurture their young,

20
00:02:01,994 --> 00:02:03,819
is your heart colder than stone,

21
00:02:03,844 --> 00:02:05,787
unmoving for your own kin?

22
00:02:05,827 --> 00:02:07,694
Has your child taken this poison?

23
00:02:07,897 --> 00:02:08,693
No!

24
00:02:08,718 --> 00:02:11,151
What abomination is in that vial?!

25
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:13,440
My lord, red cotton flower tea.

26
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:17,045
Open wide!

27
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:19,201
Ramphoei took the bait.

28
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,576
She'll exact her revenge.

29
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:22,014
What a brilliant plan.

30
00:02:22,037 --> 00:02:23,748
You'll see, our freedom is imminent.

31
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:28,998
I'm the one who

32
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:30,365
poisoned your tea, my lord.

33
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:37,744
There is no such thing as an oath!

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Burn it all!

35
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:46,076
The reason I've gathered all of you here

36
00:02:46,177 --> 00:02:47,764
is to make

37
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:49,163
an announcement.

38
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,982
As Dech might have already informed you,

39
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:58,639
he will be responsible for maintaining

40
00:02:58,664 --> 00:03:00,295
the orderliness of this household.

41
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,709
I ask that everyone follow

42
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:03,303
Dech's instructions accordingly.

43
00:03:04,538 --> 00:03:06,021
As you all know,

44
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:08,646
Dech serves as Viscount Wisan's valet.

45
00:03:11,514 --> 00:03:14,314
In my capacity as the viscount's wife,

46
00:03:14,592 --> 00:03:16,279
I hereby delegate the authority to

47
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:17,779
manage all the assets of the

48
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:19,662
House of the Dark Shadows to Dech.

49
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,295
Is there anything you wish to say, Dech?

50
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:35,107
Whatever it is that makes you

51
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,833
feel constrained or worried,

52
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:38,373
I'll work on improving it.

53
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:41,740
You may not see me helping out

54
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:43,100
with your tasks much,

55
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,273
as I have to manage

56
00:03:44,298 --> 00:03:46,009
the viscount's properties to ensure that

57
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:47,115
we all have the same

58
00:03:47,131 --> 00:03:48,248
livelihood as before.

59
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:51,179
More importantly,

60
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:52,810
despite being assigned

61
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:53,968
to oversee everything,

62
00:03:53,992 --> 00:03:55,068
I'm still the same Dech

63
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:56,100
you've always known.

64
00:04:20,696 --> 00:04:22,118
The viscount is paralyzed.

65
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:23,337
Truly, Dech?

66
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,759
Yes, truly.

67
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:32,649
As much as I despise Viscount Wisan,

68
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:35,836
I can't help feeling dismayed.

69
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,336
Oh, Ms. Malai,

70
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:40,149
my love,

71
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,211
you have a truly compassionate heart.

72
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,625
Please don't dwell on it too much.

73
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,063
Consider it karma that

74
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:50,555
Viscount Wisan must repay.

75
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:54,274
If you say so,

76
00:04:57,454 --> 00:04:59,787
I can't help but believe it's true.

77
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:03,821
Initially, I observed the

78
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:04,985
Viscount's suspicious waning,

79
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:06,555
and I was trying to escape.

80
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,899
But then this happened.

81
00:05:11,642 --> 00:05:13,383
With his condition,

82
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,891
there's no necessity for you to flee.

83
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:22,040
Because he is now incapable of

84
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,871
ordering anyone to kill me.

85
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:26,134
Please return home together, Ms. Malai.

86
00:05:27,524 --> 00:05:28,766
Will it be alright, Dech?

87
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,110
Certainly,

88
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,164
you remain the primary wife.

89
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:36,188
While most assets belong to Mueang,

90
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,141
but Viscount Wisan's primary assets

91
00:05:38,157 --> 00:05:39,422
will be yours, Ms. Malai.

92
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:41,868
That's good then.

93
00:05:43,524 --> 00:05:45,297
So I can return to care for the Viscount

94
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:47,079
in gratitude for his kindness.

95
00:05:48,587 --> 00:05:49,836
I know that Ramphoei likely

96
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:51,836
won't show concern for his well-being.

97
00:05:54,556 --> 00:05:56,391
That's reassuring to hear.

98
00:05:58,915 --> 00:06:00,086
Once matters settle at

99
00:06:00,103 --> 00:06:01,672
the House of the Dark Shadows,

100
00:06:01,697 --> 00:06:02,829
I'll come for you.

101
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:10,532
Then, we can finally enjoy

102
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,774
our happily ever after.

103
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:14,043
Despite my resentment

104
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:15,668
for what transpired,

105
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,848
I still extend my forgiveness

106
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:23,144
to you, my lord.

107
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:26,684
At least, you provided me with

108
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,081
a life far superior to that

109
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:29,692
of a beggar child

110
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:33,193
by taking me in and caring for me.

111
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,809
Oh, Fueang,

112
00:07:45,184 --> 00:07:46,590
here to visit the Viscount?

113
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,918
The Viscount's medicine?

114
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:49,965
Allow me to assist.

115
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:54,903
Count Phichit sent this medicinal herbs

116
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:56,153
to be brewed for the Viscount.

117
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:59,137
Why does it stink like this?

118
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:02,239
Herbal remedies often have this scent.

119
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:02,942
Huh?

120
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:07,114
It's unbearable.

121
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:08,871
Sorry!

122
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,481
Weren't you going to help me?

123
00:08:12,747 --> 00:08:14,285
What? Just smelling this medicine

124
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:15,442
makes her nauseous.

125
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:17,176
She's acting like a pregnant person.

126
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:18,429
Truly bizarre.

127
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:22,919
My lord,

128
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,551
please take your medicine.

129
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,885
Get straight to the point

130
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,430
and keep it simple.

131
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:49,635
The principal assets of

132
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,025
Viscount Wisan's father

133
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:52,635
consist of gold, diamonds, and land.

134
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:53,869
There are funds deposited in

135
00:08:53,878 --> 00:08:55,291
the Siam Commercial Foundation bank

136
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:56,916
although the liquidity of these assets

137
00:08:56,932 --> 00:08:58,441
could be jeopardized in times of war,

138
00:08:58,465 --> 00:09:00,465
as evidenced in other nations.

139
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,119
And what do you propose

140
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:04,808
we do with these funds?

141
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,299
My suggestion is to

142
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,322
invest in rental properties.

143
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:10,783
Even in the absence of tenants,

144
00:09:10,808 --> 00:09:12,291
we retain ownership of the land.

145
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:14,658
I concur with that plan.

146
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,768
Where will you buy the land?

147
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:18,565
Sukhumvit is a good option.

148
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,049
Prices aren't too high yet.

149
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:24,002
Then let us proceed.

150
00:09:24,338 --> 00:09:26,494
I agree with everything you said.

151
00:09:27,503 --> 00:09:29,010
If there are no objections,

152
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,416
I will oversee the arrangements.

153
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:32,088
Alright.

154
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:44,628
Ms. Ramphoei.

155
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:55,088
My apologies,

156
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,330
I didn't expect your presence, ma'am.

157
00:09:57,823 --> 00:09:59,947
- You mongrels...
- I've just concluded a discussion.

158
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:03,033
Ms. Ramphoei, please tend to your child.

159
00:10:03,057 --> 00:10:04,440
I have another matter to address.

160
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:10,877
Haven't you heard, ma'am?

161
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:28,479
Now that everyone is present,

162
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:29,690
there is an important issue

163
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:30,627
I wish to discuss.

164
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,150
What happened, ma'am?

165
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:43,213
Is Dech trying to deceive you?

166
00:10:43,463 --> 00:10:45,119
No, it's just that I got frustrated

167
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:46,510
because I got interrupted.

168
00:10:48,456 --> 00:10:50,150
Shall we go market area for shopping?

169
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,190
Certainly, ma'am!

170
00:10:54,698 --> 00:10:55,698
Who goes there?

171
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,073
Are there others upstairs?

172
00:10:58,737 --> 00:11:00,088
No one else present, ma'am.

173
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:03,190
Could it be that the servants

174
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:04,377
are attempting theft?

175
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:08,338
Everything within this household

176
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:09,385
is under my ownership.

177
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,284
Whoever dares to steal, you're dead!

178
00:11:34,244 --> 00:11:35,220
Open it.

179
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,830
Hey.

180
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:42,315
Whoa!

181
00:11:44,307 --> 00:11:45,845
The division for both of you.

182
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:51,260
I've never seen such a plethora

183
00:11:51,283 --> 00:11:52,322
of gold, rings, and

184
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:53,697
other treasures before!

185
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:55,549
Look!

186
00:11:56,088 --> 00:11:57,049
We couldn't use all

187
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:57,970
of it in this lifetime.

188
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:01,494
We've endured considerable hardship.

189
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,698
Having served the Viscount

190
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,758
for many years,

191
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:05,119
we are entitled to comfort.

192
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:13,849
Fueang.

193
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:15,841
There's no need to make such a face.

194
00:12:15,873 --> 00:12:17,825
I divided it into three equal portions.

195
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:19,364
Kam and Uan seem to have more

196
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,903
because I combined them into one box.

197
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:26,450
I do not desire the viscount's

198
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,458
dirty money.

199
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:43,866
What are you doing?

200
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,170
Trying to steal?

201
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:04,143
Malai...

202
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:09,338
Are we done?

203
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:10,892
I have duties to fulfill.

204
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:18,064
I am terrified!

205
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:28,455
Malai!

206
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:32,173
I am terrified now, ma'am!

207
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:34,080
I implore you!

208
00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:37,900
Please stop!

209
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:41,838
Ms. Malai!

210
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:44,072
Dech!

211
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:46,096
It's Ms. Malai!

212
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:47,721
Ms. Malai!

213
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:51,267
Ms. Malai!

214
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:53,665
It's indeed Ms. Malai!

215
00:13:54,182 --> 00:13:55,862
I'm overjoyed, ma'am!

216
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:59,001
My Ms. Malai is indeed alive!

217
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:03,322
Why are you this happy?

218
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:06,455
I'm truly overjoyed, ma'am!

219
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,220
There is much to tell,

220
00:14:09,494 --> 00:14:10,939
I'll tell you all about it later.

221
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:11,532
Yes, ma'am.

222
00:14:11,556 --> 00:14:12,994
Now now, no more tears.

223
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,018
Yes, ma'am.

224
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:15,244
Why...

225
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:16,641
are you still...

226
00:14:17,611 --> 00:14:18,611
Why?

227
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:21,923
Why do you appear so astounded?

228
00:14:23,143 --> 00:14:26,033
Were you so sure I was dead?

229
00:14:28,213 --> 00:14:29,298
Ms. Malai lives

230
00:14:29,323 --> 00:14:31,057
and will henceforth resume her role

231
00:14:31,082 --> 00:14:32,142
as the mistress of

232
00:14:32,158 --> 00:14:33,556
the House of the Dark Shadows.

233
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:34,751
No,

234
00:14:34,783 --> 00:14:36,064
the mistress of the House

235
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,767
of the Dark Shadows is solely me.

236
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:39,845
On what grounds do you interfere?

237
00:14:40,557 --> 00:14:42,767
As the mother of the Viscount's son,

238
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:45,564
all assets belonging to the Viscount,

239
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:47,250
including the House of the Dark Shadows,

240
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:48,744
rightfully belong to my child.

241
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:50,587
However, as long as Viscount Wisan

242
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:52,298
remains alive, I, as his primary wife,

243
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:53,540
hold the authority to

244
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:54,766
oversee the affairs of

245
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,385
the House of the Dark Shadows.

246
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,087
- But I...
- If you wish to bring Mueang up,

247
00:14:59,112 --> 00:15:00,932
we will wait until he is of age

248
00:15:00,957 --> 00:15:02,613
to manage the estate.

249
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:04,908
Until then, if Mueang does not

250
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:06,939
desire my presence here, I shall depart.

251
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,595
However,

252
00:15:11,572 --> 00:15:14,103
that is nearly two decades away.

253
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,103
There is no guarantee you will

254
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:17,361
even be alive by then.

255
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:21,884
Ouch!

256
00:15:39,134 --> 00:15:40,493
What are you looking at?

257
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,125
Just you wait.

258
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,016
I will expel that detestable Malai

259
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:47,383
and your kind from this household!

260
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:50,917
Let us depart, Chaem.

261
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:58,136
Uan!

262
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:00,581
Did you see that?

263
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:04,105
I'm so happy!

264
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,777
Are you still overjoyed?

265
00:16:06,894 --> 00:16:08,014
Still excited?

266
00:16:09,777 --> 00:16:10,817
I'm fine now.

267
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:27,370
And what about Malai's body?

268
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:29,472
I've buried her under the floorboards

269
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,808
of your residence in Hua Hin,

270
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:31,980
locked the door,

271
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:33,425
and secured it tightly with chains.

272
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,558
I assure you, no one will

273
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,636
enter the house, my lord.

274
00:17:07,883 --> 00:17:09,148
Whatever ill intentions

275
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:11,032
you may have harbored towards me,

276
00:17:11,057 --> 00:17:12,726
I extend my forgiveness, my lord.

277
00:17:15,344 --> 00:17:17,414
I plan to return and take care of you,

278
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,710
as you have cared for me

279
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:20,046
so dutifully in the past.

280
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:43,596
My lord, what are you doing?

281
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,869
I believe the Viscount

282
00:17:48,878 --> 00:17:50,041
is still mad with you.

283
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:51,807
Please disregard him.

284
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:55,007
It'd be best for you to wash your hands

285
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,227
and arrange your bedroom.

286
00:17:56,252 --> 00:17:57,415
I will assist you later.

287
00:17:59,385 --> 00:18:01,393
I comprehend the Viscount's sentiments.

288
00:18:01,418 --> 00:18:02,418
However,

289
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,096
I have returned with genuine intentions.

290
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:24,474
Please don't force me

291
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:25,904
to harm you, my lord.

292
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,516
This is my final warning.

293
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:30,310
Henceforth, you cannot accuse me

294
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:31,350
of ingratitude.

295
00:18:35,507 --> 00:18:36,819
To clarify,

296
00:18:36,844 --> 00:18:38,226
Ms. Malai had no involvement

297
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:39,335
in the incident where

298
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:40,639
I administered poison to you.

299
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:41,780
Within this household,

300
00:18:41,796 --> 00:18:43,155
she remains the sole individual

301
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,397
who genuinely cares for your well-being.

302
00:18:45,437 --> 00:18:46,957
Keep this in mind.

303
00:19:11,044 --> 00:19:12,044
Ms. Malai.

304
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,208
Why are you embracing me, ma'am?

305
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:16,434
Without your assistance,

306
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:18,168
I would have met my demise long ago.

307
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:23,113
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

308
00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:28,152
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

309
00:19:37,418 --> 00:19:39,058
Look at your expression, Fueang.

310
00:19:43,722 --> 00:19:45,105
You seem as though

311
00:19:45,636 --> 00:19:47,636
you fear I might vanish.

312
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:49,323
I've been thinking all along

313
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,737
that you were really dead.

314
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:52,315
Geez, that Dech

315
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,917
didn't even bother telling me.

316
00:19:54,222 --> 00:19:55,683
Dech has good intentions.

317
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:57,870
He fears that if too many people

318
00:19:57,895 --> 00:19:58,894
were aware, it might reach

319
00:19:58,918 --> 00:19:59,987
the Viscount's ears.

320
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:02,870
It's not that we distrust you,

321
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:05,917
but the Viscount has made

322
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:07,675
attempts on my life several times,

323
00:20:08,121 --> 00:20:09,737
Dech didn't want to take any risks.

324
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:12,347
Yes, ma'am.

325
00:20:15,191 --> 00:20:16,191
Ms. Malai.

326
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:18,425
Why are you embracing me, ma'am?

327
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:26,448
Without your assistance,

328
00:20:26,473 --> 00:20:28,285
I would have met my demise long ago.

329
00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:32,375
I don't know how to repay you.

330
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:34,340
Especially upon learning from Dech

331
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:35,473
that the Viscount has

332
00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:36,621
inflicted harm upon you,

333
00:20:36,646 --> 00:20:37,598
to reveal my hideout.

334
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:41,715
I sincerely apologize, Fueang,

335
00:20:41,746 --> 00:20:43,887
for my selfishness.

336
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:45,543
There is no need for you

337
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,661
to apologize to me.

338
00:20:46,685 --> 00:20:48,066
I am content to assist you.

339
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:51,394
I will not forget your benevolence,

340
00:20:51,426 --> 00:20:52,426
Fueang.

341
00:20:56,186 --> 00:20:57,490
Will you still return to

342
00:20:57,514 --> 00:20:59,194
attend to the Viscount,

343
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:00,451
despite the considerable harm

344
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,608
he has inflicted upon you?

345
00:21:05,374 --> 00:21:06,444
I believe

346
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:09,062
karma has taken its toll.

347
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:11,709
Clinging to anger and resentment

348
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:13,686
seems merciless.

349
00:21:14,468 --> 00:21:15,826
At present, all I desire is

350
00:21:16,764 --> 00:21:18,364
mutual forgiveness.

351
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:19,569
So that when I die,

352
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:20,897
there will be no grudges.

353
00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:15,828
Perfect timing, I'm feeling hungry.

354
00:22:15,945 --> 00:22:17,065
Yes, my lord.

355
00:22:28,578 --> 00:22:30,258
My apologies, ma'am!

356
00:22:30,805 --> 00:22:32,570
Don't touch me with your filthy hands!

357
00:22:33,617 --> 00:22:34,289
Dech!

358
00:22:35,203 --> 00:22:36,656
I extend my apologies once more.

359
00:22:37,164 --> 00:22:38,546
It was not my intention, ma'am.

360
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,054
Clumsy, witless imbecile!

361
00:22:40,086 --> 00:22:41,609
As dumb as a cow or buffalo!

362
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,257
Do you even know how expensive

363
00:22:43,273 --> 00:22:44,351
this dress of mine is?

364
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,976
A lowly servant like you,

365
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:47,226
toiling your entire life,

366
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:48,250
could never afford

367
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:49,468
to reimburse me for it.

368
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,632
I shall cover the expenses.

369
00:22:51,398 --> 00:22:52,351
Are you satisfied?

370
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:55,484
It's alright, Baron.

371
00:22:55,984 --> 00:22:56,984
But I'm not.

372
00:23:03,197 --> 00:23:04,197
Baron...

373
00:23:04,205 --> 00:23:05,454
Once you receive the money,

374
00:23:05,486 --> 00:23:06,907
do not come here again.

375
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,540
Why do you speak in such a manner?

376
00:23:13,908 --> 00:23:15,009
Dech

377
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:16,814
is the individual whom you struck

378
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,173
and demeaned as lowly.

379
00:23:18,548 --> 00:23:19,610
To me,

380
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,626
Dech is not merely a servant

381
00:23:22,126 --> 00:23:23,646
but akin to family.

382
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:25,689
Baron.

383
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:28,173
Even though you are

384
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:29,384
the daughter of a Marquis,

385
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,681
you cannot wield your authority

386
00:23:30,705 --> 00:23:32,282
over my subordinates in such a manner,

387
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,321
especially given

388
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,470
our lack of familiarity,

389
00:23:34,494 --> 00:23:35,735
you still behave such way.

390
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:36,790
If we were to wed,

391
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:39,048
would you not assert dominance?

392
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:40,673
- But, Baron...
- I am aware that

393
00:23:40,923 --> 00:23:43,126
our elders aspire for us to marry.

394
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:44,939
But, I cannot tolerate a woman

395
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:46,079
with a vulgar tongue.

396
00:23:46,104 --> 00:23:47,704
Even in the event of marriage,

397
00:23:47,736 --> 00:23:49,040
we'd end up divorcing.

398
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:51,079
Go live with your own kind.

399
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:52,853
How dare you speak

400
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:54,180
to me in this manner!

401
00:23:54,205 --> 00:23:55,845
- For such...
- The matchmaking ends now.

402
00:23:57,955 --> 00:23:58,814
Goodbye.

403
00:23:58,861 --> 00:23:59,901
And I do hope

404
00:24:00,892 --> 00:24:02,134
we will not meet again.

405
00:24:22,203 --> 00:24:23,243
Are you hurt?

406
00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:25,969
I am fine, my lord.

407
00:24:37,891 --> 00:24:38,985
My lord, if you do this,

408
00:24:38,993 --> 00:24:40,195
the Marquis will undoubtedly

409
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,024
be displeased.

410
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:43,508
Let it be.

411
00:24:44,453 --> 00:24:46,367
If I were to wed a woman of that nature,

412
00:24:46,376 --> 00:24:47,672
I would endure nothing

413
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:49,070
but constant headaches.

414
00:24:49,094 --> 00:24:50,294
Come a little closer.

415
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,364
Bear in mind my words.

416
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:12,747
You are not merely

417
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:13,880
a servant like the rest.

418
00:25:14,786 --> 00:25:15,997
You are the one I love.

419
00:25:26,507 --> 00:25:27,686
You know well that

420
00:25:28,436 --> 00:25:30,303
I value you above all other servants.

421
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:33,303
Like a sibling, born of the same parent.

422
00:25:34,811 --> 00:25:36,209
I also love you, my lord.

423
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,576
I am grateful for your benevolence

424
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,522
toward someone as humble as myself.

425
00:26:30,772 --> 00:26:32,357
I'm hardly surprised, my lord.

426
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:34,474
Ramphoei is one to squander wealth

427
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:35,826
on frivolous indulgences.

428
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:37,615
Relying on her for sustenance

429
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:38,662
would prove futile.

430
00:26:39,537 --> 00:26:42,418
At least Dech, as the
Viscount Wisan's valet,

431
00:26:42,443 --> 00:26:43,810
possesses some semblance

432
00:26:43,842 --> 00:26:45,522
of managerial acumen.

433
00:26:46,686 --> 00:26:48,201
Nonetheless,

434
00:26:48,226 --> 00:26:50,060
I find it disconcerting to see

435
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:51,577
Father's estate falling into

436
00:26:51,602 --> 00:26:53,428
the hands of someone like Ramphoei

437
00:26:53,453 --> 00:26:54,523
or being overseen by

438
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:55,663
a servant such as Dech.

439
00:26:55,688 --> 00:26:57,053
It would be preferable if it were

440
00:26:57,085 --> 00:26:58,147
managed by the viscount or his heir.

441
00:26:58,172 --> 00:26:59,850
Do not fret, my lord.

442
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,288
With the viscount no longer among us,

443
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:04,264
it's inevitable that the estate will

444
00:27:04,296 --> 00:27:06,896
eventually come under Mueang's control.

445
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,170
Consider it as

446
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,819
being temporarily managed by others.

447
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,749
I'm afraid it might run out before

448
00:27:14,774 --> 00:27:15,827
Mueang grows up.

449
00:27:17,265 --> 00:27:18,358
Engaging in legal

450
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,647
proceedings to reclaim it,

451
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:21,288
given that it's not my personal estate,

452
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:22,432
would be hard.

453
00:27:22,523 --> 00:27:23,749
Is there any other way?

454
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,002
I simply wish to ensure that

455
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:32,595
Father's hard-earned wealth isn't

456
00:27:32,612 --> 00:27:33,892
squandered on individuals

457
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:35,189
of dubious origin.

458
00:27:38,229 --> 00:27:40,742
It's better not to resort to

459
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:41,961
legal action, my lord.

460
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,635
Our status is sufficient for our needs,

461
00:27:46,205 --> 00:27:47,970
but we wouldn't be able to handle

462
00:27:47,995 --> 00:27:49,697
a legal battle with our resources.

463
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:51,447
Please forget about it, my lord.

464
00:27:56,614 --> 00:27:58,981
Who dares eavesdrop on our conversation?

465
00:28:02,997 --> 00:28:03,997
- She has a brother who's an...
- Saeng!

466
00:28:06,489 --> 00:28:07,419
Oww!

467
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:08,544
Saeng!

468
00:28:08,607 --> 00:28:09,727
I'll kill you!

469
00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:11,153
- Get out!
- Let go!

471
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:21,114
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

472
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,825
Who dares eavesdrop on our conversation?

473
00:28:36,622 --> 00:28:37,708
It is I, my lord.

474
00:28:40,903 --> 00:28:41,903
Saeng?

475
00:28:51,247 --> 00:28:53,145
You wish to work at my household?

476
00:28:55,271 --> 00:28:56,301
Yes, my lord.

477
00:28:56,482 --> 00:28:58,590
Besides Viscount Wisan and you,

478
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:01,380
I don't know anyone else.

479
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:03,606
Then where did all the money

480
00:29:03,614 --> 00:29:04,982
that the viscount gave you go?

481
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:06,817
I know it wasn't a small amount.

482
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:08,489
You could easily invest

483
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:09,692
for a bright future.

484
00:29:11,186 --> 00:29:12,186
Well,

485
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:14,826
I spent it on alcohol until

486
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:17,381
it was almost gone, ma'am.

487
00:29:19,147 --> 00:29:20,490
You're not young anymore.

488
00:29:20,506 --> 00:29:21,903
Why didn't you use your brain?

489
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,684
Why didn't you apply the skills

490
00:29:24,037 --> 00:29:25,951
you learned from the viscount

491
00:29:26,084 --> 00:29:28,764
to invest in something?

492
00:29:30,459 --> 00:29:31,639
Let's not chastise him.

493
00:29:31,787 --> 00:29:32,873
He's likely distressed

494
00:29:32,912 --> 00:29:34,053
about being cast out

495
00:29:34,078 --> 00:29:35,679
and turned to alcohol to cope.

496
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,220
Am I correct?

497
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:39,747
Indeed, my lord.

498
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:42,014
This individual was loyal to a fault.

499
00:29:42,053 --> 00:29:43,904
It's regrettable he was driven away.

500
00:29:44,069 --> 00:29:46,115
Otherwise, he wouldn't be in this state.

501
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:50,295
What do you mean, my lord?

502
00:29:50,436 --> 00:29:51,826
Don't you know what happened

503
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:52,842
to the viscount?

504
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:55,842
What happened to the viscount?

505
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:00,252
Viscount Wisan had a fall down

506
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:01,580
the stairs and is now paralyzed.

507
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:04,697
He was always in good health,

508
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:05,760
truly unfortunate.

509
00:30:08,736 --> 00:30:09,736
Dech...

510
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:12,166
Hey.

511
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,079
Where are you going?

512
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:18,692
My lord.

513
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,050
My lord.

514
00:30:22,606 --> 00:30:23,606
Please be alright.

515
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:27,121
He comes and goes as he pleases,

516
00:30:27,614 --> 00:30:29,098
utterly lacking in manners.

517
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:31,197
Don't mind him.

518
00:30:31,364 --> 00:30:32,598
He must be surprised.

519
00:30:32,816 --> 00:30:34,222
He truly loves the viscount.

520
00:30:35,473 --> 00:30:36,590
I fear he might

521
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:38,215
act impulsively, my lord.

522
00:30:38,551 --> 00:30:40,223
His concern seems excessive.

523
00:30:41,676 --> 00:30:42,934
He appears on the verge

524
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:44,293
of confronting someone.

525
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,410
Such devotion from an old,

526
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,715
loyal servant is admirable.

527
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:49,223
Their commitment is invaluable.

528
00:31:00,551 --> 00:31:01,551
Hey!

529
00:31:03,723 --> 00:31:04,723
My lord.

530
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:06,269
Ouch.

531
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:08,746
Dammit!

532
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
My lord.

533
00:31:28,604 --> 00:31:30,064
Hey. Stay in bed.

534
00:31:30,563 --> 00:31:31,563
You're ill,

535
00:31:31,705 --> 00:31:33,010
why bother getting up?

536
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:40,713
Here's some western medicine.

537
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:42,002
Take it to help you recover.

538
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:43,111
Please keep this

539
00:31:43,877 --> 00:31:45,314
costly medicine for yourself.

540
00:31:45,658 --> 00:31:47,135
Don't worry about it.

541
00:31:47,612 --> 00:31:49,111
I made the effort to come here.

542
00:31:49,136 --> 00:31:50,392
Accept it, don't be stubborn.

543
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:53,542
Yes, my lord.

544
00:32:05,838 --> 00:32:07,033
I've left the rest of the

545
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:08,205
medicine here for you.

546
00:32:08,229 --> 00:32:09,431
Take it after each meal

547
00:32:09,456 --> 00:32:10,486
until it's finished.

548
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:13,125
Thank you, my lord.

549
00:32:13,658 --> 00:32:15,178
I appreciate your generosity, my lord.

550
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,166
I've ordered Fueang

551
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,330
to make some porridge.

552
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:19,525
Try to eat a bit,

553
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,026
it will help you get better sooner.

554
00:32:22,354 --> 00:32:23,394
Yes, my lord.

555
00:32:24,112 --> 00:32:25,152
Alright then.

556
00:32:25,182 --> 00:32:26,182
Go and rest.

557
00:32:26,952 --> 00:32:28,037
Are you alright?

558
00:32:44,674 --> 00:32:45,674
- Oww!
- Hey!

559
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:48,361
Watch where you're going.

560
00:32:54,526 --> 00:32:56,479
You all have caused harm to my lord!

561
00:33:03,003 --> 00:33:04,736
- Back off!
- Don't let him enter!

562
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,611
I must see my lord!

563
00:33:06,995 --> 00:33:08,928
- Do not block me!
- Back off!

564
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:10,432
You're drunk! Get out!

565
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:11,752
I told you to back off!

566
00:33:11,777 --> 00:33:13,924
You fool, back off!

567
00:33:15,057 --> 00:33:16,057
Saeng!

568
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:18,385
Just leave, you're not wanted here!

569
00:33:19,862 --> 00:33:20,932
I refuse to leave!

570
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,065
Viscount Wisan himself has

571
00:33:22,088 --> 00:33:23,252
banned you from returning.

572
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,979
Don't create more problems for yourself.

573
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:26,908
I need to see with my own eyes

574
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:28,760
if my lord is truly paralyzed

575
00:33:28,784 --> 00:33:29,904
as everyone claims.

576
00:33:30,838 --> 00:33:32,525
- My lord!
- Hey!

577
00:33:32,987 --> 00:33:35,299
Saeng, think sensibly.

578
00:33:35,838 --> 00:33:37,221
The viscount is paralyzed,

579
00:33:37,246 --> 00:33:38,385
he can't even speak.

580
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:40,377
Why do you want to go in?

581
00:33:40,565 --> 00:33:41,682
I believe you!

582
00:33:42,057 --> 00:33:43,549
The viscount wouldn't be careless

583
00:33:43,573 --> 00:33:45,190
enough to fall down the stairs.

584
00:33:46,846 --> 00:33:48,854
Surely, you guys did something to him!

585
00:33:59,276 --> 00:34:00,276
My lord!

586
00:34:00,534 --> 00:34:01,534
- My lord!
- Hey!

587
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,666
We've done nothing to harm him!

588
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,823
Cease your baseless accusations! Go!

589
00:34:06,237 --> 00:34:08,504
I won't leave, I must see my lord!

590
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:09,885
- My lord!
- Hey!

591
00:34:10,253 --> 00:34:10,971
My lord!

592
00:34:14,963 --> 00:34:16,572
Hey, I said back off!

593
00:34:18,948 --> 00:34:20,221
You damn traitor!

594
00:34:20,729 --> 00:34:21,729
Scram!

595
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,310
No, you scram.

596
00:34:24,924 --> 00:34:26,190
The viscount dismissed you

597
00:34:26,215 --> 00:34:27,322
because he despises you,

598
00:34:27,347 --> 00:34:29,033
you still shamelessly come here!

599
00:34:29,088 --> 00:34:31,088
Exactly! Now that you know, leave!

600
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,159
Get out!

601
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,221
My lord!

602
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:34,689
My lord!

603
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:36,002
My lord!

604
00:34:36,213 --> 00:34:37,733
I must see my lord!

605
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,861
Saeng, you're drunk!

606
00:34:39,886 --> 00:34:41,525
Why even waste words on him, Kam, Uan?

607
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:44,025
Just beat him up and drag him out.

608
00:34:44,393 --> 00:34:45,315
Such a nuisance.

609
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:48,385
Why you...

610
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,850
Accursed Ramphoei.

611
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,916
You plotted with Dech to harm my lord.

612
00:34:59,075 --> 00:35:00,195
I'll kill you.

613
00:35:02,442 --> 00:35:03,559
Let go, Kam!

614
00:35:04,341 --> 00:35:06,403
Saeng! Don't talk nonsensically!

615
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,512
I've done nothing to the viscount!

616
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,840
You and your criminal brother Phoem

617
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:14,708
tried to coax me into killing my lord,

618
00:35:14,771 --> 00:35:15,971
but I refused.

619
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:17,536
So, you went ahead with your plan!

620
00:35:18,747 --> 00:35:19,747
Dear lord!

621
00:35:20,474 --> 00:35:22,520
Lady Macbeth killing her own husband!

622
00:35:22,825 --> 00:35:25,090
She has a brother who's a wanted outlaw,

623
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:26,598
come and arrest him!

624
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,965
- She has a brother who's an...
- Saeng!

625
00:35:31,888 --> 00:35:32,888
Oww!

626
00:35:33,442 --> 00:35:33,950
Saeng!

627
00:35:33,989 --> 00:35:35,598
You've gone overboard, Saeng!

628
00:35:36,146 --> 00:35:38,450
- Let go!
- Uan, take Ms. Ramphoei inside!

629
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:40,895
No, Ms. Ramphoei!

630
00:35:41,505 --> 00:35:42,505
Let go!

631
00:35:42,567 --> 00:35:44,762
- Let go!
- You damn Ramphoei!

632
00:35:44,974 --> 00:35:46,122
I must see my lord!

633
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:47,356
I will kill you!

634
00:35:47,435 --> 00:35:48,551
- Get out!
- Let go!

635
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:50,864
You, get out!

636
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:53,106
You and that wretched Ramphoei

637
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:54,224
plotted together to harm my lord,

638
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:55,375
leaving him paralyzed,

639
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,758
just as you conspired to conceal

640
00:35:56,783 --> 00:35:57,958
the fact that woman is still alive!

641
00:35:59,628 --> 00:36:04,549
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

642
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:09,549
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

643
00:36:09,707 --> 00:36:11,675
- Ms. Ramphoei, let's leave.
- Let go!

644
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,597
Let go. Don't you dare touch me.

645
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:22,784
I don't want to touch you either, ma'am.

646
00:36:23,175 --> 00:36:25,003
. But please don't go out again.

647
00:36:27,675 --> 00:36:29,875
Or Saeng will publicly condemn you,

648
00:36:30,175 --> 00:36:31,503
you wouldn't be able to bear it.

649
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,519
I am aware.

650
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,159
Your counsel is unnecessary,

651
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:35,886
akin to a cur's unsolicited advice!

652
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:38,285
Get out!

653
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,326
That damn Saeng,

654
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,427
do you intend to expose me?

655
00:37:05,615 --> 00:37:07,396
- Let go! I must see my lord!
- Get out!

656
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:08,685
- My lord!
- Get out!

657
00:37:08,772 --> 00:37:10,498
Let go, Kam, you damn traitor!

658
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:12,131
Let go!

659
00:37:12,748 --> 00:37:13,748
Eek! Kam!

660
00:37:14,412 --> 00:37:15,880
Saeng, what did you do to my husband?

661
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:17,803
- Damn you Uan!
- Saeng!

662
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:19,521
Oww!

663
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:21,115
Oww!

664
00:37:24,178 --> 00:37:25,178
It hurts.

665
00:37:25,553 --> 00:37:26,419
Get up.

666
00:37:38,084 --> 00:37:39,052
That's not true.

667
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,662
It's impossible!

668
00:37:41,748 --> 00:37:43,138
What's the matter, Saeng?

669
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,302
You look as if you've seen a ghost.

670
00:37:45,623 --> 00:37:47,076
Ms. Malai has passed away!

671
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,623
How is it possible for her to be here?

672
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:02,879
You lot...

673
00:38:04,363 --> 00:38:06,324
you deceivers have hoodwinked my lord!

674
00:38:06,706 --> 00:38:07,826
Curse you all!

675
00:38:08,309 --> 00:38:09,349
Damn you Dech!

676
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:12,199
Watch out, Kam!

677
00:38:13,852 --> 00:38:15,351
- Dech!
- Kam, please be careful!

678
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,960
Stop!

679
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:20,633
Kam!

680
00:38:35,915 --> 00:38:37,258
You have a choice, Saeng.

681
00:38:37,642 --> 00:38:39,063
Will you depart peacefully,

682
00:38:39,088 --> 00:38:40,900
or with a bullet between your eyes?

683
00:38:43,017 --> 00:38:44,344
Shoot if you dare!

684
00:38:44,454 --> 00:38:45,758
You've already betrayed

685
00:38:46,306 --> 00:38:48,454
the one who nurtured and cared for you.

686
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,985
Why would you hesitate to kill me?

687
00:38:50,735 --> 00:38:52,180
Viscount Wisan expelled you

688
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,485
for your betrayal.

689
00:38:53,509 --> 00:38:55,204
You have no right to return here.

690
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,742
I offer you the chance to leave

691
00:38:57,767 --> 00:38:58,695
without further conflict.

692
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,727
Don't hold me accountable

693
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:00,915
for the consequences.

694
00:39:02,751 --> 00:39:03,915
I fear nothing!

695
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,743
Your schemes are not lost on me.

696
00:39:07,063 --> 00:39:08,805
You and that wretched Ramphoei

697
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:10,313
plotted together to harm my lord,

698
00:39:10,321 --> 00:39:11,447
leaving him paralyzed,

699
00:39:11,471 --> 00:39:12,829
just as you conspired to conceal

700
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,407
the fact that woman is still alive!

701
00:39:17,876 --> 00:39:19,165
That is not true, Ms. Malai.

702
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,257
The viscount fell down the stairs.

703
00:39:21,282 --> 00:39:22,415
Nobody was harming anyone.

704
00:39:23,384 --> 00:39:24,610
The evidence is here!

705
00:39:26,024 --> 00:39:27,266
I concede that we collaborated

706
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,282
to deceive the viscount,

707
00:39:28,306 --> 00:39:29,766
but it was because he intended

708
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:30,813
to harm me first.

709
00:39:31,142 --> 00:39:32,680
We had to defend ourselves.

710
00:39:33,196 --> 00:39:35,141
Yet, no one harmed him in the end.

711
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:36,954
I don't believe that.

712
00:39:49,118 --> 00:39:51,329
The next bullet will find its mark.

713
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:57,695
That's enough. It's dangerous.

714
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:00,609
Saeng acted out

715
00:40:01,313 --> 00:40:02,844
of concern for the viscount.

716
00:40:04,055 --> 00:40:05,273
Let's put an end to this.

717
00:40:13,314 --> 00:40:14,680
You heard Ms. Malai.

718
00:40:14,876 --> 00:40:16,079
Leave now,

719
00:40:16,532 --> 00:40:18,932
or I'll have the police remove you.

720
00:40:19,212 --> 00:40:20,509
Fine,

721
00:40:20,634 --> 00:40:21,829
I fear nothing!

722
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:24,126
When the police arrive,

723
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:25,930
I'll expose all of you for

724
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:27,665
what you've done to make

725
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,173
my lord end up like this!

726
00:40:29,915 --> 00:40:30,915
Saeng!

727
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,696
Why not?

728
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:34,790
I'm curious who the police will

729
00:40:34,806 --> 00:40:36,923
believe more between you and us.

730
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:41,958
Uan's right.

731
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,497
Want to give it a try?

732
00:40:48,552 --> 00:40:50,137
You see their true nature now.

733
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:52,067
If Ms. Malai still intends

734
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,247
to support them,

735
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:54,738
be wary, ma'am.

736
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,754
Evil corrupts, and one day

737
00:40:56,779 --> 00:40:58,059
it might tarnish you

738
00:40:58,427 --> 00:40:59,606
just as it has them!

739
00:40:59,622 --> 00:41:00,622
Saeng!

740
00:41:01,841 --> 00:41:03,521
Remember my words, Dech.

741
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,317
One day,

742
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:07,411
I'll return to avenge my lord.

743
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,864
I won't allow his harm to go unpunished.

744
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,677
Saeng...

745
00:41:36,114 --> 00:41:37,403
Dech, please.

746
00:41:37,435 --> 00:41:38,739
Acting rashly

747
00:41:38,802 --> 00:41:40,482
will only prove Saeng.

748
00:41:47,427 --> 00:41:48,895
Let us return to the house, ma'am.

749
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:13,628
Why don't we get rid of

750
00:42:13,652 --> 00:42:14,863
Ms. Ramphoei?

751
00:42:15,277 --> 00:42:17,011
No, Saeng just died recently.

752
00:42:17,582 --> 00:42:18,808
You guys need not worry.

753
00:42:18,832 --> 00:42:20,605
