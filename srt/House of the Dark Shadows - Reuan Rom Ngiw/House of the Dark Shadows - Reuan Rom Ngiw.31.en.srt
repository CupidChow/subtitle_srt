"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 31)

19
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,390
Why did Dech tell
two different stories?

20
00:02:12,737 --> 00:02:13,777
I'm not afraid.

21
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:15,887
Don't think I'm not onto you.

22
00:02:16,164 --> 00:02:17,527
You and Ramphoei

23
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,727
conspired
to paralyze His Lordship.

24
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:23,504
The same way
you conspired to fake her death!

25
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,847
Don't trust Dech!

26
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:27,917
Don't trust Dech?

27
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:41,637
What do you mean, my lord?

28
00:02:58,757 --> 00:02:59,836
What did Dech do?

29
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
W...

30
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:26,317
A...

31
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:28,097
Wa...

32
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:42,520
Wang... (Poi...)

33
00:03:50,403 --> 00:03:51,403
Y...

34
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
Ya. (Son.)

35
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,490
Dech poisoned.

36
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:03,867
Dech poisoned?

37
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,330
Ch...

38
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,520
A...

39
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:31,720
Chan. (Me.)

40
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:37,100
Dech poisoned me!

41
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:45,377
"Dech poisoned me."

42
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:14,783
The truth is he fell down
the stairs and became paralyzed.

43
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:17,403
When the count asked me
I was still in shocked.

44
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,390
I probably just told him wrong.

45
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,410
I'm very offended

46
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:25,240
that you don't trust me anymore.

47
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:31,190
Whom should I believe?

48
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:36,237
Kam?

49
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,350
Yes?

50
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:40,640
Don't you want a girl?

51
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,040
I knew it.

52
00:05:42,463 --> 00:05:44,370
Wanna row the boat, don't you?

53
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,180
Uan, Kam.

54
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,817
What do you need, Ms. Malai?

55
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,966
Or are you here for Fueang?

56
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:04,977
- She...
- No.

57
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,693
I came to see you two.

58
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:12,422
Is there something you need?

59
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,042
Uh...

60
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:16,360
I wanted to ask...

61
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,022
when the viscount
fell down the stairs,

62
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:20,677
what happened?

63
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,280
Can you tell me?

64
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,800
There's nothing to it.

65
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,603
It happened as Dech told you.

66
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,150
That's right.

67
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:31,483
If you're curious about something,
you should ask Dech.

68
00:06:32,063 --> 00:06:33,063
Why?

69
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:36,603
Weren't you two
in the house when it happened?

70
00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:42,563
Well...

71
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,990
I don't wanna talk about it, ma'am.

72
00:06:46,663 --> 00:06:47,663
His Lordship...

73
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:49,897
was kind to both of us.

74
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:54,000
And all of a sudden
he became paralyzed.

75
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:55,910
I don't wanna talk about it.

76
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,430
Calm down, darling.

77
00:06:58,263 --> 00:06:59,263
Don't cry.

78
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,050
Uh...

79
00:07:02,177 --> 00:07:04,280
Why are you asking us
about this, ma'am?

80
00:07:04,663 --> 00:07:06,436
Uh... Well... Uh...

81
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
It's nothing.

82
00:07:10,403 --> 00:07:11,563
I was just curious.

83
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,050
I won't bother you.

84
00:07:13,637 --> 00:07:15,957
I'm sorry for upsetting you, Uan.

85
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:34,120
Why did she suddenly ask
about the viscount?

86
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:35,403
I'm confused too.

87
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,583
Or has she learned something?

88
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,103
That should be all.

89
00:07:58,323 --> 00:07:59,323
Yes, ma'am.

90
00:07:59,923 --> 00:08:01,230
Thanks a lot, Fueang.

91
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,080
Are you sure you can walk now?

92
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:04,944
You want me to run to show you?

93
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:06,320
Fueang.

94
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,737
You're jesting.

95
00:08:08,537 --> 00:08:11,870
Hey, don't forget
you're not alone anymore.

96
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,130
I won't.

97
00:08:15,137 --> 00:08:16,990
You're such a good person.

98
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:18,696
Attentive to other people.

99
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:20,680
Even a servant like me,

100
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:22,280
you still care.

101
00:08:22,596 --> 00:08:24,096
I never saw you as a servant.

102
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:26,600
I see you as my sister.

103
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,510
Ms. Malai.

104
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,083
How about this?

105
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,083
Let's go by boat tomorrow.

106
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,680
So you won't have to walk far.

107
00:08:38,223 --> 00:08:41,070
If you were a little older,

108
00:08:41,197 --> 00:08:43,097
I'll call you "Mother," ma'am.

109
00:08:50,403 --> 00:08:51,899
- Here, ma'am.
- I'm counting on you.

110
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,843
Yes, ma'am.

111
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,670
Are you ready?

112
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,730
Yes.

113
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:11,763
Let's hurry so we're in time
for the sermon.

114
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:12,996
- Yes.
- Let's go.

115
00:09:46,257 --> 00:09:47,257
Goodness!

116
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:48,817
What happened, Fueang?

117
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:51,097
Ms. Malai!

118
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:52,890
The boat's leaking, ma'am!

119
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:58,670
Ms. Malai, hold on.

120
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,377
I'll hurry to the bank.

121
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,130
Help!

122
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:05,040
Help us!

123
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:06,880
Anybody, help us!

124
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:08,120
Help us!

125
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:10,920
Ms. Malai, can you
swim to the bank first?

126
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,083
I can't swim.

127
00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:14,260
Huh?! Ms. Malai!

128
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:15,557
Fueang!

129
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:17,240
Ms. Malai.

130
00:10:17,813 --> 00:10:19,526
Is there anyone around here?!

131
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
Fueang!

132
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,480
Ms. Malai!

133
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:27,350
- Fueang!
- Ms. Malai.

134
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:30,462
- Fueang!
- Ms. Malai, hold on, ma'am.

135
00:10:30,536 --> 00:10:31,536
Hold on!

136
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,920
Ms. Malai!

137
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:41,520
Ms. Malai!

138
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:42,743

141
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:03,643
- Fueang!
- Ms. Malai, hold on, ma'am.

142
00:11:03,777 --> 00:11:04,777
Hold on!

143

What happened?!

156
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,277
Ms. Malai's drowning!

157
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,897
Get down there and help her!

158
00:11:51,563 --> 00:11:52,563
Hurry!

159
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,840
Ms. Malai!

160
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:05,080
- Ms. Malai, where are you?!
- Ms. Malai!

Ms. Malai!

162
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,990
What do we do?

163
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,197
Dech.

164
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:23,303
- Dech...
- Ms. Malai!

165
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,960
- Did you find her?
- Ms. Malai!

166
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,030
Ms. Malai!

167

Fueang!

168
00:13:02,163 --> 00:13:03,163
Dech!

169
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:04,957
Ms. Malai!

170
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:05,983
Fueang!

171
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,690
Fueang.

172
00:13:13,857 --> 00:13:14,857
Ms. Malai!

173
00:13:15,857 --> 00:13:16,857
Ms. Malai?

174
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,050
- Ms. Malai?
- Ms. Malai?

175
00:13:19,357 --> 00:13:20,920
- Ms. Malai? Ms. Malai?
- Ms. Malai?

176
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:43,077
How are you, Ms. Malai?

177
00:13:43,497 --> 00:13:45,080
How did I get back to my room?

178
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:48,556
You were unconscious.

179
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,683
Fueang and I took you
back to the house.

180
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,510
Is Fueang safe?

181
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,640
She's safe.

182
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:58,760
Instead of thinking
of yourself first.

183
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,290
So...

184
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:02,590
how did you rescue me in time?

185
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,797
I knew from Fueang
since this morning

186
00:14:05,003 --> 00:14:06,276
that you'd make merit.

187
00:14:06,603 --> 00:14:08,000
I wanted to go with you

188
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,640
but I was tied up with work.

189
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,983
As soon as I finished everything,

190
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,840
I rowed my boat quickly
and rescued you in time.

191
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:22,817
Otherwise...

192
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:24,377
Goodness.

193
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:25,817
Dech.

194
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,563
Just the thought of not seeing you

195
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:33,470
and your face again in this life,

196
00:14:34,763 --> 00:14:36,810
I just couldn't handle it.

197
00:14:39,603 --> 00:14:41,603
If I didn't save you in time today,

198
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:44,617
I would have killed myself
and joined you, ma'am.

199
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:51,023
Do you know now

200
00:14:51,477 --> 00:14:53,664
how much I love you?

201
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,770
I know.

202
00:14:56,717 --> 00:14:58,040
I know, Dech.

203
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,817
I love you too.

204
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:16,840
Thank you.

205
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,400
My intention was to
make merit for Saeng and Chaem.

206
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,360
This shouldn't have happened, Dech.

207
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:35,280
The fact that you and Fueang
were going to make merit,

208
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,120
who knew about it, ma'am?

209
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,090
Well...

210
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,400
the whole house knew.

211
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,559
Because everyone helped me
prepare the offerings.

212
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,360
They all wanted to make merit
for Saeng and Chaem too.

213
00:15:57,897 --> 00:15:59,080
You should rest.

214
00:16:00,803 --> 00:16:02,323
I have something to take care of.

215
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:56,584
Dech, you dare to slap me?!

216
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,883
Don't think I'll let you hurt me
without a fight, slave!

217
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,040
Enough!

218
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:02,676
Or you want more?

219
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:05,259
What the hell is wrong the you?!

220
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,400
This is nothing

221
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:08,720
compared to your attempt
to kill Ms. Malai!

222
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:14,443
How did she frame me this time?

223
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,077
Is that why you're accusing me?

224
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,600
She didn't do anything.

225
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:20,129
She just almost died on her way
to make merit with Fueang.

226
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:23,800
What does a leaking boat
have anything to do with me?

227
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:30,680
What did you just say?

228
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:33,640
I haven't told you

229
00:17:34,237 --> 00:17:35,597
what almost killed Ms. Malai.

230
00:17:36,677 --> 00:17:37,677
Well...

231
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,817
She took a boat to make merit
and almost died.

232
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,250
What else could it be?

233
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,840
I was just guessing.

234
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,920
The only one in this house
who wants Ms. Malai dead is you.

235
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,543
You want Fueang dead too.

236
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:51,997
If it wasn't you, who would it be?

237
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,163
If you plan on hurting Ms. Malai,

238
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:57,840
I'll leave this place.

239
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,320
I don't believe you.

240
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,637
You stayed because
you want the fortune,

241
00:18:01,843 --> 00:18:02,843
the comfort.

242
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,263
And right now
everything is in your control.

243
00:18:06,343 --> 00:18:07,636
Don't talk tough, Dech.

244
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,337
If you think I want
to stay here for the fortune,

245
00:18:11,597 --> 00:18:12,897
you're wrong, ma'am.

246
00:18:13,283 --> 00:18:16,200
Ms. Malai and I always
wanted to leave this place.

247
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,000
Then why didn't you?

248
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,360
Answer me.

249
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:21,517
Because I knew if I left,

250
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,200
you'd squander the fortune
down to the last penny.

251
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:27,320
Before Mueang's grown.

252
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:28,657
Am I right?

253
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:34,240
When I run out of patience,

254
00:18:35,537 --> 00:18:37,537
I'd abandon even my own child.

255
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,197
You choose a woman
over your flesh and blood.

256
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:44,280
Over your benefactor.

257
00:18:44,397 --> 00:18:45,397
No wonder

258
00:18:45,437 --> 00:18:47,790
you dared hurt the viscount
and left him paralyzed.

259
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:49,763
Ow, Dech.

260
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:52,760
I didn't hurt the viscount.

261
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,090
If I did what you claim,

262
00:18:56,223 --> 00:18:58,880
I would have killed you
to silence you a long time ago.

263
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,097
Ow, Dech, let go.
You're hurting me.

264
00:19:01,337 --> 00:19:03,600
I stayed because of Ms. Malai.

265
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,957
If you try to hurt Ms. Malai again,

266
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,240
don't say I didn't warn you.

267
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:54,360
Enough, my lord.

268
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,160
Stop accusing Dech.

269
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,170
You're doing this because
you're possessive of Dech, right?

270
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:12,417
My lord,

271
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:14,960
I won't believe you anymore.

272
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,183
If you still want me
to take care of you,

273
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,003
you must stop this.

274
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:28,240
Or I'll have servants
take care of you instead.

for the misunderstanding.

292
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,850
It's okay, ma'am.

293
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:23,157
I understand.

294
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:25,640
Are you still mad at me?

295
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:38,160
I love you too much
to be mad at you.

296
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,517
Malai is stupid.

297
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:08,284
She's gone back to believe Dech.

298
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,920
I won't let you win
without a fight, Dech!

(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

301
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:02,840
You're watching me.

302
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,640
How can I fall as sleep?

303
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:08,116
I just want to tuck in
the woman I love.

304
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,704
Please let me sit here
until you fall asleep.

305
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,160
Don't worry, ma'am.

306
00:24:16,983 --> 00:24:19,600
I won't do anything
to dishonor you.

307
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,120
Once you're asleep,
I'll leave, ma'am.

308
00:24:29,563 --> 00:24:32,640
I'll definitely have
a good dream tonight.

309
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:38,144
Please dream of me too.

310
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:36,404
For this kind of money
is worth getting hurt a little.

311
00:25:36,597 --> 00:25:39,314
And please keep it a secret
as we agreed.

312
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:44,080
Call on me if you have
this kind of job again. I like it.

313
00:25:46,793 --> 00:25:47,880
You must be happy

314
00:25:48,127 --> 00:25:49,800
now that you got back with Malai.

315
00:25:50,023 --> 00:25:51,400
You're quite cunning, Dech.

316
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,757
You want me to help you kill Malai?

317
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,070
You said you loved her so much.

318
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,777
What made you change your mind?

319
00:26:02,037 --> 00:26:03,120
It's just an act.

320
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,210
I know you can do it.

321
00:26:06,203 --> 00:26:07,243
Aren't you worried

322
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,280
you might accidentally kill
Malai and Fueang for real?

323
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,880
Fueang can swim. She'll survive.

324
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,300
As for Ms. Malai,
I'll follow them closely by boat.

325
00:26:16,393 --> 00:26:18,920
I'll never let Ms. Malai die.

326
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:23,160
You just have to put on a show.

327
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,730
You don't have to
wait for my answer.

328
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:33,170
I have to follow
your plan anyway, right?

329
00:26:33,603 --> 00:26:35,603
I'm alone in the world.

330
00:26:35,657 --> 00:26:37,177
I don't have any leverage.

331
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,320
Very smart, Ms. Ramphoei.

332
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,543
But don't worry, ma'am.

333
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,960
I already prepared your reward.

334
00:26:48,743 --> 00:26:49,840
If you succeed.

335
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,480
Yeah.

336
00:26:54,977 --> 00:26:56,804
If I didn't do as you asked,

337
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:59,890
I'd probably have ended up
in a ditch like Chaem.

338
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,280
I already told you
I didn't kill her.

339
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,623
You don't have to believe me.

340
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,800
And you have to stop
provoking Ms. Malai to doubt me.

341
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,840
If you insist
you didn't kill Chaem,

342
00:27:13,057 --> 00:27:14,990
then I insist
I didn't provoke Malai.

343
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:18,120
If you don't count
when I was drunk.

344
00:27:20,142 --> 00:27:21,142
If it wasn't you,

345
00:27:21,602 --> 00:27:23,815
then who provoked her to doubt me?

346
00:27:28,802 --> 00:27:29,802
Never mind.

347
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,030
Let's just say

348
00:27:31,223 --> 00:27:34,397
I want to live peacefully
in this house with Ms. Malai.

349
00:27:35,203 --> 00:27:37,776
You just have to stop acting out.

350
00:27:39,523 --> 00:27:41,720
If you weren't still useful to me,

351
00:27:42,043 --> 00:27:43,276
I wouldn't have indulged you.

352
00:27:51,777 --> 00:27:54,930
Don't you have an extra reward
for your son's mother, Dech?

353
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,650
Dech.

354
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,557
You're still young and fit.

355
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:05,960
You'll go out of your mind
waiting for that nun.

356
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,497
If you and I don't tell,

357
00:28:08,983 --> 00:28:10,240
no one will know.

358
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,150
Ow.

359
00:28:14,843 --> 00:28:16,280
You've got your money.

360
00:28:17,143 --> 00:28:19,430
If you're that hungry, go buy it.

361
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,730
But be careful of diseases.

362
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,200
You're foul-mouthed these days.

363
00:28:48,623 --> 00:28:49,880
I heard your boat capsized

364
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,730
on your way to make merit, Malai?

365
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,110
Yes, ma'am.

366
00:28:54,663 --> 00:28:57,063
Fortunately,
Dech rescued me in time.

367
00:28:58,483 --> 00:29:00,576
From the masters to the servants.

368
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,197
Malai,

369
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,610
you should invite monks
to bless this house.

370
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,077
Ranchuan.

371
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:07,657
My lord,

372
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:09,850
I really meant what I said.

373
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,280
Why would you stop me?

374
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:13,790
I agree, my lord.

375
00:29:14,977 --> 00:29:16,517
When I get the date,

376
00:29:16,857 --> 00:29:19,357
you two are invited
to the ceremony.

377
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:27,097
The viscount was right
to entrust this house to you.

378
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,080
It's been months.

379
00:29:29,657 --> 00:29:30,920
It still looks the same.

380
00:29:32,477 --> 00:29:33,720
You're right, my lord.

381
00:29:34,177 --> 00:29:35,350
I'm glad it's you.

382
00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:39,280
If it were up to that woman,
we'd have already sold this house.

383
00:29:44,247 --> 00:29:45,600
Since I'm here,

384
00:29:46,073 --> 00:29:49,087
can I take a look at this house's
the income and expenditure records?

385
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:51,400
I might have some suggestions.

386
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Yes, my lord.

387
00:29:57,473 --> 00:29:59,890
Dech's overseeing everything
for the viscount right now.

388
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:02,724
I look over the books
when I have time.

389
00:30:03,263 --> 00:30:05,363
If you have suggestions,

390
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,560
let me know, my lord.

391
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,289
You really are his close servant

392
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,080
who's served him for over a decade.

393
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,960
Having someone trustworthy

394
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,480
is a good thing.

395
00:30:18,847 --> 00:30:20,214
Then please come this way.

396
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:25,436
You go ahead and see
the viscount with Malai.

397
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:26,856
I'll join you later.

398
00:30:27,237 --> 00:30:28,237
Yes, my lord.

399
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,390
Please.

400
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:33,360
Let's go, ma'am.

401
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,730
I didn't know
you were educated enough

402
00:30:48,783 --> 00:30:51,197
to keep the books as well as
when the viscount was fine.

403
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:52,760
If not better.

404
00:30:53,183 --> 00:30:55,183
You're too kind, my lord.

405
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:59,480
The profit rose after the viscount
received his inheritance, my lord.

406
00:31:02,303 --> 00:31:03,303
Go on.

407
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,197
I bought and fixed old buildings,

408
00:31:06,403 --> 00:31:08,120
then let the government rent them.

409
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,883
As for farms,

410
00:31:09,977 --> 00:31:12,670
I've had them harvested
and sold the produce for income.

411
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,280
Better than letting them overgrow.

412
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,383
You're business smart.

413
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:20,240
Of course I have to praise you.

414
00:31:21,403 --> 00:31:22,800
It's the viscount's luck

415
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,490
to have such a faithful servant.

416
00:31:25,223 --> 00:31:26,263
Yes, my lord.

417
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:51,120
You're the only one

418
00:31:51,637 --> 00:31:53,317
who takes good care
of the viscount.

419
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,760
As for Ramphoei,

420
00:31:56,257 --> 00:31:57,760
does she even care?

421
00:31:58,143 --> 00:31:59,743
Let's not talk about her.

422
00:32:00,036 --> 00:32:02,400
As long as she doesn't
cause problems, I'm happy.

423
00:32:03,697 --> 00:32:04,697
True.

424
00:32:04,857 --> 00:32:07,194
The viscount finally has an heir,

425
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,480
instead of...

426
00:32:11,207 --> 00:32:12,907
I apologize, my lord.

427
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,454
I talk too much.

428
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,760
What did he say?

429
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,923
Can you understand?

430
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:25,800
I struggled at first

431
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,840
to understand his requests.

432
00:32:28,043 --> 00:32:30,400
But I'm getting a hold of it
because I use...

433
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:33,970
Use what?

434
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:35,337
Use...

435
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,883
Use my feelings and check the time

436
00:32:38,343 --> 00:32:41,043
what he wants at this hour.

437
00:32:43,603 --> 00:32:44,910
You've been here a while.

438
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,557
I haven't served you snack.

439
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,160
Forgive my manners.

440
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,450
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. We're family.

441
00:32:52,783 --> 00:32:54,560
Uh, I'll be right back, ma'am.

442
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,510
What do you want, my lord?

443
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,090
What do you want, my lord?

444
00:33:38,543 --> 00:33:40,310
You want these documents?

445
00:34:17,343 --> 00:34:18,343
The letters?

446
00:34:19,443 --> 00:34:20,443
The vowels?

447
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:28,481

448
00:34:28,903 --> 00:34:33,390
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

449
00:34:41,257 --> 00:34:42,257
Dech!

450
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,960
Hello, my lord.

451
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,736
You're probably
talking shop with Dech.

452
00:34:53,903 --> 00:34:55,316
I won't be long, my lord.

453
00:34:57,387 --> 00:35:00,024
Give me my daily allowance.
I have to go out soon.

454
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:19,897
Wait.

455
00:35:21,483 --> 00:35:22,483
Excuse me.

456
00:35:30,043 --> 00:35:31,680
Is this your month allowance?

457
00:35:34,363 --> 00:35:35,520
Daily allowance.

458
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,440
In case Dech's too afraid to answer.

459
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:40,320
You're spending this much money?

460
00:35:41,643 --> 00:35:43,000
Why can't I, my lord?

461
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:45,680
I have a viscount for a husband.

462
00:35:45,983 --> 00:35:48,509
I can't possibly live like a pauper

463
00:35:48,603 --> 00:35:50,680
or people will criticize me.

464
00:35:51,057 --> 00:35:52,616
They'll say you spend money

465
00:35:52,627 --> 00:35:54,720
like someone who forgets
her place, Ramphoei.

466
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,070
My lord,

467
00:35:56,297 --> 00:36:00,530
you can make Ms. Ranchuan
live as humbly as you want.

468
00:36:01,663 --> 00:36:02,663
We all know.

469
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,083
Your position is
lower than your brother's.

470
00:36:05,183 --> 00:36:06,960
And you got none of the fortune.

471
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,680
It's natural for you
to know your place.

472
00:36:11,577 --> 00:36:12,664
Ms. Ramphoei,

473
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:14,440
apologize right now.

474
00:36:14,523 --> 00:36:16,703
Jeez, sorry, Dech.

475
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,777
I don't consider myself
related to...

476
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,000
poor people.

477
00:36:22,297 --> 00:36:25,137
I asked you for help once

478
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,143
but you ignored me.

479
00:36:27,563 --> 00:36:29,760
I don't have to respect you either.

480
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,960
Goodbye, my lord.

481
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:47,403
I apologize for Ms. Ramphoei
disrespecting you, my lord.

482
00:36:47,823 --> 00:36:50,040
Forget it. She was born wicked.

483
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,040
Nothing will improve her.

484
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,157
It's a shame the viscount
took a degenerate as a mistress.

485
00:36:57,897 --> 00:36:58,897
Let's get back to work.

486
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:00,617
Yes, sir.

487
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,190
So most of the house's expenditure

488
00:37:10,403 --> 00:37:12,290
is Ramphoei's allowance?

489
00:37:14,017 --> 00:37:16,017
Because the other
expenses look reasonable.

490
00:37:17,797 --> 00:37:18,797
Yes, my lord.

491
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,383
In exchange for Ms. Ramphoei
no longer causing problems

492
00:37:21,502 --> 00:37:22,536
and harassing people,

493
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,160
I have to pay her.

494
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,490
I understand.

495
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,650
The letters?

496
00:37:48,777 --> 00:37:49,777
The vowels?

497
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,350
You want to talk to me, my lord?

498
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,120
We finally understand each other.

499
00:38:05,723 --> 00:38:07,280
Too bad Malai's not here.

500
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:09,000
Or I would have understood faster.

501
00:38:09,903 --> 00:38:10,903
But earlier,

502
00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:13,437
why didn't she say
there was something like this?

503
00:38:14,561 --> 00:38:16,442
How do we start?

504
00:38:19,823 --> 00:38:21,363
The snack's ready, Ms...

505
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,230
Malai.

506
00:38:23,597 --> 00:38:24,624
Come help me.

507
00:38:24,823 --> 00:38:26,160
How do you use this?

508
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,510
Uh..

509
00:38:32,957 --> 00:38:33,957
Ms. Ranchuan.

510
00:38:36,077 --> 00:38:37,077
What have you been...

511
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,917
saying to the viscount, ma'am?

512
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,210
Nothing yet.

513
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,120
It took me a while
to understand his request.

514
00:38:47,377 --> 00:38:49,377
Did you make this table yourself?

515
00:38:49,757 --> 00:38:50,757
So...

516
00:38:51,217 --> 00:38:52,576
What have you two talked about?

517
00:38:53,243 --> 00:38:54,243
Not a lot, ma'am.

518
00:38:54,937 --> 00:38:57,210
I let His Lordship look at

519
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:59,840
each letter and watch his eyes

520
00:38:59,903 --> 00:39:01,440
if it's the right letter,

521
00:39:01,897 --> 00:39:03,444
then I compound each word.

522
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:06,000
- But I stopped using this method.
- Eh?

523
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,840
Why?

524
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Uh...

525
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:12,830
It took a lot of time and...

526
00:39:12,923 --> 00:39:14,350
sometimes I got the wrong words.

527
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,843
So I misunderstood him.

528
00:39:16,109 --> 00:39:18,577
The method I told you earlier
is a lot better.

529
00:39:19,456 --> 00:39:20,456
No wonder.

530
00:39:20,997 --> 00:39:24,783
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
earlier about this method.

531
00:39:25,017 --> 00:39:27,017
Don't mention it. It's nothing.

532
00:39:27,137 --> 00:39:28,137
I understand.

533
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,440
If you get the words wrong
and cause misunderstanding,

534
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,720
things will be hectic.

535
00:39:43,157 --> 00:39:44,157
My lord.

536
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,650
How is he?

537
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,197
Like you see, my lord.

538
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,823
He knows what's going on
but he can't respond.

539
00:39:54,023 --> 00:39:57,443
My lord, Malai said
she prepared snack for us.

540
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,350
Would you like that now?

541
00:39:59,843 --> 00:40:00,843
Sure.

542
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:03,917
This way, please.

543
00:40:27,437 --> 00:40:29,280
I'm sorry, my lord,

544
00:40:29,563 --> 00:40:30,563
for stopping you.

545
00:40:32,183 --> 00:40:35,596
I can't let you accuse Dech
to Ms. Ranchuan or anyone else.

546
00:40:37,237 --> 00:40:39,520
You fooled me once, my lord.

547
00:40:40,422 --> 00:40:41,720
Please don't do it again.

00:41:12,727 --> 00:41:16,320
I saw the letter table
Malai made to talk to the viscount.

549
00:41:16,347 --> 00:41:18,347
My only happiness is Ms. Malai,

550
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,593
yet you took her away!

551
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,880
What do you want from me?!

552
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
You ingrate!

553
00:41:22,531 --> 00:41:24,531
I'll rip off your mask, Dech.

554
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,560
Mark my words!

555
00:41:26,147 --> 00:41:27,180
Ms. Malai, I...

556
00:41:28,983 --> 00:41:30,265
Even though I burnt you,

557
00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:31,463
you still regrow.

558
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,410
Please forgive me, my lord.
