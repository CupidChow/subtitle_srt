"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 14)

19
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,390
I swear that

20
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:01,859
I will only love

21
00:02:01,884 --> 00:02:03,765
and remain faithful to the viscount.

22
00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:05,007
However,

23
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,718
if Dech were to break that oath,

24
00:02:06,797 --> 00:02:08,997
he shall meet a gruesome demise.

25
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:10,226
How about allowing me to

26
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:11,414
sleep with Ms. Malai instead?

27
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,430
Saeng!

28
00:02:12,852 --> 00:02:13,773
Dech!

29
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:15,359
I believe you are actually angry at me

30
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:17,351
because I am aware of your intentions.

31
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:20,539
You need not oblige

32
00:02:20,564 --> 00:02:22,078
to sleep with Dech any longer.

33
00:02:22,406 --> 00:02:24,164
I will have Dech sleep with Ramphoei.

34
00:02:41,063 --> 00:02:42,398
My lord, are you granting

35
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:43,453
me all of these?

36
00:02:43,547 --> 00:02:44,632
Indeed, I am.

37
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:46,460
I'm fair, after all.

38
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:49,023
Malai received them previously,

39
00:02:49,523 --> 00:02:50,859
and now it is your turn.

40
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:56,029
Thank you, my lord.

41
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,156
These gifts are but a fraction.

42
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:01,109
My father's wealth

43
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:03,539
is hundreds of times greater than this.

44
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,317
Truly, my lord?

45
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:06,492
If only I

46
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:08,414
were to inherit my father's inheritance.

47
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:10,492
May you receive it in due time, my lord.

48
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:24,880
I am simply concerned, my lord.

49
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,169
If Dech fails to impregnate Ms. Malai,

50
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:28,458
how will you provide

51
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:29,887
your father with an heir?

52
00:03:29,912 --> 00:03:31,670
I will have Dech sleep with Ramphoei.

53
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:44,801
Why you little...

54
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:48,567
Saeng!

55
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,020
Saeng! You scum!

56
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:52,403
What on earth are you doing?

57
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:55,059
If Dech hadn't dodged in time,

58
00:03:55,356 --> 00:03:56,965
it might have cost him his life!

59
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,317
It would be better

60
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:00,536
if someone like him were to die!

61
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,794
- The one who deserves to die is you!
- Wait!

62
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:04,325
Hey!

63
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:08,185
Hey!

64
00:04:08,294 --> 00:04:09,676
If the viscount were to discover

65
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:11,075
the extent of your actions,

66
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:13,411
you would have been the one to die.

67
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:15,294
If something happens to Dech,

68
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,630
I will testify for him.

69
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:18,669
I wonder if the viscount

70
00:04:18,685 --> 00:04:19,958
would spare your life

71
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,134
once he learns of your deeds?

72
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:25,465
Curses!

73
00:04:25,903 --> 00:04:27,300
Why are you so meddling?

74
00:04:31,596 --> 00:04:32,995
What's gotten into him?

75
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:35,651
Why did he go on such a rampage?

76
00:04:37,332 --> 00:04:38,573
A narrow-minded

77
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:40,245
and envious individual

78
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,378
can make a mountain out of a molehill.

79
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:45,464
Thank you.

80
00:04:45,814 --> 00:04:46,901
No trouble at all.

81
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:50,019
If something happens again,

82
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:51,269
just say the word,

83
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:52,300
and I'll assist you.

84
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,063
I've long found him to be insufferable.

85
00:04:56,785 --> 00:04:57,785
Sure.

86
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,067
No!

87
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,614
I cannot bring myself to

88
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,582
sleep with Ms. Ramphoei.

89
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:23,879
Why not?

90
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:25,153
She is also a woman.

91
00:05:25,184 --> 00:05:26,606
Because I do not love Ms. Ramphoei.

92
00:05:26,622 --> 00:05:29,022
Does that mean you love Malai, then?

93
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:31,832
No, it's not like that, my lord.

94
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:32,871
What I mean is that

95
00:05:32,888 --> 00:05:34,067
sleeping with Ms. Ramphoei

96
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:35,231
would conflict too much

97
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:36,129
with my feelings.

98
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:37,356
It has to happen.

99
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:39,442
Want me to reveal the truth

100
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:40,371
about us sleeping together?

101
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:45,535
I haven't turned a blind eye

102
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,575
to be unaware about

103
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,715
how you feel toward Malai.

104
00:05:48,684 --> 00:05:49,739
I also wonder

105
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,770
how Malai feels about

106
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:54,950
having a true husband and the
husband she wedded sleep together.

107
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:58,520
I wonder if the pure and innocent Malai

108
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:00,918
would be able to accept this situation.

109
00:06:03,638 --> 00:06:06,082
And don't you trust me, my lord?

110
00:06:06,677 --> 00:06:08,762
Why not let me handle this job instead?

111
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:09,817
I am aware of

112
00:06:10,442 --> 00:06:11,817
how loyal you are to me,

113
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:14,762
but you are foolish and jealous.

114
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:16,864
I don't want a child like you.

115
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:18,371
When it grows up, it might

116
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:19,567
create problems for me

117
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,715
just like its father did.

118
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:23,293
Don't aim too high

119
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,965
and be satisfied with where you are now.

120
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,143
You desire me to sleep with another man

121
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:48,846
to bear you a child, my lord?

122
00:06:49,003 --> 00:06:50,354
You heard correctly.

123
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:52,744
I am unable to have children

124
00:06:52,753 --> 00:06:53,861
because I'm infertile.

125
00:06:56,971 --> 00:06:58,330
If you cannot do it,

126
00:06:58,799 --> 00:06:59,908
both you and I will be

127
00:07:00,392 --> 00:07:01,502
deprived of any inheritance

128
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,525
from my father.

129
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:04,729
But if you succeed,

130
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,330
surely, you are aware of

131
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:07,455
what you will gain.

132
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:10,841
I never had any intention

133
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:12,436
of taking your wealth, my lord.

134
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,653
If I had to sleep with others,

135
00:07:15,037 --> 00:07:16,466
I refuse, my lord.

136
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,114
Ramphoei,

137
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:20,880
I wish it wasn't like this either,

138
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,638
but there's no other option.

139
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:23,731
If we don't do this,

140
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:25,496
I might become penniless.

141
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:27,638
If that's the case, I'll endure

142
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:29,575
the difficult times with you, my lord.

143
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:30,942
But allowing me to become

144
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:31,997
a loose woman

145
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:34,302
and sleep with someone else beside you,

146
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:36,162
I could never do that.

147
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:39,320
You're not doing it

148
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,154
because you desire to be unfaithful,

149
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:43,202
you're doing it because it's necessary.

150
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:46,796
What about Ms. Malai, my lord?

151
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:49,398
Why don't you let her do it, my lord?

152
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,015
Oh...

153
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:53,655
Is this because

154
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:55,195
I'm a villager's daughter, is that it?

155
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:57,007
That's why you dare doing this.

156
00:07:57,047 --> 00:07:59,713
It's not like that, Ramphoei. I just...

157
00:08:00,211 --> 00:08:01,452
Just what, my lord?

158
00:08:02,226 --> 00:08:04,257
Did you assume I would be so low

159
00:08:05,163 --> 00:08:07,097
as to do anything for wealth?

160
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:11,077
That's good then,

161
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:13,898
now I have learned about your feelings.

162
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:16,335
You truly look down on me.

163
00:08:18,226 --> 00:08:20,765
Please listen to me, Ramphoei.

164
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:22,351
I won't listen, my lord!

165
00:08:22,953 --> 00:08:24,054
The more I listen,

166
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,202
the more I realize

167
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:26,907
I mean nothing to you!

168
00:08:28,554 --> 00:08:30,226
Ramphoei!

169
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:31,765
Please hear me out,

170
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:32,905
I'm not done speaking!

171
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:34,640
Ramphoei...

172
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:03,837
Dech!

173
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:05,884
After you're done bathing,

174
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:07,415
help me carry the rice bags.

175
00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:09,930
Yeah, I'll go now.

176
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,323
Do not dawdle.

177
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:12,415
Yeah, yeah.

178
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:26,157
Ramphoei, please hear me out.

179
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:28,188
I have nothing more to

180
00:09:28,212 --> 00:09:29,352
say to you, my lord.

181
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:31,829
Ramphoei,

182
00:09:32,181 --> 00:09:33,610
I won't let you go anywhere

183
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:35,548
until we discuss this.

184
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:38,464
I've already told you, no, my lord.

185
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:41,602
Ramphoei.

186
00:09:41,986 --> 00:09:43,305
I'm begging you.

187
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,743
If I don't have an heir,

188
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:47,563
you won't get to live here anymore.

189
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:50,055
Even though I hold a government position

190
00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:51,173
and have some wealth,

191
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:52,376
it's not enough to live

192
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,587
comfortably forever.

193
00:09:55,173 --> 00:09:57,134
But I'm not comfortable with the idea,

194
00:09:57,408 --> 00:09:59,782
Having me sleeping with some stranger

195
00:09:59,822 --> 00:10:01,502
with an unknown origin.

196
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:04,313
If he were to gossip about it,

197
00:10:04,642 --> 00:10:06,555
wouldn't I get in trouble, my lord?

198
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,900
Ramphoei.

199
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:12,126
You don't have to worry about that.

200
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:13,798
The person I would allow you

201
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:15,548
to be with is not a stranger

202
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,071
but Dech.

203
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:19,649
I assure you he can be trusted.

204
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:27,384
It's even worse to sleep with a servant!

205
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:29,305
I refuse, my lord.

206
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:30,954
Even though Dech is a servant,

207
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:33,032
he is a good person whom I trust.

208
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:34,532
Besides,

209
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:35,930
I'm not asking you

210
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:37,524
to be with Dech all the time.

211
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:38,923
I just want you to

212
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,095
have one child for me.

213
00:10:42,868 --> 00:10:44,102
No, my lord.

214
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,180
Being to be a secondary wife to

215
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:48,226
Ms. Malai is already more than enough,

216
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:49,696
but don't make me a woman

217
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:51,196
with multiple husbands, please.

218
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:54,126
Ramphoei.

219
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:56,845
Ramphoei.

220
00:11:15,861 --> 00:11:17,384
Who would accept so readily?

221
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:20,243
Once the prey has entered the trap,

222
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:22,790
I will reap more benefits.

223
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:27,411
Hurry up.

224
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:35,771
Hey,

225
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:36,802
you lot,

226
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:37,825
hurry up.

227
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:45,841
Hey, Dech.

228
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,833
Yes, Mr. Kam?

229
00:11:57,841 --> 00:11:59,051
Hurry up, you.

230
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:16,817
What are you looking at, Ramphoei?

231
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,990
No, it's nothing.

232
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,376
Is something troubling you, Ms. Malai?

233
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:11,306
I haven't broached the topic of

234
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:12,634
divorce with the Viscount yet.

235
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:14,556
Every time I try,

236
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:16,110
he insists on

237
00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:18,110
maintaining our marital bond.

238
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:23,256
Though my feelings for him have waned,

239
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,896
he continues to treat me kindly.

240
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:29,041
I don't know how to tell him, Dech.

241
00:13:35,786 --> 00:13:37,371
There is no need to feel guilty.

242
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:40,051
It's alright to take your time.

243
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,481
So I'll have enough time to save money.

244
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:46,864
But I don't want it to be like this.

245
00:13:49,973 --> 00:13:51,012
As long as I am still

246
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:52,137
the Viscount's wife,

247
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:55,239
coming to you like this feels like

248
00:13:55,255 --> 00:13:56,473
I am having an affair.

249
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,879
It doesn't sit well with me.

250
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,504
Please endure a while longer.

251
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,109
I am confident that a day will arrive

252
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:19,140
when we can build our life together.

253
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:21,202
When that time comes,

254
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:23,678
I wish to possess sufficient funds

255
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:26,101
to provide you with a comfortable life.

256
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,750
Oh, Dech.

257
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,335
Even if you have no money,

258
00:14:32,883 --> 00:14:33,883
I have no problem.

259
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:38,748
I only ask for your love.

260
00:14:41,883 --> 00:14:43,109
In that case, Ms. Malai,

261
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,015
bear with the circumstances

262
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,773
for the sake of our love.

263
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,007
Even if the Viscount doesn't

264
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:50,389
allow me to see you,

265
00:14:50,414 --> 00:14:53,163
I only ask that you believe in love

266
00:14:53,867 --> 00:14:54,945
as you've professed.

267
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,187
When the moment of liberation arrives,

268
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,859
I pledge you won't regret

269
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:04,601
choosing to love someone like me.

270
00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:44,140
I've ordered this specifically for you.

271
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:46,139
It's renowned as the best restaurant.

272
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:50,515
You must have frequented this place

273
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,952
with Ms. Malai, my lord?

274
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:00,576
Spare me mentions of others, Ramphoei.

275
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:06,357
But I cannot help

276
00:16:06,373 --> 00:16:07,584
dwelling on it, my lord.

277
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,256
No matter what, I always seem

278
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,857
to be second to Ms. Malai.

279
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:15,631
I don't even have a ring on my finger.

280
00:16:19,873 --> 00:16:21,178
Do you see, my lord?

281
00:16:21,342 --> 00:16:23,092
Even for trivial matters like this,

282
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,037
it appears my value goes unnoticed.

283
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:26,436
Geez...

284
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,904
it's just a small matter.

285
00:16:28,038 --> 00:16:29,303
After we finish our meal,

286
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:31,412
I will accompany you to

287
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:32,920
select any ring you desire,

288
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:34,170
regardless of the cost.

289
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:35,881
I'll get it for you. What do you say?

290
00:16:37,905 --> 00:16:39,725
I cannot remain upset with my lord

291
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,139
if you make such an offer.

292
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:44,063
Come, let us dine.

293
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,143
That is all.

294
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:49,235
Are you certain that

295
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,063
you've acquired everything you desired?

296
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
Yes.

297
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,404
Thank you very much, my lord.

298
00:17:58,189 --> 00:17:59,189
Ramphoei,

299
00:17:59,689 --> 00:18:00,689
well...

300
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,189
I must confess something to you.

301
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:09,642
I exhausted all my funds

302
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,767
to procure those items.

303
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,750
Pardon me, my lord?

304
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:20,337
Without the inheritance from my father,

305
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:23,259
the earnings from my government position

306
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:24,471
wouldn't suffice

307
00:18:24,495 --> 00:18:26,118
to indulge you in such luxuries.

308
00:18:30,672 --> 00:18:32,593
Geez, my lord,

309
00:18:32,874 --> 00:18:34,648
as long as you treat me well,

310
00:18:34,664 --> 00:18:35,664
it's enough.

311
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:40,140
I don't anticipate frequent indulgence.

312
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:48,039
Although you say that,

313
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:50,835
having a legitimate heir

314
00:18:51,117 --> 00:18:52,398
would secure my father's

315
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:53,710
considerable wealth.

316
00:18:54,078 --> 00:18:55,507
With that,

317
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:57,429
our living conditions

318
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,351
would remain unchanged.

319
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:01,804
I only hope

320
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,734
that you can assist me in this matter.

321
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,093
However, what you're asking

322
00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:07,617
is quite demanding, my lord.

323
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,187
It would entail compromising my dignity

324
00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:11,781
and emotions if you expect me

325
00:19:11,813 --> 00:19:13,265
to sleep with another man.

326
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,586
If I must comply,

327
00:19:19,227 --> 00:19:21,617
may I make a request, my lord?

328
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:29,140
Dech!

329
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,156
You must do it!

330
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:33,101
No!

331
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,110
I order you to do it, you must comply!

332
00:19:36,078 --> 00:19:37,078
I refuse!

333
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:42,141
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

334
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:47,102
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

335
00:19:48,055 --> 00:19:50,250
Ramphoei has agreed to what I requested.

336
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:53,694
Tomorrow night, you can go to her room.

337
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:55,844
If that's the case,

338
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,101
may I make a request?

339
00:19:57,938 --> 00:19:59,094
What is it now?

340
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,422
Ramphoei made a request,

341
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:01,562
now you're asking for one.

342
00:20:01,578 --> 00:20:02,687
So many conditions.

343
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:04,172
I'm not asking for a lot.

344
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:05,969
But in exchange for allowing you

345
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:07,054
to take my child,

346
00:20:07,078 --> 00:20:08,422
I request a sum of money to

347
00:20:08,447 --> 00:20:09,914
establish myself independently.

348
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:11,672
Establish yourself?

349
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,164
Are you planning to leave me?

350
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:17,931
Yes, my lord.

351
00:20:18,688 --> 00:20:20,164
Once this matter is resolved,

352
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,422
I implore you to allow me

353
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,805
to depart with Fueang.

354
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:24,336
I assure you that

355
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:27,183
our agreement will remain confidential.

356
00:20:29,883 --> 00:20:30,906
I do not believe you.

357
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:32,492
You're not departing with Fueang,

358
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,828
you're leaving with Malai!

359
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:34,875
I won't permit it!

360
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:35,937
Then, I refuse to

361
00:20:35,946 --> 00:20:37,055
sleep with Ms. Ramphoei!

362
00:20:37,094 --> 00:20:37,789
Dech!

363
00:20:40,328 --> 00:20:41,211
You must do it!

364
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,148
No!

365
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:44,047
I order you to do it, you must comply!

366
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,118
I refuse!

367
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,313
You must!

368
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:49,102
I refuse!

369
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:50,297
Do you think

370
00:20:50,305 --> 00:20:52,140
I want you to be with someone else?

371
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,952
I have taken care of you,

372
00:20:54,227 --> 00:20:55,898
but you have become ungrateful!

373
00:21:14,868 --> 00:21:16,609
I have never forgotten your kindness,

374
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,953
but what you're asking,

375
00:21:17,961 --> 00:21:19,601
my lord even can't bring himself to do.

376
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:21,226
Why do you think others

377
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:22,923
can do it in your stead, my lord?

378
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,750
Dech!

379
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:26,406
You swore to me that

380
00:21:26,774 --> 00:21:27,797
if you don't love me,

381
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:28,836
you'd meet a brutal end.

382
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,648
Yet you dare speak to me like this?

383
00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:36,262
I genuinely love you, my lord,

384
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:37,319
I won't deny that.

385
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:41,686
But I love you as my lord.

386
00:21:44,124 --> 00:21:45,802
If you don't promise to grant me

387
00:21:45,827 --> 00:21:47,335
and Fueang freedom,

388
00:21:47,624 --> 00:21:48,702
I absolutely won't sleep

389
00:21:48,718 --> 00:21:49,811
with Ms. Ramphoei.

390
00:21:58,015 --> 00:21:59,061
Fine!

391
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:02,905
If you desire freedom,

392
00:22:03,382 --> 00:22:04,502
I will grant it.

393
00:22:11,187 --> 00:22:12,707
Thank you very much, my lord.

394
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:55,858
Why do you find the time to

395
00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:56,889
bring me to make merit today?

396
00:22:57,671 --> 00:22:58,749
The viscount is engaged in

397
00:22:58,773 --> 00:23:00,460
official duties at the ministry all day.

398
00:23:00,468 --> 00:23:02,045
He will spend the night there.

399
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:04,108
I thought it would be a good opportunity

400
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,999
for us to spend some time together.

401
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:09,756
I thought there was something going on.

402
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,397
Typically, the viscount

403
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:12,569
only summons you.

404
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:18,622
Is there something you wish to tell me?

405
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,560
Not at all.

406
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:22,411
Let us find something to eat instead.

407
00:23:45,578 --> 00:23:47,055
You invited me here to eat,

408
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,633
but I haven't seen you

409
00:23:48,641 --> 00:23:49,664
take a single bite.

410
00:23:49,735 --> 00:23:51,250
Just watching you, Ms. Malai,

411
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:53,625
makes me happy enough

412
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,008
that I don't need to eat anything.

413
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,703
Who taught you to talk like that?

414
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,633
I'm able to feel embarrassed, you know?

415
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:04,680
But I enjoy teasing you.

416
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:07,687
When you blush, you are so adorable.

417
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,075
If you're full,

418
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,621
then let's go.

419
00:24:18,661 --> 00:24:19,645
Yes.

420
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:20,789
Check, please.

421
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:21,817
Yes.

422
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:23,160
You don't have to pay.

423
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:24,496
I'll take care of it.

424
00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:26,661
No, really. You keep the money.

425
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,942
It's alright.

426
00:24:28,364 --> 00:24:29,848
Let me treat you this time.

427
00:24:31,778 --> 00:24:33,137
As you wish, then.

428
00:24:35,442 --> 00:24:36,606
Here you go.

429
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:37,669
Thank you.

430
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,073
But you really don't have to do this.

431
00:24:45,449 --> 00:24:46,957
I just want to see you happy,

432
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:47,966
that's all.

433
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,606
Just being with you

434
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:52,168
is enough for me.

435
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:53,364
It won't be long now.

436
00:24:54,005 --> 00:24:55,005
I promise.

437
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,637
Dech, where did you go for so long?

438
00:25:48,012 --> 00:25:50,028
You went to buy sugar sculpture candy.

439
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:51,379
Take it, please.

440
00:25:52,341 --> 00:25:53,934
Do you think that I'm a kid?

441
00:25:54,442 --> 00:25:56,496
I quit eating it a long time ago.

442
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:00,668
I saw someone paddling by selling it.

443
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,621
I wanted to buy it and eat it with you.

444
00:26:05,387 --> 00:26:07,067
Frowning just like a kid.

445
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:09,200
I'll eat it with you, then.

446
00:26:58,693 --> 00:27:00,459
I want us to be together like this

447
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,263
until we're old.

448
00:27:05,482 --> 00:27:07,037
Do you think it's a good idea?

449
00:27:09,154 --> 00:27:10,357
When the time comes,

450
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:12,779
who will support whom?

451
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:16,732
Ms. Malai,

452
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:19,709
I can't even carry you anymore.

453
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,896
Like this?

454
00:27:21,921 --> 00:27:22,921
Dech!

455
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:25,310
Do you think I'll be so heavy

456
00:27:25,335 --> 00:27:27,802
that you can't carry me when I'm old?

457
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:29,467
Perhaps?

458
00:27:29,904 --> 00:27:30,990
Dech!

459
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,075
Ms. Malai,

460
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:42,615
please don't be upset.

461
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,505
Even if you grow old and heavy,

462
00:27:47,162 --> 00:27:48,599
I will love you

463
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:50,754
just the same.

464
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,187
What are you saying?

465
00:28:04,662 --> 00:28:06,325
I want you to know this,

466
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:08,388
no matter what happens,

467
00:28:09,443 --> 00:28:10,591
my heart

468
00:28:11,021 --> 00:28:12,677
belongs solely to Ms. Malai.

469
00:29:11,576 --> 00:29:16,506
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

470
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:21,461
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

471
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:35,419
I'll have you sleep with Ramphoei.

472
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:38,849
You must do it!

473
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:39,794
No!

474
00:29:39,803 --> 00:29:41,803
I order you to do it, you must comply!

475
00:29:42,826 --> 00:29:43,881
I also wonder

476
00:29:44,046 --> 00:29:45,483
how Malai feels about

477
00:29:45,508 --> 00:29:46,734
having a true husband and

478
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:48,376
the husband she wedded sleeps together.

479
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,321
If you don't promise to grant me

480
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:47,854
and Fueang freedom,

481
00:30:48,143 --> 00:30:49,221
I absolutely won't sleep

482
00:30:49,237 --> 00:30:50,330
with Ms. Ramphoei.

483
00:30:50,573 --> 00:30:51,619
Fine!

484
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:53,503
If you desire freedom,

485
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:54,973
I will grant it.

486
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:03,596
Please forgive me

487
00:31:04,635 --> 00:31:05,635
Ms. Malai.

488
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,244
Honestly, I didn't want to do this.

489
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,018
I only agreed because of the Viscount.

490
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:00,719
Yes, ma'am.

491
00:32:06,703 --> 00:32:08,703
I will have you know that

492
00:32:09,086 --> 00:32:11,289
I'm not smitten over a servant like you.

493
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,641
Yes, ma'am.

494
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:20,173
I apologize.

495
00:32:45,018 --> 00:32:46,298
On the bed, Dech.

496
00:33:02,377 --> 00:33:03,377
Dech,

497
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:04,401
kiss me.

498
00:33:21,573 --> 00:33:23,236
I want you to know this,

499
00:33:23,979 --> 00:33:25,299
no matter what happens,

500
00:33:26,026 --> 00:33:27,174
my heart

501
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:29,197
belongs solely to Ms. Malai.

502
00:33:35,674 --> 00:33:37,213
What's wrong with you, Dech?

503
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:38,839
I cannot do it, ma'am.

504
00:33:41,111 --> 00:33:42,556
I will take my leave, ma'am.

505
00:33:45,994 --> 00:33:47,291
Take it easy, Dech.

506
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,986
If you go out now

507
00:33:50,011 --> 00:33:52,064
and someone sees you, it won't be good.

508
00:33:52,768 --> 00:33:53,517
But...

509
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:54,635
No buts, Dech.

510
00:33:55,057 --> 00:33:56,588
It's better if you stay in this room

511
00:33:56,604 --> 00:33:57,642
with me until morning.

512
00:33:57,658 --> 00:33:58,799
Even if we don't do it,

513
00:33:58,807 --> 00:33:59,853
no one will know.

514
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,377
But if you leave now

515
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:02,885
and run into someone,

516
00:34:02,994 --> 00:34:04,713
and it reaches the Viscount's ears,

517
00:34:04,987 --> 00:34:06,502
both of us will be in trouble.

518
00:34:12,862 --> 00:34:14,205
Geez, Dech.

519
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,306
I could get in trouble too.

520
00:34:17,401 --> 00:34:19,025
I'm not trying to deceive you.

521
00:34:19,596 --> 00:34:21,830
Just stay with me here until morning.

522
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,650
In that case,

523
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:27,478
I'll sleep on the floor, ma'am.

524
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:28,885
Sure, whatever makes you

525
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:29,924
feel comfortable.

526
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:31,189
I'm not forcing you.

527
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:12,317
Ms. Ramphoei, what are you doing?

528
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,317
Lighting the frankincense.

529
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,347
Where are you rushing off to, Dech?

530
00:35:39,426 --> 00:35:41,082
Please let me go, Ms. Ramphoei!

531
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,355
Dear Dech,

532
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,152
don't act this way with your wife.

533
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,410
Please don't call me

534
00:35:45,441 --> 00:35:46,441
that way, Ms. Ramphoei.

535
00:35:46,793 --> 00:35:48,253
I am not your husband.

538
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:16,117
Ms. Ramphoei, what are you doing?

539
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,117
Lighting the frankincense.

540
00:36:43,516 --> 00:36:44,976
It smells nice, right?

541
00:36:54,854 --> 00:36:55,854
Yes, ma'am.

542
00:39:12,023 --> 00:39:13,023
My Ms. Ramphoei...

543
00:39:28,938 --> 00:39:29,938
My Ms. Ramphoei...

544
00:39:35,781 --> 00:39:37,585
May I kiss you, Ms. Ramphoei?

545
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:48,539
Ms. Ramphoei!

546
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:51,039
Where are you rushing off to, Dech?

547
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:53,281
Please let me go, Ms. Ramphoei!

548
00:40:55,406 --> 00:40:56,828
Geez, Dech.

549
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,180
Dear Dech,

550
00:40:58,391 --> 00:41:00,140
don't act this way with your wife.

551
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:01,406
Please don't call me

552
00:41:01,445 --> 00:41:02,795
that way, Ms. Ramphoei.

553
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,226
I am not your husband.

554
00:41:04,734 --> 00:41:06,140
Why can't I?

555
00:41:08,492 --> 00:41:11,945
We did it last night, after all.

556
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,023
Honestly, you are

557
00:41:15,257 --> 00:41:17,257
much better than the Viscount.

558
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,773
It's just you weren't as passionate.

559
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:26,390
You are the Viscount's wife,

560
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,976
you shouldn't speak like that.

561
00:41:28,883 --> 00:41:30,390
But I just did.

562
00:41:31,016 --> 00:41:32,016
Why,

563
00:41:32,547 --> 00:41:33,827
could it be that

564
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,468
you are going to

565
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,805
shut my lips with yours?

566
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,180
Hey!

567
00:41:38,648 --> 00:41:41,921
You are shameless, not at all
suited to be the Viscount's wife.

568
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,312
If that's the case,

569
00:41:44,641 --> 00:41:46,578
I'm more suitable to be your wife then.

570
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:47,603
Hey!

571
00:42:11,727 --> 00:42:13,367
Even if the world were to end,

572
00:42:13,392 --> 00:42:15,204
my desire is to remain with you, Malai.

573
00:42:15,891 --> 00:42:17,914
I place no trust in your words, my lord.

574
00:42:19,296 --> 00:42:20,544
In the end, my lord,

575
00:42:20,568 --> 00:42:22,013
you still need to resort to

576
00:42:22,038 --> 00:42:23,718

577
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,695

00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,883
