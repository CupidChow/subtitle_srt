It's not your fault.

54
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,672
It's me who needs to apologize.

55
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,848
Please forgive me,

56
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:18,415
Ms. Malai.

57
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:28,523
I was right about Dech.

58
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:46,379
But if this keeps up…

59
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:48,739
when will Malai get pregnant?

60
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:23,375
I'm sorry, my lord.

61
00:11:25,758 --> 00:11:26,758
Malai,

62
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:28,367
are you sick?

63
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:30,542
I'm fine.

64
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:35,596
Are you sure?

65
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,242
You don't look fine.

66
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:41,439
Drink some orange juice.
You'll feel refreshed.

67
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,036
I'd rather not.

68
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:47,836
I'm gonna take a walk
in the garden.

69
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:56,743
What happened last night?

70
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,332
Why does Ms. Malai seem unsettled?

71
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:00,719
How should I know?

72
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:02,808
Go do your job, Fueang!

73
00:12:04,295 --> 00:12:05,295
Yes, sir.

74
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:06,868
I'm going.

75
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:08,525
You've visited only Ms. Malai.

76
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:11,476
Haven't you thought I'd be lonely?

77
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:16,008
I know that what I asked of you
wasn't a small matter.

78
00:13:16,948 --> 00:13:18,675
And I don't trivialize it but…

79
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:20,622
But what?

80
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:25,854

81
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:30,854

82
00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:35,192
What do you think
is wrong with her?

83
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:38,887
When did you get here so quietly?

84
00:13:39,512 --> 00:13:41,778
It doesn't matter when I got here.

85
00:13:42,285 --> 00:13:43,285
There.

86
00:13:43,598 --> 00:13:45,323
I'm worried about Ms. Malai.

87
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:49,353
How should I know
our master's business?

88
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:53,124
You're a servant. It's okay
to worry about our masters.

89
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,393
There, look at Ms. Malai.

90
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:57,599
She's so distracted.

91
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,614
How will she fight Ramphoei
when feeling this down? Huh?

92
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,007
No one wants to live

93
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,098
a life without honor.

94
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:08,034
I used to think

95
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:11,138
I'd use that poison I got
from the huntsman in the north,

96
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,200
put it on a knife
and cut my own throat.

97
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,153
Don't jinx yourself.

98
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:18,293
Don't talk about death.

99
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:21,546
I was just babbling.

100
00:14:22,053 --> 00:14:23,857
Don't you worry, Fueang.

101
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:27,407
Who jokes about death?

102
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,821
Or if you really want to die,

103
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,274
why would you waste time
putting the poison on a knife?

104
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:34,646
Why wouldn't you just drink it?

105
00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:38,147
Drinking it
will leave you paralyzed.

106
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:39,773
That'd be hell on earth.

107
00:14:42,472 --> 00:14:43,859
Where's that poison?

108
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:46,298
Give it to me. I'll throw it out.

109
00:14:46,606 --> 00:14:48,249
Why would I give it to you?

110
00:15:05,826 --> 00:15:06,826
Come in.

111
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:14,077
What, Saeng?

112
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,637
I didn't send for you.

113
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,596
The medicine you asked to me to get

114
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:20,087
to feign serious illness.

115
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:23,314
Did it have anything to do with
Ms. Malai crying in the garden?

116
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:25,047
Malai was crying?

117
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:26,384
Yes.

118
00:15:26,822 --> 00:15:28,976
But I haven't figured it out

119
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,361
why you pretended to be sick

120
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:33,621
and why it made
Ms. Malai that upset.

121
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:36,588
It was my fault.

122
00:15:37,677 --> 00:15:39,861
I forced Malai
to have a child with Dech.

123
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:42,728
What?

124
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:45,325
Why did you have to do that?

125
00:15:46,272 --> 00:15:47,639
My father is seriously ill.

126
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,712
He can die any time.

127
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:51,982
If I don't have a child soon,

128
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:54,376
all of his fortune
will go to some temple.

129
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:56,772
I won't get even one cent.

130
00:15:58,201 --> 00:15:59,755
But why must it be Dech?!

131
00:16:00,637 --> 00:16:02,150
Why did you choose me?

132
00:16:03,977 --> 00:16:05,624
Saeng, who are you?

133
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:06,997
Who am I?

134
00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:09,828
The way you talk. Have you
forgotten your background?

135
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,839
Whore!

136
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:12,139
I…

137
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,150
I haven't.

138
00:16:13,926 --> 00:16:15,099
I'm just curious

139
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:17,518
why you like Dech so much,

140
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,877
so much so that you let him
sleep with Ms. Malai, your wife,

141
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,571
when he's no better than me.

142
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,756
You wanna try me?

143
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:32,078
I won't dare, my lord.

144
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:33,844
I was wrong.

145
00:16:40,017 --> 00:16:41,267
Don't let me find out

146
00:16:41,653 --> 00:16:42,986
that you're a snake, Saeng.

147
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:45,618
You won't go back to be a whore.

148
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:48,261
But you'll be a corpse
in a potter's field.

149
00:16:48,393 --> 00:16:49,393
Understood?!

150
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,951
I won't dare, my lord.

151
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:55,727
I was wrong.

152
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:00,131
Go! Get out!

153
00:17:02,464 --> 00:17:03,464
Sir.

154
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:14,981
If Dech has a child with Ms. Malai,

155
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:16,292
I'll be screwed.

156
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:21,142
If I were Dech,

157
00:17:21,922 --> 00:17:23,788
His Lordship would have
never done that.

158
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:27,428
Chaem!

159
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:29,156
Chaem!

160
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:31,692
Chaem!

161
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:33,525
Chaem!

162
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:36,725
Always nowhere to be found
when I need her.

163
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:38,532
Chaem!

164
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:41,069
Chaem!

165
00:17:49,758 --> 00:17:50,758
Ms. Ramphoei.

166
00:17:52,486 --> 00:17:53,861
Say what you have to say.

167
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:58,078
His Lordship must have a child
before this father dies.

168
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,638
Or his father's fortune
will go to a temple.

169
00:18:01,244 --> 00:18:02,244
Huh?!

170
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:03,833
No way.

171
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:06,129
Why would he give
that much money away?

172
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:09,429
I was wondering the same thing.
That's why I'm telling you this.

173
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,662
Nuts. They're all nuts.

174
00:18:15,313 --> 00:18:16,750
What do I do now?

175
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:21,927
I won't stay here if His Lordship
becomes destitute.

176
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:28,016
It's easy, ma'am.

177
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,222
Just have His Lordship's child
before Ms. Malai does.

178
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:36,374
Don't you think
I'm trying, you idiot?!

179
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:37,895
I know, ma'am.

180
00:18:38,424 --> 00:18:40,814
I just wanted to warn you to hurry.

181
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:42,803
Time is running out.

182
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:44,626
His Lordship said

183
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:48,051
his father could die any day now.

184
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:53,047
Thanks a lot for telling me.

185
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:55,555
I won't forget
what you've done for me.

186
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:57,616
Uh…

187
00:18:57,716 --> 00:18:59,716
but you can't tell anyone.

188
00:19:00,836 --> 00:19:02,934
If he finds out I blabbed,

189
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:04,887
His Lordship will punish me.

190
00:19:05,481 --> 00:19:06,673
Don't worry, Saeng.

191
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:09,218
I promise not to tell anyone.

192
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:12,756
And when I have
His Lordship's child,

193
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:15,943
I'll reward you handsomely.

194
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:18,859
Yes, Ms. Ramphoei.

195
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,630
I won't let you be
the only one thriving, Dech.

196
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:52,374
I only need His Lordship
to have a child.

197
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:55,094
Doesn't matter from which wife.

198
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,716
I won't let you prosper.

199
00:19:59,402 --> 00:20:00,402
Watch me.

200
00:20:19,123 --> 00:20:21,057
Please stay with me tonight.

201
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:25,449
I feel I haven't served you
at all lately, my lord.

202
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:27,764
If you wanted to serve me,

203
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:31,428
you didn't need to drag me
into your room like this.

204
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:32,923
I had to, my lord.

205
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:35,652
You've visited only Ms. Malai.

206
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:38,603
Haven't you thought I'd be lonely?

207
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,678
Goodness, Ramphoei.

208
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:42,279
Don't be upset.

209
00:20:42,986 --> 00:20:44,635
I'm with you now.

210
00:20:44,906 --> 00:20:46,162
Please don't sulk.

211
00:20:54,634 --> 00:20:56,699
The red cotton flower tea
you asked for, my lord.

212
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,710
Thanks, Saeng.

213
00:20:57,948 --> 00:20:59,228
It's late. Go to bed.

214
00:21:00,307 --> 00:21:01,307
Yes, my lord.

215
00:21:18,005 --> 00:21:19,781
Isn't it hot, my lord?

216
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:25,553
Since Saeng brought the tea,

217
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:26,774
you should drink some.

218
00:21:28,627 --> 00:21:29,807
Not so fast, my lord.

219
00:21:30,627 --> 00:21:33,054
The tea can wait.

220
00:21:33,937 --> 00:21:36,403
I have something
to discuss with you.

221
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,730
What's that?

222
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:41,070
Or did someone
make you uncomfortable?

223
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:43,697
It's not about that.

224
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:45,654
It's about you, my lord.

225
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,694
I know now

226
00:21:48,334 --> 00:21:49,416
what's going on.

227
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:01,334
My lord, let go please.

228
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:06,390
My lord, please don't hurt me.

229
00:22:08,218 --> 00:22:12,037
I just found out that
you must have a child before…

230
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,943
your father passes away.

231
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:17,012
Does that warrant killing me?

232
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:29,627
Even if you must have a child,

233
00:22:30,468 --> 00:22:33,008
it doesn't have to be
with just Ms. Malai.

234
00:22:34,073 --> 00:22:35,870
Even if she's your wife,

235
00:22:36,241 --> 00:22:38,696
she's been married
to you for a while.

236
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:41,474
There's no indication
she'll get pregnant.

237
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:46,222
But having a child with a wife,

238
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:48,944
gets me a bigger title and
more respect than with a mistress.

239
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:55,482
But if Ms. Malai is barren,

240
00:22:56,856 --> 00:22:59,549
will you still wait
for a child from only her?

241
00:23:04,972 --> 00:23:06,955
Even though I am…

242
00:23:07,432 --> 00:23:09,846
always ready to have
a child for you.

243
00:23:11,512 --> 00:23:15,649
I only ask you visit
my chamber every day.

244
00:23:16,538 --> 00:23:18,892
I'm happy to serve
your needs, my lord.

245
00:23:21,584 --> 00:23:23,245
Don't accuse Malai like that.

246
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:26,491
No matter what, she is my wife.

247
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,717
Don't let me hear you
speak ill of Malai again.

248
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:31,044
Ow.

249
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,787
Wait, my lord!

250
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,730
You fucked me just once.
When will I get pregnant?!

251
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,830
Idiot!

252
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,220
Eh?

253
00:24:03,454 --> 00:24:05,062
Where's His Lordship, Ms. Ramphoei?

254
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,673
You'd have seen him if he's here.

255
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,820
Well,

256
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:12,424
I thought he'd like you so much
he stayed until morning.

257
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
I wish.

258
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,453
My back didn't even
touch the mattress.

259
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,819
Eh? Why's that?

260
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,650
You said you'd close the deal.

261
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:23,167
It's Malai.

262
00:24:25,391 --> 00:24:26,725
His Lordship's ridiculous.

263
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:30,311
I don't get why he wants
to have a child with her so much.

264
00:24:30,322 --> 00:24:31,971
She's a woman. I'm a woman.

265
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:33,536
We both can get pregnant.

266
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:36,129
So what are you gonna do?

267
00:24:38,064 --> 00:24:40,001
Find a way to get rid of Malai.

268
00:24:40,565 --> 00:24:41,826
If she's not here,

269
00:24:42,526 --> 00:24:44,260
I'll rule this house alone.

270
00:24:44,906 --> 00:24:46,426
Get rid of her how?

271
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,166
Malai.

272
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:10,016
Yes, my lord?

273
00:25:11,036 --> 00:25:14,716
I know that what I asked of you
wasn't a small matter.

274
00:25:15,656 --> 00:25:17,383
And I don't trivialize it but…

275
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,330
But what?

276
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,780
I want you to try again.

277
00:25:21,828 --> 00:25:23,188
It failed last time, right?

278
00:25:23,942 --> 00:25:25,302
How did you know?

279
00:25:31,424 --> 00:25:32,424
I asked Dech.

280
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:36,374
And he told me the truth because
he's owed me a debt of gratitude.

281
00:25:36,705 --> 00:25:37,922
Don't be mad at him.

282
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,405
I can't do it, my lord.

283
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:50,098
- Malai, I'm begging you.
- No is no!

284
00:25:55,502 --> 00:25:57,717
You saw I couldn't
go through with it

285
00:25:57,727 --> 00:25:59,415
but you're still forcing me.

286
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:01,374
Asking me to try again.

287
00:26:01,787 --> 00:26:03,307
Don't you feel for me at all?

288
00:26:06,087 --> 00:26:07,725
I'm a human being.

289
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:09,964
I have a heart and honor too.

290
00:26:11,251 --> 00:26:12,331
Malai. Ma…

291
00:26:12,685 --> 00:26:13,685
Malai.

292
00:26:15,071 --> 00:26:16,071
Malai!

293
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:23,065
If I knew you'd be this difficult,

294
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:25,085
I wouldn't have married you.

295
00:26:28,226 --> 00:26:29,226
Bu-nga, you bitch!

296
00:26:31,286 --> 00:26:33,704
Making your own wife
sleep with another man.

297
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,717
Prick!

298
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,787
Malai, I don't want you
to socialize with her again!

300
00:26:43,106 --> 00:26:47,653
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

301
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:49,959
Welcome, Ms. Bu-nga.

302
00:26:50,691 --> 00:26:51,882
Ms. Malai is this way.

303
00:27:06,446 --> 00:27:08,213
I was wondering
who the mastermind was.

304
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:10,434
It's actually you, Ramphoei.

305
00:27:12,806 --> 00:27:14,444
Uap, go away.

306
00:27:15,045 --> 00:27:17,099
I'm Oep. Uap is my mother.

307
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,319
Whatever.

308
00:27:27,364 --> 00:27:28,364
Don't hide it.

309
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:30,064
Let me see what's inside.

310
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:32,325
You can't, ma'am.

311
00:27:33,624 --> 00:27:36,512
You're not behaving
like Ms. Malai's friend,

312
00:27:36,972 --> 00:27:39,951
lowering yourself to bickering
with a servant like Chaem.

313
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:41,617
You're right.

314
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,338
I must have forgotten myself.

315
00:27:43,971 --> 00:27:47,733
So would you go tell Malai
that I'm here to see her?

316
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:51,157
Ms. Bu-nga, are you doing this
because you think me a servant?

317
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,410
Oh?

318
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,128
Are you not?

319
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:57,874
I just assumed your background

320
00:27:58,062 --> 00:27:59,839
wasn't that different from Chaem's.

321
00:28:00,189 --> 00:28:01,681
Eh? Was I wrong?

322
00:28:01,989 --> 00:28:03,127
Bu-nga, you bitch!

323
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,835
- Hey, Chaem! Chaem!
- Oh, I'm going, ma'am.

324
00:28:10,873 --> 00:28:12,866
- I'm going, ma'am.
- Chaem, come help me!

325
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,488
Bu-nga, you bitch.

326
00:28:35,031 --> 00:28:36,031
Get off me!

327
00:28:39,424 --> 00:28:40,424
What's that?

328
00:28:41,082 --> 00:28:42,082
Sounds like a fight.

329
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:49,369
Get off me!

330
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:55,048
I'm a fair person.

331
00:28:55,074 --> 00:28:56,810
You slapped me
so I slapped you back.

332
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:59,554
My hit will be as hard as yours.

333
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,193
- Ow, let go.
- Don't think of hurting me

334
00:29:02,204 --> 00:29:03,862
like you think of
hurting my friend.

335
00:29:03,873 --> 00:29:04,890
Remember that!

336
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,049
I yield!

337
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:14,035
- I yield! I yield!
- Really?

338
00:29:14,562 --> 00:29:15,562
You yielded.

339
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:17,933
But I didn't! Bring it on!

340
00:29:17,944 --> 00:29:18,944
Ms. Bu-nga!

341
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,726
Hey. Let me go, Dech.

342
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:23,672
I'm not done with her!

343
00:29:23,852 --> 00:29:25,693
- Get off me!
- Please stop, Ms. Bu-nga.

344
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,179
Your clothes got all dirty.

345
00:29:27,977 --> 00:29:28,977
Eh? Fueang!

346
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:30,630
Help Ms. Ramphoei up!

347
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:33,664
Ms. Ramphoei, get up, ma'am.

348
00:29:33,869 --> 00:29:35,389
- Get up.
- Get off me!

349
00:29:35,543 --> 00:29:38,074
Dech, get this crazy bitch
out of this house!

350
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:41,011
But Ms. Bu-nga
is Ms. Malai's friend.

351
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:42,542
Dech!

352
00:29:42,555 --> 00:29:44,355
You dare disobey my order?!

353
00:29:44,622 --> 00:29:45,548
Get out!

354
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,552
Let's go, Ms. Bu-nga.

355
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:48,154
No. No, I'm not going.

356
00:29:48,765 --> 00:29:50,502
Mark my words, Ramphoei.

357
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,479
If you bully Malai again,

358
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:54,726
you'll get worse than this,
Ramphoei!

359
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:57,232
Yeah! Bring it on! I'm not afraid!

360
00:29:57,345 --> 00:29:58,718
- You're not afraid?!
- Bring it!

361
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,025
- That's enough, ma'am.
- Let's go. Ms. Bu-nga.

362
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,736
- Enough, ma'am.
- I'll get you!

363
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:04,379
Get off me!

364
00:30:14,872 --> 00:30:15,872
Chaem!

365
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:17,019
Chaem!

366
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,519
Serves her right.

367
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,799
It's a shame.

368
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,885
Your servant
shouldn't have stopped me.

369
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:29,892
I was gonna teach her
with my slaps.

370
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:31,165
Bu-nga.

371
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,538
It's a good thing Dech helped you.

372
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,200
You'd be in big trouble
if His Lordship saw you.

373
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:41,072
I wouldn't be able to speak
on your behalf much anymore.

374
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,370
Why not?

375
00:30:42,863 --> 00:30:44,503
You're his wife.

376
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:47,477
Ramphoei is just
his low-life mistress.

377
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,637
She can't compete!

378
00:31:04,902 --> 00:31:06,179
What's the matter, Malai?

379
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:08,116
What are you making that face?

380
00:31:10,082 --> 00:31:11,082
I…

381
00:31:12,382 --> 00:31:14,145
I don't know what to do, Bu-nga.

382
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:20,408
I feel completely hopeless right now.

383
00:31:23,286 --> 00:31:25,076
I don't have even my honor left.

384
00:31:28,493 --> 00:31:29,660
What does that mean?

385
00:31:31,144 --> 00:31:32,288
Tell me about it.

386
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,213
I didn't think
you could be this vile

387
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,093
and do this to my friend!

388
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,140
Ms. Bu-nga!

389
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,453
Watch yourself.
Show me some respect.

390
00:31:51,226 --> 00:31:54,258
I haven't made you pay
for slapping Ramphoei.

391
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:57,646
You made yourself stupid
and bedded that kind of woman

392
00:31:58,186 --> 00:31:59,706
when you already had Malai?

393
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,268
Shortsighted fool.

394
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,033
Ms. Bu-nga, if you're gonna
talk this way, get out of my house!

395
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,638
You think I want to be here?

396
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,056
What kind of man
can't protect his own wife

397
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,697
and hurts her in the process?

398
00:32:11,126 --> 00:32:13,544
Making your own wife
sleep with another man.

399
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:14,683
Prick!

400
00:32:16,946 --> 00:32:17,946
Get out!

401
00:32:17,953 --> 00:32:19,193
- Let go! Let go!
- Get out!

402
00:32:19,346 --> 00:32:20,346
I'm going!

403
00:32:21,192 --> 00:32:23,479
But if you keep hurting Malai,

404
00:32:24,006 --> 00:32:25,927
I'll make you sorry!

405
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:27,219
Watch me!

406
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,287
What can a woman like you do to me?

407
00:32:30,873 --> 00:32:32,806
If you remain a rich man,

408
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:34,543
it'll be a close fight.

409
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:36,499
But if you don't have kids,

410
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:38,753
and get none of your inheritance,

411
00:32:39,565 --> 00:32:43,292
this woman will come back
and buy up all your assets.

412
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:45,431
I will use my money to

413
00:32:45,851 --> 00:32:48,004
smack you down
until the earth swallows you.

414
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,091
Watch me!

415
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,231
Stay strong, Malai.

416
00:33:12,983 --> 00:33:14,565
Don't give in if it's too much.

417
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,395
I won't, Bu-nga.

418
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,130
I'm gonna go.

419
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:21,803
I'll come again,

420
00:33:22,056 --> 00:33:24,189
if people here still
open their doors for me.

421
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,716
I doubt it.

422
00:33:32,664 --> 00:33:34,617
You can come to me any time, Malai.

423
00:33:35,171 --> 00:33:36,424
Don't think it's a bother.

424
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:38,793
Thank you very much, Bu-nga.

425
00:33:55,987 --> 00:33:56,987
Malai!

426
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:59,961
Your friend tore me a new one!

427
00:34:00,077 --> 00:34:02,440
I don't want you
to socialize with her again!

428
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,843
But Bu-nga is my one true friend.

429
00:34:05,058 --> 00:34:06,312
How can I do that?

430
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:08,112
You will do as I say!

431
00:34:08,652 --> 00:34:09,652
And tonight,

432
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:11,404
you must sleep with Dech.

433
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:13,511
I'm not asking you.

434
00:34:13,892 --> 00:34:15,087
This is an order!

435
00:34:15,473 --> 00:34:17,693
Why are you
so cruel to me, my lord?

436
00:34:18,118 --> 00:34:20,287
I can understand
if you're mad at Bu-nga.

437
00:34:20,466 --> 00:34:22,714
But why must you order me
to force myself?

438
00:34:24,335 --> 00:34:26,389
Think of it as penance for your friend.

439
00:34:28,638 --> 00:34:30,415
You know what I need.

440
00:34:31,064 --> 00:34:32,415
If you can't give it to me,

441
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:34,207
there's no reason

442
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:36,041
for me to honor you

443
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,573
as the wife of this house!

444
00:35:14,165 --> 00:35:15,165
Watch out!

445

446
00:35:27,014 --> 00:35:31,561
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

447
00:36:29,528 --> 00:36:30,728
No matter what,

448
00:36:31,228 --> 00:36:33,051
you must give me a child, Malai.

449
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:35,041
I understand

450
00:36:36,275 --> 00:36:38,018
that I don't want to…

451
00:36:40,713 --> 00:36:42,200
Whether I want to or not…

452
00:36:45,006 --> 00:36:46,723
I won't get anyone's sympathy.

453
00:36:48,913 --> 00:36:50,165
Just get it over with.

454
00:37:05,192 --> 00:37:07,279
I really don't want to force you.

455
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,434
Do I have a choice, Dech?

456
00:37:18,899 --> 00:37:21,032
Right now
I feel like I'm worthless.

457
00:37:23,706 --> 00:37:26,201
Like a doll His Lordship
can give to anyone

458
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,006
to do anything to it.

459
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,585
Only to accomplish
His Lordship's goal.

460
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:52,336
I have to thank you, Dech.

461
00:37:55,162 --> 00:37:56,355
For your concern.

462
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:00,452
Let's not drag this out.

463
00:38:02,255 --> 00:38:03,555
I prepared myself.

464
00:38:29,928 --> 00:38:30,928
Ms. Malai!

465
00:38:33,487 --> 00:38:34,487
Watch out!

466
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:26,472
Dech.

467
00:39:26,483 --> 00:39:27,483
Dech!

468
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:28,669
Dech!

469
00:39:30,103 --> 00:39:31,103
Dech.

470
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:36,295
Anybody, help!

471
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:37,741
Dech.

472
00:39:37,921 --> 00:39:38,921
Dech!

473
00:39:40,594 --> 00:39:41,594
My lord.

474
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:42,681
My lord.

475
00:39:42,997 --> 00:39:43,997
Dech!

476
00:39:44,504 --> 00:39:45,504
Dech.

477
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:48,651
- Dech?
- Dech?

478
00:39:49,064 --> 00:39:50,664
Don't fall asleep, Dech.

479
00:39:50,884 --> 00:39:52,266
- Keep awake, Dech.
- Dech!

480
00:39:52,371 --> 00:39:53,371
Keep awake, Dech.

481
00:39:53,777 --> 00:39:54,777
Dech!

482
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:56,437
Dech.

483
00:39:57,344 --> 00:39:58,344
Dech.

484
00:40:01,671 --> 00:40:03,798
My lord, where are you taking him?

485
00:40:04,464 --> 00:40:05,852
Back to the servant's house.

486
00:40:06,266 --> 00:40:08,399
Or do you want people
to know everything?

487
00:40:57,986 --> 00:41:00,793
My lord, I sent Kam
to get the doctor.

488
00:41:01,867 --> 00:41:03,077
How's Dech doing?

489
00:41:03,481 --> 00:41:05,534
Are you blind?
You see him. Don't ask.

490
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:09,788
How did a snake get
into Ms. Malai's chamber?

491
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,239
Don't ask.

492
00:41:14,546 --> 00:41:16,446
Someone might have
planned to hurt her.

493
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,393
And Dech got bit instead, my lord.

494
00:41:20,776 --> 00:41:23,510
I said don't ask questions.
Are you deaf?

495
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,953
Or are you worried
people will question

496
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,167
how Dech got into
Ms. Malai's chamber?

497
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,517
That must have mattered more than
finding out who tried to hurt her.

498
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:36,191
Fueang!

499
00:41:37,236 --> 00:41:38,870
I'll help Uan catch that snake

500
00:41:39,256 --> 00:41:40,657
before it bites someone else.

501
00:41:47,896 --> 00:41:48,896
You…

502
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:50,549
So insolent.

503
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:15,493
You said he'd get better
in the morning, Doctor.

504
00:42:16,726 --> 00:42:18,346
I wasn't lying, my lord.

505
00:42:18,772 --> 00:42:20,472
The medication
should have kicked in.

506
00:42:20,533 --> 00:42:22,342
The venom should have lessened.

507
00:42:22,513 --> 00:42:23,819
We just have to wait.

508
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,432
What are we waiting for?!

509
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:27,013
Dech's not awake yet.

510
00:42:27,246 --> 00:42:30,468
How can I trust
that he's better now? Huh?!

511
00:42:32,946 --> 00:42:34,146
Don't, my lord.

512
00:42:37,385 --> 00:42:39,119
Dech, you're awake finally.

513
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,212
I was so worried.

514
00:42:45,345 --> 00:42:47,246
- Come and check him out!
- Yes, my lord.

515
00:42:58,003 --> 00:42:59,563
Fueang, how is he doing?

516
00:42:59,917 --> 00:43:00,917
What have you heard?

517
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,235
Dech's condition is worrisome.

518
00:43:03,676 --> 00:43:05,504
We must wait and see
for a few days.

519
00:43:07,777 --> 00:43:08,989
He might not make it.

520
00:43:09,317 --> 00:43:10,317
That bad?

521
00:43:12,499 --> 00:43:13,499
Yes.

522
00:43:17,066 --> 00:43:18,066
Goodness,

523
00:43:18,165 --> 00:43:19,891
where are you
running off to, Ms. Malai?

524
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,569
It's not your business.

525
00:43:21,843 --> 00:43:22,843
- Move.
- Why?

526
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:27,931
I heard that Dech got bit
by a snake in your chamber.

527
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:30,409
Eh?

528
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:32,401
I'm not sure
if that's true or a rumor.

529
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:35,142
I just want you to
satisfy my curiosity.

530
00:43:39,523 --> 00:43:40,523
Oh.

531
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:41,534
Or…

532
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:44,256
are you running off
to care for your lover?

533
00:43:44,376 --> 00:43:45,989
- You crossed the line!
- Don't, Fueang.

534
00:43:53,435 --> 00:43:55,815
I fell in love with you that day

535
00:43:56,348 --> 00:43:57,587
even though I knew

536
00:43:57,952 --> 00:43:59,322
we'd never meet again.

537
00:43:59,961 --> 00:44:00,961
