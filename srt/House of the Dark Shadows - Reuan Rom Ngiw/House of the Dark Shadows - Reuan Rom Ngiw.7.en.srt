"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 7)

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Malai might not want it back,

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
but I think it's too valuable.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's disgraceful on you.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I want Malai to suffer,

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
dying on the inside slowly.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You got it.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry, my lord. I'm not ready.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If you can't sire a child
to continue my bloodline,

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll donate my fortune
to a Buddhist temple.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Watch me!

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Are you still worried
about Ms. Malai?

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Malai is amenable.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Easy to appease.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm more worried about
my father's demand for an heir.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hey, Dech.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You know very well

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
that if I can't give him an heir.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I won't get even one cent from him.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But for me to bed a woman,

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I just can't do it.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Just the thought…

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
is unacceptable to me.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What is it, my lord?

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
A sedative. Mix it with
the red cotton flower tea.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Have Ms. Malai drink it
before bed every night.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Won't she find out?

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
She will if you mix it with water

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
because it's very bitter.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
She won't recognize its taste
if mixed with the tea.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes, sir.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Keep it a secret.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No one can find out.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll reward you two handsomely.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Thank you, my lord.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
If the sedative's about to run out,

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll let you know right away.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Very good.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I appreciate you
not asking me too many questions.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Here you go.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Then how could you
have sex with Ms. Ramphoei?

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't know either how I did it.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I think

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
something suspicious
must have happened.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't you want to know
what happened?

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't think it's a bad thing.

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's actually a good thing.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Many people saw it
so it'll stop the speculation

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
about why I haven't had children.

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Ever since you brought
Ms. Ramphoei here,

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
there's trouble every day.

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I warned you when we were
in the northern city

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
but you didn't listen.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Goodness, Dech.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I admit

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
it was my fault.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But a proper lady like Malai

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
just doesn't turn me on.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So I thought a racy woman
like Ramphoei could help.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But...

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
she can't.

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hey, Dech!

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Dech, you bastard.

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Stop, Saeng!

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What's wrong with you?

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You promised
you'd come by last night.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But you were with him.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He wouldn't let you go, right?

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
- Dech!
- Saeng!

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
My lord!

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You're just a placeholder
when Dech's away.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If you're still this arrogant,

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll kick you out to be
a hooker again!

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Dech, are you hurt?

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm fine, sir.

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's late.

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Won't you stay here, my lord?

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
No.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't like sleeping anywhere else
except in my own house.

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You should know.

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But I want to serve you
more than this.

100
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Can I come serve you
in the main house?

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I promise

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I won't ask for anything

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
but what you're willing to give me.

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I already have someone I love.

105
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You've seen Dech.

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Even if you serve me
in the main house,

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
you'll still be second to him.

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Can you bear it?

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I only ask for
an opportunity to serve you.

110
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I have no intention
to compete with anyone.

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Let me sleep on it.

112
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes, my lord.

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Dech,

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
as soon as I get to live
in the Dark Shadow House,

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll kick you out.

116
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The viscount will be mine alone.

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I hate you,

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Dech.

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I hate you!

120
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Uan?

123
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Is it true like the viscount says

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
that red cotton flower tea
is tonic for women?

125
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's true, ma'am.

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
This tea is an old recipe
in His Lordship's family.

127
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You must drink a lot of it.

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So you'll have a child soon.

129
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Steamed curry is here!

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This one is pretty.

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Hot steamed curry is here!

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Come get delicious steamed curry!

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It smells great, Uan.

134
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Would you like steamed curry?

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Why don't you look familiar at all?

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Are you new around here?

137
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes.

138
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Would you like
delicious steamed curry?

139
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No, thanks.

140
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We already made plenty.
Enough to feed the whole house.

141
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Miss,

142
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
please help me out.

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I haven't sold any today.

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll buy some.

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
He's already here.

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Hot steamed curry.

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It smells really good.

148
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Ah, hot steamed curry.

149
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Did you make it yourself?

150
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes.

151
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
How much each?

152
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Not expensive.

153
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Ms. Malai!

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Ms. Malai!

155
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What, Fueang?

156
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Someone's here to see His Lordship

157
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
but I'm not sure
if he's out on business.

158
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't know either.

159
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's okay.

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll see them myself.

161
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Pick two servings
of steamed curry for me.

162
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If you want some too,
feel free to get more.

163
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Hey, come by again
if you have a problem selling it.

165
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'll buy some.

166
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Thank you.

167
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Here.

168
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let's see. Which ones did she pick?

169
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
In here.

170
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
- This one, right?
- Yes.

171
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
There were servants around.

172
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
As for Malai,

173
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
she never leaves the house.

174
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
When do you expect me to do it?

175
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That day will come. Calm down.

176
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'd rather kill than rape her.

177
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Your brother is a famous criminal.

178
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Doing something that disgraceful

179
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
is insulting!

180
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
No.

181
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I insist you rape her.

182
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Only that will avenge me.

183
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I want her to die on the inside.

184
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Only that will satisfy me.

185
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
When can I do it?

186
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
When the opportunity
presents itself, I'll let you know.

187
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
In the meantime,
get your guys ready.

188
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I have to go. Being gone
too long looks suspicious.

189
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, I'm so excited.

190
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I want to see Ms. Malai's outfit.

191
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
If you ask me,
she looks good in everything.

192
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Just wait and see.

193
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh, here she comes.

194
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Ooh.

195
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Isn't His Lordship handsome?

196
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He is.

197
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Whoa.

198
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Wow.

199
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
They're as beautiful as
children of the gods.

200
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What do I have to do to be
lucky enough to wear that?

201
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
An outfit looks good
when its wearer looks good.

202
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Homely people
won't improve the outfit.

203
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Understand?

204
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Kam.

205
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Hey,

206
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
what do you think?

207
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Ms. Malai is stunning.

208
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You Lordship is very handsome, too.

209
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Truly beautiful.

210
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Really, ma'am.

211
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Chaem!

212
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
If you want to see,

213
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
you can come see up-close.

214
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
No need to lurk
like a household deity.

215
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Don't do that, Fueang.

216
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Where's your master today?

217
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
She's not begging to accompany
His Lordship again?

218
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's right.
I haven't seen Ramphoei today.

219
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Ms. Ramphoei is sick

220
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
so she's resting in her room.

221
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Now that you know why,
you can stop barking.

222
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Hey,

223
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
take good care of your master.

224
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Tell her I've gone to a party
and not to wait up.

225
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yes, my lord.

226
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Let's go, Malai.

227
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yes, sir.

228
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Come.

229
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
- I want Ms. Malai's outfit so bad.
- So stunning.

230
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So beautiful.

231
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Kam?

232
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's beautiful.

233
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Look at her. She deserves a slap.

234
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Ready?

235
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

236
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Let's get going, my lord.

237
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
- Or we'll be late.
- Let's go.

238
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Watch your head, Malai.

239
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Are you all right?

240
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm fine, ma'am.

241
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
- You can slow down a bit.
- Yes, ma'am.

242
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Ma'am, something
got on your collar.

243
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Really? Thanks.

244
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
(Pawn Shop)

245
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Stop!

246
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The mistress' rickshaw is gone.

247
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
- Stop!
- I said stop. Didn't you hear?

248
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I said stop. Didn't you hear?

249
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I said stop! Hey, stop!

250
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
My lord, watch out!

251
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Where's everyone?

252
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Stop!

253
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Dech!

254
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Dech! My lord!

255
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
- Come here!
- Dech!

256
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You're a fighter.

257
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Dech!

258
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Help!

259
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Help!

260
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Help!

(House of the Dark Shadows

263
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Go help Ms. Malai.

264
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'll help His Lordship.

265
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
- Earlier you...
- Go on. What are you waiting for?

266
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Or she'll get killed.

267
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Go!

268
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Damn it.

269
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
My lord, are you okay?

270
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Dech!

271
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
- Dech!
- My lord, be careful.

272
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Dech?

273
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Ms. Malai!

274
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Ms. Malai!

275

Don't hurt me, please.

Please don't hurt me.

278
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
If you want money, take it.

279
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
No!

280
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000

Dech.

- Dech, come on!
- Ms. Malai!

Run!

302
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Come on, Ms. Malai.

303
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Ms. Malai.

304
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Are you okay?

305
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm fine.

306
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Don't be scared, Ms. Malai.

I'll protect you with my life.

308
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Thanks.

309
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
What did you find out?

310
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
The guys you two caught are just
opium addicts who were hired.

311
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Did your people
find Ms. Malai and Dech?

312
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
But I sent my people to find them.

313
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Don't you worry.

314
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But it's dark now,
so it's gonna be hard.

315
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I understand.

316
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I'm already uncomfortable
bothering you at this hour.

317
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
But I'm worried about De...

318
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Malai.

319
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Chaem, what did you find out?

320
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
The count's people
haven't found Dech and Malai.

321
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
They might have
already been killed.

322
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
That'd be great. So I can be
the only mistress of this house.

323
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But to be honest,
these robbers were so brazen.

324
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
They dared kidnap
the viscount's wife.

325
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
If they get caught,
they'll be executed for sure.

326
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Why did you kick me?

327
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
For not...

328
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
For not being sure if Malai's dead.

329
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Get out. I want to sleep.

330
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yes, ma'am.

331
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You're awake, Ms. Malai?

332
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Forgive me.

333
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Don't mention it.

334
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It's you who got hurt,

335
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
tired from helping me escape,

336
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and watched over me all night.

337
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm sorry
for getting you in trouble.

338
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It's okay, ma'am.

339
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I think we're safe now.

340
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Let's go home.

341
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It's almost dawn.

342
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
His Lordship must be
worried sick about you.

343
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Come on.

344
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Please let me help you walk.

345
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm worried you might faint.

346
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Thanks.

347
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000

348
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
- Malai.
- My lord.

349
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Do you have any idea
how worried I was about you?

350
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
You were gone with Dech all night.

351
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Why are you in this state, ma'am?

352
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
If it wasn't for Dech, I would
have been killed last night.

353
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Then why didn't Dech
bring you back last night?

354
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You two didn't...

355
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Stop insulting Malai.

356
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
You were there last night.

357
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
The attack was carefully planned.

358
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Luckily, Dech managed to
rescue Malai.

359
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Stop saying things to defame her.

00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
After you recover,

361
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I might have to have
the police question you two

362
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
for information
to capture the culprits.

363
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Yes, sir.

364
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Yes, my lord.

365
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Let's get back, Malai.

366
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
If you won't help me,

367
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'll have to let Malai
sleep with someone else.

00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

370
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Let me see.

371
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm sorry, ma'am.

372
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It's okay. Keep going.

373
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Does it hurt?

374
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
- Fueang?
- Yes, ma'am?

375
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
What did the police say?

376
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
The police said
it was just a robbery.

377
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Two of the robbers caught are
opium addicts who were hired.

378
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So they don't know yet
who's behind it.

379
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It's such a shame that

380
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
they didn't catch
the leader who kidnapped you.

381
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Look at you.

382
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Eavesdropping for so long

383
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
your ears almost turned
into elephant ears.

384
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Why don't you go in and listen?

385
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Who's eavesdropping?
I was just walking back to my room.

386
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You're a servant.

387
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Watch your mouth.

388
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
What a lowlife.

389
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Your medicine, ma'am.

390
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Thanks.

391
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Just now.

392
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Ramphoei was eavesdropping on
your and Fueang's conversation

393
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
at the door.

394
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Both she and her maid are so nosy.

395
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
True.

396
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Ignore them, ma'am.

397
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Take the medicine for internal
injuries, so you'll heal quickly.

398
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Uan,

399
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
did the viscount scold Dech?

400
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
No, ma'am.

401
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
His Lordship isn't gullible.
He won't listen to Saeng.

402
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Saeng shouldn't have
said those things.

403
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Dech was punished
because of him last time.

404
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
He still goes after his own people.

405
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
That's good to hear.

406
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I don't want Dech to get
in trouble because of me again.

407
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Especially this time
when he risked his life for me.

408
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You called me here to make a promise?

409
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You and Malai were gone
together all night.

410
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
What else should I think?

411
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
That's why I need you
to swear before me.

412
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
So you not making a scene earlier

413
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
was just an act to show that
you trust me and Ms. Malai?

414
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
If you two didn't have sex,

415
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
you just have to swear.

416
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Why do you have to argue
with me about this?

417
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Ms. Malai and I almost got killed.

418
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Who would be in the mood
for such despicable act?

419
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Then swear to me
that you two didn't have sex!

420
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Who's there?!

421
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's me, sir.

422
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Come in!

423
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
The count's messenger
brought a message.

424
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
He just left.

425
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Why did he send someone?

426
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
The count's message
is that your father...

427
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
took a turn for the worse.

428
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Brother?

429
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Father just took
his medicine and slept.

430
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Don't bother him.

431
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
How is he?

432
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Brace yourself.

433
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
The doctor gave Father one year.

434
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Two at the most.

435
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You don't have to worry, my lord.

436
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You have two wives
but still no children.

437
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Why don't you find more wives?
So they can give you children.

438
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Ranchuan.

439
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Ignore Ranchuan.

440
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Father's condition is worrisome.

441
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Your time is running out.

442
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Whatever your plan is,
do it quickly.

443
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You know I'm trying.

444
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
But what can I do
if I can't sire a child?

445
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I understand.

446
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
But if you really can't do it,

447
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
you'll have to let...

448
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
your inheritance
go to the temple.

449
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You're a capable and talented man.

450
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Even without your father's fortune,

451
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
you should be able
to make your own.

452
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Am I right?

453
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That much money.

454
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'll never let it go to the temple.

455
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
What are you looking at?

456
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
What birds are those?
They're so noisy.

457
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
They're Asian koels.

458
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
They probably laid
their eggs in crow nests.

459
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Once they hatched, they got big.

460
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
So they're loud, sir.

461
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's like that old saying.

462
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
The chicks are
probably still small.

463
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Once they're strong,

464
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
they'll fly away.

465
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Can't we chase them off now?

466
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
No, my lord.

467
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It's bad karma.

468
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Please have a little patience
and wait.

469
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
You can go.

470
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000

You lay your eggs

477

Crows fall in love
with your chicks.

478
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Thinking them as their own.

479
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
You really want me
to have a child with Ms. Malai?

480
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
This is the best way.

481
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You know very well
I can't bed a woman.

482
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But Ms. Malai is your wife.

483
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
In name only.

484
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
If I don't give my father an heir,

485
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I won't get my inheritance.

486
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I can't adopt a child either.

487
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
This is the only way.

488
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
If I do what you ask,

489
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
then I'll...

490
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
hurt Ms. Malai's feelings.

491
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Dech,

492
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
think about it.

493
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
The nobleman who had once
supported Malai passed away.

494
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And she can't
rely on her relatives.

495
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Plus she's a woman.

496
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
What would she do for a living?

497
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
If I don't get my inheritance,

498
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Malai will be in trouble too.

499
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
In the end,
it's about your inheritance.

500
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
You're the person I trust the most.

501
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
If Malai's pregnant
with someone else's child,

502
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm afraid things might get messy.

503
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
More importantly,

504
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I won't be able to love that child.

505
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
If it's yours,

506
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm certain I can raise that child.

507
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Help me this once, Dech.

508
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Help me, Dech.

509
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Please.

510
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
If you won't help me,

511
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'll have to let Malai
sleep with someone else.

512
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
If she has to sleep with some guy
we don't know from Adam,

513
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I'll do what you ask, my lord.

514
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Really, Dech?

515
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Even though I agree,

516
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I don't know if Ms. Malai will.

517
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Let me worry about that.

518
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Thanks a lot, Dech.

519
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
If you help me

520
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
kick Malai out of this house.

521
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I'll reward you handsomely.

525
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Would you promise to help me?

My lord. My lord.

527
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000

with Dech for me?
