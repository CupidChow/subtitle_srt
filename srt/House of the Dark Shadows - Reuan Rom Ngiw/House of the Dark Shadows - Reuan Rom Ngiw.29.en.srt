"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 29)

19
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:00,837
Miscarriage decoction.

20
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,593
Fueang is like my sister
but you didn't spare her.

21
00:02:03,604 --> 00:02:06,284
How could you do that
just to get back at me?

22
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:07,994
Mark my words, Dech.

23
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:11,207
When I'm in trouble,
you'll be in trouble too.

24
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:14,266
I swear that I didn't kill Saeng.

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,260
The metropolitan police
asked for you.

26
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:19,720
Can you go and kill Malai?

27
00:02:19,993 --> 00:02:24,025
Without her, Dech might give in
and become my husband for real.

28
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:25,407
Dech!

29
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,440
Why are you looking for Dech here?

30
00:02:27,707 --> 00:02:30,180
Why can't I look
for him at this hour

31
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,760
when Dech and I have shared a bed?

32
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,710
Ramphoei?

33
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:46,533
Ramphoei?

34
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,760
Mueang is sick.

35
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:50,753
Ramphoei?

36
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,990
Your mom's not here, baby.

37
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:00,817
Dech?

38
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,363
Is there something wrong,
Ms. Malai?

39
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,040
Mueang is sick. He's burning up.

40
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:08,083
So I wanted Ramphoei
to tend to him.

41
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:10,970
But I don't know where she is.
She's probably not in the house.

42
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:13,710
She won't be back till morning.

43
00:03:13,883 --> 00:03:14,883
Ignore her.

44
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,790
I'll help you tend to him.

45
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:18,663
Thanks.

46
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Baby.

47
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:23,257
Baby, don't cry, sir.

48
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:26,403
Be a good boy, sir.
Be a good boy, sir.

49
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:29,303
Be a good boy, sir.
Be a good boy, sir.

50
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,790
There, there.

51
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,916
Be a good boy, sir. Be quiet, sir.

52
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:35,563
Be a good boy, sir.

53
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:40,760
Baby, baby.

54
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:42,420
Peekaboo!

55
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:44,827
Who are your parents?

56
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,080
Who are your parents?

57
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:49,073
Who are your parents?

58
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:50,850
Who are your parents?

59
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,737
Silver barbs. Silver barbs.

60
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,210
Silver barbs.

61
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:56,097
Silver barbs.

62
00:04:04,673 --> 00:04:05,860
Why are you smiling?

63
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:07,820
Seeing you get along with Mueang,

64
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:10,120
I can't help admiring you.

65
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:22,760
I really appreciate you

66
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,750
taking pity on him.

67
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,390
Even if I didn't know he was yours,

68
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,000
I couldn't help pitying him for...

69
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:34,680
having Ramphoei as a mother.

70
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,044
I truly love the right person.

71
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,960
Even though I can't turn back time
and fix what I did wrong,

72
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:48,000
I promise you

73
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:53,056
I'll make you happy every day
and night we spend together.

74
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:01,023
It's late.

75
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:03,370
And you're here
to pick a fight with me?

76
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,637
You knew it was late.
Why did it take you so long?

77
00:06:06,023 --> 00:06:07,023
Why?

78
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,880
It was my business
where I went or what I did.

79
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:12,473
Don't you forget

80
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:15,600
you didn't admit
you were my husband.

81
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:19,560
So you're just
a servant in this house.

82
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:22,030
I'm well aware
of my position and duties.

83
00:06:22,477 --> 00:06:23,477
What about you?

84
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,357
Have you done
your duties as a mother?

85
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,810
Mueang burned up
since the afternoon.

86
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:31,285
Ms. Malai gave him medicine
and wiped him without rest.

87
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:33,090
But his real mother
went out on the town,

88
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:34,196
forgetting her way home.

89
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,610
Jeez!

90
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,110
So annoying!

91
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,857
You're standing here
and chewing me out

92
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:41,997
because you're worried about Malai.

93
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:43,600
Don't use our son as an excuse!

94
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:49,103
You're crossing the line, Dech!

95
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:52,829
I never interfered with how
you squander the viscount's money.

96
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,816
But at least make time for your son
who's growing every day.

97
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,325
Or he won't know who to call "mom."

98
00:06:57,336 --> 00:07:00,543
Why? I'm happy as it is.
What are you gonna do?

99
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:05,412
Now that Ms. Malai
found out about this,

100
00:07:05,422 --> 00:07:06,800
I have nothing to lose now.

101
00:07:06,956 --> 00:07:09,063
Don't make me run out of patience.

102
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:25,806
You ambushed me because
you're worried about Malai, right?!

103
00:07:31,897 --> 00:07:34,120
Malai, you bitch.
It's all your fault.

104
00:07:34,783 --> 00:07:38,440
You and I can't really
live in the same world.

105
00:07:55,353 --> 00:07:56,353
Ms. Malai.

106
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,867
Uan, what's wrong?

107
00:07:58,387 --> 00:07:59,947
You made a ruckus running up here.

108
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,227
The servant from
Ms. Bu-nga's house said...

109
00:08:02,227 --> 00:08:03,600
her condition worsened.

110
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,700
Goodness.

111
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,480
Did they say how bad?

112
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:08,960
They didn't, ma'am.

113
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:10,777
Only that it was worrisome.

114
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:13,743
Fueang,

115
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,430
pack me a bag.

116
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:17,123
I'm gonna go see her.

117
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,120
You can't, Ms. Malai.

118
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:20,497
It's late now.

119
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:22,080
Please wait till tomorrow.

120
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:24,160
I told you to pack a bag, so go.

121
00:08:24,383 --> 00:08:26,063
These things can't wait.

122
00:08:26,803 --> 00:08:27,920
Thanks a lot, Uan.

123
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,560
But at least maybe wait
until Dech's back, ma'am.

124
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,240
Fueang, you dare disobey me?

125
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:40,840
I don't, ma'am. I'm just worried.

126
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:42,520
I get that you are.

127
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:44,617
But for this I have to go.

128
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,160
Please wait for me.

129
00:08:58,303 --> 00:09:00,170
Call a rickshaw for me, Uan.

130
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:02,440
Might be hard to find one now.

131
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,010
It's okay, ma'am.

132
00:09:04,223 --> 00:09:05,316
Wait for me a bit.

133
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:06,883
Go.

134
00:09:23,322 --> 00:09:24,995
You started working so early, Dech.

135
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:27,008
Ms. Ramphoei.

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,240
What did you want, ma'am?

137
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,483
Gee, don't be so cold, Dech.

138
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,737
I'm just here to tell you

139
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:38,840
I won't harass Ms. Malai anymore.

140
00:09:40,017 --> 00:09:41,017
Are you sure?

141
00:09:41,077 --> 00:09:42,077
Of course.

142
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:44,570
I thought about what you said.

143
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:46,877
Since I can't change your mind,

144
00:09:47,143 --> 00:09:48,796
fighting won't help anything.

145
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,560
It's better to be civil

146
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:52,816
and have fun
with the money we have.

147
00:09:57,957 --> 00:09:59,457
I'm glad you realized that.

148
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:10,990
I got an idea how to get
Malai out of the house.

149
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,250
Tell me.

150
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,800
Malai has a friend
who's very dear to her.

151
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,917
If something happens
to Bu-nga, her friend,

152
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,680
I guarantee she'll run off to her.

153
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:38,403
What's that?

154
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,000
I don't know, ma'am.
Sounds like a gunshot.

155
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:45,920
I can accept it
if you want retribution.

156
00:11:47,703 --> 00:11:50,110
But I can't let you hurt Ms. Malai.

157
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,230
Then let's go.

158
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:53,663
Yes, ma'am.

159
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:26,650
I got an idea how to get
Malai out of the house.

160
00:12:26,957 --> 00:12:27,957
Tell me.

161
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,460
Malai has a friend
who's very dear to her.

162
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,577
If something happens
to Bu-nga, her friend,

163
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,340
I guarantee she'll run off to her.

164
00:12:50,943 --> 00:12:51,943
I knew it.

165
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,320
It was suspicious.

166
00:12:54,803 --> 00:12:56,400
Suddenly giving in?

167
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:58,560
She was just fooling me

168
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,475
while planning to hurt Ms. Malai.

169
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,309
So what are you gonna do, Dech?

170
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,730
I won't let anyone
hurt my Ms. Malai.

171
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,520
No one...

172
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,440
can hurt my Ms. Malai.

173
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:17,644
Even the viscount wasn't spared.

174
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,480
You think I would spare the others?

175
00:13:39,677 --> 00:13:40,677
Oops.

176
00:13:44,143 --> 00:13:45,963
What did you just say?

177
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:48,480
Uh, Outlaw Phoem is dead.

178
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,430
There's a rumor
he was shot to dead.

179
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:54,893
That's not true.

180
00:13:55,063 --> 00:13:56,063
It's true, ma'am.

181
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:59,090
The metropolitan police
confirmed it.

182
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,350
I heard

183
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,320
he was killed by an enemy.

184
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,387
Do you know where he died?

185
00:14:06,653 --> 00:14:08,957
They say he died by our house.

186
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:11,544
He probably planned on robbing us.

187
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:14,047
Jeez, I get goosebumps
just talking about it.

188
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:15,868
I'm glad he's dead.

189
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:18,194
Or he would have killed
every one of us.

190
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:22,980
Why did you slap me?

191
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:25,552
Shut the hell up, Chaem!
I don't wanna hear it.

192
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:27,587
Yes, ma'am.

193
00:14:37,971 --> 00:14:38,971
Dech.

194
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:42,066
There's something
I'd like to report.

195
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,294
Say what you have to say.

196
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:50,920
I have somewhere to be.

197
00:14:52,473 --> 00:14:54,662
If you're gonna see
Outlaw Phoem's body,

198
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:56,003
I suggest you don't go.

199
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:57,497
Why not?

200
00:14:57,637 --> 00:14:59,110
Saeng was telling everyone.

201
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,800
I don't know whom he told this
before he died.

202
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:04,400
If you go, problems might arise.

203
00:15:05,377 --> 00:15:07,720
At least regarding his past crimes.

204
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,050
You're right.

205
00:15:11,883 --> 00:15:13,276
So what do I do?

206
00:15:14,757 --> 00:15:15,880
I'll take care of it.

207
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,040
Please trust me, Ms. Ramphoei.

208
00:15:20,477 --> 00:15:21,563
Stay here.

209
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:22,920
Do nothing.

210
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,520
I never thought
my brother would die this way.

211
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,120
Who would be so cruel and do that?

212
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:38,280
No one could predict this.

213
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:43,537
Please ease your mind.
Don't worry about anything, ma'am.

214
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,360
My brother's dead now.

215
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,750
I'm all alone now, Dech.

216
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,680
I'll take care of you.

217
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:58,520
Don't worry, ma'am.

218
00:15:58,903 --> 00:16:01,080
All I ask is
don't look at his body

219
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:03,800
or do anything
having to do with him.

220
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,880
Or you might raise
someone's suspicion.

221
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:11,304
I'll obey your every word.

222
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:12,800
I won't be defiant.

223
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:17,240
Because you're all
I have left to reply on.

224
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,240
Please don't abandon me.

225
00:16:26,857 --> 00:16:27,857
I won't, ma'am.

226
00:16:41,237 --> 00:16:43,196
I don't know who pulled this prank.

227
00:16:44,143 --> 00:16:46,143
Bu-nga's condition has not changed.

228
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,110
The servants here insisted that

229
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,880
no one was sent to our house.

230
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:54,703
It was probably someone's plan
to get you out of the house.

231
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,583
You mean Ramphoei?

232
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:02,553
Why would she do that?

233
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:06,737
You know how she is.

234
00:17:07,936 --> 00:17:09,400
If it was out of jealousy

235
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,617
or to get me out of the way,

236
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,710
it wouldn't make much sense.

237
00:17:14,897 --> 00:17:16,506
The viscount's already paralyzed,

238
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:18,960
why would she waste energy
to hurt me too?

239
00:17:19,637 --> 00:17:21,480
His fortune is already hers.

240
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,403
Even so, you can't be too careful.

241
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:28,650
You're right, Dech.

242
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,670
I still don't understand.

243
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,680
If Ramphoei really wanted
to have me killed,

244
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:36,720
when I'm at the house,

245
00:17:37,076 --> 00:17:39,600
there were plenty of chances,
why didn't she take it?

246
00:17:39,897 --> 00:17:41,560
No matter what, I think

247
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:43,400
you should be very careful.

248
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:44,827
You can't be complacent.

249
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,397
Yes, Dech.

250
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,710
Or...

251
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:51,056
did Ramphoei
just want to scare me?

252
00:17:51,343 --> 00:17:52,480
It's possible.

253
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,680
But it's better
that you're careful.

254
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:58,400
We don't know
what she'll pull again.

255
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,240
I agree.

256
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:05,720
Thank you very much
for picking me up here

257
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,600
when it's not necessary.

258
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:13,480
For you,

259
00:18:13,663 --> 00:18:16,400
I'm willing to go anywhere.

260
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:22,037
Then let me see Bu-nga a bit
before I leave.

261
00:18:22,597 --> 00:18:23,597
Yes, ma'am.

262
00:18:31,423 --> 00:18:33,303
Even if I would burn in hell,

263
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:36,323
if it could protect Ms. Malai,

264
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,530
I'm willing to do it
without regrets.

265
00:18:48,683 --> 00:18:52,290
If you're hungry, blink once.

266
00:18:52,301 --> 00:18:54,920
If you're not, blink twice.

267
00:18:55,283 --> 00:18:56,636
Can you do that?

268
00:19:01,449 --> 00:19:05,940
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

269
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:10,896
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

270
00:19:15,543 --> 00:19:16,543
Fueang.

271
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:18,077
Ms. Malai.

272
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:21,603
Please wash the clothes in the bag.

273
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,760
Yes, ma'am.

274
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,663
Ms. Malai!

275
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:27,416
You're back just in time.

276
00:19:27,743 --> 00:19:28,840
What happened, Uan?

277
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,150
The viscount wouldn't eat.

278
00:19:32,843 --> 00:19:36,040
No matter how hard I tried
to feed him, he wouldn't eat.

279
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:37,640
You don't need to feed him.

280
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,130
Let him starve to death.

281
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,924
How can we do that, Fueang?

282
00:19:42,637 --> 00:19:44,637
Did you ask him
why he wouldn't eat?

283
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,043
I tried to ask him, ma'am.

284
00:19:48,377 --> 00:19:49,990
But I didn't know
how to talk to him.

285
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:51,800
He can only watch me.

286
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,070
I can't read his mind.

287
00:19:55,597 --> 00:19:57,040
Then I'll see him myself.

288
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,590
Go do what I asked, Fueang.

289
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:00,864
You can go rest, Uan.

290
00:20:01,095 --> 00:20:02,402
I'll call if I need anything.

291
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:03,963
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

292
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:25,240
I heard you wouldn't eat.

293
00:20:31,783 --> 00:20:32,783
My lord,

294
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,583
You can't do whatever you want.

295
00:20:37,557 --> 00:20:38,604
You can't talk.

296
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,570
No one can read your mind.

297
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:48,280
You're annoyed?

298
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,840
Being scolded for defying.

299
00:20:50,077 --> 00:20:51,600
It's natural to feel annoyed.

300
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:16,000
If you're hungry,

301
00:21:16,644 --> 00:21:18,557
blink one time.

302
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:21,017
If you're not,

303
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,920
blink two times.

304
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,449
Can you do that?

305
00:21:35,983 --> 00:21:37,536
Then I'll feed you, my lord.

306
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,920
Don't want me to feed you?

307
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:59,064
Or you don't want
the food Uan brought?

308
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,690
I get it now.

309
00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:07,160
I'll get you
different food, my lord.

310
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:31,536
I've seen you like this for days.

311
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:33,889
Go see a doctor
to find out what's wrong.

312
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,624
Your condition's not improving
like you said at all.

313
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,240
I'm fine.

314
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:45,800
Stop asking me.

315
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,910
Eh?

316
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:49,704
I'm worried about you.

317
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,030
You might be seriously ill.

318
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,400
You're usually healthy.

319
00:22:55,857 --> 00:22:56,857
Oh.

320
00:23:08,957 --> 00:23:10,117
Brew this and drink it.

321
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:12,136
The doctor insisted that you do.

322
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,404
Jeez, this is expensive.

323
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,120
You didn't have to do this.

324
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,950
I had to.

325
00:23:20,257 --> 00:23:22,692
You're in this situation
because of me.

326
00:23:25,983 --> 00:23:27,983
Please come out healthy, boy.

327
00:23:30,523 --> 00:23:31,816
How do you know it's a boy?

328
00:23:32,223 --> 00:23:33,480
What if it's a girl?

329
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,600
Either way,
I want them to be healthy.

330
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,797
Take good care
of this baby, Fueang.

331
00:23:41,117 --> 00:23:42,240
They're my nibling.

332
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,803
What food do you have?
I'm starving.

333
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,797
You woke up almost noon, Chaem.

334
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:21,283
Stop complaining.
I'm just a little late.

335
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:22,294
So, food?

336
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:23,583
Over there.

337
00:24:24,203 --> 00:24:25,379
Eat if it's to your liking.

338
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,080
If it's not, go eat somewhere else.

339
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:30,160
- What?
- Uan,

340
00:24:30,517 --> 00:24:32,160
Watch my decoction pot.

341
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,979
I'm gonna check
the clothes I air dry.

342
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,990
I'll watch it.

343
00:24:35,243 --> 00:24:36,263
Don't be long.

344
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:57,063
What's wrong with Fueang?
Why is she brewing this?

345
00:24:57,343 --> 00:25:00,243
Don't know. She's been sick
for days. It won't go away.

346
00:25:18,263 --> 00:25:19,863
Pregnancy medicine?

347
00:25:21,403 --> 00:25:22,403
Chaem.

348
00:25:22,782 --> 00:25:25,223
Are you eating? I went through
the trouble of making it.

349
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,750
Of course.

350
00:25:27,823 --> 00:25:29,080
Eat it here.

351
00:25:29,477 --> 00:25:31,370
And don't mess
with Fueang's decoction.

352
00:25:31,817 --> 00:25:32,817
Why not?

353
00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:35,080
I might be able to help
if she's terminally ill.

354
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,977
You're so nosy.

355
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,280
What did you say Fueang brew?

356
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,390
Pregnancy decoction, ma'am.

357
00:25:55,143 --> 00:25:57,143
I brew it for you many times

358
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,600
so I recognized its smell.

359
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,000
I was even more certain
when I saw the herbs.

360
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,030
Fueang's pregnant?

361
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,192
When did she get
knocked up and by whom?

362
00:26:06,203 --> 00:26:07,856
Jeez, I wouldn't know, ma'am.

363
00:26:08,096 --> 00:26:09,238
If she's pregnant,

364
00:26:09,248 --> 00:26:12,480
she must have been a slut
and sneaked around with someone.

365
00:26:12,963 --> 00:26:15,403
But where would she get
medicine that expensive?

366
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:17,725
If she was a slut
and got herself a rich husband,

367
00:26:17,736 --> 00:26:20,519
she wouldn't still be here
serving Malai.

368
00:26:21,883 --> 00:26:22,883
That's true, ma'am.

369
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:31,463
I just drank it, Dech.

370
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:32,976
Just drink it.

371
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,050
If not for you, then for the baby.

372
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,310
She's not carrying my baby!

373
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:40,316
You two stop lying.

(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

376
00:26:54,523 --> 00:26:56,240
This method might take time,

377
00:26:57,129 --> 00:26:58,129
but it...

378
00:26:58,556 --> 00:27:00,583
might help you
communicate, my lord.

379
00:27:06,783 --> 00:27:11,200
If I point at a letter or a vowel

380
00:27:11,637 --> 00:27:13,637
and you blink once,

381
00:27:14,183 --> 00:27:16,370
that means
it's the right letter or vowel.

382
00:27:17,297 --> 00:27:20,097
If it's not, blink twice.

383
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Understood?

384
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,910
Then let's start
with something simple.

385
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,610
Uh...

386
00:27:29,603 --> 00:27:31,603
What do you want to eat today?

387
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,080
The medicine smell.

388
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:11,720
I just drank it, Dech.

389
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,280
Drink it again.

390
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:15,963
The doctor insisted
on three times a day.

391
00:28:16,437 --> 00:28:18,924
Jeez, I can't. It's bitter.

392
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:20,163
No more.

393
00:28:20,763 --> 00:28:21,883
Just drink it.

394
00:28:22,397 --> 00:28:24,480
If not for you, then for the baby.

395
00:28:28,882 --> 00:28:30,676
The doctor insisted
so the baby's strong.

396
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:36,449
Or do you want me to feed you?

397
00:28:39,777 --> 00:28:40,777
No way.

398
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:43,697
Pumpkin in sweet coconut milk?

399
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,797
You want pumpkin
in sweet coconut milk?

400
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:52,083
You got it.

401
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:54,360
I'll make it for you, my lord.

402
00:29:00,561 --> 00:29:01,561
What, my lord?

403
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:03,600
What else do you want?

404
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,510
Huh?

405
00:29:19,177 --> 00:29:20,177
Cho-ching?

406
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,470

408
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,780
Chan? (I?)

409
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
Chan? (I?)

410
00:30:12,623 --> 00:30:13,623
Tho-thung?

411
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:17,603
(Tho-thung)

412
00:30:18,377 --> 00:30:19,084
I...

413
00:30:19,095 --> 00:30:20,095
I...

414
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:27,088
The u vowel?

415
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,160
(I was...)

416
00:30:35,358 --> 00:30:37,520
I was...

417
00:30:49,897 --> 00:30:50,897
(Tho-thahan)

418
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,440
Tho-thahan?

419
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:08,003
The am vowel?

420
00:31:11,063 --> 00:31:12,063
(Tham - Made)

421
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,050
Tham? (Made?)

424
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
made...

425
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:31,477
I was made...? (I was attacked?)

426
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:42,563
Just drink it.

427
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,370
No way!

428
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,016
Dech!

429
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:53,029
Hey! Ms. Ramphoei!

430
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,080
Have you gone mad?!

431
00:31:57,109 --> 00:31:58,109
Ramphoei?

432
00:32:16,063 --> 00:32:18,043
Shameless! Stealing
someone else's husband!

433
00:32:18,076 --> 00:32:19,760
No wonder you run your mouth.

434
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,523
Wanna compete with me, Fueang?!

435
00:32:22,076 --> 00:32:24,225
Think I'm scared of you?
Come get me if you dare!

436
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:25,349
Come get me, Ramphoei!

437
00:32:25,796 --> 00:32:28,489
You act tough. I'll slap you
so hard you miscarry!

438
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:34,243
You're choosing your new wife
over me, Dech?!

439
00:32:34,397 --> 00:32:35,397
Ms. Ramphoei!

440
00:32:35,563 --> 00:32:36,879
Stop imagining things!

441
00:32:37,316 --> 00:32:38,603
She's not carrying my baby!

442
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,950
If it's not your baby,

443
00:32:42,283 --> 00:32:43,530
then whose is it?!

444
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,620
Don't tell you

445
00:32:47,993 --> 00:32:49,436
you're having an affair with Kam.

446
00:32:50,263 --> 00:32:51,263
Good.

447
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,160
I'll get Uan to slap you
so hard your mouth bleeds!

448
00:32:54,477 --> 00:32:55,477
You don't only

449
00:32:55,657 --> 00:32:57,657
do vile things,
but also have vile thoughts!

450
00:32:57,857 --> 00:33:00,680
Well, Dech and Kam are
the only two men in this house.

451
00:33:00,936 --> 00:33:02,783
If it weren't them,
who would it be?

452
00:33:06,243 --> 00:33:07,636
You can't answer me because

453
00:33:07,647 --> 00:33:09,723
you're having an affair
with my husband, Fueang!

454
00:33:10,063 --> 00:33:11,063
You! You!

455
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:12,323
Let go! Let go!

456
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,000
What did you just say?!

457
00:33:20,397 --> 00:33:21,724
You didn't hear it clearly?

458
00:33:22,303 --> 00:33:23,400
I'll tell you.

459
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,880
Your most beloved Fueang...

460
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,990
was knocked up by Dech, my husband.

461
00:33:32,103 --> 00:33:33,360
That's not true, Ms. Malai!

462
00:33:34,077 --> 00:33:35,077
Fueang's not pregnant.

463
00:33:45,183 --> 00:33:47,156
Why else would she
drink pregnancy decoction?

464
00:33:48,663 --> 00:33:50,750
I drank it before. I know!

465
00:33:51,357 --> 00:33:53,000
Chaem told me herself.

466
00:33:53,183 --> 00:33:55,183
You two stop lying.

467

- Come here!
- Hey, Ramphoei!

468
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,850
You're gonna steal
my husband, you slave?!

476
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,390
Ms. Ramphoei,

477
00:34:45,723 --> 00:34:47,560
stop making people misunderstand.

478
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,237
You can stay stupid
and believe them if you want.

479
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,017
But I don't believe them!

480
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,310
Ms. Ramphoei!

481
00:34:58,523 --> 00:35:00,610
Ow, let go! Let go of me! Let go!

482
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:01,870
Dech, let go!

My Ms. Malai.

487
00:35:25,116 --> 00:35:26,116
Fueang.

488
00:35:27,403 --> 00:35:28,560
Why are you crying?

489
00:35:32,483 --> 00:35:33,640
Just tell the truth.

490
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,830
I can take it.

491
00:35:36,683 --> 00:35:38,480
Dech really didn't knock me up.

492
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,063
Please believe me, Ms. Malai.

493
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,000
Ms. Ramphoei just was
trying to break us up.

494
00:35:53,003 --> 00:35:54,290
So who knocked you up?

495
00:36:26,677 --> 00:36:29,017
You said you loved Malai so much.

496
00:36:29,123 --> 00:36:30,510
How could you knock up Fueang?!

497
00:36:30,597 --> 00:36:32,160
Stop, Ms. Ramphoei!

498
00:36:32,297 --> 00:36:33,297
I won't!

499
00:36:33,303 --> 00:36:35,303
With me you played
hard to get, Dech!

500
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:36,796
Stop!

501
00:36:38,077 --> 00:36:39,077
Ow.

502
00:36:40,477 --> 00:36:42,170
You dare do this to me?!

503
00:36:42,423 --> 00:36:45,120
You wouldn't listen to reason!
You kept making a scene!

504
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:48,156
I'm like this because I'm jealous!

505
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:50,520
I'm not like Malai

506
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:54,443
who would let my own husband
knock up girls all over town!

507
00:36:55,043 --> 00:36:56,803
It's not what you think,
Ms. Ramphoei.

508
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,290
I see.

509
00:36:58,403 --> 00:36:59,520
You're protecting her?!

510
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,050
You love her so much?!

511
00:37:01,061 --> 00:37:01,930
Fine.

512
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:03,240
Let go!

513
00:37:03,316 --> 00:37:04,790
If you don't listen to reason,

514
00:37:04,963 --> 00:37:06,963
I will have to
tie you up, Ms. Ramphoei.

515
00:37:06,983 --> 00:37:07,783
Let go!

516
00:37:07,797 --> 00:37:08,720
No!

517
00:37:11,169 --> 00:37:12,710
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

518
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:15,809
Ms. Ramphoei!

519
00:37:25,983 --> 00:37:26,983
Fueang!

520
00:37:27,463 --> 00:37:28,640
- Come here!
- Hey, Ramphoei!

521
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,630
You're gonna steal
my husband, you slave?!

522
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:32,983
Fueang!

523
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,950
Fueang!

524
00:37:44,423 --> 00:37:45,423
Fueang!

525
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:46,883
Fueang!

526
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:48,440
Fueang, please be okay!

527
00:37:49,056 --> 00:37:50,056
Fueang!

528
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:51,569
Fueang!

529
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,800
Dech! Dech!

530
00:37:54,043 --> 00:37:55,576
Fueang fell down the stairs! Help!

531
00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:57,076
Dech!

532
00:37:57,383 --> 00:37:58,383
Fueang?

533
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,343
Fueang?

534
00:38:00,663 --> 00:38:01,663
Fueang?

535
00:38:09,443 --> 00:38:10,443
- Fueang?!
- Fueang?!

536
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,866
I knew how depraved he could be,

537
00:38:23,877 --> 00:38:25,557
but I didn't expect this.

538
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,220
It was all my fault

539
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:29,320
you fell victim to this atrocity.

540
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,800
Forget it.

541
00:38:31,173 --> 00:38:32,513
It's nothing, right?

542
00:38:32,653 --> 00:38:34,200
It's not nothing, Fueang!

543
00:38:34,473 --> 00:38:36,040
The viscount raped you!

544
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,403
You son of a bitch.

545
00:38:44,414 --> 00:38:45,747
Fueang is like my sister

546
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:46,920
but you didn't spare her.

547
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:49,557
I once regretted doing this to you

548
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,560
because you'd fostered me.

549
00:38:51,877 --> 00:38:53,157
An animal like you

550
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:56,049
deserves this suffering
as punishment.

551
00:39:11,897 --> 00:39:13,320
How did I get here?

552
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
My baby.

553
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,790
Your baby's okay.

554
00:39:20,217 --> 00:39:21,217
You should rest.

555
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:26,428
I called a doctor
while you were unconscious.

556
00:39:26,543 --> 00:39:28,543
He said you and the baby were okay.

557
00:39:29,523 --> 00:39:31,523
Will you lie down now, huh?

558
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:47,363
If you don't believe me,
I'll get the doctor here tomorrow.

559
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,080
I'm not worried about that.

560
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,440
If you're not worried
about the baby,

561
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:53,760
what are you worried about?

562
00:39:56,543 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm worried about Ms. Malai.

563
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:07,000
I don't want
you and Ms. Malai to fight.

564
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,520
Thanks a lot.

565
00:40:10,403 --> 00:40:12,360
But I have my reason
for not telling her yet.

566
00:40:13,237 --> 00:40:14,320
What do you mean?

567
00:40:15,597 --> 00:40:16,597
I...

568
00:40:25,983 --> 00:40:28,017
I'm worried about
your and your baby's safety.

569
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,103
Why are you worried about me?

570
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,480
I'm worried you'll be
in hot water with Ms. Malai.

571
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:40,400
Fueang, listen to me carefully.

572
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:44,040
If Ms. Ramphoei finds out
the baby is the viscount's,

573
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,120
she'll try to get rid of you.

574
00:40:46,963 --> 00:40:48,010
You're right.

575
00:40:48,477 --> 00:40:50,190
Even though I don't want his money,

576
00:40:51,663 --> 00:40:52,890
this baby

577
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:55,577
is the viscount's sole heir.

578
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,237
Don't you trust Ms. Malai?

579
00:40:59,537 --> 00:41:00,537
It's not that.

580
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:05,240
You know Ms. Malai is the only one
in this house you and I can trust.

581
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,560
Even with Uan and Kam,

582
00:41:07,857 --> 00:41:09,404
you can't slip up about this.

583
00:41:12,663 --> 00:41:13,663
Mm.

584
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,750
When will you tell Ms. Malai?

585
00:41:16,977 --> 00:41:18,840
I've been meaning to tell her,

586
00:41:19,149 --> 00:41:20,363
but I haven't got a chance.

587
00:41:23,037 --> 00:41:24,037
Go back to sleep.

588
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,450
Dech?

589
00:41:27,683 --> 00:41:28,683
Thanks.

590
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,870
Mm.

591
00:41:44,996 --> 00:41:45,996
Come here.

592
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:53,356
I didn't really want to touch you.

593
00:41:55,089 --> 00:41:56,400
Why did you bring me here?

594
00:41:57,803 --> 00:42:00,080
I'm bothered not getting
to hear the rest of it?

595
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:01,603
Jeez.

596
00:42:01,763 --> 00:42:03,680
In front of him
you act all trusting,

597
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,040
so lovey-dovey.

598
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,920
In reality you're jealous too.

599
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,480
You came just to say this?

600
00:42:08,837 --> 00:42:09,837
So I can leave.

601
00:42:10,523 --> 00:42:12,200
You're not sure either, aren't you?

602
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,800
That Fueang's baby

603
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,030
is not Dech's.

604
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,720
I'm so curious

605
00:42:24,997 --> 00:42:27,417
how much longer
you can act like a saint

606
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:31,200
when you know
the man you worship so much

607
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,760
knocked up another woman.

608
00:42:34,477 --> 00:42:36,124
You can say whatever you want.

609
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:40,440
But I believe Dech and Fueang
wouldn't lie to me.

610
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,336
I'll wait for the day
that baby's born

611
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,997
and it looks like its father.

612
00:42:48,743 --> 00:42:49,840
On that day,

613
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,160
I will laugh so hard I'll
I knock my teeth out.

614
00:42:59,837 --> 00:43:00,837
Oh.

615
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,640
Even if you can accept this,

616
00:43:04,657 --> 00:43:06,657
I will never let her child

617
00:43:06,977 --> 00:43:10,080
get even one penny
from my son's fortune.

618
00:43:47,763 --> 00:43:49,480
Why did Dech tell
two different stories?

619
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:51,930
I'm not afraid.

620
00:43:52,217 --> 00:43:54,040
Don't think I'm not onto you.

621
00:43:54,317 --> 00:43:55,680
You and Ramphoei

622
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,880
conspired
to paralyze His Lordship.

623
00:43:58,757 --> 00:44:01,657
The same way
you conspired to fake her death!

624
00:44:02,803 --> 00:44:04,000
Don't trust Dech!

625
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,070
