19
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:10,922
That hurts!

20
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:14,062
Help!

21
00:02:14,797 --> 00:02:16,172
Help me!

22
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:18,133
Help me!

23
00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:20,070
If you are not going to help me,

24
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:22,709
I have no choice but to let Malai

25
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:23,937
sleep with another man.

26
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:36,086
For what occasion, my lord?

27
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:37,476
To comfort you after

28
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:39,047
your recent brush with death.

29
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,094
It's such a waste, my lord.

30
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:42,883
Don't dwell on it too much, Malai.

31
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:44,031
I offer it willingly.

32
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:45,976
Here, let me put it on for you.

33
00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:47,352
Yes, my lord.

34
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:52,429
Excuse me.

35
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:11,594
I didn't expect you

36
00:03:11,618 --> 00:03:13,094
to be so biased, my lord.

37
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:16,390
I merely asked you a question,

38
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:17,759
why didn't you respond?

39
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,055
Give me a break.

40
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,826
Acting so audacious in front of me.

41
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:23,398
I'm simply asserting my rights

42
00:03:23,423 --> 00:03:25,023
as your other wife, my lord.

43
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:26,969
Whatever that damn woman...

44
00:03:32,063 --> 00:03:33,289
Ms. Malai receives,

45
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,687
I should receive as well!

46
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,008
I refuse.

47
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,116
Whatever and whoever

48
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:38,256
I choose to gift is my decision.

49
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:39,444
Stop making demands.

50
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,640
I was in a good mood,

51
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:42,055
but you've come and ruined it.

52
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:43,172
Go wherever you want,

53
00:03:43,188 --> 00:03:44,423
get away from my sight.

54
00:03:44,447 --> 00:03:45,447
Leave!

55
00:04:02,788 --> 00:04:03,929
Malai,

56
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,491
let's go outside.

57
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,460
Let's go.

58
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:31,801
My lord, why did you take her side?

59
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:39,051
Just you wait,

60
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:40,887
I will find a way to drive you

61
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:42,161

62
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:43,489

for taking me out and

86
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:54,055
broadening my horizons.

Thank you again, my lord.

91
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:04,228
Geez.

92
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,610
No need to thank me.

93
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:09,766
It's normal for a husband

94
00:07:09,774 --> 00:07:11,102
to take his wife out.

95
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:14,790
I apologize for not having more time

96
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:16,835

97
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:28,126
Malai.

98
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:30,165
Is something wrong?

99
00:07:30,931 --> 00:07:32,852
Why did you suddenly become quiet?

100
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:37,704
I feel guilty, my lord.

101
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:40,016
My lord, you've been so kind to me,

102
00:07:40,048 --> 00:07:41,172
but I'm still unable

103
00:07:41,196 --> 00:07:42,360
to give you a child.

104
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:44,469
If you don't receive

105
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,055
your inheritance from Father,

106
00:07:46,344 --> 00:07:48,594
part of it is my fault.

107
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:51,377
Umm...

108
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:54,158
You see,

109
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:56,228
there's something I need to confess.

110
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,134
The truth is...

111
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,580
Well...

112
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:04,111
I...

113
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,845
I am infertile.

114
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:10,033
My goodness...

115
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:16,255
is that why I haven't been

116
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,021
able to conceive?

117
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:33,149
It's alright, my lord.

118
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,430
Even if you

119
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:36,774
don't inherit the property

120
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,641
due to the lack of an heir for Father,

121
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:42,100
we can still live together like this.

122
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,024
Malai...

123
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,383
My lord is still working

124
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,586
in government service.

125
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:49,415
I'm not ashamed to work and support us.

126
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:53,188
I have some cooking skills,

127
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:55,930
if we open a restaurant,

128
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:57,790
my cooking will sell decently.

129
00:08:58,626 --> 00:08:59,743
We wouldn't have to

130
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,219
live in great hardship.

131
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:04,665
Malai.

132
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:06,743
Listen carefully.

133
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:08,665
Government service

134
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:11,079
isn't as prosperous as it used to be.

135
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:13,821
I don't want you to struggle

136
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:14,821
because of me.

137
00:09:15,532 --> 00:09:16,563
I should rightfully

138
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:18,211
inherit Father's inheritance,

139
00:09:18,252 --> 00:09:21,375
as the son of the primary wife.

140
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:24,766
Then what will you do, my lord?

141
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:25,524
Since...

142
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:27,266
Have a child with Dech instead of me.

143
00:09:34,673 --> 00:09:36,297
Please calm down first, Malai.

144
00:09:36,337 --> 00:09:38,820
- Think this through carefully.
- What were you thinking, my lord?

145
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:40,094
To have your own wife

146
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:41,320
sleep with another man?

147
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:43,703
This is a great dishonor for a woman!

148
00:09:44,157 --> 00:09:46,203
But no one would know about this.

149
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:47,797
If it's successful,

150
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,110
we could live comfortably

151
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:50,500
for the rest of our lives.

152
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:52,212
My lord...

153
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:11,817
Malai.

154
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,019
Was this terrible plan

155
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,644
your idea, Dech?

156
00:10:18,262 --> 00:10:19,262
I...

157
00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:33,905
Malai!

158
00:10:34,382 --> 00:10:35,413

Please open the door and talk to me.

165
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,366
I wish to be alone, my lord.

166
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:58,132
Malai, don't do this.

167
00:10:58,413 --> 00:10:59,741
Please calm down first, Malai.

168
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:01,179
Malai.

169
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:02,890
You belittled my feelings.

170
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,632
I have nothing to say to you, my lord.

171
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:10,905
Please open the door.

172
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:12,843
Let's talk.

173
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:15,132
Malai.

174
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:17,405
Please open the door.

175
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:19,929
They just made up,

176
00:11:19,954 --> 00:11:20,890
now they're already quarreling.

177

Malai.

178
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,781
Serves you right.

179
00:11:23,054 --> 00:11:24,054
Please come out and talk.

180
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,659
I wonder what it's about.

181
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,706
If you agree to collaborate with me

182
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:33,378
in chasing that damn Malai away

183

from this household,

184
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,698
I'll reward you with a

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,409
What seems to be troubling you, my lord?

192
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:20,058
It's not your business.

193
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,831
Please sit down.

194
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:24,157
Let me help brighten

195
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:25,768
your spirits, my lord.

196
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,034
- Please back off.
- Allow me, my lord.

197
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:02,387
My lord,

198
00:14:02,957 --> 00:14:03,997
what's wrong?

199
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:10,707
My lord!

200
00:14:44,611 --> 00:14:45,985
Wow!

201
00:14:46,634 --> 00:14:48,900
Today is my lucky day!

202
00:14:50,064 --> 00:14:51,344
Please don't say that.

203
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:53,312
I'm worried sick about why

204
00:14:53,337 --> 00:14:55,478
Ms. Malai refusing to eat.

205
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:58,681
Ms. Malai?

206
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:00,533
Exactly.

207
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,134
Do you have any idea

208
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,048
what's wrong with her?

209
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:05,532
How would I know?

210
00:15:06,853 --> 00:15:08,493
What? Why did he ask?

211
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:10,587
Hey.

212
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:12,126
Can I eat it now?

213
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,666
Kam.

214
00:15:15,705 --> 00:15:17,505
Go change the plates first.

215
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:19,408
Yes, wife.

216
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:24,648
Having a husband is like having a child.

217
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,843
Please forget about

218
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:23,453
what the Viscount asked of you.

219
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:26,601
I swear it was not my idea.

220
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:36,242
I deeply apologize

221
00:16:37,032 --> 00:16:39,305
if I am the source of your distress.

222
00:16:40,836 --> 00:16:42,787
I can confirm that I genuinely care

223
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:44,936
for your feelings the most.

224
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:00,481
My lord!

225
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:06,520
I thought you were the Viscount.

226
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:09,176
The Viscount has matters to attend to.

227
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:24,557
If there's anything you need,

228
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:25,799
please let me know.

229
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:28,330
I am aware that

230
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,690
Dech is the most favored

231
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,534
among the servants.

232
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,185
And, ma'am?

233
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:47,039
If you agree to cooperate with me

234
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:48,703
in chasing that damn Malai away

235
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:49,867
from this household,

236
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:51,148
I'll reward you with a

237
00:17:51,164 --> 00:17:52,553
substantial sum of money

238
00:17:52,578 --> 00:17:53,915
for your future endeavors.

239
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,970
You won't have to

240
00:17:54,993 --> 00:17:56,274
be a servant for eternity.

241
00:18:04,228 --> 00:18:05,454
Why are you laughing?

242
00:18:07,978 --> 00:18:09,595
I laugh because Ms. Ramphoei

243
00:18:09,611 --> 00:18:10,977
thinks too simplistically.

244
00:18:12,618 --> 00:18:13,978
What do you mean?

245
00:18:17,925 --> 00:18:20,073
I know the Viscount better than anyone,

246
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:22,081
and I know that

247
00:18:22,136 --> 00:18:23,744
no matter what, there's no way

248
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,550
he would favor you, Ms. Ramphoei.

249
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,097
Or.

250
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:33,128
Any other woman in the world.

251
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,878
Are you talking back to me now?

252
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,964
Malai must have paid you off a lot,

253
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:45,472
so you're refusing to help me.

254
00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:48,703
Oh...

255
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,335
That damn Malai offered you something

256
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,366
other than money, huh?

257
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,429
What do you mean, Ms. Ramphoei?

258
00:18:57,062 --> 00:18:58,148
If not with money,

259
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,468
then with her body.

260
00:19:00,797 --> 00:19:01,898
That would explain

261
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:03,249
why you're so loyal to her.

262
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:04,234
Please don't speak

263
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:05,421
disrespectfully about Ms. Malai.

264
00:19:06,054 --> 00:19:06,945
Oh my!

265
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,945
If you're getting so furious,

266
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:11,903
how can I not have wicked thoughts?

267
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:15,359
Only people with a vile

268
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,632
and despicable heart

269
00:19:16,804 --> 00:19:18,726
would entertain such wicked thoughts.

270
00:19:19,062 --> 00:19:20,062
Dech!

271
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:22,210
How dare you speak to me like that, cur?

272
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,398
Just you wait,

273
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,382
I will drive you out of this house

274
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:26,898
along with that damn Malai!

275
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,298
Will you be

276
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:45,063
staying with me tonight, my lord?

277
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:56,524
You're welcome to

278
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,141
share anything troubling you,

279
00:19:58,603 --> 00:19:59,891
in case I may be of help.

280
00:20:01,673 --> 00:20:02,727
Even if I told you,

281
00:20:02,752 --> 00:20:04,408
you wouldn't be able to help me.

282
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,680
I wish to be ill.

283
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:09,102
Gravely ill. But not actually ill.

284
00:20:10,697 --> 00:20:12,040
Can you help with that?

285
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:15,558
Why would my lord

286
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,029
want to suddenly be sick?

287
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:19,505
If you can't help me,

288
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:21,404
then don't ask so many questions.

289
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,450
Wait a moment, my lord.

290
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,396
When I was a child...

291
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:32,224
When I was working,

292
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:34,411
I knew a doctor who could prepare

293
00:20:34,436 --> 00:20:35,475
medicine just the way

294
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,654
you desire, my lord.

295
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,474
Malai-

296
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:45,357
Oww!

297
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:46,966
Oww...

298
00:20:47,489 --> 00:20:48,489
My lord!

299
00:20:49,536 --> 00:20:50,536
My lord!

300
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:55,357
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

301
00:20:55,387 --> 00:21:00,317
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

302
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,122
You really don't know how much

303
00:21:03,404 --> 00:21:05,060
wealth the Viscount possesses?

304
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,536
It's true.

305
00:21:06,576 --> 00:21:08,505
Ah, I apologize, Ms. Ranchaun.

306
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:10,482
I know it's not proper to

307
00:21:10,506 --> 00:21:12,306
inquire about such matters.

308
00:21:12,717 --> 00:21:14,458
It's not a question of propriety.

309
00:21:14,498 --> 00:21:16,099
But it's important that a wife should

310
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:17,411
be aware her husband's

311
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:18,646
financial affairs.

312
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:21,161
It is only right

313
00:21:21,263 --> 00:21:22,599
for you to be aware.

314
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:23,872
But we've only been

315
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:25,568
married for a few months,

316
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:27,419
and I haven't gathered

317
00:21:27,443 --> 00:21:28,880
the courage to delve into it.

318
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,075
If you believe it's that significant,

319
00:21:31,435 --> 00:21:33,271
can you enlighten me?

320
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:39,060
To the best of my knowledge,

321
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:40,357
the Viscount likely

322
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,896
has only a stipend.

323
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:44,380
He may live comfortably for now,

324
00:21:44,396 --> 00:21:45,615
it may not last for long.

325
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,075
Is it that terrible?

326
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,685
I never thought that

327
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,825
a government position could

328
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,849
decline to such an extent.

329
00:21:52,873 --> 00:21:54,747
I'm equally worried.

330
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:57,279
In truth, the count and I

331
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:58,825
are not particularly affluent.

332
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,575
If we assist each other in frugality,

333
00:22:02,013 --> 00:22:03,169
it should be sufficient

334
00:22:03,178 --> 00:22:04,271
to sustain ourselves.

335
00:22:07,683 --> 00:22:08,909
If the Viscount does not

336
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:10,518
inherit substantial wealth,

337
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,846
he will be unable to

338
00:22:14,206 --> 00:22:15,768
continue supporting

339
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,737
his servants like this.

340
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:19,502
They'll likely be let go and

341
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:20,682
seek their own employment.

342
00:22:24,272 --> 00:22:26,185
Young male and female servants

343
00:22:26,405 --> 00:22:27,771
may be able to find work

344
00:22:27,796 --> 00:22:28,967
as farm laborers,

345
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:31,100
but for those who are older,

346
00:22:32,163 --> 00:22:34,154
without any capital to start a business,

347
00:22:34,491 --> 00:22:36,912
it may prove challenging.

348
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:16,961
I am infertile.

349
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,405
Then what will you do, my lord?

350
00:23:21,836 --> 00:23:22,547
Since...

351
00:23:22,572 --> 00:23:24,289
Have a child with Dech instead of me.

352
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:31,515
Dech and I

353
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:33,124
were orphans.

354
00:23:33,514 --> 00:23:35,522
We were taken in by the lord,

355
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:37,312
he taught us to read and write.

356
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:39,218
As for Kam and Uan,

357
00:23:39,695 --> 00:23:41,304
they used to have paddy field,

358
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:43,366
but they failed and got into debt.

359
00:23:43,578 --> 00:23:45,710
They had to depend on the viscount

360
00:23:45,765 --> 00:23:47,530
and become his lordship's servants

361
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:48,539
in return.

362
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,820
If the Viscount does not

363
00:23:50,828 --> 00:23:52,429
inherit substantial wealth,

364
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:55,757
he will be unable to

365
00:23:56,117 --> 00:23:57,679
continue supporting

366
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,703
his servants like this.

367
00:24:01,961 --> 00:24:03,124
They'll likely be let go and

368
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:04,289
seek their own employment.

369
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,280
Malai, are you no longer angry?

370
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:35,654
I request a divorce from you, my lord.

371
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:38,068
Please calm down, Malai.

372
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,341
Let's discuss this matter calmly.

373
00:24:40,717 --> 00:24:42,060
If you were to divorce me,

374
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:43,825
how would you sustain yourself?

375
00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:45,091
You have no relatives.

376
00:24:45,131 --> 00:24:46,865
I'm prepared to endure hardships.

377
00:24:47,075 --> 00:24:48,505
Even if I am forsaken by all

378
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,890
and left bereft,

379
00:24:51,178 --> 00:24:52,701
it would still be preferable to

380
00:24:52,787 --> 00:24:54,396
being compelled to sleep with

381
00:24:54,421 --> 00:24:56,054
another man who isn't my husband.

382
00:24:56,076 --> 00:24:58,310
I refuse to be branded as an adulteress.

383
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:00,403
If it should come to pass,

384
00:25:00,428 --> 00:25:01,294
I would rather die.

385
00:25:01,498 --> 00:25:03,185
It is not adultery,

386
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:05,341
for I am aware of everything,

387
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,490
Malai...

388
00:25:07,178 --> 00:25:08,247
Tonight, I will sleep in

389
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,193
another room, my lord.

390
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:11,193
Malai!

391
00:25:11,662 --> 00:25:12,779
Oww!

392
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:15,419
Oww...

393
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:16,958
My lord!

394
00:25:17,842 --> 00:25:18,842
My lord!

395
00:25:20,076 --> 00:25:21,076
My lord!

396
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:24,224
Oh no! Your body is all hot!

397
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,919
Someone, please help the viscount!

398
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,490
My lord!

399
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,740
Kam,

400
00:25:29,748 --> 00:25:31,325
swiftly go and summon the doctor for me.

401
00:25:31,349 --> 00:25:31,974
Yes, ma'am.

402
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:33,372
Umm, Uan, get a towel to

403
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:34,974
cleanse the viscount's body.

404
00:25:34,998 --> 00:25:36,529
- You may summon Fueang to assist you.
- Yes, ma'am.

405
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:38,271
Chaem!

406
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:39,803
Chaem!

407
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:41,756
Chaem!

408
00:25:42,303 --> 00:25:43,325
This viscount is sick,

409
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,122
come aid me in tending to him!

410
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:48,701
Chaem!

411
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,294
Can't you hear me calling?

412
00:25:53,036 --> 00:25:54,036
Chaem!

413
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,036
Go. Go and attend to your duties.

414
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,255
Yes, ma'am.

415
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:00,116
Hey, go that way.

416
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:06,512
May I go and get Fueang, ma'am?

417
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:18,358
Saeng, wait for me.

418
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:24,444
What are you and the Viscount planning?

419
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:26,342
What do you mean?

420
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,772
I am utterly unaware.

421
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:29,873
Do not attempt to deceive me.

422
00:26:30,147 --> 00:26:31,756
Whenever the Viscount falls ill,

423
00:26:32,147 --> 00:26:34,076
are you not the first to tend to him?

424
00:26:34,585 --> 00:26:36,576
I do so out of love for the Viscount.

425
00:26:37,936 --> 00:26:39,014
Unlike you,

426
00:26:39,404 --> 00:26:40,748
who has never loved him.

427
00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:45,092
Am I correct?

428
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,451
Do not divert the topic.

429
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:50,249
Reveal the truth to me.

430
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,748
If you refuse to answer,

431
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:57,694
it shows the Viscount isn't really sick.

432
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:00,397
Are you both engaged in some scheme?

433
00:27:03,605 --> 00:27:04,725
I do not know.

434
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,050
If you wish to discover the truth,

435
00:27:07,854 --> 00:27:09,471
then await and see for yourself.

436
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:22,117
Can you pledge to

437
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:23,194
fulfill this favor for me?

438
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:24,562
My lord...

439
00:27:24,907 --> 00:27:27,328
Please conceive a child with Dech for me.

440
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,900
I beg of you.

441
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:31,805
You must be happy now that

442
00:27:31,852 --> 00:27:32,852
you have managed to coerce

443
00:27:32,883 --> 00:27:34,031
Ms. Malai into compliance.

444
00:27:34,906 --> 00:27:36,703
In truth, you should be happy with me,

445
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:38,570
instead of displaying such displeasure.

446
00:27:38,586 --> 00:27:40,609
I cannot condone your methods, my lord.

447
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:45,598
(House of the Dark Shadows

448
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:50,629
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

449
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:53,895
I feel sorry for Viscount Wisan.

450
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:55,612
What ill-fated fortune.

451
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:57,409
Father remains unwell,

452
00:27:57,948 --> 00:27:59,701
now he has succumbed to illness.

453
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,420
I find myself at a loss, truly.

454
00:28:01,717 --> 00:28:03,225
How fares Father, my lord?

455
00:28:06,945 --> 00:28:08,710
His time may be dwindling.

456
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,304
If my father should...

457
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,093
I fear

458
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:16,202
the Viscount shall follow suit.

459
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,250
Why...

460
00:28:17,452 --> 00:28:19,148
Why do you speak thusly, my lord?

461
00:28:19,218 --> 00:28:20,718
I speak honestly, Ms. Malai.

462
00:28:20,961 --> 00:28:22,445
The Viscount feels guilty,

463
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,968
for his inability to provide an heir,

464
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,226
which led to his illness.

465
00:28:28,093 --> 00:28:29,460
I dread losing both Father

466
00:28:29,485 --> 00:28:31,523
and my brother in such swift succession.

467
00:28:42,485 --> 00:28:43,563
My lord, is there

468
00:28:43,571 --> 00:28:44,961
a particular dish you desire?

469
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:46,008
I can have Chaem

470
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:47,282
attend to your request.

471
00:28:47,298 --> 00:28:48,344
No need.

472
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,946
And where is Malai?

473
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:54,540
Why don't I see her around?

474
00:28:55,282 --> 00:28:56,282
My lord!

475
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,055
I am also your wife.

476
00:28:58,462 --> 00:29:00,395
Why do you seek someone else?

477
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:01,954
I am asking

478
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:04,188
where Malai is.

479
00:29:08,118 --> 00:29:09,118
Malai...

480
00:29:13,923 --> 00:29:15,603
I wish to be with Malai.

481
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,492
Please leave, Ramphoei.

482
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:42,007
Malai...

483
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:53,499
Allow me to wipe your body, my lord.

484
00:29:57,452 --> 00:29:58,452
Oh?

485
00:29:59,023 --> 00:30:00,397
Why does Ms. Ramphoei

486
00:30:00,422 --> 00:30:01,803
appear so cheerful?

487
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,311
Indeed, ma'am.

488
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:04,858
Shouldn't you continue

489
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:05,748
tending to the Viscount?

490
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:07,334
No need to exchange

491
00:30:07,343 --> 00:30:08,523
sarcastic remarks with me.

492
00:30:08,548 --> 00:30:09,579
When the day comes that I

493
00:30:09,604 --> 00:30:10,976
become the head of this household,

494
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,451
both of you husband and wife

495
00:30:12,796 --> 00:30:14,647
can go back to farming for all I care.

496
00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:19,009
I look forward to it.

497
00:30:24,902 --> 00:30:26,232
What has come over you?

498
00:30:27,115 --> 00:30:28,544
I feel sorry for the viscount.

499
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:30,888
He has languished in sickness for days.

500
00:30:31,084 --> 00:30:33,107
If an unfortunate turn befalls him,

501
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,732
how shall we both carry on?

502
00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:41,552
I fear

503
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,130
my time may be drawing near, Malai.

504
00:30:44,568 --> 00:30:45,740
My lord,

505
00:30:46,036 --> 00:30:48,068
please don't speak of such ill omens.

506
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:50,708
No,

507
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:51,857
I speak the truth.

508
00:30:54,482 --> 00:30:56,216
I am an ungrateful person.

509
00:30:58,083 --> 00:30:59,075
Even in death,

510
00:31:00,256 --> 00:31:01,936
I shall find no solace.

511
00:31:02,302 --> 00:31:03,333
My lord...

512
00:31:06,294 --> 00:31:07,716
Please don't jump to conclusions.

513
00:31:08,216 --> 00:31:09,630
The doctor doesn't even know

514
00:31:09,646 --> 00:31:11,044
what illness you have.

515
00:31:11,896 --> 00:31:13,083
It may not be as grave

516
00:31:13,108 --> 00:31:14,286
as you fear, my lord.

517
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:18,747
Please have a drink.

518
00:31:44,948 --> 00:31:45,948
My lord!

519
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,370
My lord!

520
00:31:47,902 --> 00:31:49,190
My lord, what is wrong?

521
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:56,409
Malai...

522
00:31:57,831 --> 00:31:59,932
I have one final entreaty for you.

523
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:02,573
Can you pledge to

524
00:32:02,598 --> 00:32:03,659
fulfill this favor for me?

525
00:32:03,684 --> 00:32:04,862
My lord!

526
00:32:06,152 --> 00:32:07,917
What would you have me do, my lord?

527
00:32:08,534 --> 00:32:09,846
Please conceive a child

528
00:32:09,871 --> 00:32:11,112
with Dech on my behalf?

529
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:13,582
I beg of you.

530
00:32:15,441 --> 00:32:16,909
- Please, Malai.
- My lord!

531
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:18,386
- No, my lord!
- I beg you!

532
00:32:18,411 --> 00:32:19,426
My lord!

533
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,081
- I beg you, Malai.
- My lord!

534
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,518
No, my lord!

535
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:27,526
Please conceive a child with Dech.

536
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:29,393
Please conceive a child with Dech for me.

537
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:30,323
I beg you!

538
00:32:31,089 --> 00:32:32,089
Malai...

539
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:34,409
No, my lord!

540
00:32:34,425 --> 00:32:35,307
My lord!

541
00:32:35,332 --> 00:32:37,534
- I beg you, Malai.
- My lord!

542
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:39,284
- I beg you, Malai.
- My lord!

543
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:40,917
Malai...

544
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:44,254
Malai...

545
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,049
I beg you, Malai.

546
00:32:48,293 --> 00:32:50,019
Please conceive a child with Dech.

547
00:32:51,418 --> 00:32:52,418
Please?

548
00:32:54,137 --> 00:32:55,137
My lord...

549
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:29,965
Ms. Malai.

550
00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:37,183
I implore you to escape from here.

551
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,753
I cannot bear witnessing

552
00:33:39,762 --> 00:33:41,105
your distress any longer.

553
00:33:43,324 --> 00:33:44,488
Are you asking me to

554
00:33:44,496 --> 00:33:45,941
abandon the Viscount now?

555
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:50,214
I cannot bring myself to do so.

556
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:51,902
Ms. Malai is a good person,

557
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:55,253
so you have become a pawn

558
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:56,527
in the hands of a wicked person.

559
00:34:00,652 --> 00:34:01,925
What do you mean, Dech?

560
00:34:02,926 --> 00:34:04,144
I fail to comprehend.

561
00:34:04,449 --> 00:34:05,503
In truth,

562
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:09,524
the Viscount...

563
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:12,985
The Viscount...

564
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:15,800
It's terrible!

565
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:17,699
Ms. Malai! It's terrible!

566
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,816
What is it, Uan?

567
00:34:19,394 --> 00:34:20,964
The Viscount is in danger!

568
00:34:20,993 --> 00:34:22,196
What of the Viscount?

569
00:34:22,446 --> 00:34:24,141
The Viscount's condition is dire, ma'am.

570
00:34:26,009 --> 00:34:27,509
Please quickly tend to him!

571
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:38,732
My lord!

572
00:34:40,334 --> 00:34:41,037
My...

573
00:34:43,928 --> 00:34:44,928
My lord!

574
00:34:45,943 --> 00:34:47,341
Please stay with me!

575
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:50,302
I already ordered Uan to get a doctor.

576
00:34:51,162 --> 00:34:52,044
My lord!

577
00:34:52,061 --> 00:34:53,154
Malai...

578
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:57,904
My lord!

579
00:34:59,443 --> 00:35:00,974
My lord!

580
00:35:01,693 --> 00:35:02,591
My lord!

581
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:09,576
My lord!

582
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,990
My lord!

583
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:18,865
I submit, my lord.

584
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:34,263
I am prepared to bear

585
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:35,396
a child with Dech, my lord.

586
00:35:44,084 --> 00:35:45,177
Malai...

587
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:48,669
Thank you, Malai.

588
00:36:24,288 --> 00:36:25,475
You must be happy now that

589
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,834
you have managed to coerce

590
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,108
Ms. Malai into compliance.

591
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:30,350
In truth, you should be happy with me,

592
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:32,077
instead of displaying such displeasure.

593
00:36:32,186 --> 00:36:34,279
I cannot condone your methods, my lord.

594
00:36:34,467 --> 00:36:36,147
What I do is within my rights,

595
00:36:36,858 --> 00:36:37,795
as long as I secure

596
00:36:37,811 --> 00:36:38,897
an heir for my father.

597
00:36:55,983 --> 00:36:57,819
However, heed my words carefully.

598
00:36:58,905 --> 00:37:00,240
I only seek a child.

599
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:03,115
You must love me alone like always.

to allow him to sleep with Ms. Malai,

605
00:40:28,444 --> 00:40:29,444
his wife?

606
00:40:30,874 --> 00:40:32,358
I am now aware

607
00:40:32,749 --> 00:40:33,869
of everything.

608
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,701
I shall reward you generously.

I don't want you to hang out

And tonight, you must sleep with Dech.
