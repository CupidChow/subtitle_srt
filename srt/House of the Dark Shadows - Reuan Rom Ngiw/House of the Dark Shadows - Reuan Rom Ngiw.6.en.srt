"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 6)

19
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,101
I heard that

20
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:03,032
someone stole a kiss from my friend.

21
00:02:03,344 --> 00:02:06,031
Do you have any idea who it might be?

22
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,095
If I ever misbehave

23
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:09,749
towards Ms. Malai again,

24
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,181
I shall face a brutal death...

25
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:15,421
Mark my words, Chaem.

26
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:16,976
I will definitely succeed in

27
00:02:16,984 --> 00:02:18,101
driving that Malai woman

28
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:19,194
away from this house.

29
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:20,648
- Eek!
- Hey.

30
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,070
Phoem!

31
00:02:22,304 --> 00:02:24,796
I want to make a magic love powder.

32
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:26,375
Use this first.

33
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,956
You smell so good.

34
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:42,172
Wow!

35
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,812
Truly beautiful, Ms. Ramphoei.

36
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:45,992
Let's quickly show off to the Viscount.

37
00:02:46,695 --> 00:02:47,695
Yes, ma'am.

38
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:51,687
Why did you enter the Viscount's room?

39
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:56,695
Ms. Malai's necklace...

40
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,554
Take it off now!

41
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:00,640
I won't take it off!

42
00:03:02,063 --> 00:03:03,445
Take it off, do you hear me?

43
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,843
The Viscount gave it to Ms. Malai,

44
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:05,562
not you!

45
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:06,586
Back off!

46
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:07,617
Take it off!

47
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,625
- Back off!
- Take it off!

48
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:10,101
Hey!

49
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,171
Don't you dare give

50
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:12,578
that attitude to my master!

51
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,037
Don't go using my master's belongings,

52
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,132
without permission,

53
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:16,382
so I wouldn't have to say

54
00:03:16,407 --> 00:03:17,422
that your master is

55
00:03:17,453 --> 00:03:19,217
someone uneducated with unknown origin!

56
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,295
Seems like you need

57
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,531
to be taught a lesson!

58
00:03:23,523 --> 00:03:25,242
I also have hands too.

59
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:26,983
Come at me if you dare!

60
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:28,583
Slap her, Chaem!

61
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,765
But she's incredibly strong.

62
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:32,210
I don't know how she's so strong.

63
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:33,921
Chaem, are you afraid of her?

64
00:03:33,992 --> 00:03:34,976
What's the matter?

65
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:36,062
Not as tough as you made

66
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:37,031
yourself out to be?

67
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:40,664
Take off the necklace right now,

68
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:43,139
if you don't want to get slapped.

69
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:45,162
Or I'll report this to the Viscount!

70
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:46,547
- Take it off!
- If you slap me,

71
00:03:46,572 --> 00:03:48,250
I will report this to the Viscount.

72
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:50,460
I am his wife,

73
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:52,085
and you are merely a servant.

74
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,218
Let's see whom he chooses to believe.

75
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:56,765
- Ramphoei...
- My lord!

76
00:03:58,797 --> 00:03:59,797
Oww!

77
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,492
Want to get up?

78
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,593
Take that! How's that?

79
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:12,125
My lord!

80
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,281
Isn't it beautiful, my lord?

81
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:16,960
I bought this necklace for Malai

82
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:18,505
as a wedding gift.

83
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,976
Why are you wearing it?

84
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:21,875
Well, my lord,

85
00:04:21,891 --> 00:04:24,031
I thought it looked beautiful.

86
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:25,343
Doesn't it suit me?

87
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:27,195
Take it off.

88
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:28,921
This necklace is meant for Malai.

89
00:04:28,938 --> 00:04:30,828
It isn't appropriate for you to wear it.

90
00:04:31,422 --> 00:04:33,156
Oh, my lord.

91
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:34,577
Well, Ms. Malai isn't

92
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,179
in this house anymore,

93
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:37,382
and she didn't take

94
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:38,733
this necklace either.

95
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:41,804
Who knows when it will be worn again?

96
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,556
Just give it to me, please, my lord.

97
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:45,983
Please, my lord.

98
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:48,546
Return the necklace, Chaem!

99
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,570
My lord,

100
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:52,460
I have something to report to you!

101
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,867
My lord, the thing is...

102
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:54,915
- Oww!
- Oops!

103
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:57,390
Goodness, Fueang! Are you alright?

104
00:04:58,289 --> 00:04:59,765
Why are you running, Fueang?

105
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:01,835
What if you fall and hit your head?

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
My lord,

107
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:05,031
are you giving that woman...

108
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,843
Are you giving

109
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:12,070
Ms. Ramphoei the necklace?

110
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:14,226
Don't you feel sorry for Ms. Malai?

111
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:15,258
My lord.

112
00:05:15,422 --> 00:05:17,289
- But this necklace...
- Hey!

113
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:18,703
Do as you please.

114
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:20,343
This is ridiculous.

115
00:05:20,422 --> 00:05:21,937
I'll go and attend to my work.

116
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:44,398
Oww!

117
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:45,422
Hey!

118
00:05:45,563 --> 00:05:46,781
That hurts!

119
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,257
Don't complain about this little wound.

120
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:51,789
Come.

121
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:53,718
This house is turning

122
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:55,007
into a complete mess.

123
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:56,648
Ms. Malai left abruptly,

124
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,367
that woman wore her necklace

125
00:05:58,383 --> 00:05:59,609
without permission.

126
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:01,796
What are we going to do?

127
00:06:01,805 --> 00:06:03,203
There's nothing we can do.

128
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:04,843
Servants must focus on their own duties,

129
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:05,859
and not get involved

130
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:06,782
in the master's affairs.

131
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:08,429
It'll only give you a headache.

132
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:09,945
Are you just going to

133
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,101
let the house fall apart?

134
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:13,664
When it falls apart as you say,

135
00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:14,734
then I'll think about it.

136
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:16,719
Hey!

137
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:18,109
Where are you going?

138
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:19,382
I'm going to work.

139
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:20,945
I'm tired of listening to someone

140
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,109
complain so dramatically.

141
00:06:22,134 --> 00:06:23,934
My, now you're acting so diligent.

142
00:06:24,027 --> 00:06:25,222
If Kam and Aun were here,

143
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:26,285
I wouldn't have to

144
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,168
complain to you.

145
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:29,926
Hey!

146
00:06:33,676 --> 00:06:34,676
Fueang.

147
00:07:13,322 --> 00:07:14,368
My lord.

148
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:24,266
My lord, when did you arrive?

149
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:28,024
I've been waiting here for you.

150
00:07:28,423 --> 00:07:29,657
I had no knowledge

151
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,482
of your arrival, my lord...

152
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:32,774
I didn't come here to

153
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:33,751
listen to your apologies.

154
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:35,727
It is I who should apologize to you.

155
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,977
What I did earlier,

156
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40,329
I truly didn't mean it.

157
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:42,134
You know very well that I don't...

158
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:45,462
You don't need to apologize

159
00:07:45,486 --> 00:07:46,993
to a servant like me, my lord.

160
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:49,298
I didn't take offense.

161
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:51,602
I came here to apologize

162
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,876
because I felt I wronged you,

163
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:54,907
but it seems like you

164
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:55,954
don't care.

165
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,960
Do I hold no value in your eyes at all?

166
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:01,673
That's not the case, my lord.

167
00:08:03,556 --> 00:08:04,790
I am but a servant.

168
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:07,118
How could I be angry at my master?

169
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,454
Not to mention,

170
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:13,368
I owe you a debt of gratitude

171
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,977
that I can never forget.

172
00:08:26,284 --> 00:08:27,284
Thank you.

173
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:39,620
Hey!

174
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:40,659
Move it!

175
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,799
Don't crowd in front of my shop.

176
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:43,659
Hey!

177
00:08:43,675 --> 00:08:44,307
Oww!

178
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,885
Why did you shove my friend?

179
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:46,932
Leave!

180
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,495
Both of you are standing

181
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:50,565
in front of my shop,

182
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,518
no customers would dare come.

183
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:54,041
We're just looking,

184
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,745
we're not blocking anything.

185
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:57,354
Still arguing with me,

186
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,940
you beggars.

187
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:01,666
Go beg for spare change somewhere else.

188
00:09:01,753 --> 00:09:03,096
I'm busy working!

189
00:09:04,658 --> 00:09:06,018
Still not leaving?

190
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:06,815
Oww!

191
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:08,416
Hey!

192
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:11,170
Oww!

193
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:12,505
Hey, Fueng, run!

194
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,740
You brats!

195
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,084
Stop where you are!

196
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:17,475
Hey, stop!

197
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,349
Hey!

198
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:19,427
Oww!

199
00:09:19,677 --> 00:09:20,677
Stop, you brats!

200
00:09:21,115 --> 00:09:22,365
- I'll hit you to death!
- Let's run!

201
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:31,576
Count, Viscount, Earl,

202
00:09:32,248 --> 00:09:34,255
please save our lives,

203
00:09:34,686 --> 00:09:35,560
and

204
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:36,873
we will gladly serve in

205
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:38,240
your households, my lord.

206
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:40,084
You've given me so many titles,

207
00:09:40,553 --> 00:09:42,998
they're not even in the correct order.

208
00:09:44,436 --> 00:09:45,436
Hey.

209
00:09:45,506 --> 00:09:46,506
Young man.

210
00:09:47,811 --> 00:09:48,974
I'm going to deal with

211
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:50,585
these beggar brats for biting me.

212
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:52,248
You're not relevant, so back off.

213
00:09:52,506 --> 00:09:53,591
If I won't back away,

214
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,021
what are you going to do?

215
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,202
You commoner.

216
00:09:56,591 --> 00:09:57,341
Hey!

217
00:09:57,935 --> 00:09:59,294
Let go! Oww!

218
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:01,474
Oww!

219
00:10:01,498 --> 00:10:03,537
How dare you swagger in front

220
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,242
of a government official?

221
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:06,740
Do you know who I am?

222
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:08,552
Do you know who my father is?

223
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:10,677
Do you wish to be imprisoned?

224
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:11,959
Well?

225
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:12,983
Oww!

226
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:17,406
My apologies, my lord. I was mistaken.

227
00:10:20,342 --> 00:10:21,342
Leave.

228
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:23,507
Yes, my lord.

229
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:25,225
Make way!

230
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,060
Stand up.

231
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:36,709
Thank you, my lord, for your mercy.

232
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:40,537
Let's go.

233
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:42,138
Hold on,

234
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:46,357
didn't you say you would

235
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:47,318
become my servant?

236
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:49,755
But both of us are just beggars,

237
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,280
with no parents, my lord.

238
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:53,505
Do you want me to

239
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:54,849
take care of both of you?

240
00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:05,094
Oh, Dech,

241
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:07,555
your debt to me is irrelevant here.

242
00:11:07,852 --> 00:11:09,125
By now,

243
00:11:09,227 --> 00:11:10,524
I'm sure you're aware

244
00:11:10,548 --> 00:11:11,992
of what I desire more.

245
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,992
I want you to love me,

246
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,125
both body

247
00:11:26,383 --> 00:11:27,399
and heart.

248
00:11:29,524 --> 00:11:30,766
Can you do that for me?

249
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:36,633
Even if Malai doesn't want it back,

250
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:38,336
But if you ask me,

251
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,016
I think it's too valuable for you.

252
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,946
Seeing you wear it is an eyesore.

253
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:43,563
No! I won't take it off.

254
00:11:43,728 --> 00:11:45,766
The viscount has already given it to me!

256
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:59,353
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

257
00:12:01,907 --> 00:12:02,953
Oh, Dech,

258
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:05,414
your debt to me is irrelevant here.

259
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:07,061
By now,

260
00:12:07,086 --> 00:12:08,383
I'm sure you're aware

261
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:09,851
of what I desire more.

262
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,851
I want you to love me,

263
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,061
both body

264
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,258
and heart.

265
00:12:27,476 --> 00:12:28,718
Can you do that for me?

266
00:13:14,204 --> 00:13:15,204
My lord...

267
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:15,946
Dech...

268
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,970
My lord...

269
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:01,993
What is it?

270
00:14:02,056 --> 00:14:04,133
What are we gathering here for?

271
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:05,594
I have no idea,

272
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,985
but Chaem threatened us to come.

273
00:14:09,243 --> 00:14:10,383
Threatened?

274
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:11,821
I will teach her a lesson.

275
00:14:11,845 --> 00:14:12,845
Fueang.

276
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:26,346
Hey!

277
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:27,745
Sit down now.

278
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,096
Do you not respect your master?

279
00:14:31,214 --> 00:14:32,214
You lot...

280
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,588
That goes for you too, Fueang.

281
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:53,639
Is everyone here?

282
00:14:54,374 --> 00:14:55,288
Good,

283
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:57,381
now everyone will know.

284
00:14:57,874 --> 00:15:00,061
Hurry up and tell us, ma'am.

285
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:01,772
You're wasting our time.

286
00:15:01,882 --> 00:15:03,256
You're asking for it!

287
00:15:04,624 --> 00:15:05,811
Watch your mouth!

288
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:08,319
Be quiet, Fueang.

289
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:10,319
She is the master's wife, after all.

290
00:15:11,663 --> 00:15:13,186
From now on,

291
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,983
I am the sole mistress

292
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:16,889
of this household.

293
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:18,577
No matter what I order,

294
00:15:18,593 --> 00:15:20,374
everyone must do as I say.

295
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:23,108
Don't complain, no exceptions.

296
00:15:23,694 --> 00:15:25,069
And behind my back,

297
00:15:25,148 --> 00:15:26,342
don't even think about

298
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:27,678
gossiping about me,

299
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:29,749
or else

300
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,366
I will report it to the viscount

301
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,108
and will kick all of you out.

302
00:15:34,288 --> 00:15:35,381
Do you understand?

303
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:44,362
I said, do you understand?

304
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:46,067
Did you not hear me?

305
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:52,482
Answer!

306
00:15:52,662 --> 00:15:54,022
Are you lot deaf?

307
00:15:54,717 --> 00:15:56,474
Goodness gracious,

308
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,310
I thought this was a monkey show.

309
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:05,173
Ms. Malai.

310
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:12,034
Look, Malai,

311
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:13,948
a monkey who just got a taste of power.

312
00:16:13,964 --> 00:16:15,120
This is my first time

313
00:16:15,145 --> 00:16:16,808
seeing something like this.

314
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,819
Oh goodness,

315
00:16:21,843 --> 00:16:23,155
I thought

316
00:16:23,187 --> 00:16:25,327
Ms. Malai would never return.

317
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:28,905
Who gave you permission

318
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,100
to wear that necklace?

319
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:33,877
Who else but the viscount?

320
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,010
He rewarded me for

321
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:38,284
perfectly fulfilling my wifely duties.

322
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,043
Then

323
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:44,331
you can have it.

324
00:16:50,895 --> 00:16:52,332
Is that a good idea, Malai?

325
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:54,527
That necklace is valuable.

326
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:56,222
It will only bring

327
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:57,660
satisfaction to that woman.

328
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:01,153
The viscount has already

329
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:02,434
given it to her, Bu-nga.

330
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:05,137
His lordship probably

331
00:17:05,162 --> 00:17:06,645
thought she never had it,

332
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,005
and buying a new one

333
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,481
would be a waste of money

334
00:17:10,185 --> 00:17:12,309
because she simply doesn't deserve it.

335
00:17:12,325 --> 00:17:13,294
So,

336
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:14,998
he gave her a used one.

337
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,700
Malai!

338
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,700
A gun!

339
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:21,200
Don't even think about it.

340
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:24,520
I won't let someone like you

341
00:17:24,552 --> 00:17:26,792
lay a finger on my friend.

342
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:28,340
Please back away, ma'am.

343
00:17:30,153 --> 00:17:31,950
Even if Malai doesn't want it back,

344
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:33,660
But if you ask me,

345
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:35,340
I think it's too valuable for you.

346
00:17:35,544 --> 00:17:37,270
Seeing you wear it is an eyesore.

347
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:38,520
Take the necklace off!

348
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:43,840
No! I won't take it off.

349
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:46,043
The viscount has already given it to me!

350
00:17:52,622 --> 00:17:54,004
I said, take it off!

351
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:55,645
Otherwise,

352
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,957
I will report this matter

353
00:17:56,981 --> 00:17:58,082
to the viscount's father.

354
00:17:58,106 --> 00:17:59,075
Let's see

355
00:17:59,168 --> 00:18:00,856
who holds the most power here.

356
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:03,754
Take it off!

357
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,220
Please take it off or you'll die!

358
00:18:06,676 --> 00:18:07,589
Take it off!

359
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:09,239
Please take it off, ma'am!

360
00:18:10,044 --> 00:18:10,957
Chaem, help me!

361
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:11,981
Hurry up!

362
00:18:11,997 --> 00:18:13,442
Right away! I'm taking it off.

363
00:18:13,544 --> 00:18:14,707
How do I take it off?

364
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:17,067
Hurry!

365
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:18,582
Yes! I'm taking it off quickly!

366
00:18:19,177 --> 00:18:20,177
Hurry!

367
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,400
Hand it to her.

368
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:38,129
I want Malai

369
00:18:38,154 --> 00:18:38,911
to suffer

370
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,325
and slowly die inside.

371
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:42,926
I'll make it happen for you.

373
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:52,903
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

374
00:19:00,395 --> 00:19:01,606
You have to be strong,

375
00:19:01,622 --> 00:19:03,059
like you were today, Malai.

376
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:05,285
Without you, Bu-nga,

377
00:19:06,223 --> 00:19:07,512
I don't think I can do it.

378
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:10,395
Oh, Malai,

379
00:19:10,872 --> 00:19:12,371
even though I'm your friend,

380
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,096
I can't always be there to help you.

381
00:19:15,496 --> 00:19:17,676
You must learn to stand up for yourself.

382
00:19:17,794 --> 00:19:18,864
Do you understand?

383
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:21,052
Yes, Bu-nga.

384
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:22,973
No matter what,

385
00:19:22,981 --> 00:19:24,887
you must take control of this household.

386
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:26,129
You must have the power

387
00:19:26,154 --> 00:19:27,746
to handle that woman.

388
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:29,731
Don't be tricked by her deceitful words,

389
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:31,215
no matter what. Okay?

390
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:35,801
I will keep that in mind.

391
00:19:37,286 --> 00:19:38,395
Excellent.

392
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:41,106
Value yourself above all else.

393
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:43,042
Without the viscount,

394
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,676
you won't have any assets.

395
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:47,301
Your siblings never cared for you.

396
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:50,301
The only one who can take care of you

397
00:19:50,326 --> 00:19:52,200
is yourself, Malai.

398
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:59,340
I'm telling you out of concern.

399
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:00,856
I don't want you to

400
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,973
endure any hardship.

401
00:20:01,997 --> 00:20:03,106
Do you understand?

402
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:07,767
Geez, come here.

403
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:20,270
Do you really want this?

404
00:20:22,965 --> 00:20:24,832
Isn't it better to just kill her?

405
00:20:26,098 --> 00:20:27,145
No,

406
00:20:27,168 --> 00:20:29,004
I want that damn Malai to suffer

407
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:30,035
and be so embarrassed

408
00:20:30,051 --> 00:20:31,277
that she desires death.

409
00:20:33,286 --> 00:20:34,887
Would forcing myself on her

410
00:20:34,903 --> 00:20:36,105
really torment her?

411
00:20:37,223 --> 00:20:38,918
What if she gets addicted to it?

412
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:42,934
Absolutely not.

413
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,395
A snob like her, sleeping with

414
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:45,675
someone other than her husband

415
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:47,379
is like hell on earth for her.

416
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:49,605
I want to witness her

417
00:20:49,637 --> 00:20:50,598
suffering

418
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:53,549
and slowly dying inside.

419
00:20:54,192 --> 00:20:55,926
It's up to you, Ramphoei.

420
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:57,691
Whatever you desire,

421
00:20:58,301 --> 00:20:59,762
I'll make it happen for you.

422
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:38,215
Why are you looking at me so quietly?

423
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,110
I didn't want to upset you, Ms. Malai.

424
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,157
Are you suggesting that

425
00:21:44,182 --> 00:21:45,017
I'm short-tempered?

426
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:55,227
No, ma'am.

427
00:22:29,211 --> 00:22:30,899
I find you to be more courageous

428
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:32,344
than I initially believed.

429
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,289
I'm truly not that brave.

430
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:39,547
All the servants were commending

431
00:22:39,563 --> 00:22:40,860
your actions, Ms. Malai.

432
00:22:41,852 --> 00:22:43,320
What were they saying?

433
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:46,211
They were expressing that

434
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:47,915
you conducted yourself admirably

435
00:22:47,939 --> 00:22:49,820
as the primary wife of the viscount.

436
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,141
And I concur.

437
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,125
Thank you.

438
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,274
However,

439
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:02,750
I don't think it will be

440
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:03,649
resolved easily.

441
00:23:08,832 --> 00:23:10,192
I concur, ma'am.

442
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,356
Yet, Ms. Malai's return

443
00:23:14,582 --> 00:23:15,864
is already wonderful.

444
00:23:38,661 --> 00:23:39,973
I will help you select.

Father!

456
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:48,007
Don't approach me!

457
00:24:51,328 --> 00:24:53,960
Just let me die in front of you both.

458
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:55,421
Father,

459
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,567
please don't speak such ominous words.

460
00:24:57,836 --> 00:24:59,546
Why can't I say it

461
00:24:59,984 --> 00:25:01,320
when I'll have no one to

462
00:25:01,345 --> 00:25:02,453
carry on my lineage

463
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:03,867
even if I continue to live?

464
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,804
No need to frown like that,

465
00:25:11,836 --> 00:25:12,836
Wisan.

466
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,171
I am trying, Father.

467
00:25:15,938 --> 00:25:17,492
Please, Father, relax.

468
00:25:17,711 --> 00:25:19,351
This kind of matter requires time.

469
00:25:20,531 --> 00:25:21,531
Requires time...

470
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:24,523
Time to get over the fact

471
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,875
that a homosexual like you

472
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,929
wouldn't know how sleep with women.

473
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,780
Father...

474
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:33,945
I possess an immense fortune

475
00:25:34,531 --> 00:25:35,898
that would not be depleted

476
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,257
even if I were reborn 10 times.

477
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:38,546
My mistress's son

478
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:39,758
just had to be infertile.

479
00:25:41,281 --> 00:25:42,789
As for my primary wife's son,

480
00:25:43,695 --> 00:25:44,859
the one who was supposed

481
00:25:44,884 --> 00:25:45,913
to bring me pride,

482
00:25:46,141 --> 00:25:47,937
only engages in shameful behavior.

483
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,992
You have the advantage

484
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:51,234
of being born male,

485
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:53,085
but you just had to be into men.

486
00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:55,984
What a waste.

487
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,703
What will I do

488
00:26:02,516 --> 00:26:03,890
if someone discovers this?

489
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,630
Wisan!

490
00:26:10,216 --> 00:26:11,825
Why did you do it?

491
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:12,833
You ungrateful child!

492
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,435
You homosexual!

493
00:26:15,482 --> 00:26:16,708
Do you want to be hit?

494
00:26:17,052 --> 00:26:17,724
- Well?
- Please stop.

495
00:26:17,763 --> 00:26:18,872
Please stop, Father.

496
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:21,200
Let me go! Why are you stopping me?

497
00:26:21,224 --> 00:26:21,981
Leave!

498
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,911
What's wrong with you?

499
00:26:24,935 --> 00:26:26,200
Why did you do it?

500
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:27,216
Father!

501
00:26:27,802 --> 00:26:28,474
Father!

502
00:26:28,498 --> 00:26:29,498
Phichit, release me!

503
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:30,935
- Release me!
- Please stop!

504
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:32,402
- Let go!
- Father!

505
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:33,724
Let go!

506
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:44,802
Rit!

507
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,130
Rit!

508
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:52,184
Are you badly hurt? Rit!

509
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:53,828
- Wisan!
- Rit!

510
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:55,286
Right in front of me!

511
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,066
If you love him that much,

512
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:01,473
go and live with him!

513
00:27:01,973 --> 00:27:02,973
Leave!

514
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:07,465
Father...

515
00:27:07,747 --> 00:27:08,787
Are you hurt?

516
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,030
Please bear with me.

517
00:27:23,388 --> 00:27:25,092
This medicine is very expensive.

518
00:27:25,233 --> 00:27:26,835
It helps with internal bruising,

519
00:27:27,663 --> 00:27:28,858
and you'll heal faster.

520
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:38,502
Is it so painful?

521
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:43,576
Mr. Wisan...

522
00:27:47,841 --> 00:27:49,974
You shouldn't have to trouble yourself

523
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,731
and take care of me,

524
00:27:52,607 --> 00:27:53,817
the master

525
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:57,638
will be even more upset.

526
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:00,942
I don't care

527
00:28:01,623 --> 00:28:03,099
about that bigot.

528
00:28:06,154 --> 00:28:07,622
You just recover first,

529
00:28:11,263 --> 00:28:12,442
you and I

530
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:16,427
can escape and live to together.

531
00:28:16,443 --> 00:28:17,802
I am educated.

532
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:19,591
Even if I don't become

533
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:20,755
a government official,

534
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,583
I'll survive.

535
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:28,669
Let's start a new life together.

536
00:28:30,732 --> 00:28:31,778
Together.

537
00:28:39,388 --> 00:28:40,388
Rit...

538
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:45,458
Rit!

539
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:49,552
Rit!

540
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,810
Rit!

541
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:54,007
Rit!

542
00:28:57,189 --> 00:28:58,189
I...

543
00:28:58,408 --> 00:28:59,915
I fear I won't survive.

544
00:29:00,517 --> 00:29:01,517
No, Rit.

545
00:29:03,204 --> 00:29:04,404
Don't leave me!

546
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,009
Rit!

547
00:29:14,564 --> 00:29:16,579
In this life, I'm fated by my past sins.

548
00:29:20,064 --> 00:29:21,493
I'm denied the chance

549
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:25,149
to be with the one I love.

550
00:29:32,122 --> 00:29:33,465
I wish Mr. Wisan...

551
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,926
to persist in living...

552
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,544
for me.

553
00:29:47,435 --> 00:29:48,435
Rit...

554
00:29:56,652 --> 00:29:57,652
Rit!

555
00:30:13,672 --> 00:30:14,890
I apologize, my lord.

556
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:16,093
I am still not ready.

557
00:30:16,242 --> 00:30:17,632
If you can't give me a grandchild

558
00:30:17,657 --> 00:30:18,780
to continue the lineage,

559
00:30:18,805 --> 00:30:20,101
I will give all of my assets

560
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,130
to the temples.

561
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:22,085
Just you watch!

563
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,990
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

564
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:46,734
I admit to all of my wrongdoings.

565
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,796
Admitting or not,

566
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:51,937
they remain your wrongdoings.

567
00:30:52,508 --> 00:30:54,374
He already repented,

568
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:56,499
please forgive him, Father.

569
00:30:56,664 --> 00:30:58,335
No need to intercede on his behalf!

570
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,546
Rit...

571
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:06,476
Rit has already passed away, Father.

572
00:31:08,328 --> 00:31:09,390
You no longer

573
00:31:09,718 --> 00:31:11,476
have to be suspicious

574
00:31:12,984 --> 00:31:14,015
that I might go out

575
00:31:14,031 --> 00:31:15,241
with any man, Father.

576
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:17,265
Even if you can't forgive me,

577
00:31:17,898 --> 00:31:19,093
at least,

578
00:31:20,734 --> 00:31:21,866
consider it for

579
00:31:22,593 --> 00:31:24,163
the sake of the late mother.

580
00:31:28,382 --> 00:31:30,070
Please, forgive him.

581
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,730
I beg you as well.

582
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:35,934
From now on,

583
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,777
act like a proper man.

584
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:39,355
If you can't do it,

585
00:31:39,988 --> 00:31:41,465
don't call me father,

586
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:43,879
go and become a beggar on the streets!

587
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,675
Thank you very much, Brother.

588
00:31:59,365 --> 00:32:00,708
Don't overthink it.

589
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:03,255
Regardless of who you are,

590
00:32:03,396 --> 00:32:04,372
I still love you.

591
00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:21,794
Speak your mind.

592
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:23,849
No need to stare at my face.

593
00:32:26,482 --> 00:32:27,522
It's nothing.

594
00:32:28,084 --> 00:32:29,950
Mark my words.

595
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:32,895
If you can't give me a grandchild

596
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,302
to continue the lineage,

597
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,262
I won't give you a single coin!

598
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:39,669
I will give all of my assets

599
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,770
to the temples.

600
00:32:42,006 --> 00:32:43,206
Just you watch!

601
00:32:44,334 --> 00:32:45,334
Yes, Father!

602
00:32:49,132 --> 00:32:50,374
I will rest now.

603
00:32:51,374 --> 00:32:53,046
You two go wherever you want.

604
00:32:53,461 --> 00:32:55,062
I don't want to see your faces.

605
00:33:11,472 --> 00:33:13,252
I diligently studied and graduated,

606
00:33:13,277 --> 00:33:14,409
served the government until

607
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,594
I achieved the viscount status.

608
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,158
But it's still not enough?

609
00:33:17,183 --> 00:33:18,432
Why did Father...

610
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:21,166
You know

611
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,713
how serious Father is about

612
00:33:22,729 --> 00:33:24,409
continuing the lineage.

613
00:33:25,565 --> 00:33:27,213
He probably didn't want it to end

614
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:28,260
with his sons.

615
00:33:36,633 --> 00:33:38,585
You've been married for quite a while.

616
00:33:38,968 --> 00:33:40,116
You should already

617
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,616
give Father his grandchild.

618
00:33:41,968 --> 00:33:43,210
If something were to happen to.

619
00:33:43,235 --> 00:33:44,866
Father before he gives the inheritance,

620
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,984
you won't get the inheritance

621
00:33:49,015 --> 00:33:50,695
that Father mentioned.

622
00:33:54,014 --> 00:33:55,679
As a son of a concubine like me,

623
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:58,484
I have no rights to Father's assets,

624
00:33:59,156 --> 00:34:01,968
as he intends to solely give it to you.

625
00:34:03,297 --> 00:34:04,297
Brother...

626
00:34:04,523 --> 00:34:07,632
But if you can't give him a grandchild,

627
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,374
you'll have to accept

628
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:11,124
giving all the assets to the temple.

629
00:34:12,647 --> 00:34:14,412
It's a pity,

630
00:34:14,498 --> 00:34:16,529
but I have no other means to help you.

631
00:34:24,572 --> 00:34:26,096
Kam and I went to Ayutthaya

632
00:34:26,104 --> 00:34:27,150
for just a few days,

633
00:34:27,174 --> 00:34:28,283
and so many things

634
00:34:28,308 --> 00:34:29,580
have already happened?

635
00:34:29,596 --> 00:34:30,736
Indeed.

636
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:32,259
It's a shame you weren't here

637
00:34:32,284 --> 00:34:35,564
to help me slap Chaem and her master.

638
00:34:36,939 --> 00:34:38,189
If Ms. Ramphoei

639
00:34:38,564 --> 00:34:40,619
were to have a child before Ms. Malai,

640
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,126
I dare not even think about it.

641
00:34:42,908 --> 00:34:45,150
I only sympathize with Ms. Malai.

642
00:34:47,205 --> 00:34:49,048
I wonder how long she can bear it.

643
00:34:50,932 --> 00:34:53,423
You didn't witness what I did.

644
00:34:53,783 --> 00:34:56,791
Ramphoei is truly difficult handle.

645
00:35:34,396 --> 00:35:35,396
Malai.

646
00:35:36,388 --> 00:35:38,161
Please let go of your anger towards me.

647
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:42,551
I have already instructed Ramphoei

648
00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:44,481
not to cause you any more trouble.

649
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:49,855
Is that true?

650
00:35:52,128 --> 00:35:53,252
Of course.

651
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:55,034
You are still

652
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:57,659
my sole primary wife.

653
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:40,104
Ramphoei...

654
00:36:47,284 --> 00:36:48,338
Malai.

655
00:36:56,096 --> 00:36:57,619
What's the matter, Malai?

656
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,627
I apologize, my lord.

657
00:37:01,628 --> 00:37:02,955
I am still not ready.

658
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:12,337
It's alright, Malai.

659
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:14,994
When you are ready,

660
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:16,994
please let me know.

661
00:37:17,565 --> 00:37:19,479
Thank you for understanding me.

662
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:22,799
Please rest.

663
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:25,291
I will continue with my work.

664
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:33,678
Please come in, my lord.

665
00:39:18,637 --> 00:39:19,230
Dech!

666
00:39:19,246 --> 00:39:20,542
What's gotten into you?

667
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:21,661
I hate him.

668
00:39:21,863 --> 00:39:22,863
That Dech.

669
00:39:22,965 --> 00:39:24,005
I hate you!

670
00:39:41,543 --> 00:39:43,246
Help me!

671
00:39:43,793 --> 00:39:45,543
