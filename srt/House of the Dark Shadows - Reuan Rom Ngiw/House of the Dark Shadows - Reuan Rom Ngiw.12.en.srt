"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 12)

19
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:00,585
That woman just
now is your mother?

20
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,671
Yes, her name is Fueang.

21
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,132
If you don't wish to die,

22
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,187
do not get involved with that house!

23
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:10,773
No way.

24
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,906
It was just a dream.

25
00:02:12,156 --> 00:02:13,406
How could it be real?

26
00:02:17,492 --> 00:02:19,179
You never think of loving others

27
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:20,632
except for yourself, my lord!

28
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:21,476
Dech!

29
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:22,492
My lord!

30
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:56,157
This is for you.

31
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,399
That's a picture of Malai, my relative.

32
00:03:20,986 --> 00:03:22,048
Malai passed away

33
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,438
when she was still young,

34
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,985
I feel sorry for her.

35
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:41,186
Earlier, I saw you get startled

36
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:42,686
when you saw Malai's picture.

37
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:44,358
Do you know Malai?

38
00:03:46,687 --> 00:03:48,803
I've heard about Ms. Malai a bit before.

39
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:52,092
Because of The Dark Shadow House?

40
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,624
Rat told me that you went there.

41
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:57,928
I'm not sure if this would be a bother,

42
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:00,710
but if I may ask you, Countess,

43
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:02,874
to tell me the story about Ms. Malai?

44
00:04:04,148 --> 00:04:05,389
No problem at all,

45
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:07,514
I'd be happy to have someone

46
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,030
to talk to about Malai as well.

47
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:13,186
Speaking of her makes me miss her.

48
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:27,769
Do you believe the ghost stories

49
00:04:27,794 --> 00:04:29,293
about The Dark Shadow House?

50
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,129
I've heard them before too,

51
00:04:32,778 --> 00:04:33,965
but I don't believe it.

52
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:37,932
The house has been vacant for so long,

53
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:39,557
people tend to spread rumors.

54
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,064
What about the story of

55
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:42,674
the rich couple named Sing and Thapthim

56
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:43,712
who were murdered at

57
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:44,946
The Dark Shadow House?

58
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:46,689
Have you heard about it, Countess?

59
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:48,782
Well,

60
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:50,220
my son is a police officer,

61
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:51,985
so I'm kept informed.

62
00:04:52,564 --> 00:04:54,009
What do you think about it?

63
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:57,618
I think it was just

64
00:04:58,204 --> 00:05:00,142
a simple robbery gone wrong.

65
00:05:00,603 --> 00:05:02,095
As stories get passed around,

66
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:04,095
they naturally evolve
into ghost stories

67
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,329
which is typical of Thai folks.

68
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,040
Then may I please

69
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:11,400
excuse myself to help in the kitchen?

70
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:13,314
Certainly.

71
00:05:41,322 --> 00:05:42,322
Wow.

72
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:44,079
Everything looks so delicious,

73
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,556
no wonder my mother

74
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:46,634
never stops praising you.

75
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:49,696
You haven't even tried any yet,

76
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:51,657
how would you know if it's tasty?

77
00:05:51,673 --> 00:05:53,064
When you weren't looking,

78
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:55,470
I sneaked a taste of some of them.

79
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,161
Lieutenant Rat,

80
00:05:57,345 --> 00:05:58,993
you might mess up the dishes

81
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:00,595
that I perfectly laid out.

82
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:01,829
I was just joking.

83
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:04,333
Lieutenant Rat...

84
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:15,071
Now where did Mai run off to?

85
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:16,509
I brought him to assist me,

86
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:18,064
so useless.

87
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:22,657
Isn't it fine?

88
00:06:22,986 --> 00:06:24,595
I'm here helping you, aren't I?

89
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:26,212
It's nice being together...

90
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:27,676
I'm here, master.

91
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,626
You finished chatting with

92
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,165
the Countess a long time ago, right?

93
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,493
Did you slack off somewhere?

94
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:35,525
Geez,

95
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:37,048
I just separated from her

96
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,923
and rushed straight to the kitchen.

97
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:40,696
Who would dare slack off?

98
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:41,860
You will surely scold me

99
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:43,368
for being ungrateful again.

100
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:46,181
At least you are aware now.

101
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:48,204
Go get some more firewood.

102
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,634
I only get to sit just now.

103
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,244
Now.

104
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,119
Yes, ma'am.

105
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:16,235
Hey you,

106
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:17,782
they hired you to cook and

107
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:19,907
you still dare bring the food back home.

108
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,220
Don't you have any consideration

109
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:22,157
for Lieutenant Rat?

110
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:24,829
They gave it to me willingly.

111
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,634
I didn't ask for it.

112
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:27,745
You witnessed it.

113
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,117
Isn't it good?

114
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:30,196
This way I can save money.

115
00:07:30,556 --> 00:07:33,353
"They gave it to me willingly."

116
00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:35,056
Yeah, sure.

117
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,009
I saw how gleefully he looked at you,

118
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:38,415
even from outside the house

119
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,571
I knew what he was thinking.

120
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:40,595
Hey!

121
00:07:54,588 --> 00:07:55,588
Hey!

122
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,619
Don't start mouthing off.

123
00:07:57,729 --> 00:07:58,892
Do you know we have

124
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:00,072
another mouth to feed now?

125
00:08:00,097 --> 00:08:01,205
How much rice and

126
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,424
food will that cost us?

127
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:07,041
I've sent a telegram home to send money,

128
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:08,978
don't worry I won't just eat

129
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:10,056
and freeload here.

130
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,916
I have a home too,

131
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:13,275
I'm not penniless.

132
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:14,549
Remember that.

133
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:19,950
If you're truly rich then go back home.

134
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,010
Young man, you don't need to wait

135
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:33,205
for money from home,

136
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:35,338
No need to pay Rerai's debt,

137
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,040
just leave soon.

138
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,659
Mom.

139
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:41,284
I won't leave.

140
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:43,463
I'll pay for everything,

141
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:44,992
rent

142
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:46,112
and food.

143
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:48,058
Really?

144
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:50,417
Geez...

145
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:52,722
Hey,

146
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:54,104
as soon as money is mentioned,

147
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:55,370
your eyes light up huh.

148
00:08:55,393 --> 00:08:56,659
Ever since I met you,

149
00:08:56,675 --> 00:08:58,135
it's all you ever talk about.

150
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,362
Why can't I talk about it?

151
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:01,291
I'm no rich kid

152
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:02,627
or nobleman's daughter.

153
00:09:03,018 --> 00:09:05,268
Money is important to me.

154
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:06,760
- You're aware...
- Silence!

155
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,026
Enough from both of you,

156
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:14,518
you're making me go deaf.

157
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:16,433
Young man,

158
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:18,182
I told you nicely to leave

159
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:19,407
but you refused

160
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,627
even when I chased you away.

161
00:09:22,315 --> 00:09:23,565
How arrogant.

162
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:26,495
If something happens to you,

163
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:27,814
don't blame me.

164
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:44,779
Why is your mother so angry?

165
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:46,073
I don't know either.

166
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,448
Hey, put the food in the kitchen.

167
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,159
I'm going to bathe and sleep,

168
00:09:56,354 --> 00:09:57,354
I'm tired.

169
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:00,815
Hey!

170
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,026
I'm the tired one,

171
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:04,190
carrying things around all day!

172
00:10:10,597 --> 00:10:11,924
Are you lot sure

173
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:13,885
that the plain-faced guy

174
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,541
slept in the same house as Rerai?

175
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,659
Yes,

176
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:20,791
I saw them walk into the house together.

177
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:23,112
I waited for a long time to make sure,

178
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,221
then came to report to you.

179
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:26,580
Just Lieutenant Rat alone

180
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:28,021
is bad enough,

181
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,463
now this guy

182
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:31,965
shows up too.

183
00:10:32,722 --> 00:10:33,823
Last time the plan to

184
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,088
abduct Rerai didn't work,

185
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:36,924
what will you do next?

186
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:45,872
If I can't have Rerai as my wife,

187
00:10:47,028 --> 00:10:48,309
no other man

188
00:10:49,052 --> 00:10:50,544
can hope to get Rerai either.

189
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:19,254
Ahem.

190
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,019
What are you doing?

191
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:22,285
Hey,

192
00:11:22,301 --> 00:11:23,652
since when have you been here?

193
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,793
And what have you seen?

194
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
Tell me everything.

195
00:11:27,613 --> 00:11:29,410
I've been watching you for a long time,

196
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:30,574
seeing you stuff money into

197
00:11:30,598 --> 00:11:32,011
a flask smiling to yourself.

198
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:33,075
Are you mad?

199
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,089
Don't make that face,

200
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:38,847
I'm not stealing your money.

201
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:40,066
When I get money,

202
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:40,988
I'll return it

203
00:11:41,464 --> 00:11:42,480
with interest.

204
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:43,925
Watch what you say,

205
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:45,370
don't go back on your word.

206
00:11:45,715 --> 00:11:48,042
If you try to weasel out,

207
00:11:48,058 --> 00:11:49,738
I'll get you for it.

208
00:11:52,308 --> 00:11:54,620
Why are you so stingy?

209
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,010
Can't even talk about money

210
00:11:56,044 --> 00:11:57,011
without your eyes

211
00:11:57,027 --> 00:11:58,042
bulging like goose eggs.

212
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:00,120
I'm asking sincerely,

213
00:12:00,668 --> 00:12:01,769
what are you planning to do

214
00:12:01,777 --> 00:12:02,808
with so much money?

215
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:03,886
Nosy.

216
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:15,662
Eek!

217
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:03,319
I'd like to dedicate the merits

218
00:13:03,335 --> 00:13:04,600
from this good deed to...

219
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:08,288
Whoa!

220
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,006
I don't want any scraps

221
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:20,967
of merits from you,

222
00:13:20,991 --> 00:13:22,116
you immoral man!

223
00:13:23,062 --> 00:13:24,702
Did you assume wearing the yellow robe

224
00:13:24,718 --> 00:13:26,272
will allow you to escape your sins?

225
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,522
Hey!

226
00:13:57,547 --> 00:13:58,547
Ouch!

227
00:13:58,827 --> 00:13:59,827
Oww!

229
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:12,499
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

230
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:23,388
Rerai,

231
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:25,077
go call Mai over to eat together.

232
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,127
Why doesn't he know how to be punctual?

233
00:14:29,507 --> 00:14:32,085
We can start eating without him, Mom.

234
00:14:32,217 --> 00:14:33,545
No need to wait.

235
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:37,585
Weren't you going to make him

236
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:39,092
pay rent, food, living costs?

237
00:14:39,655 --> 00:14:41,467
If you make him skip some meals,

238
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:43,749
you won't get paid.

239
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,480
You're right, Mom.

240
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:52,487
Eek!

241
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:55,275
Why didn't you get dressed properly

242
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:56,158
before coming out?

243
00:14:57,487 --> 00:14:58,487
Oh come on,

244
00:14:58,512 --> 00:14:59,877
you act like you've never seen

245
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:00,955
a shirtless guy.

246
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:03,244
Cut it out,

247
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,807
there are only women in this house.

248
00:15:04,823 --> 00:15:06,229
Please be considerate.

249
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:08,783
Come sit and eat already.

250
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,409
Alright.

251
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:16,948
Take a seat.

252
00:15:32,526 --> 00:15:34,206
What's wrong? You startled me.

253
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,416
Mom!

254
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:42,033
- Mom!
- Auntie!

255
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:43,338
- Mom!
- Auntie!

256
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:44,729
Auntie!

257
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:49,322
Go call Lieutenant Rat for me.

258
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:50,525
Go!

259
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:51,534
Alright.

260
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:53,917
Mom!

261
00:15:54,338 --> 00:15:55,378
Stay with me.

262
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:56,768
Mom!

263
00:16:24,752 --> 00:16:27,165
Why did you faint upon seeing

264
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,830
the necklace I was wearing?

265
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:37,300
I need to ask you

266
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:40,105
how you got this necklace first.

267
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,082
My father gave it to me.

268
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:44,816
He said it was a family heirloom.

269
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:53,406
Tell me your parents' names again.

270
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:55,609
My father's name is Sing,

271
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,023
my mother's name is Thapthim.

272
00:16:57,508 --> 00:16:58,594
They were the rich couple

273
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,101
who died in the Dark Shadow House,

274
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:01,461
surely, you've heard of the news.

275
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:04,672
I've never heard those names before.

276
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:09,086
How are you related to

277
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,320
the Dark Shadow House?

278
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:12,648
I'm the latest owner

279
00:17:12,673 --> 00:17:13,656
of the Dark Shadow House.

280
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:18,523
What did you say?

281
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:20,555
The land deed for the Dark Shadow House

282
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,375
used to belong to someone named "Mueang"

283
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:25,836
before being passed down to my parents.

284
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,109
When they passed,

285
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:30,031
it came to me.

286
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,400
The reason I came here

287
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,049
wasn't to take over

288
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:39,268
the Dark Shadow House,

289
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:42,049
but to investigate the cause of

290
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:43,182
death of my parents.

291
00:17:45,604 --> 00:17:47,284
- Do you know anything...
- I don't know.

292
00:18:01,276 --> 00:18:03,455
Are you sure it's the same necklace?

293
00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:07,525
I'm certain.

294
00:18:08,823 --> 00:18:09,924
I remember that necklace

295
00:18:09,949 --> 00:18:11,003
and will never forget it.

296
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,541
That lad must be related to

297
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:15,714
the viscount, for sure.

298
00:18:20,135 --> 00:18:21,221
Or could it be...

299
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:22,940
No, it's not.

300
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:24,947
It's not what you think.

301
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:28,002
Because Mai said

302
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:30,752
the land deed for the Dark Shadow House

303
00:18:30,768 --> 00:18:32,190
used to belong to Mueang

304
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:36,002
before going to Mai's parents.

305
00:18:38,456 --> 00:18:39,643
It's possible

306
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:42,752
it was sold again in between.

307
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:48,541
Then is it possible

308
00:18:49,104 --> 00:18:50,526
that Mueang is still alive?

309
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,635
Is there anything I can help you with?

310
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:11,205
Oh, Rerai!

311
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:13,260
On your way to sell sweets?

312
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:14,339
Yes, Uncle.

313
00:19:15,776 --> 00:19:17,565
Mai, hurry up!

314
00:19:26,424 --> 00:19:28,119
It's alright now, Lieutenant Rat.

315
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:29,588
Please return to your duties

316
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:30,744
at the police station.

317
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:32,651
Allow me to accompany you to the market.

318
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,754
It's alright.

319
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:37,639
I will let

320
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,526
my assistant will take over.

321
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:42,221
I feel indebted enough as it is already.

322
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,713
Are you certain, Rerai?

323
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:46,065
Yes, truly.

324
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:49,760
I have prepared some sweets for you.

325
00:19:51,018 --> 00:19:52,854
Consider it payment for your efforts.

326
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:56,033
Thank you so much, Rerai.

327
00:19:56,143 --> 00:19:57,143
No problem.

328
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:01,002
I entrust Rerai to your care.

329
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:10,455
I'll attend to my duty now.

330
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,667
Sure.

331
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,565
If he wishes to help,

332
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,010
why not allow him?

333
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:19,049
Look at those pleading eyes.

334
00:20:20,714 --> 00:20:22,690
Lieutenant Rat's shift is approaching.

335
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:24,635
He serves the public,

336
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:26,158
he can't dedicate

337
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,627
his working hours slacking off here.

338
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:29,018
I am not that type of person.

339
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,346
Yeah, yeah, Ms. Goody Two-Shoes.

340
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:35,822
Hey, may I ask a question?

341
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:38,268
Go ahead.

342
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:39,869
Why did you remain composed

343
00:20:39,894 --> 00:20:41,119
when Aunt Fueang fainted?

344
00:20:41,135 --> 00:20:42,768
You showed no signs of panic.

345
00:20:43,565 --> 00:20:44,846
I previously served as

346
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:46,776
a medical assistant at Siriraj Hospital.

347
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,557
Seriously? You? A medical assistant?

348
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:52,635
I aspired to become a doctor

349
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:54,174
but I have no money.

350
00:20:54,276 --> 00:20:55,322
My mother opposed my

351
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:56,815
studying to become a doctor.

352
00:20:57,151 --> 00:20:58,619
Old timers are like that.

353
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,447
However,

354
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:02,759
I won't give up.

355
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,807
I'll save money to study medicine

356
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:05,854
like I intended.

357
00:21:07,362 --> 00:21:09,252
Why did you desire to become a doctor?

358
00:21:09,283 --> 00:21:10,979
My mom's health is delicate.

359
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:12,665
If I were a doctor,

360
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,299
I could care for her.

361
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,611
Additionally, I would have

362
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:17,916
the chance to aid others.

363
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:22,606
Why,

364
00:21:22,934 --> 00:21:23,974
are you in awe?

365
00:21:25,714 --> 00:21:26,777
No way.

366
00:21:27,465 --> 00:21:30,132
I now understand why you are so stingy.

367
00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:31,473
Hey!

368
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,918
What a foul mouth.

369
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,004
Just kidding.

370
00:21:35,637 --> 00:21:37,355
You actually have thoughts

371
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,060
even when you're like this.

372
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,136
You're full of surprises

373
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:42,535
despite your looks.

374
00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:44,207
Mai!

375
00:21:47,023 --> 00:21:48,023
Oh.

376
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:50,101
I ordered some goods.

377
00:21:50,812 --> 00:21:52,812
Go and carry the goods from the ship.

378
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:55,062
Hurry up and return too.

379
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,851
I think I'll just sit and wait here.

380
00:21:58,172 --> 00:21:59,172
I'm tired.

381
00:22:01,484 --> 00:22:02,984
What? Go on and return

382
00:22:03,343 --> 00:22:04,460
to carry these goods too.

383
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:21,148
Hey!

384
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:22,156
Ouch!

385
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,039
Oww!

386
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:27,015
Oww!

387
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,601
The viscount desires an heir

388
00:22:34,851 --> 00:22:36,835
to inherit his father's assets.

389
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,179
I don't believe he will dare harm us.

390

No matter what unfolds,

391
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,570
I will protect you.

392
00:22:45,836 --> 00:22:48,249
We will undoubtedly be together, ma'am.

Hey!

397
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:13,247
Ouch!

398
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
Oww!

Oww!

You lot!

401
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:54,714
What is taking him so long?

402
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:57,918
Did he slack off?

403
00:23:59,464 --> 00:24:00,526
Mai oh Mai.

404
00:24:00,918 --> 00:24:02,284
Truly can't be trusted.

405
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:14,019
The boat is fully loaded. Can we get on?

406
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:16,589
Unload the items and put him in there.

407
00:24:16,614 --> 00:24:17,972
Cover his legs as well.

408
00:24:18,964 --> 00:24:20,034
Yes, sir.

409
00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:41,129
Take that!

00:24:53,957 --> 00:24:54,957
Ah!

411
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:06,297
Hurry!

412
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:08,734
Hey!

413
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:10,414
What are you lot doing?

414
00:25:10,891 --> 00:25:11,931
Isn't that Mai?

415
00:25:12,242 --> 00:25:13,398
What's happening?

416
00:25:13,438 --> 00:25:14,812
Where are you taking Mai?

417
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,679
Don't interfere!

418
00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:28,117
Hurry up.

419
00:25:29,852 --> 00:25:31,132
Where did he go?

420
00:25:32,266 --> 00:25:33,281
Just you wait,

421
00:25:33,305 --> 00:25:34,578
if the goods don't sell out,

422
00:25:34,603 --> 00:25:36,031
he'll reimburse them!

00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:43,515
You appear alarmed.

429
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:45,539
What happened to my mom?

430
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,054
No, it's not, Fueang!

431
00:25:48,766 --> 00:25:50,890
You see...

432
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,078
What is it?

433
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:55,757
Mai was abducted by someone!

434
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:56,726
Mai!

435
00:25:57,602 --> 00:25:59,632
- Let us go, Uncle!
- Come!

436
00:26:01,516 --> 00:26:02,516
Hurry up!

437
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:14,750
You wish to be the enemy of my heart?

438
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,320
Just wait for the ghost

439
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:17,320
to break your neck.

440
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,093
Kla, let's go quickly,

441
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:22,546
it's getting dark.

442
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:29,297
Let us go.

443
00:26:44,653 --> 00:26:46,309
Mom!

444
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,840
Oh? Why have you returned so soon?

445
00:26:49,068 --> 00:26:50,340
Did sales go well today?

446
00:26:50,435 --> 00:26:51,435
It's Mai!

447
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:53,044
Mai got abducted by someone.

448
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,567
What should we do?

449
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,083
Have you alerted the police?

450
00:26:56,622 --> 00:26:57,653
Not yet, Mom.

451
00:26:57,678 --> 00:26:58,887
I searched everywhere

452
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,012
but couldn't find him.

453
00:27:00,021 --> 00:27:01,395
I returned home in case

454
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,084
Mai somehow returns on his own.

455
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,630
Go inform Lieutenant Rat.

456
00:27:04,646 --> 00:27:05,770
I will notify the villagers

457
00:27:05,795 --> 00:27:06,864
to aid in the search.

458
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:08,051
- Let us go.
- Yes, Mom.

459
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:20,833
Whoa...

460
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:32,559
You want to know what happened?

461
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:41,482
Why did you have to kill

462
00:28:41,498 --> 00:28:42,740
my father and mother?

463
00:28:43,483 --> 00:28:45,435
I did not kill your father and mother.

464
00:29:27,888 --> 00:29:29,740
Returning to my past,

465
00:29:30,904 --> 00:29:33,427
after Dech and I became lovers,

466
00:29:34,326 --> 00:29:36,115
(1920 CE)
I devoted my heart entirely to Dech.

467
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:37,420
(1920 CE)

468
00:29:37,436 --> 00:29:39,170
(1920 CE)
However, the deeper our love,

469
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:39,880
(1920 CE)

470
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:41,888
(1920 CE)
the more imminent the dangers grew.

471
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:51,459
Dech...

472
00:29:52,068 --> 00:29:53,552
What if someone sees us?

473
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,865
At this early hour,

474
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,365
no one will notice, ma'am.

475
00:30:00,951 --> 00:30:03,123
I got worried when I woke up

476
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:04,755
and didn't find you.

477
00:30:06,733 --> 00:30:08,123
What are you afraid of?

478
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:09,482
I fear that Ms. Malai will

479
00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:10,834
run away from me again.

480
00:30:14,405 --> 00:30:15,428
Dech,

481
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:17,663
what lies ahead for us in our lives?

482
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,764
The viscount desires an heir

483
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,842
to inherit his father's assets.

484
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:26,319
I don't believe he will dare harm us.

485
00:30:36,987 --> 00:30:38,588
No matter what unfolds,

486
00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:40,377
I will protect you.

487
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,230
We will undoubtedly be together, ma'am.

488
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:08,196
He has never cared for me,

489
00:31:08,446 --> 00:31:09,938
and you know that very well.

490
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:11,009
I understand the Viscount's

491
00:31:11,032 --> 00:31:12,032
disposition thoroughly.

492
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:13,235
If either I or you,

493
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,260
were to act out of line,

494
00:31:14,532 --> 00:31:16,172
and arouse the Viscount's suspicion,

495
00:31:16,946 --> 00:31:18,540
it would mean the end for both of us.

(House of the Dark Shadows

498
00:31:58,489 --> 00:31:59,707
Malai,

499
00:32:02,114 --> 00:32:03,676
are you still angry at me?

500
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,852
- I can provide an explanation...
- It's alright, my lord.

501
00:32:06,294 --> 00:32:07,629
I understand everything.

502
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:11,098
I will bear a child for you, my lord,

503
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,504
to secure the inheritance you desire.

504
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:14,998
Truly, Malai?

505
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,575
However, afterward,

506
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,693
I reclaim my life, my lord.

507
00:32:21,114 --> 00:32:22,474
What do you mean?

508
00:32:22,888 --> 00:32:23,950
My lord, I mean,

509
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:26,035
I will not permit you

510
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:27,317
to control my life any longer.

511
00:32:36,112 --> 00:32:37,095
Don't go yet.

512
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,728
I have a question.

513
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:44,689
Someone aims to kill Malai?

514
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:46,479
Are they bandits?

515
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:47,790
Certainly not, my lord.

516
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,314
I believe there must be someone

517
00:32:50,323 --> 00:32:52,142
with the intention to kill Ms. Malai.

518
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:54,924
Who might it be?

519
00:32:55,213 --> 00:32:57,072
And what is the motive to kill Malai?

520
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:58,517
I suspect it could be

521
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:00,542
Ms. Malai's siblings, my lord.

522
00:33:02,198 --> 00:33:04,338
And what would they gain from doing so,

523
00:33:04,346 --> 00:33:05,541
given that Malai possesses

524
00:33:05,557 --> 00:33:06,799
no wealth whatsoever?

525
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:12,408
Set that matter aside for now.

526
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:13,681
When will you be

527
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:15,142
sharing a bed with Malai?

The Viscount wouldn't mind.

544
00:35:36,658 --> 00:35:37,767
It's just us here,

545
00:35:38,276 --> 00:35:39,369
there's no need for any

546

elaborate rituals.

Ensure it's handled tonight.

Let's not have any more issues.

551
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:13,642
My lord, do we have no other options?

552
00:37:13,658 --> 00:37:15,549
- I...
- It has reached this point,

553
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,103
and you're still raising
the same question?

554
00:37:23,957 --> 00:37:25,637
I know that you feel troubled,

555
00:37:27,285 --> 00:37:28,730
but I implore you to do this for me.

556
00:39:46,704 --> 00:39:47,563
Saeng!

557
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:48,845
Did you trail me?

558
00:39:49,212 --> 00:39:50,438
It is said that a couple

559
00:39:50,463 --> 00:39:51,641
who sleeps together

560
00:39:51,665 --> 00:39:52,993
will develop an attachment.

00:40:22,014 --> 00:40:23,732
He has never cared for me,

567
00:40:24,146 --> 00:40:25,653
and you know that very well.

568
00:40:25,725 --> 00:40:26,873
I understand the Viscount's

569
00:40:26,897 --> 00:40:28,021
disposition thoroughly.

570
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:29,051
If either I or you,

571
00:40:29,076 --> 00:40:30,271
were to act out of line,

572
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:32,169
and arouse the Viscount's suspicion,

573
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:34,435
it would mean the end for both of us.

574
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:39,020
So, how much longer must

575
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,426
we continue this charade?

576
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:42,496
When can we express our love?

577
00:40:48,938 --> 00:40:50,695
Trust me, Ms. Malai,

578
00:40:50,821 --> 00:40:52,109
and endure it for today,

579
00:40:52,134 --> 00:40:53,328
for the sake of our future.

580
00:40:53,353 --> 00:40:55,072
We will undoubtedly be together.

581
00:40:58,555 --> 00:40:59,922
I won't allow anyone to

582
00:40:59,947 --> 00:41:01,391
take you away from me.

583
00:41:29,188 --> 00:41:30,047
Saeng!

584
00:41:30,063 --> 00:41:31,329
Did you trail me?

585
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:32,781
It is said that a couple

586
00:41:32,806 --> 00:41:33,984
who sleeps together

587
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:35,337
will develop an attachment.

588
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:36,234
Saeng!

589
00:41:36,868 --> 00:41:38,406
I swear that

590
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:39,875
I will only love

591
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,781
and remain faithful to the viscount.

592
00:41:41,844 --> 00:41:43,023
However,

593
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:44,734
if Dech were to break that oath,

594
00:41:44,813 --> 00:41:47,013
he shall meet a gruesome demise.

595
00:41:49,008 --> 00:41:50,008
My lord...

596
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,835
