"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 39)

19
00:01:58,897 --> 00:02:01,474
Ms. Malai showed me
everything that happened.

20
00:02:01,703 --> 00:02:03,962
She's convinced
you're the one who killed her.

21
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:06,572
It doesn't mean
what you saw was the truth.

22
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,419
Make sure Monk Dech gets punished.

23
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:11,133
Don't let his depravity
taint monasticism.

24
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:13,137
I want only one thing from you.

25
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:14,812
Just leave Rerai alone.

26
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:16,076
I slept with Mai.

27
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,612
And we're getting married.

28
00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:20,279
And did you know
he claimed to be Mr. Mueang?

29
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,725
He did it to find out the truth.

30
00:02:21,735 --> 00:02:23,920
You're not my nephew Mueang.

31
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:25,755
Sell me the Dark Shadow House

32
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:27,166
and leave this place.

33
00:02:27,668 --> 00:02:29,989
I'm like this because of you.

34
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:31,692
All because of you, Dech.

35
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:32,849
It's fate.

36
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,792
Watch me go against fate.

37
00:02:34,803 --> 00:02:36,036
You were like this.

38
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,510
How could you survive the fire?

39
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,480
Because I had Im.

40
00:02:41,883 --> 00:02:43,266
You're saying this.

41
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:45,840
Does this mean you know
who was behind everything?

42
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:51,660
After Im rescued me...

43
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,414
Ms. Bu-nga! Ms. Bu-nga!

44
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,580
Ms. Bu-nga! Hurry! Help her!

45
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:57,916
Hurry! Hurry!

46
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:02,376
Ms. Bu-nga?!

47
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:03,536
Ms. Bu-nga?!

48
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:17,203
Ms. Bu-nga,

49
00:03:17,923 --> 00:03:19,303
the count came to see you.

50
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,610
The count?

51
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:28,310
Who is he? I don't know him.

52
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,630
Count Phichit,

53
00:03:29,863 --> 00:03:31,596
the viscount's older brother.

54
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,267
Don't do that, Mr. Bu-nga.

55
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:47,633
It's not proper, ma'am.

56
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:50,720
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,650
Ever since she woke up,
she became deranged.

58
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,130
Deranged?

59
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:57,397
Yes, my lord.

60
00:03:57,463 --> 00:04:00,293
The doctor said she sustained
a severe head injury.

61
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:02,673
So she lost her mind.

62
00:04:02,903 --> 00:04:03,903
Poor woman.

63
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:07,987
It's probably best that you leave.

64
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:10,107
So I'll take my leave.

65
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,836
I'm sorry for intruding.

66
00:04:23,103 --> 00:04:24,633
What did you just say, Im?

67
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:28,547
Count Phichit just got promoted
to a marquis, Ms. Bu-nga.

68
00:04:28,823 --> 00:04:30,994
Then we must be more careful.

69
00:04:31,263 --> 00:04:33,620
You've been feigning insanity
for months now.

70
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:38,607
The count... No, the marquis
doesn't seem to be suspicious.

71
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:40,403
We can't be too careful, Im.

72
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:42,240
I don't know what he's thinking.

73
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:44,770
He's even more dangerous
at a higher position.

74
00:04:47,563 --> 00:04:49,700
So what do we do, Ms. Bu-nga?

75
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:54,860
We have to hide out
somewhere far away.

76
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,162
Either Ko Mak or Singapore.

77
00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:59,407
So I can fully recover.

78
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:02,734
I have to walk again.

79
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:04,956
In the meantime,

80
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,053
we'll look for evidence
to incriminate the marquis.

81
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:12,100
We can't let
the culprit off the hook.

82
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,120
Are you sure it's the marquis?

83
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:17,403
I am.

84
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,800
Both Im and I saw him.

85
00:05:21,217 --> 00:05:22,217
No wonder.

86
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,327
So after all these years,

87
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:27,153
have you found any evidence?

88
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,840
If I didn't,
I wouldn't have come back.

89
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,040
And it's not just me

90
00:05:32,263 --> 00:05:33,883
who wants to punish the marquis.

91
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:37,190
There are other people
who want to see him punished.

92
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:39,003
Only waiting for the opportunity.

93
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:42,880
The snacks are here.

94
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:57,523
Ms. Bu-nga, have some snacks.

95
00:05:58,323 --> 00:05:59,490
From my own shop.

96
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:01,217
Snacks.

97
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:03,344
Lots of snacks.

98
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:23,937
What's with you?

99
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,230
Are you possessed?

100
00:06:25,323 --> 00:06:27,790
I just wanted to be nice
and you call me possessed.

101
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:30,486
If you don't like it,
I won't feed you.

102
00:06:30,496 --> 00:06:31,496
Hey.

103
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:41,077
So good.

104
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:42,983
So have more.

105
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,390
Rerai!

106
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,350
Mom.

107
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:52,600
- Mom.
- Come home.

108
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,470
I told you to stay away from him.

109
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,085
You don't have
the right to do this to me.

110
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:02,330
Dragging me like I'm a pet.

111
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:05,120
Have you ever listened
to my warnings?

112
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,584
Why are you so stubborn?

113
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:10,067
I didn't listen
because they were unreasonable.

114
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,960
Mai's not a bad man.
Why can't I hang out with him?

115
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:15,100
You kept saying
stay away from him

116
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:17,020
but you never gave a reason.

117
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:19,006
I said that
because I worried about you.

118
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:22,080
- Come home.
- Fueang! Fueang!

119
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:23,343
Let' talk about this.

120
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,690
Please don't do this.

121
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,870
None of your business.

122
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,190
Don't meddle like a fool.

123
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,243
I think the foolish one here
is you, Fueang.

124
00:07:56,797 --> 00:07:57,797
This can't be true.

125
00:07:58,457 --> 00:07:59,680
You're not insane?

126
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:01,880
The insane one right now

127
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,080
is you, not me.

128
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,750
Ms. Malai?

129
00:09:13,183 --> 00:09:14,183
Ms. Malai?

130
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,720
Please come out.

131
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:19,080
You're not welcome here.

132
00:09:19,797 --> 00:09:20,797
Get out.

133
00:09:21,443 --> 00:09:22,926
Don't say that, Ms. Malai.

134
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,550
The previous incident

135
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,987
must have weakened you a lot.

136
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,600
- I...
- You're...

137
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:31,043
worried about me?

138
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:33,600
- I'm really worried about you.
- Liar!

139
00:09:34,503 --> 00:09:35,503
You killed me.

140
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,830
Why would you worry about me?

141
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:39,680
- I didn't...
- Get out!

142
00:09:41,937 --> 00:09:43,397
I said get out!

143
00:10:10,823 --> 00:10:11,823
Ms. Malai?

144
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,560
Whose spirit is that dark shadow?

145
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,694
You're trying to keep them

146
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,710
from getting close to one another

147
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:50,360
because you're afraid the
truth will come out, aren't you.

148
00:10:53,303 --> 00:10:54,303
The truth?

149
00:10:55,277 --> 00:10:56,350
What truth, Mom?

150
00:10:59,837 --> 00:11:02,120
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

151
00:11:02,223 --> 00:11:03,920
Don't play dumb, Fueang.

152
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:06,686
You know very well what I mean.

153
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:09,433
You don't want your daughter
to know her origin

154
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:11,346
and who her father was.

155
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:17,127
You know who my father was?

156
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,883
I wouldn't have said if I didn't.

157
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,360
Well, Fueang?

158
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:23,904
You want me to tell her

159
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,203
or are you gonna tell her?

160
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,690
I really don't know

161
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:28,680
what you're talking about.

162
00:11:29,243 --> 00:11:30,243
Rerai,

163
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,310
- come home.
- I'm not letting you leave.

164
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:34,200
Rerai is the viscount's daughter.

165
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:36,800
She's the real owner
of the Dark Shadow House.

166
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:38,804
Why are you hiding that?

167
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:44,730
Is that true, Mom?

168
00:11:50,683 --> 00:11:51,683
No.

169
00:11:52,383 --> 00:11:54,090
No, it's not true, baby.

170
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,932
Ms. Bu-nga is probably
still deranged

171
00:11:56,943 --> 00:11:58,520
so she's talking nonsense.

172
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,960
I have all my senses.

173
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:01,743
And I've known this
for a long time.

174
00:12:02,063 --> 00:12:03,760
Malai told me herself.

175
00:12:03,977 --> 00:12:06,187
Or are you accusing her
of lying to me?

176
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:07,576
Is it true, Mom?

177
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,303
Answer me, Mom.

178
00:12:09,403 --> 00:12:10,403
It's not true.

179
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,920
It's all nonsense.

180
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,560
Rerai, let's go home.

181
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,370
Let's go home. Let's go home.

182
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,770
Mom.

183
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:26,312
- Mom.
- Come home now.

184
00:12:26,323 --> 00:12:27,813
I can't do this to me.

185
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:30,127
- Go home.
- You can't keep dragging me.

186
00:12:30,437 --> 00:12:31,574
I'm a person too, Mom.

187
00:12:31,777 --> 00:12:32,920
If you weren't stubborn,

188
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,230
would I have to
drag you home like this?

189
00:12:35,383 --> 00:12:36,540
What did I do wrong?

190
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,433
I paid Ms. Bu-nga a visit as usual.

191
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,480
Mai just asked to tag along.

192
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:42,313
You wouldn't let me explain.

193
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:44,166
And you lied to me.

194
00:12:44,456 --> 00:12:45,680
What did I lie to you about?

195
00:12:45,822 --> 00:12:47,826
- What Ms. Bu-nga...
- It's not true.

196
00:12:48,282 --> 00:12:50,282
She was talking nonsense.
Come home.

197
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,045
- No, I'm not going.
- Come home.

198
00:12:52,056 --> 00:12:52,986
- Fueang!
- Let go!

199
00:12:52,996 --> 00:12:54,386
- Fueang!
- Come home!

200
00:12:54,396 --> 00:12:55,976
- Fueang! Fueang!
- I'm not going!

201
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,607
You should just tell her the truth.

202
00:12:58,729 --> 00:12:59,789
Don't hide it anymore.

203
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:03,970
So...

204
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,600
you knew about this?

205
00:13:07,643 --> 00:13:08,643
But this...

206
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,180
as your mother, Fueang
should be the one to tell you.

207
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:15,360
Fueang, please admit the truth.

208
00:13:15,943 --> 00:13:18,530
- It's no use hiding it from Rerai.
- Stop talking!

209
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:22,327
It's none of your business.

210
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:23,847
This is not about Mai.

211
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:25,040
This is about me.

212
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:26,643
Tell me

213
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:29,323
- if what Ms. Bu-nga said was true.
- It's not true!

214
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:31,720
Don't pay attention to a mad woman.

215
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,440
If she didn't tell the truth,

216
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:35,576
why would you drag me out of there?

217
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,130
For years,

218
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,160
why have you been hiding this?

219
00:13:45,043 --> 00:13:47,920
I didn't want you involved
with the goddamn fortune.

220
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:49,923
Rerai,

221
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:53,040
I did what I did
because I meant well.

222
00:13:54,577 --> 00:13:55,577
Meant well?

223
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:59,413
You meant so well that we've
had to struggle just to get by

224
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:02,854
when we can live comfortably.

225
00:14:03,403 --> 00:14:06,700
When I can study
what I want to study.

226
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:09,400
How is that well-meaning, Mom?

227
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:15,863
You don't know

228
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:19,160
how many people have died
because of this goddamned fortune.

229
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,160
I don't want you to get involved.

230
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,280
Why can't I get involved?

231
00:14:27,563 --> 00:14:29,850
Ow, Mom! It hurts!

232
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,130
Listen to you!

233
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:33,823
Greed will blind you!

234
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,040
I don't want you to be so
greedy for the fortune that...

235
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,097
you don't care how many
people died because of it.

236
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,570
Yes.

237
00:14:44,763 --> 00:14:46,760
The whole fortune is yours!

238
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,560
But I don't want you
to even touch it.

239
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:55,720
- You're selfish!
- I'm not! I did this for your sake!

240
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:01,879
The fortune is the only
good thing about your father.

241
00:15:01,897 --> 00:15:03,640
The rest of him was bad.

242
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,160
He was just a wicked man

243
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:08,920
who coerced others
with the word "kindness."

244
00:15:09,613 --> 00:15:11,782
I didn't want that kind of man
to be your father!

245
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:12,920
If my father was wicked,

246
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:15,240
his daughter is as wicked.

247
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,480
If you hate my father that much,

248
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,000
you don't have to
consider me your daughter.

249
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:23,749
Rerai!

250
00:15:28,822 --> 00:15:30,240
If you walk away from me,

251
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,580
don't bother coming home to me.

252
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:39,944
And don't call me "mom"...

253
00:15:40,797 --> 00:15:41,797
anymore!

254
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,480
Rerai!

255
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:53,597
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:55,176
- I didn't see...
- Stop!

257
00:16:56,623 --> 00:16:57,623
Come on.

258
00:16:57,743 --> 00:16:58,743
Shut up!

259
00:16:58,897 --> 00:16:59,897
Quiet!

260
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:01,817
Help!

261
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:04,177
Help!

262
00:17:04,597 --> 00:17:05,597
Rerai!

263
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,230
Rerai!

264
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,317
Rerai!

265
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,056
- Please tell other people.
- Lieutenant Rat!

266
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:19,883
Lieutenant Rat, it's bad.

267
00:17:20,003 --> 00:17:21,920
What happened?
Why are you in such a hurry?

268
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:23,400
Rerai is missing.

269
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,320
Venerable Father!

270
00:17:30,703 --> 00:17:31,803
Venerable Father!

271
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:34,334
Rerai was taken.

272
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:35,701
Have you told the police?

273
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:37,354
I told Lieutenant Rat.

274
00:17:37,497 --> 00:17:39,267
He's looking for her right now.

275
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,297
But I have something
to talk to you.

276
00:17:41,363 --> 00:17:43,053
- I think...
- Mister?

277
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,063
Mister? Mister?

278
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,160
Someone left you a note.

279
00:17:47,637 --> 00:17:49,920
Do you know who gave you this?

280
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,766
I don't know. He gave me money

281
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:53,360
and told me to give it to you.

282
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,450
What's wrong?

283
00:18:06,723 --> 00:18:08,640
Rerai was taken
to the Dark Shadow House.

284
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:10,526
What are you gonna do?

285
00:18:10,816 --> 00:18:12,230
I'm gonna rescue her, of course.

286
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:13,727
From where I stand,

287
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:15,830
the culprit must be the marquis.

288
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:18,547
The marquis?

289
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:21,722
I think he had Rerai taken

290
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,680
because his previous plan

291
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,720
to burn down the house failed.

292
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,340
So he resorted to this.

293
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:30,253
But he still doesn't know
the truth about Rerai.

294
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:32,760
If he finds out
she's the viscount's true heir.

295
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,880
He won't let her live.

296
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:51,060
I'd like to leave the monkhood.

297
00:18:51,689 --> 00:18:53,040
I know.

298
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,307
Just seeing your face,

299
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,893
I know you can't remain a monk.

300
00:18:58,636 --> 00:18:59,927
Over the years,

301
00:19:00,323 --> 00:19:02,120
your training has advanced greatly.

302
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:04,406
But you can't escape your karma.

303
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:06,326
I'm sorry, Venerable Father.

304
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:15,300
You haven't found Rerai yet?

305
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,430
Please don't be alarmed.

306
00:19:18,012 --> 00:19:19,723
My people are looking for her.

307
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:20,990
They'll find her soon.

308
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:24,442
You should go home.
I'll let you know.

309
00:19:24,904 --> 00:19:25,907
Yes.

310
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:26,918
All right.

311
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,711
Fueang.

312
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,950
Venerable Brother!

313
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:41,169
- Why...?
- I left monkhood.

314
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,713
Things got too out of hand
for me to remain a monk.

315
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:46,477
You're saying this...

316
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,383
That means you heard about Rerai.

317
00:19:50,483 --> 00:19:52,000
Mai and I will take care of it.

318
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,110
No.

319
00:19:53,503 --> 00:19:55,073
Do it on your own.

320
00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:57,753
I don't want that boy
near my daughter again.

321
00:19:57,943 --> 00:19:58,943
Fueang.

322
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:01,603
How long will you let
your bias blind you?

323
00:20:01,943 --> 00:20:03,793
Even if Mai wasn't involved,

324
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,903
if it's gonna happen,
it's gonna happen.

325
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,997
The truth will come out eventually

326
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,594
who is the viscount's real heir.

327
00:20:11,037 --> 00:20:12,037
So what?

328
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:15,973
I just don't want people
involved with that blood money

329
00:20:16,577 --> 00:20:18,949
to go near my daughter.
Is that so wrong?

330
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:20,593
You don't want your daughter

331
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:22,333
to be tainted
because you love her

332
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:25,059
or is it because you're biased?

333
00:20:25,236 --> 00:20:26,650
Don't talk to me this way.

334
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,810
You're awake?

335
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:18,360
What are you gonna do to me?

336
00:21:18,616 --> 00:21:19,819
Don't worry.

337
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:21,526
I'm not gonna hurt you.

338
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,379
Let's wait for that boy.

339
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:25,470
So you both can die together.

340
00:21:36,843 --> 00:21:37,996
You're finally here,

341
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,470
you bastard.

343
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:51,695
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

344
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,950
Lieutenant Rat.

345
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,360
What's going on, Chief?

346
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:02,023
Ms. Bu-nga.

347
00:22:04,403 --> 00:22:06,040
I have business with the marquis.

348
00:22:06,397 --> 00:22:08,100
Is he home?

349
00:22:08,356 --> 00:22:11,280
My mother said he wasn't home yet.

350
00:22:12,843 --> 00:22:15,113
How did Ms. Bu-nga come here?

351
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,466
- I hope it's not...
- Ms. Bu-nga is a key witness.

352
00:22:18,822 --> 00:22:19,822
What's this about?

353
00:22:20,376 --> 00:22:23,660
I'm here because there's
an arrest warrant for the marquis.

354
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,842
My father?

355
00:22:25,316 --> 00:22:26,469
Past karma, Lieutenant.

356
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,473
I didn't want it to be this way.

357
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,113
But it's time for your father

358
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,520
to pay for his sins.

359
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:36,162
I've been investigating
the Dark Shadow House murders

360
00:22:36,173 --> 00:22:37,216
for over ten years

361
00:22:37,476 --> 00:22:38,679
and I'm now convinced

362
00:22:39,189 --> 00:22:42,579
the person who gained the most
from those deaths

363
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:44,452
is Marquis Phichit.

364
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:45,889
My father.

365
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,863
But I didn't have enough evidence

366
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:50,510
to prosecute the marquis

367
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:53,679
until I have
Ms. Bu-nga's statement.

368
00:22:54,395 --> 00:22:57,086
When the Dark Shadow House
was on fire about 10 years ago,

369
00:22:57,996 --> 00:23:01,387
I saw Marquis Phichit come out
of the house with my own eyes.

370
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:04,096
The murderer
could not be anyone else

371
00:23:04,777 --> 00:23:05,777
but the marquis.

372
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,667
My father could never be
the murderer.

373
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,649
You're gonna believe
the words of a mad woman

374
00:23:11,716 --> 00:23:13,306
and prosecute my father?

375
00:23:13,923 --> 00:23:16,420
Ms. Bu-nga isn't really insane.

376
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:18,066
She just pretended to be.

377
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:19,793
I did it to protect myself

378
00:23:20,156 --> 00:23:22,619
and I went away
for over 10 years to recover.

379
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:25,808
If I didn't do that,
I would have died a long time ago.

380
00:23:27,137 --> 00:23:28,754
Ms. Bu-nga! Ms. Bu-nga!

381
00:23:30,237 --> 00:23:31,380
What's going on, Im?

382
00:23:31,802 --> 00:23:33,293
Why did you come here?

383
00:23:33,322 --> 00:23:34,322
It's Mai.

384
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,593
He asked me to give you this letter

385
00:23:36,662 --> 00:23:38,833
and he insisted that

386
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,057
I must hand it to you myself.

387
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,810
Goodness.

388
00:23:51,983 --> 00:23:53,340
What's wrong, Ms. Bu-nga?

389
00:23:53,636 --> 00:23:56,746
Rerai was taken by the marquis
to the Dark Shadow House.

390
00:24:08,828 --> 00:24:10,536
All right. Come what may.

391
00:24:19,783 --> 00:24:21,720
Rerai! Where are you, Rerai?!

392
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,190
Rerai!

393
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,216
Where's Rerai?!

394
00:24:28,536 --> 00:24:29,663
Give me the gun first.

395
00:24:29,856 --> 00:24:30,856
Then I'll show you.

396
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:32,436
No.

397
00:24:32,983 --> 00:24:35,383
Show me Rerai first.
Then I'll do what you asked.

398
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,880
Don't make this difficult
for no reason.

399
00:24:38,683 --> 00:24:39,946
Hand us the gun.

400
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:41,709
Come get me.

401
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:43,377
I'll shoot you in the heads.

402
00:24:43,643 --> 00:24:44,899
Since we can't talk nicely,

403
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:46,747
I have to get violent!

404
00:24:51,536 --> 00:24:52,680
One more step,

405
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:54,746
I'll shoot you dead here.

406
00:24:55,216 --> 00:24:56,216
A gunshot.

407
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,413
Whom did your people shoot?

408
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,786
Quiet, if you don't wanna die.

409
00:25:01,283 --> 00:25:02,787
Whom did your people shoot?

410
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:04,036
Mai, right?

411
00:25:04,363 --> 00:25:05,740
You had Mai killed, right?

412
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:06,937
Mai!

413
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,457
Mai! Let go!

414
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,910
Let go!

415
00:25:11,937 --> 00:25:12,937
Mai!

416
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:15,383
Mai.

417
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:16,457
Marquis.

418
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,050
Drop the gun.

419
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:24,760
I said drop the gun

420
00:25:25,337 --> 00:25:26,337
or she dies.

421
00:25:28,582 --> 00:25:29,595
Don't do it, Mai.

422
00:25:44,323 --> 00:25:45,323
Get the gun.

423
00:25:52,943 --> 00:25:54,480
What's wrong?
He said get the gun.

424
00:26:06,062 --> 00:26:07,062
What are you doing?

425
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:08,197
I said get the gun.

426
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,000
I can't, my lord.

427
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:11,393
When I reach out,

428
00:26:11,677 --> 00:26:12,677
I can't keep reaching.

429
00:26:12,997 --> 00:26:14,560
Like something's holding my hand.

430
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,470
What the hell?

431
00:26:37,143 --> 00:26:38,143
Let's go!

432
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:45,503
Malai.

433
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,520
This must be you.

434
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:51,990
Even though I can't see you,

435
00:26:52,603 --> 00:26:55,110
I know it's definitely your doing.

436
00:27:30,563 --> 00:27:31,716
You're finally here,

437
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,190
you bastard.

438
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,347
Don't stall.

439
00:27:42,556 --> 00:27:43,786
Why don't you go help Mai?

440
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,713
Are you gonna let me
go in there nicely?

441
00:27:47,163 --> 00:27:48,404
I'm glad you understand.

442
00:27:49,143 --> 00:27:50,666
I want to see you tortured.

443
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,860
You'll never be able
to help anyone.

444
00:27:53,643 --> 00:27:54,643
Those you love...

445
00:27:55,969 --> 00:27:57,322
will die painfully.

446
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,347
You don't have to do this.

447
00:28:06,657 --> 00:28:08,040
We can talk nicely.

448
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:09,660
Talk nicely?

449
00:28:10,277 --> 00:28:12,280
I tried talking to you nicely,

450
00:28:12,683 --> 00:28:14,480
asking you to sell me this house,

451
00:28:14,863 --> 00:28:15,863
but you refused.

452
00:28:16,364 --> 00:28:17,701
What else is there to talk?

453
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,191
Like what you said,

454
00:28:19,437 --> 00:28:20,863
a lawsuit takes a long time.

455
00:28:21,037 --> 00:28:22,513
This is the only way.

456
00:28:23,057 --> 00:28:24,460
If you let Rerai go,

457
00:28:24,676 --> 00:28:25,676
I'll sell it to you.

458
00:28:26,797 --> 00:28:27,797
No.

459
00:28:28,116 --> 00:28:29,860
I'll give you this house for free.

460
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:31,393
I wasn't born yesterday.

461
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:34,013
The land of such great value,

462
00:28:34,595 --> 00:28:36,013
you're gonna trade it with...

463
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,150
this girl?

464
00:28:41,317 --> 00:28:42,317
Fine.

465
00:28:43,237 --> 00:28:44,237
Except...

466
00:28:46,123 --> 00:28:47,320
if you die first.

467
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,490
Mai.

468
00:29:14,737 --> 00:29:16,234
Don't look at me like that!

469
00:29:17,124 --> 00:29:18,440
I'll never forgive you.

470
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:20,650
I'm ready to die.

471
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,333
If that's what you want.

472
00:29:26,356 --> 00:29:27,356
Vile.

473
00:29:27,463 --> 00:29:30,140
But I don't wanna die
while you misunderstand me.

474
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:32,760
You're still vile to this moment.

475
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:34,773
Even when I'm a ghost,

476
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,506
I don't fool people
as well as you do.

477
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:40,377
Please give me a chance
to prove myself to you.

478
00:29:40,783 --> 00:29:42,799
I will find you the real murderer.

479
00:29:43,502 --> 00:29:44,972
I had given you enough.

480
00:29:45,142 --> 00:29:46,295
But every time,

481
00:29:46,476 --> 00:29:48,286
you betrayed me.

482
00:29:48,736 --> 00:29:50,952
I'm a house ghost because of you.

483
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:52,956
Since you don't believe me,

484
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,670
I'm ready to die

485
00:29:55,943 --> 00:29:57,290
as you wish.

486
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:17,561
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

487
00:30:18,015 --> 00:30:22,502
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

488
00:30:22,963 --> 00:30:24,617
Since you don't believe me,

489
00:30:26,078 --> 00:30:27,331
I'm ready to die

490
00:30:27,604 --> 00:30:28,951
as you wish.

491
00:30:57,763 --> 00:30:59,133
Don't worry about it, Malai.

492
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,663
Your handkerchief is clean.
Don't dirty it on my account.

493
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:06,813
Please take it.
As my thanks for helping me.

494
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,470
Give me a chance to prove it,

495
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,387
so we know what really happened.

496
00:31:28,076 --> 00:31:29,243
Don't you wanna know?

497
00:31:43,363 --> 00:31:44,363
Come here.

498
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,690
Marquis!

499
00:31:57,297 --> 00:31:58,297
Venerable Father.

500
00:32:02,883 --> 00:32:04,010
You're finally here, Dech.

501
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:05,417
Good.

502
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,540
So I can get rid of
all of you together.

503
00:32:08,316 --> 00:32:09,533
It's hard to believe

504
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,533
that someone
who appears to be decent

505
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,507
and respectable like you

506
00:32:13,877 --> 00:32:15,547
would do these wicked things.

507
00:32:19,002 --> 00:32:20,002
Wicked?

508
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,970
I'm not as wicked as your husband.

509
00:32:31,975 --> 00:32:33,273
You think I didn't know

510
00:32:34,063 --> 00:32:35,673
how dirty you and Wisan

511
00:32:36,116 --> 00:32:37,280
have always been?

512
00:32:38,137 --> 00:32:42,339
Wisan always boasted and acted like
he was better than anyone else

513
00:32:43,543 --> 00:32:47,020
when all he did was being born
of my father's first wife.

514
00:32:47,662 --> 00:32:48,662
He was born

515
00:32:48,943 --> 00:32:50,220
a homosexual.

516
00:32:54,262 --> 00:32:55,990
But my father still sided with him.

517
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,609
Wisan!

518
00:33:00,243 --> 00:33:01,323
How could you do that?!

519
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:02,496
Father.

520
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:05,429
Rit!

521
00:33:07,756 --> 00:33:08,756
Rit!

522
00:33:09,617 --> 00:33:10,657
Are you okay?

523
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,067
If you love him so much,

524
00:33:12,184 --> 00:33:13,494
go live with him!

525
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:15,084
Go!

526
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,450
Father?

527
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,830
Does it hurt?

528
00:33:22,977 --> 00:33:23,977
Rit?

529
00:33:36,043 --> 00:33:37,043
Even so,

530
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,530
not long after

531
00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:40,386
my father let him come back

532
00:33:40,796 --> 00:33:42,146
because my father loved him

533
00:33:42,389 --> 00:33:43,777
while he hated me!

534
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,897
No matter how good I was,
my father never saw me.

535
00:33:47,597 --> 00:33:49,044
If he didn't come back that day,

536
00:33:49,643 --> 00:33:50,860
all the fortune

537
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:53,020
would have been mine!

538
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:55,880
None of this would have happened!

539
00:33:56,196 --> 00:33:58,107
So it all started from envy.

540
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,220
You're good, my lord,

541
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,706
for hiding your envy for so long.

542
00:34:03,276 --> 00:34:04,886
But your envy

543
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:07,340
must have hurt
more than the viscount.

544
00:34:07,757 --> 00:34:08,757
You're smart.

545
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:10,317
But it's too late

546
00:34:10,663 --> 00:34:11,760
to be smart now.

547
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,230
You're right, my lord.

548
00:34:13,423 --> 00:34:15,886
I should have known
since Chaem's death.

549
00:34:18,009 --> 00:34:19,009
Chaem's death

550
00:34:19,803 --> 00:34:21,650
wasn't a part of my plan.

551
00:34:25,377 --> 00:34:26,507
It was just her time.

552
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:00,810
Master!

553
00:35:03,763 --> 00:35:04,763
Was it done?

554
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:09,523
Even though
I didn't know this Chaem,

555
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,004
I know she was innocent.

556
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,140
Didn't you feel anything at all

557
00:35:15,462 --> 00:35:17,269
about killing people
who weren't involved?

558
00:35:23,203 --> 00:35:24,280
Feel?

559
00:35:24,796 --> 00:35:26,971
Why should someone
like me feel anything

560
00:35:26,982 --> 00:35:29,130
for the death of scum like Chaem?

561
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:33,909
But her death

562
00:35:35,096 --> 00:35:36,346
got me in trouble

563
00:35:37,976 --> 00:35:39,820
because of
that fool's recklessness!

564
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:45,807
That's Chaem,

565
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:47,559
Ramphoei's servant.

566
00:35:47,902 --> 00:35:49,400
She was dressed the same way.

567
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:50,621
I didn't think...

568
00:35:52,355 --> 00:35:53,355
Idiot!

569
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:54,800
I'm sorry, my lord.

570
00:35:55,202 --> 00:35:56,600
I'll be more careful next time.

571
00:35:57,683 --> 00:35:59,886
There's no next time
for an idiot like you.

572
00:36:14,908 --> 00:36:16,108
I didn't do anything wrong.

573
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:19,306
I did it to protect
my father's fortune.

574
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:22,001
Your men killed the wrong woman
because of how she dressed.

575
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:23,289
That means...

576
00:36:24,957 --> 00:36:27,087
the person you wanted killed was...

577
00:36:27,423 --> 00:36:28,423
Ms. Ramphoei.

578
00:36:28,543 --> 00:36:29,683
That wretched woman.

579
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,080
That squanderer.

580
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,520
I killed her too late even.

581
00:37:16,803 --> 00:37:17,803
Help...

582
00:37:42,696 --> 00:37:43,696
You...

583
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,403
I killed her myself.

584
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:19,690
So there was no mistake.

585
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,160
I was glad

586
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,760
she died.

587
00:38:23,696 --> 00:38:24,696
That loose woman.

588
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,040
She would only taint
my fortune if she lived!

589
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:33,296
As for you...

590
00:38:35,497 --> 00:38:36,497
you should just die

591
00:38:37,203 --> 00:38:39,576
so the fortune will be mine
as it should have been.

592
00:38:47,497 --> 00:38:49,367
I sent a letter to Ms. Bu-nga.

593
00:38:49,789 --> 00:38:52,003
She's probably taking
the police to arrest you.

594
00:38:52,256 --> 00:38:54,709
You think people will believe
a mad woman like Bu-nga

595
00:38:54,782 --> 00:38:56,245
over a marquis like me?

596
00:38:56,642 --> 00:38:58,276
But Ms. Bu-nga was never mad.

597
00:39:01,197 --> 00:39:05,688

598
00:39:06,142 --> 00:39:10,629
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

599
00:39:11,197 --> 00:39:12,227
I was glad

600
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:13,827
she died.

601
00:39:14,763 --> 00:39:15,763
That loose woman.

602
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:19,107
She would only taint
my fortune if she lived!

603
00:39:23,243 --> 00:39:24,363
As for you...

604
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:27,564
you should just die

605
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,643
so the fortune will be mine
as it should have been.

606
00:39:33,597 --> 00:39:34,807
It's too late, Marquis!

607
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,760
Even if you kill all of us,

608
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,900
you won't get even one penny.

609
00:39:39,516 --> 00:39:40,516
What do you mean?

610
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,010
Before I came here,

611
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,300
I sent a letter to Ms. Bu-nga.

612
00:39:44,722 --> 00:39:46,936
She's probably taking
the police to arrest you.

613
00:39:50,683 --> 00:39:52,523
A mad woman like Bu-nga?

614
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,503
You think people will believe
a mad woman like Bu-nga

615
00:39:55,576 --> 00:39:57,039
over a marquis like me?

616
00:39:59,883 --> 00:40:02,120
Excuse me
for interrupting, Marquis.

617
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,920
But Ms. Bu-nga was never mad.

618
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,963
What do you mean?

619
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,943
I didn't understand it at first

620
00:40:14,536 --> 00:40:15,880
but now I do.

621
00:40:16,783 --> 00:40:18,493
Ms. Bu-nga pretended to be mad

622
00:40:18,889 --> 00:40:20,160
to fool you

623
00:40:24,775 --> 00:40:28,113
and wait for the day
to drag a wicked man like you

624
00:40:28,616 --> 00:40:30,120
to pay for his sins in prison.

625
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:32,066
You're a marquis

626
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:33,780
but you will die in prison.

627
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,700
How satisfying is that?

628
00:40:37,275 --> 00:40:38,275
Rerai.

629
00:40:38,623 --> 00:40:39,777
You have a smart mouth.

630
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:41,440
You'd better not live.

631
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,257
Rerai, come here.

632
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:02,830
Someone like me
will never be imprisoned.

633
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,683
But if that happens,
we'll all die here!

634
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:08,969
Don't worry about it.

635
00:41:10,157 --> 00:41:12,354
No one will arrest you.

636
00:41:12,843 --> 00:41:13,843
I promise.

637
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:16,800
Why did you say that?

638
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:23,460
Aside from Chaem and Ms. Ramphoei,

639
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:28,200
did you kill the viscount too?

640
00:41:33,817 --> 00:41:35,394
Why do you suspect me?

641
00:41:35,923 --> 00:41:37,227
Am I right, my lord?

642
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,290
We've got this far.

643
00:41:39,483 --> 00:41:42,120
It's no use for you to lie.

644
00:41:45,397 --> 00:41:46,707
Tell the truth, sir,

645
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:49,200
if you killed the viscount too.

646
00:41:53,977 --> 00:41:55,347
I have to thank you.

647
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:58,160
If you didn't paralyze him,

648
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:01,107
I wouldn't be able
to kill him with my own hands.

649
00:42:15,181 --> 00:42:17,300
Don't let anyone know
I'm here tonight.

650
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:18,583
Understood?

651
00:42:18,597 --> 00:42:19,597
Don't worry, my lord.

652
00:42:21,068 --> 00:42:23,101
I'll take care of things outside.

653
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,063
As for things inside the house...

654
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,647
Don't worry about things inside.

655
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:31,070
No one will know
your business in there.

656
00:42:56,577 --> 00:42:58,240
Please forgive me,

657
00:42:58,597 --> 00:42:59,597
my lord.

658
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,213
Dech can't go anywhere.

659
00:44:35,643 --> 00:44:37,414
Dech has to stay with me
as he vowed!

660
00:44:37,584 --> 00:44:40,507
I'm ready to fulfill the vow.

661
00:44:40,923 --> 00:44:42,414
I gave you, my lord.

662
00:44:42,717 --> 00:44:43,717
