"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 30)

19
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:00,469
If you're hungry

20
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:02,569
blink once.

21
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:05,242
If you're not, blink twice.

22
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,090
Can you do that for me?

23
00:02:11,562 --> 00:02:12,935
I've just eaten, Dech.

24
00:02:13,303 --> 00:02:14,423
Eat some more.

25
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,676
Just think of the baby inside you.

26
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:19,843
I did not get Fueang pregnant!

27
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:22,040
You two should stop lying!

28
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,587
- You wench!
- Ramphoei!

29
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:28,735
Trying to steal my man?

30
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:51,964
Ms. Malai.

31
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:53,470
Where are you going?

32
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,813
I'm going to see Bu-nga.

33
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,275
You don't usually go on this day.

34
00:02:58,769 --> 00:02:59,769
I changed my mind.

35
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:01,575
Is that a problem?

36
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,541
Ms. Malai, please don't do this.

37
00:03:03,814 --> 00:03:05,314
Won't you hear me out?

38
00:03:07,251 --> 00:03:09,090
I know why you're mad,

39
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:10,990
but I can explain.

40
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:26,372
Chaem's eavesdropping.

41
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,513
Let's go somewhere else.

42
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:39,932
Fine by me.

43
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:41,685
You lead the way.

44
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,980
She's pregnant with his child?

45
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,199
Everything that I said is the truth.

46
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:53,363
How's that possible?

47
00:03:53,876 --> 00:03:54,942
When did it happen?

48
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,829
It happened when he locked her up

49
00:03:58,103 --> 00:03:59,729
to question where we were hiding.

50
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:02,641
The Viscount doesn't like women.

51
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:04,564
He used the aphrodisiac powder

52
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,536
and...

53
00:04:11,474 --> 00:04:12,474
raped her.

54
00:04:15,446 --> 00:04:17,158
This is why I kept it a secret.

55
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:19,345
I dread for Fueang's dignity

56
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:20,997
and even more so,

57
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:23,168
her own safety.

58
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,905
Ms. Ramphoei.

59
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:27,962
Correct.

60
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:30,175
You know how she is.

61
00:04:42,044 --> 00:04:44,650
I'm glad you trust me, Ms. Malai.

62
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,047
You should rest.

63
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:04,061
You don't have to do this, Ma'am.

64
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:07,515
Let me care for you, just this once.

65
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,386
I made some healthy food for you.

66
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:15,663
Make sure you eat it.

67
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:18,400
It's good for both

68
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:19,807
both you and...

69
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:26,101
Thank you for being so kind, ma'am.

70
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:29,806
Dech told me the truth.

71
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:35,709
Is the baby truly the Viscount's?

72
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,437
I'm so sorry.

73
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:49,672
I'm truly sorry.

74
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:52,309
I caused you terrible experience.

75
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,443
I'm really sorry.

76
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:57,630
It's alright, ma'am.

77
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:00,223
It's really alright,

78
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:02,655
dear Ms. Malai.

79
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:29,416
Not only did he try to kill me,

80
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:33,526
but he also harmed the innocent.

81
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:43,695
Ms. Malai.

82
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:46,361
Ms. Malai!

83
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,844
I knew you're vile and despicable.

84
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:05,642
But I never imagined you'd stoop so low

85
00:07:06,223 --> 00:07:08,790
as to rape an innocent person!

86
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:12,060
You wretched,

87
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:13,220
despicable bastard!

88
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:16,540
Why did you do it?

89
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:20,986
You deserve to suffer tenfold.

90
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:25,672
Paralysis befits the likes of you!

91
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:31,208
You will pay for all your sins!

92
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:33,632
Viscount, my foot!

93
00:08:34,955 --> 00:08:37,267
Why did you come into my life?

94
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:40,720
Why, my lord?

95
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:50,133
Why subject me to all of this?

96
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,251
Can't you eavesdrop

97
00:09:24,378 --> 00:09:25,898
without getting caught?

98
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:27,672
Stupid, useless!

99
00:09:28,797 --> 00:09:30,317
I apologize, ma'am.

100
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:31,637
Then,

101
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,583
What's your next move?

102
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,499
Well, I know Dech won't join me

103
00:09:39,498 --> 00:09:40,777
and with Malai present,

104
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:43,014
the fortune that should be mine alone

105
00:09:43,054 --> 00:09:44,908
will be shared with her.

106
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:46,414
I can't bare it!

107
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,646
There's also Fueang and…

108
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:51,593
And who?

109
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:55,509
Are you talking about Kam and Uan?

110
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:57,139
Forget it.

111
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,757
It's quite sad,

112
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:01,283
no one at this estate likes you.

113
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:02,748
Chaem!

114
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:04,688
I know! You needn't say it.

115
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,271
Anyway, I don't like anyone here,

116
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:11,209
but there must be someone

117
00:10:11,502 --> 00:10:14,148
who could remove Dech and Malai.

118
00:10:16,678 --> 00:10:18,025
Can't think of anyone.

119
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,229
Chaem!

120
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,142
Yes, ma'am?

121
00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:26,548
Look after my baby.

122
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,375
Where are you going?

123
00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:41,115
Stop being nosy!

124
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:44,516
Iron my clothes.

125
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:46,929
I'll wear it when I go out.

126
00:10:57,921 --> 00:10:59,527
"Look after my baby."

127
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,067
You never do.

128
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:03,524
What a hypocrite.

129
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:19,294
So pretty...

130
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,860
This one's nice.

131
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:24,439
Oh my, it's perfect!

132
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,430
What brings you to my estate?

133
00:11:37,946 --> 00:11:39,880
The reason why I'm here

134
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:42,670
is because I need your help to kick Ma-

135
00:11:45,117 --> 00:11:47,092
Ms. Malai and Dech out.

136
00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:49,208
Why should I do that?

137
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:53,965
I believe they are having an affair

138
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:55,775
while plotting together to take over

139
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,400
the Viscount's fortune.

140
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,502
If the Count can fulfill my request,

141
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:06,345
I'll give you Mueang's share

142
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,343
as payment for your work.

143
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:10,809
I know that...

144
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:13,250
you received nothing

145
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,735
as inheritance from the Marquis.

146
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,227
Contrary to your belief,

147
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:18,700
I didn't want any of his fortune.

148
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:22,452
Is it possible?

149
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:25,405
To be good and not greedy for fortune?

150
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:28,173
As far as I know,

151
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,138
you may be the mistress' son,

152
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,860
but you still share his blood.

153
00:12:34,302 --> 00:12:36,295
Yet he shared nothing with you...

154
00:12:37,002 --> 00:12:38,456
Do you not feel any resentment

155
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,622
towards the Viscount?

156
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:42,758
You're as vile and

157
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:44,463
vicious as they all say.

158
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,325
I didn't think that you would...

159
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:50,128
Have the nerve to drag me into this!

160
00:12:56,644 --> 00:12:58,530
Never set foot inside my estate.

161
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,557
You're not welcome here.

162
00:13:05,797 --> 00:13:07,777
As if I want to be here.

163
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,618
Such good Samaritans.

164
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:12,918
I'll just do it myself.

165
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,361
Have you reconciled with her?

166
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:35,768
I haven't seen Ms. Malai at all today.

167
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:37,674
I was quite busy.

168
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:39,547
Why do you ask?

169
00:13:44,454 --> 00:13:46,560
I've told her everything.

170
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:48,889
Fueang.

171
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,815
She might be swayed

172
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,361
by Ms. Ramphoei's words,

173
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,785
but I'm confident she'll trust mine.

174
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:58,735
I don't want the two people

175
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,973
I care about to fight.

176
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:04,997
Thank you Fueang.

177
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:10,082
Ms. Ramphoei

178
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:11,656
is infuriating.

179
00:14:11,957 --> 00:14:13,676
She keeps stirring up trouble.

180
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:15,892
Why can't she leave us alone?

181
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:18,982
Dech.

182
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:20,169
Can you just give her

183
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,419
her share of money and kick her out

184
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:24,898
so we can finally get some peace?

185
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:27,814
I'll look for a way.

186
00:14:28,495 --> 00:14:29,495
You should rest.

00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:12,632
I must have done bad things

190
00:16:12,657 --> 00:16:13,757
to you in my past life.

191
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,236
It must be why

192
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,207
I can't help but take care of you.

193
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:37,443
What do you need?

194
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:43,882
Can you repeat that?

195
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:50,488
Oh.

196
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:52,495
I'll return shortly.

197
00:17:11,645 --> 00:17:13,151
Ms. Malai, what are you doing?

198
00:17:15,219 --> 00:17:16,112
Dech.

199
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:45,443
Oh, hello ma'am.

200
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:47,083
What would you like today?

201
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:48,877
Expensive foreign liquor.

202
00:17:49,229 --> 00:17:50,229
Certainly.

203
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:51,372
Good.

204
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:53,408
Also, serve me four or five sides.

205
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:55,185
Hurry along.

206
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:56,736
- Yes, ma'am.
- I hate waiting.

207
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:12,697
I was wiping him down,

208
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:14,994
but I didn't bring enough cloth.

209
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:18,214
I'm currently searching.

210
00:18:20,314 --> 00:18:22,677
I should leave some here as spares.

211
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:26,548
I'll fetch it for you.

212
00:18:27,469 --> 00:18:28,290
Thank you.

213
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:29,952
My pleasure.

214
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:18,847
Ms. Malai.

215
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,247
Why the look?

216
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:24,971
Still mad at me?

217
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,813
No,

218
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,295
just worried about Fueang.

219
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:30,796
It's my fault he forced himself on her

220
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:33,611
and got her pregnant.

221
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,563
Don't blame yourself, Ms. Malai.

222
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:40,777
If you do,

223
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,979
I must share the blame as well.

224
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:46,691
Thanks, Dech.

225
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:49,657
I promise

226
00:19:50,054 --> 00:19:50,944
I'll take good care

227
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:52,130
of Fueang and her baby.

228
00:19:52,342 --> 00:19:54,911
I won't let Ramphoei hurt them.

229
00:19:55,412 --> 00:19:57,167
Do you worry about this too?

230
00:20:12,998 --> 00:20:14,247
Thank you, ma'am.

231
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:30,809
Careful, ma'am.

232
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:32,408
You're very drunk.

233
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:33,772
This isn't safe.

234
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:35,505
Looks like...

235
00:20:35,722 --> 00:20:36,882
I should take you home.

236
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:43,805
Not in the mood!

237
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:44,906
Go away.

238
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:37,599
Why did he say that?

239
00:21:39,322 --> 00:21:40,320
I'm not afraid!

240
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,453
Don't think I'm stupid.

241
00:21:42,658 --> 00:21:44,087
You and Ms. Ramphoei conspired

242
00:21:44,347 --> 00:21:46,395
to hurt him, and now he's paralyzed.

243
00:21:47,184 --> 00:21:50,110
It's the same with hiding
the fact she's still alive!

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,193
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

246
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:08,592
Careful, ma'am.

247
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:10,191
You're very drunk.

248
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,555
This isn't safe.

249
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,288
Looks like...

250
00:22:13,505 --> 00:22:14,665
I should take you home.

251
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:21,588
Not in the mood!

252
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,689
Go away.

253
00:23:38,846 --> 00:23:40,238
No way, How's that possible?

254
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:43,719
What's the matter?

255
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,833
You, ma'am.

256
00:23:51,106 --> 00:23:52,557
Stop with that look,

257
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:54,634
I won't do anything to your servant.

258
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:56,833
Fueang.

259
00:23:56,858 --> 00:23:57,724
What's wrong?

260
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,376
Chaem's dead, ma'am.

261
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:01,743
What?

262
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:04,048
An official announced it this morning.

263
00:24:04,295 --> 00:24:07,256
Someone found her corpse by the road.

264
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:10,055
Poor soul.

265
00:24:10,943 --> 00:24:11,943
This is so sudden.

266
00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:16,195
She might have crossed the wrong folks

267
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:18,403
with an attitude like her mistress.

268
00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:20,289
Fueang! You...

269
00:24:20,443 --> 00:24:22,273
Are you picking a fight?

270
00:24:24,465 --> 00:24:26,623
You must be happy Chaem's dead.

271
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:28,292
Listen well,

272
00:24:28,443 --> 00:24:30,710
if I know it's part of your scheme

273
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:32,215
to get rid of me!

274
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:35,149
I won't let you win so easily.

275
00:24:36,532 --> 00:24:37,652
Good for you

276
00:24:38,016 --> 00:24:39,819
to know everyone here hates you.

277
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:41,390
That's enough, Fueang.

278
00:25:14,288 --> 00:25:15,288
Dech!

279
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:21,290
Why are you here this early?

280
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:22,927
Don't act like you don't know.

281
00:25:23,226 --> 00:25:25,291
Was it you who killed Chaem?

282
00:25:27,686 --> 00:25:28,943
What did you say?

283
00:25:32,068 --> 00:25:33,108
Chaem's dead?

284
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:38,648
You think I did it, don't you?

285
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:40,071
Who else would it be

286
00:25:40,276 --> 00:25:41,289
if not you?

287
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:42,849
You're the only one

288
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,476
who wants me gone from here!

289
00:25:44,575 --> 00:25:45,932
I'm not the Viscount

290
00:25:46,055 --> 00:25:48,551
who killed people left and right.

291
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,498
You must think you can hog

292
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:53,608
all the fortune for your wives?

293
00:25:54,508 --> 00:25:55,574
You're going too far.

294
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:56,721
Who knows?

295
00:25:56,874 --> 00:25:58,061
It won't be long before

296
00:25:58,077 --> 00:25:59,221
I unveil that mask

297
00:25:59,245 --> 00:26:01,512
and reveal how evil you truly are.

298
00:26:36,653 --> 00:26:37,980
Ms. Malai.

299
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,980
Ms. Malai.

300
00:26:49,784 --> 00:26:50,903
Oh, Fueang.

301
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:52,422
When did you…?

302
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,636
I'm already here, before you returned.

303
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:57,435
Is something the matter, Ms. Malai?

304
00:26:57,642 --> 00:26:58,876
You look dazed.

305
00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:00,873
What's on your mind?

306
00:27:02,306 --> 00:27:04,026
When was the last time you saw Chaem?

307
00:27:07,374 --> 00:27:08,374
I...

308
00:27:13,835 --> 00:27:15,696
- Ah!
- I'm sorry!

309
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:18,997
Chaem!

310
00:27:19,508 --> 00:27:20,315
What?

311
00:27:20,322 --> 00:27:21,288
Here we go again.

312
00:27:23,872 --> 00:27:24,872
If you're free,

313
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,902
you should stay home and take care of

314
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:28,400
your mistress' child, Ms. Chaem.

315
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:30,292
You even

316
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,852
dare wear your mistress' clothes.

317
00:27:33,212 --> 00:27:35,418
Ms. Ramphoei'd be furious if she knew.

318
00:27:35,703 --> 00:27:36,627
Why?

319
00:27:37,432 --> 00:27:38,913
I'm not scared.

320
00:27:40,469 --> 00:27:41,990
She's very nice to me.

321
00:27:42,323 --> 00:27:43,830
She won't mind about the clothes.

322
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,097
Want to bet?

323
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,675
I'll tell her right now because

324
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:48,747
I want to know too.

325
00:27:48,904 --> 00:27:49,744
Wait!

326
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:51,150
You're just jealous.

327
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:52,744
You're acting like a bully

328
00:27:52,816 --> 00:27:54,530
because my mistress is nice to me.

329
00:27:55,658 --> 00:27:57,178
If she's kind, why were you

330
00:27:57,358 --> 00:27:59,491
afraid when I called you out?

331
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:04,061
Fine!

332
00:28:04,235 --> 00:28:05,762
I stole Ms. Ramphoei's clothes.

333
00:28:05,924 --> 00:28:06,924
Happy?

334
00:28:08,776 --> 00:28:10,056
I'll only wear them to

335
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:11,010
watch the musical.

336
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:12,430
Just don't tell her.

337
00:28:12,665 --> 00:28:13,665
Oh, I don't know.

338
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,531
That'll depend on you.

339
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:18,708
Alright, I won't bother you for a while.

340
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,722
That's it, laters.

341
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,331
Envious, eh?

342
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:38,866
That's what happened, Ms. Malai.

343
00:28:39,387 --> 00:28:40,907
Why are you asking?

344
00:28:42,423 --> 00:28:43,391
That means

345
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,116
Chaem wore her clothes to the musical.

346
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:48,358
Yes.

347
00:28:49,435 --> 00:28:51,576
Looks like the killer
targeted Ms. Ramphoei,

348
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,267
and Chaem was the unlucky victim.

349
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:55,824
Good grief!

350
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:02,080
Yesterday was Ms. Ramphoei.

351
00:29:02,412 --> 00:29:03,526
Today, it's Ms. Malai.

352
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:06,072
Did she come to see you?

353
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:09,637
She came seeking help
to evict you and Dech.

354
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,406
She even offered Mueang's fortune to me.

355
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:17,249
Don't make that face.

356
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,992
I sent her away before
she could finish the sentence.

357
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:23,946
You have my gratitude.

358
00:29:24,227 --> 00:29:26,113
I know you both are good people.

359
00:29:26,326 --> 00:29:28,793
I can entrust my brother to you two.

360
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:31,531
So don't worry about Ms. Ramphoei.

361
00:29:31,848 --> 00:29:34,507
If she causes trouble, I'll assist you.

362
00:29:36,965 --> 00:29:40,070
There's been trouble since
the Viscount became paralyzed.

363
00:29:40,397 --> 00:29:42,430
Servants turned up dead,

364
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:44,871
like Saeng, and now Chaem.

365
00:29:46,742 --> 00:29:47,942
Poor Viscount,

366
00:29:48,007 --> 00:29:50,479
young and healthy, suddenly fell

367
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:51,949
down the stairs at night,

368
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:53,760
found by Dech the next morning.

369
00:29:55,104 --> 00:29:56,464
What do you mean?

370
00:29:57,193 --> 00:29:59,717
Can the Count elaborate for me?

371
00:30:01,404 --> 00:30:02,650
Dech told me…

372
00:30:03,517 --> 00:30:04,229
I reckon

373
00:30:04,231 --> 00:30:05,761
he fell down the stairs last night.

374
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,812
I found him at dawn

375
00:30:08,165 --> 00:30:10,311
when I came to check on things.

376
00:30:11,457 --> 00:30:12,352
Dech sent him to

377
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:13,785
the hospital immediately,

378
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,839
but it was too late.

379
00:30:15,454 --> 00:30:16,915
The Viscount is pitiful.

380
00:30:21,815 --> 00:30:22,815
Well...

381
00:30:23,392 --> 00:30:25,259
Is Ms. Ranchuan not home?

382
00:30:27,115 --> 00:30:29,834
She's been observing
the rites at the temple.

383
00:30:30,054 --> 00:30:31,230
She'll be back soon.

384
00:30:31,517 --> 00:30:32,550
Is everything alright?

385
00:30:33,022 --> 00:30:35,993
It's fine. Please send her my regards.

386
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:49,162
That night, he worked until late.

387
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,100
My lord!

388
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:58,691
My lord!

389
00:30:58,770 --> 00:30:59,770
My lord!

390
00:31:01,113 --> 00:31:02,113
Even though

391
00:31:02,225 --> 00:31:04,998
I had Kam and Uan call on the doctor,

392
00:31:05,285 --> 00:31:06,485
it was all too late.

393
00:31:12,028 --> 00:31:13,735
Why did he say that?

394
00:31:15,325 --> 00:31:16,325
I'm not afraid!

395
00:31:16,652 --> 00:31:18,458
Don't think I'm stupid.

396
00:31:18,663 --> 00:31:20,092
You and Ms. Ramphoei conspired

397
00:31:20,352 --> 00:31:22,400
to hurt him, and now he's paralyzed.

398
00:31:23,189 --> 00:31:26,115
It's the same with hiding
the fact she's still alive!

399
00:31:54,637 --> 00:31:56,317
Where did you go today?

400
00:31:56,723 --> 00:31:57,990
Even Fueang was clueless.

401
00:31:58,698 --> 00:32:00,618
I made offerings to Chaem and Saeng,

402
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:02,527
and took the time to

403
00:32:02,585 --> 00:32:04,087
pray and meditate as well.

404
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:07,455
You should've told me.

405
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:09,195
I'd accompany you.

406
00:32:10,123 --> 00:32:11,216
It's alright.

407
00:32:11,582 --> 00:32:13,288
You've got a lot on your plate.

408
00:32:13,401 --> 00:32:15,468
I need to clean myself up, see you.

409
00:32:27,324 --> 00:32:28,604
Don't trust Dech!

410
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:30,678
Don't trust Dech!

411

412
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:44,220
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

413
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:01,297
Ms. Malai, what are you doing?

414
00:33:03,365 --> 00:33:04,365
Dech.

415
00:33:27,926 --> 00:33:28,926
I promise

416
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,180
I'll take good care

417
00:33:30,187 --> 00:33:31,366
of Fueang and her baby.

418
00:33:31,657 --> 00:33:34,226
I won't let Ramphoei hurt them.

419
00:33:34,648 --> 00:33:36,403
Do you worry about this too?

420
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:44,718
Ms. Malai.

421
00:33:45,073 --> 00:33:47,005
This is bad, very bad!

422
00:33:47,371 --> 00:33:48,457
Who is it this time?

423
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,755
Downstairs, Ms. Ramphoei is going crazy.

424
00:33:51,657 --> 00:33:52,683
Her again.

425
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,003
Lead the way.

426
00:33:54,144 --> 00:33:55,144
Yes.

427
00:33:56,523 --> 00:33:57,523
Chaem!

428
00:33:57,591 --> 00:33:59,464
Serve me some liquor!

429
00:34:01,142 --> 00:34:02,142
Chaem!

430
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:09,166
Chaem's dead.

431
00:34:15,706 --> 00:34:17,066
You killed Chaem.

432
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:18,676
You beast!

433
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:20,729
Hiding your claws behind your back!

434
00:34:23,257 --> 00:34:26,003
- I offered my help but she resisted.
- Scumbag!

435
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:27,531
I can't stand her.

436
00:34:28,113 --> 00:34:29,179
Uan, that's enough.

437
00:34:30,127 --> 00:34:31,307
There's a saying,

438
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:33,662
"One can't reason with a drunkard."

439
00:34:37,711 --> 00:34:38,785
How could you...

440
00:34:38,885 --> 00:34:40,342
How could you kill her?

441
00:34:40,443 --> 00:34:41,443
Let's go.

442
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:44,869
Ms. Ramphoei, I'll take you to bed.

443
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,562
Let go. Let me go!

444
00:34:48,897 --> 00:34:49,717
Careful, ma'am.

445
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:52,930
Look at you.

446
00:34:53,697 --> 00:34:56,817
The Mother Teresa of this estate!

447
00:34:57,807 --> 00:34:58,807
Let's go.

448
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:00,207
Uan, give me a hand.

449
00:35:00,884 --> 00:35:02,025
I'll hold her.

450
00:35:02,192 --> 00:35:03,392
Let go, I said!

451
00:35:03,445 --> 00:35:04,445
Let me go!

452
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:06,657
Malai! Let me go!

453
00:35:07,704 --> 00:35:09,897
Stop acting all nice, Malai.

454
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:11,427
I know, you already

455
00:35:11,452 --> 00:35:12,940
figured out everything!

456
00:35:13,046 --> 00:35:14,108
Shut up

457
00:35:14,132 --> 00:35:15,413
and come with me!

458
00:35:16,044 --> 00:35:18,570
You'll disturb the Viscount
with your constant yelling.

459
00:35:18,914 --> 00:35:20,081
Let him hear it.

460
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:22,205
Let the Viscount bear witness

461
00:35:22,293 --> 00:35:24,085
to how you all are

462
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:25,636
scheming to harm me!

463
00:35:25,973 --> 00:35:27,598
After the Viscount, it's Saeng.

464
00:35:27,862 --> 00:35:29,542
After that, it's Chaem,

465
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,493
and then it'll be my turn.

466
00:35:31,518 --> 00:35:32,406
Right?

467
00:35:33,738 --> 00:35:35,133
Don't listen to her, Ms. Malai.

468
00:35:35,157 --> 00:35:36,838
She's drunk and talking nonsense.

469
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:40,223
Answer me!

470
00:35:40,664 --> 00:35:42,110
You need to stop, Ramphoei!

471
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:45,042
You may have take away my people,

472
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:46,709
but remember,

473
00:35:47,182 --> 00:35:49,275
I, Ramphoei,

474
00:35:49,569 --> 00:35:51,741
won't go down easily!

475
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:54,580
Uan,

476
00:35:54,628 --> 00:35:55,834
You should go.

477
00:35:55,973 --> 00:35:57,073
I'll take care of it.

478
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,943
Ms. Malai should let her
sleep on the floor for this.

479
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,790
Ramphoei!

480
00:36:05,321 --> 00:36:06,307
Go to your room.

481
00:36:06,763 --> 00:36:07,763
Let go!

482
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,289
I'm not done talking.

483
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:10,777
Let me remind you.

484
00:36:10,925 --> 00:36:14,566
It's 'an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth' for me.

485
00:36:14,937 --> 00:36:16,617
If you're aiming at my life,

486
00:36:17,018 --> 00:36:18,538
I'll aim for yours too!

487
00:36:22,169 --> 00:36:23,489
Rest assured, Ramphoei,

488
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:25,975
I may not like you,

489
00:36:26,303 --> 00:36:28,081
but I don't wish to kill you.

490
00:36:30,463 --> 00:36:31,582
Since you said it,

491
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,184
I'll trust your words.

492
00:36:34,623 --> 00:36:36,385
But I won't trust the others!

493
00:36:37,632 --> 00:36:38,838
Heavens above,

494
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:41,631
I'll cast a curse upon them.

495
00:36:42,092 --> 00:36:44,513
Whoever wishes to kill me

496
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,535
shall face woe and despair,

497
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:49,259
finding no solace

498
00:36:49,786 --> 00:36:51,725
until their descendants are no more!

499
00:36:51,771 --> 00:36:52,931
That's enough, Ramphoei!

500
00:36:54,531 --> 00:36:55,531
Let me go!

501
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,490
Stop and let go!

502
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:21,980
Can I help you, Ms. Malai?

503
00:37:22,665 --> 00:37:24,120
Why did your story about

504
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:26,537
my lord's fall differ from
what you told the Count?

505
00:37:28,503 --> 00:37:29,509
What do you mean?

506
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:30,902
I don't understand.

507
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:33,729
You told the Count
you found him at dawn.

508
00:37:33,969 --> 00:37:35,343
But you told me

509
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,349
you were with him when he fell.

510
00:37:37,663 --> 00:37:38,929
Which one is the truth?

511
00:37:39,203 --> 00:37:41,369
You're being manipulated
again, aren't you?

512
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:45,278
Is it Ms. Ramphoei?

513
00:37:45,356 --> 00:37:46,709
It's not about her.

514
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,355
I want to know for myself.

515
00:37:48,398 --> 00:37:50,130
Ms. Malai, does this mean

516
00:37:50,346 --> 00:37:52,485
you no longer trust me?

517
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:54,940
Dech, this isn't about trust.

518
00:37:56,578 --> 00:37:57,584
I simply want...

519
00:37:58,355 --> 00:38:00,407
I want to hear the truth from you, Dech.

520
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:02,445
The truth is,

521
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:04,384
My lord fell and became paralyzed.

522
00:38:04,586 --> 00:38:05,592
When the Count asked,

523
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,072
I was still grieving.

524
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:08,426
I might have been confused

525
00:38:08,434 --> 00:38:09,634
and misspoken.

526
00:38:11,696 --> 00:38:13,115
I'm very hurt.

527
00:38:13,384 --> 00:38:14,917
It seems you no longer trust me.

528
00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:16,095
Dech.

529
00:38:16,887 --> 00:38:17,993
If you'll excuse me.

530
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:20,519
I don't wish to become more hurt.

531
00:38:22,872 --> 00:38:23,872
Dech.

532
00:39:12,535 --> 00:39:14,081
I've locked the door.

533
00:39:14,168 --> 00:39:16,812
No one will know what we talk about.

534
00:39:18,696 --> 00:39:20,563
What do you want to tell me?

535
00:39:57,089 --> 00:39:58,089
D

536
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:05,335
O

537
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:22,760
N

538
00:40:28,871 --> 00:40:30,057
Don't...

539
00:40:47,785 --> 00:40:48,785
T

540
00:41:01,928 --> 00:41:03,044

U

542
00:41:10,127 --> 00:41:11,127
Tru-

S

544
00:41:26,337 --> 00:41:27,337
Don't trus?

545
00:41:42,755 --> 00:41:44,281
- T.
- Don't trust.

546
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:00,138
D

547
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:14,625

Don't trust Dech!

Don't trust Dech!

551
