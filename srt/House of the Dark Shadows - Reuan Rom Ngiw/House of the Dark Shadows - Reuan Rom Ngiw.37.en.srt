"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 37)

19
00:02:10,557 --> 00:02:11,557
Fire.

20
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,356
Young Master Mueang?
Where are you taking him?

21
00:04:22,243 --> 00:04:24,397
Come back to your present, Mai.

22
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,933
You saw everything.

23
00:04:29,242 --> 00:04:31,242
Now you know...

24
00:04:32,043 --> 00:04:33,043
who...

25
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,610
killed me.

26
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:02,960
(1940)

27
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:06,276
You're the man who almost drowned
at the Dark Shadow House, right?

28
00:05:06,896 --> 00:05:08,306
You knew about that?

29
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,967
What were you doing there?

30
00:05:10,488 --> 00:05:14,440
I was investigating the murders
of my parents that happened there.

31
00:05:14,877 --> 00:05:16,624
What are your parents' names?

32
00:05:28,003 --> 00:05:29,286
My father's name is Sing.

33
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:32,477
My mother's name is Thapthim.

34
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:34,343
I never heard of them.

35
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:38,592
We've been talking for a while.
What's your name, young man?

36
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:40,319
So I can address me correctly.

37
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:41,633
My name is Mai.

38
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:47,746
You asked as if you knew
people there very well.

39
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,420
Before I was ordained,

40
00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:51,200
my name was Dech.

41
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,933
I was a servant there.

42
00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:10,927
After the fire
that killed people there,

43
00:06:11,097 --> 00:06:13,603
I've been ordained ever since.

44
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,547
Did you get ordained to make up
for your sin against Ms. Malai?

45
00:06:20,517 --> 00:06:21,773
You knew Ms. Malai?

46
00:06:21,976 --> 00:06:23,416
My parents told me about her.

47
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:24,783
Yes.

48
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:26,530
I got ordained for Ms. Malai.

49
00:06:28,157 --> 00:06:32,073
Because after she died,
her spirit is still at the house

50
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:33,497
and she hasn't been reborn.

51
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:37,410
Ms. Malai's spirit is probably
furious and vengeful toward

52
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:39,226
the person who wronged her.

53
00:06:39,742 --> 00:06:40,742
I suppose so.

54
00:06:41,476 --> 00:06:42,759
If I could,

55
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:46,100
I'd like to find the person
who hurt Ms. Malai.

56
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:48,742
So she could rest in peace.

57
00:06:50,814 --> 00:06:53,256
Have you known or heard the name...

58
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:55,202
"Mueang"?

59
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,335
Young Master Mueang,

60
00:06:59,915 --> 00:07:01,262
please be my hostage for now.

61
00:07:06,783 --> 00:07:08,120
Is something wrong?

62
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:09,340
No.

63
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,207
I've never met anyone
called Mueang.

64
00:07:11,577 --> 00:07:13,054
What about Kam and Uan?

65
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,490
Have you heard of them?

66
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:19,240
They were also the servants
at the Dark Shadow House.

67
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:20,703
They stole my...

68
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:25,057
Young Master Mueang.

69
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:27,867
What got me curious is

70
00:07:29,123 --> 00:07:30,587
how his Buddha amulet

71
00:07:31,176 --> 00:07:32,400
ended up with you.

72
00:08:53,063 --> 00:08:54,063
Ms. Malai?

73
00:08:55,103 --> 00:08:56,103
Ms. Malai?

74
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:06,623
Ms. Malai?

75
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:07,957
Ms. Malai?

76
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:13,437
Ms. Malai?

77
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:15,440
Please come out and talk to me.

78
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:33,556
Ms. Malai?

79
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:36,040
I'm not talking to liars like you!

80
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,650
Ms. Malai, no!

81
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,930
Venerable Brother,

82
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,580
please stop trying
to talk to Ms. Malai.

83
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:09,234
It's been years.

84
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,506
She's still blinded by vengeance.

85
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:15,286
She won't listen to anyone.

86
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:17,209
Not even me.

87
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,440
If I knew it would be like this,

88
00:10:21,176 --> 00:10:23,963
you should have
let me die back then,

89
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:26,120
Venerable Brother...

90
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,429
Dying with someone you love...

91
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,067
is better than suffering like this.

92
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,927
You can't die yet.

93
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:36,360
Ms. Malai's killer
is still at large.

94
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:38,507
You have to catch them.

95
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,241
So Ms. Malai stops
misunderstanding you.

96
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,423
How is it going, officer?

97
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:21,200
He wouldn't answer any questions.

98
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,536
He keeps crying.

99
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:38,600
Here, take it. Take more money.

100
00:11:39,813 --> 00:11:40,966
Make sure it's enough.

101
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:45,040
Just find Kam and Uan for me.

102
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:48,056
If anyone finds them,

103
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:50,330
I'll give you more.

104
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:52,037
Take it all.

105
00:11:53,153 --> 00:11:54,153
Get going.

106
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,070
Dech.

107
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:06,900
When will you stop wasting money?

108
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,753
What am I supposed to do?

109
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,027
You want me to stop
looking for Mueang,

110
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,793
my only child?

111
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,546
You know very well...

112
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:18,233
I have no one else.

113
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:20,542
Not my child.

114
00:12:21,163 --> 00:12:22,502
Not the woman I loved.

115
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:40,723
And you went broke

116
00:12:42,156 --> 00:12:43,469
and had to become a monk.

117
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:48,079
At least I tried my best
to find my only child.

118
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:50,932
And I remain a monk

119
00:12:51,628 --> 00:12:54,293
because I want to
transfer my merit to Ms. Malai.

120
00:12:54,762 --> 00:12:55,762
Venerable Brother...

121
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,143
In case one day...

122
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:00,206
Ms. Malai will forgive me.

123
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:03,703
So she stops being angry
and trying to take revenge.

124
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:08,056
And what I want the most is...

125
00:13:08,348 --> 00:13:10,441
I want Ms. Malai's spirit...

126
00:13:11,974 --> 00:13:13,680
to go to a good plane of existence.

127
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:15,679
I don't want your merit,

128
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:16,869
Dech!

129
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:50,956
You're going back
to Ayutthaya right now?

130
00:13:51,176 --> 00:13:54,600
I'm going back to Ayutthaya
to investigate everything.

131
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:56,013
My parents

132
00:13:56,242 --> 00:13:57,242
and Mr. Mueang.

133
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:58,483
If I succeed,

134
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,483
we'll know the murderer's identity.

135
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:02,373
Good luck.

136
00:14:07,968 --> 00:14:09,927
You going back
to Ayutthaya all alone

137
00:14:10,302 --> 00:14:11,907
without an assistant,

138
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,650
is that a good idea?

139
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,290
The outfit the countess ordered.

140
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:22,027
Thanks very much, Kathi.

141
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:24,810
Uh, my mother's not here.

142
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:26,396
How much? I'll pay for it.

143
00:14:26,793 --> 00:14:27,793
No need.

144
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,057
The countess already paid me.

145
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:31,654
Lieutenant,

146
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:33,914
do you want souvenirs
from Ayutthaya?

147
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,287
You're taking a trip?

148
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:38,036
No, Rerai asked me
to accompany her

149
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:40,148
to prevent gossip

150
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,636
about her going there with
a male stranger on her own.

151
00:14:43,022 --> 00:14:44,173
What do you mean?

152
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:46,469
Rerai's new friend called Mai

153
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,640
has some business in Ayutthaya.

154
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:50,800
Rerai is tagging along.

155
00:14:54,803 --> 00:14:55,803
Lieutenant,

156
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,926
so do you want anything?
I'll get them for you.

157
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:01,327
It's okay. I don't want to impose.

158
00:15:01,756 --> 00:15:03,897
Please take care of Rerai for me.

159
00:15:06,283 --> 00:15:07,283
Oh?

160
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,970
(Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya)

161
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,090
Young Master Mai!

162
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,470
It's really you.

163
00:15:19,903 --> 00:15:22,633
Why didn't you send a telegram
that you were coming back?

164
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:24,764
I left abruptly.

165
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:29,903
Are they your guests?

166
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,727
Yes, please set up a room for them.

167
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:35,116
Yes, sir.

168
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,690
He's back.

169
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,820
Great.

170
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,100
It's been a long journey.

171
00:15:40,363 --> 00:15:41,547
Let's relax inside.

172
00:15:41,663 --> 00:15:43,023
Then I'll go ahead.

173
00:15:55,023 --> 00:15:56,423
Kathi, wait for me!

174
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,920
Didn't Rerai tell you

175
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,353
she was going to Ayutthaya
with Mai and Kathi?

176
00:16:08,682 --> 00:16:09,733
What?

177
00:16:10,316 --> 00:16:11,327
How did you know?

178
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:14,190
Kathi went by yesterday
to drop off my mother's outfit.

179
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,399
She said she was going
to Ayutthaya with Rerai

180
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,084
because it would look bad
if Rerai went with Mai alone.

181
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,947
I thought you knew.

182
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,210
Lieutenant,

183
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,444
come to Ayutthaya with me today.

184
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:31,550
- What? But...
- No but.

185
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:33,473
I'll get Rerai home no matter what.

186
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,730
Yes, ma'am.

187
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,243
Watch out, Rerai!

188
00:16:40,437 --> 00:16:41,437
Go!

191
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,107
Please forgive me, Ms. Malai.

192
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:14,820
Uan and I had to do it.

193
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,246
I'm sorry, Ms. Malai.

194
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:23,985
If you tell the police
the viscount was poisoned

195
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:27,499
and both of us get arrested,
who's gonna raise Mai?

196
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:30,989
Please understand me, Ms. Malai.

197
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:37,800
You're hiding here.

198
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:39,156
I've looked everywhere.

199
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:42,440
Hey, wait.

200
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,542
You can tell me...

201
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,179
if something's bothering you.

202
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:55,313
We've got this far.

203
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:57,166
We have to help each other.

204
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:00,426
I noticed that

205
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:03,220
when we first got here,
you looked okay.

206
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:05,173
And you suddenly changed.

207
00:18:05,422 --> 00:18:06,422
What happened?

208
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,617
I don't know if I should
talk to you about this.

209
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,390
Eh?

210
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:14,416
If you don't talk,
how do I know if it's good or bad?

211
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,963
Try me.

212
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:18,023
I'm happy to listen.

213
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:21,337
Well...

214
00:18:22,617 --> 00:18:24,117
I feel like...

215
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:28,800
Over the years,
I didn't know my parents at all.

216
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:31,447
I never thought they would be...

217
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,530
bad people.

218
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:38,797
How were they bad?

219
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:40,952
All the money I have...

220
00:18:42,797 --> 00:18:43,797
isn't mine.

221
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,023
They stole it from someone else.

222
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,228
Everything was all a lie.

223
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:52,637
That might not be true.

224
00:18:52,884 --> 00:18:54,064
Don't assume.

225
00:18:54,771 --> 00:18:57,984
Do you have proof
that what you have isn't yours?

226
00:18:58,863 --> 00:18:59,863
I don't know.

227
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:01,497
That's why I came back here.

228
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:04,534
But the more I see what I have,

229
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:05,843
the surer I am

230
00:19:06,243 --> 00:19:08,110
that all this wasn't theirs.

231
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,570
What should I do?

232
00:19:14,883 --> 00:19:15,923
What's wrong?

233
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,790
Who are you?!

234
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,830
Take that! Take that!

235
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:37,360
Fire! Fire!

236
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:39,056
Run!

237
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:40,067
Watch out, Rerai!

238
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,843
Are you sure it's around here?

239
00:19:51,143 --> 00:19:53,716
I haven't seen a single house.

240
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,030
I'm sure, ma'am.

241
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,147
They said Mai was very rich.

242
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,330
He has a big house.

243
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:00,023
We can't miss it.

244
00:20:01,177 --> 00:20:02,930
Walk a little further.
We should find it.

245
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,080
Fire! Fire!

246
00:20:05,923 --> 00:20:07,010
Let's go, ma'am.

247
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:11,000
Where's the fire?
I don't see any fire.

248
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,596
Yeah, she's right.

249
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:14,248
There's not even smoke.

250
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,763
I saw suspicious men
at the pier earlier.

251
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:21,103
But if I yelled about a fight,
you guys wouldn't have come.

252
00:20:21,257 --> 00:20:22,257
Am I right?

253
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,819
Just people fighting?

254
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,256
Everyone, let's go home.
What a waste of time!

255
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:29,103
Hey, sir, don't go yet!

256
00:20:29,232 --> 00:20:31,212
Guys, don't go yet!

257
00:20:32,546 --> 00:20:33,546
Guys!

258
00:20:35,537 --> 00:20:37,000
- Kathi, what's going on?
- Kathi?

259
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,883
Lieutenant Rat? Fueang?

260
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:40,196
How did you get here?

261
00:20:40,383 --> 00:20:41,383
Where's Rerai?!

262
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,840
Rerai and Mai are being attacked.
They're over there.

263
00:20:46,153 --> 00:20:47,153
Let's go.

264
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,697
- Ow!
- Fueang!

265
00:20:50,843 --> 00:20:51,843
Fueang!

266
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,273
Lieutenant, I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.

267
00:20:53,283 --> 00:20:55,060
- Go help Rerai first. Hurry.
- Yes, ma'am.

268
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,196
Lieutenant, follow me.

269
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,983
- Rerai! Rerai!
- Mai!

270
00:21:14,603 --> 00:21:15,603
Take that!

271
00:21:15,677 --> 00:21:16,677
Rerai!

272
00:21:20,603 --> 00:21:21,603
Rerai!

273
00:21:21,683 --> 00:21:23,676
Rerai! Rerai!

274
00:21:24,537 --> 00:21:25,537
Rerai.

275
00:21:34,517 --> 00:21:35,517
Rerai!

276
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,528
Mai!

277
00:21:38,737 --> 00:21:39,870
Lieutenant, watch out!

278
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:43,903
You!

279
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,010
Lieutenant!

280
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,197
Hey, stop!

281
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,203
Don't you know who he is?

282
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,990
Lieutenant?
How are you doing, Lieutenant?

283
00:22:20,023 --> 00:22:21,130
Hey, stop!

284
00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:23,280
Hey, let's go!

285
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,530
Lieutenant?

286
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,830
Lieutenant, how are you doing?

287
00:22:31,843 --> 00:22:32,843
Easy.

288
00:23:13,463 --> 00:23:14,463
Rerai?

289
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,750
Rerai?

290
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,717
Rerai? Wake up, Rerai.

291
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:19,450
Rerai? Wake up, Rerai!

292
00:23:19,937 --> 00:23:20,937
Wake up!

293
00:23:22,493 --> 00:23:23,493
Forgive me.

294
00:23:31,457 --> 00:23:32,457
Rerai.

295
00:23:35,077 --> 00:23:36,077
Rerai.

296
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,310
What about...

297
00:23:40,203 --> 00:23:42,023
those guys? Where are they?

298
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:45,437
No idea. I saw you fall into water,
so I jumped in after you.

299
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:47,000
Then I brought you here.

300
00:23:50,023 --> 00:23:51,063
Are you okay?

301
00:23:52,617 --> 00:23:53,657
I'm fine now.

302
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,430
Uh, but I thought you can't swim.

303
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:59,027
You jumped in after me.

304
00:23:59,497 --> 00:24:00,497
Weren't you scared?

305
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:01,703
I forgot.

306
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:03,210
I wasn't thinking.

307
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:05,723
When I saw you fall,
I jumped in right away.

308
00:24:11,763 --> 00:24:12,763
Can you stand?

309
00:24:13,023 --> 00:24:14,023
Of course.

310
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,323
Rerai.

311
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:22,477
Don't force yourself.

312
00:24:23,143 --> 00:24:24,143
Just rest a bit.

313
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,720
Please be honest.

314
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,050
Are you in conflict with anyone?

315
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,030
I've never been in conflict
with anyone, especially here.

316
00:26:22,357 --> 00:26:23,384
Then it's strange.

317
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,483
My family's not in conflict
with anyone either.

318
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:27,763
Except for...

319
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,483
The Dark Shadow House.

320
00:26:33,303 --> 00:26:34,906
That piece of land
is very valuable.

321
00:26:35,403 --> 00:26:37,053
Someone might want me dead

322
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:38,880
or force me to sell it.

323
00:26:39,463 --> 00:26:42,240
Who would want
that house that much?

324
00:26:43,077 --> 00:26:45,800
Count Phichit once offered
to buy it from me.

325
00:26:47,056 --> 00:26:48,946
I've known that family
my entire life.

326
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:50,160
They're good people.

327
00:26:50,713 --> 00:26:51,713
No way.

328
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:53,557
Uh...

329
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,764
Who else do you suspect?

330
00:26:58,377 --> 00:26:59,907
My parents told me

331
00:27:00,057 --> 00:27:01,960
foreigners gave them an offer

332
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,800
but I don't know who.

333
00:27:04,383 --> 00:27:05,383
And...

334
00:27:05,977 --> 00:27:06,977
And what?

335
00:27:07,697 --> 00:27:08,697
Monk Dech.

336
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,130
Ridiculous.

337
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,150
You're insane.

338
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:13,410
You think Venerable Uncle
wants your fortune

339
00:27:13,421 --> 00:27:15,004
so much he sent
someone to hurt you?

340
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:17,422
Aren't you afraid of hell?

341
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,720
I couldn't help wondering.

342
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,150
Never mind.

343
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:27,074
Anyone would be suspicious.

344
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:31,426
I'm gonna get some sleep.

345
00:27:35,957 --> 00:27:38,600
I'm sorry
for getting you in trouble.

346
00:27:40,277 --> 00:27:41,277
Don't think like that.

347
00:27:42,423 --> 00:27:45,023
If I'm unlucky,
it's because of me.

348
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,216
I always got myself
into those situations.

349
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,150
You're right.

350
00:27:54,023 --> 00:27:57,120
But if it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have survived.

351
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,390
Thank you.

352
00:28:01,163 --> 00:28:02,163
You're welcome.

353
00:28:19,137 --> 00:28:20,944
Make sure Monk Dech gets punished.

354
00:28:21,337 --> 00:28:24,044
Don't let his depravity
taint monasticism.

355
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,080
Go back to the Dark Shadow House.

356
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:27,737
Find out the truth there.

357
00:28:28,197 --> 00:28:29,520
And bring Dech...

358
00:28:30,113 --> 00:28:31,440
to justice.

You killed me!

366

I'll never forgive you,

367
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,430
Dech!

00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,600
It really is you two.

372
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,360
You ingrates.

373
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:06,574
In the end, you couldn't
escape your karma.

374
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,483
Where did you put
Young Master Mueang?

375
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,770
Or were you so wicked

376
00:30:27,003 --> 00:30:28,683
you already killed him?

377
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,730
You're finally back.

378
00:30:50,477 --> 00:30:51,477
You ungrateful child.

379
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,906
Mom! Don't hit me!

380
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:58,786
Don't hit me! You're hurting me!

381
00:30:58,797 --> 00:31:00,870
- Mom!
- What are you doing this?!

382
00:31:01,747 --> 00:31:03,257
You ran off with a man here.

383
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:05,480
You were gone with him all night.

384
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,091
Don't think I'm not on to you.

385
00:31:07,514 --> 00:31:09,114
I didn't run off with Mai.

386
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:10,577
Kathi came with me.

387
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:13,423
Why did you think I was that easy?

388
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:16,339
Don't you talk back.

389
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:18,363
You slept with him, didn't you?

390
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:20,279
That's why you were gone all night.

391
00:31:20,686 --> 00:31:21,789
Please calm down.

392
00:31:21,826 --> 00:31:22,826
Don't interrupt me!

393
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:25,279
I was talking to my daughter.

394
00:31:25,699 --> 00:31:26,819
You're not involved.

395
00:31:32,077 --> 00:31:33,957
If you want me to be
Mai's wife so much,

396
00:31:34,623 --> 00:31:35,980
I'll do it for you.

397
00:31:36,537 --> 00:31:37,847
I slept with Mai.

398
00:31:38,684 --> 00:31:39,944
And we're getting married.

399
00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:45,763
Are you happy now?

400
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,423
Rerai!

401
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,743
What were you thinking
taking a girl out of town?

402
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,553
It's not what you think, ma'am.

403
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:09,400
Rerai and I...

404
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:11,266
We haven't gone that far.

405
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,566
You just hurt her feelings.

406
00:32:14,023 --> 00:32:15,190
She was being sarcastic.

407
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,193
I hope what you're saying is true.

408
00:32:17,589 --> 00:32:19,686
Because I want you
to leave Rerai alone.

409
00:32:20,175 --> 00:32:21,566
You're mad at me...

410
00:32:21,957 --> 00:32:24,281
because I'm Kam's
and Uan's son, right?

411
00:32:27,662 --> 00:32:29,946
How did you know Kam and Uan
were your parents?

412
00:32:30,522 --> 00:32:32,482
Let's just say I know
more than you think.

413
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:35,035
If you're still mad
about what my parents did,

414
00:32:35,449 --> 00:32:36,790
I can understand.

415
00:32:37,306 --> 00:32:39,421
Actually, Rerai is
the daughter of...

416
00:32:39,431 --> 00:32:40,431
Stop talking!

417
00:32:44,017 --> 00:32:46,240
I'm trying to make amends
for my parents.

418
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,770
If I could,

419
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,840
I'd like to give everyone justice.

420
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:52,083
No need.

421
00:32:52,323 --> 00:32:53,713
Don't give me anything.

422
00:32:54,137 --> 00:32:55,720
I want only one thing from you.

423
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,874
Just leave Rerai alone.

424
00:33:22,777 --> 00:33:23,777
It's okay.

425
00:33:24,243 --> 00:33:25,243
I can do it myself.

426
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,720
Don't worry about it.

427
00:33:30,243 --> 00:33:33,220
She was just angry
you didn't tell her your plan.

428
00:33:33,337 --> 00:33:34,337
If I told her,

429
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,243
would she let me come?

430
00:33:36,469 --> 00:33:37,653
She would stop you

431
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,417
because she was worried.

432
00:33:39,663 --> 00:33:40,663
Worried?

433
00:33:41,803 --> 00:33:43,260
But the things she thought

434
00:33:43,597 --> 00:33:44,597
were all vile.

435
00:33:45,017 --> 00:33:47,007
How could she think
I'd slept with Mai?

436
00:33:47,464 --> 00:33:49,230
She raised me herself

437
00:33:49,393 --> 00:33:51,240
but why wouldn't she trust me?

438
00:33:58,357 --> 00:34:01,254
If she's worried you'll be defamed
when you get back,

439
00:34:01,423 --> 00:34:03,350
I'm willing to take
the responsibility.

440
00:34:03,836 --> 00:34:04,876
Lieutenant...

441
00:34:05,616 --> 00:34:08,099
If I don't offend you,

442
00:34:08,623 --> 00:34:09,840
please marry me.

443
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,653
I'm sorry, Lieutenant Rat.

444
00:34:17,508 --> 00:34:19,080
You don't offend me.

445
00:34:19,523 --> 00:34:20,566
But...

446
00:34:20,816 --> 00:34:22,673
I just...

447
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,693
I just don't love you...

448
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:29,402
that way.

449
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,250
Let go!

450
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:47,837
Rerai!

451
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:50,660
You will leave as I say!

452
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,606
Kathi agreed to leave.

453
00:34:53,136 --> 00:34:55,347
How can you stay here
by yourself with a man?

454
00:34:55,456 --> 00:34:56,787
Why can't I stay

455
00:34:56,917 --> 00:34:58,356
since I'm already Mai's wife?

456
00:34:58,536 --> 00:34:59,807
So I can stay here, Mom.

457
00:35:00,237 --> 00:35:02,054
Don't be sarcastic with me.

458
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,287
You will leave as I say! Come home!

459
00:35:04,297 --> 00:35:05,946
- I'm not going!
- Right now!

460
00:35:05,957 --> 00:35:08,520
Mom, I'm not going!

461
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:10,770
Let go, Mom! Let go of me!

462
00:35:58,357 --> 00:36:00,174
Is anyone here? Get me some water?

463
00:36:01,304 --> 00:36:04,124
Just cold water can't put out
the fire in your heart.

464
00:36:08,324 --> 00:36:09,324
Ms. Malai.

465
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,683
There's a lot more...

466
00:36:14,636 --> 00:36:15,833
you don't know.

467
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,977
Make sure Monk Dech gets punished.

468
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:23,077
Don't let his depravity
taint monasticism.

469
00:36:23,543 --> 00:36:25,113
Go back to the Dark Shadow House.

470
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,857
Find out the truth there.

471
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,823
And bring Dech...

472
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:30,473
to justice.

473
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,980
If you don't do it,

474
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:37,020
I'm gonna keep coming after

475
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:39,293
both him and you

476
00:36:40,383 --> 00:36:41,733
until...

477
00:36:42,003 --> 00:36:45,016
he pays for what he did to me.

478
00:37:11,238 --> 00:37:12,477
Young Master!

479
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:16,023
Hey!

480
00:37:16,096 --> 00:37:18,538
How many times have you told you
not to run in the house?

481
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,980
I'm sorry, Auntie.

482
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,590
What's wrong?

483
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:24,994
There's a locked cabinet
in your parents' room.

484
00:37:25,323 --> 00:37:27,260
We didn't dare open it to clean it.

485
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,366
It's okay. I'll open it.

486
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:30,889
Thanks.

487
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:32,063
Sir.

488
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:31,640
(Mueang)

489
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:37,090
(Mueang)

490
00:38:42,323 --> 00:38:45,316
(Mueang)

491
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,630
Mueang.

492
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,090
(Mueang)

493
00:38:55,097 --> 00:38:57,620
Ms. Malai showed me
everything that happened.

494
00:38:57,796 --> 00:38:59,987
She's convinced
you're the one who hurt her.

495
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:01,277
You betrayed me!

496
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:10,981
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

497
00:39:11,429 --> 00:39:15,916
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

498
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,103
As far as I remember,
ever since started working her,

499
00:39:20,196 --> 00:39:22,587
you're the only young master here.

500
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,494
Who would know
about the other child?

501
00:39:24,897 --> 00:39:26,540
I want to find him.

502
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,786
Probably the Venerable Grandfather
at the temple, Young Master Mai.

503
00:39:31,137 --> 00:39:32,137
Really?

504
00:39:32,277 --> 00:39:35,244
But why do you want to
find the other child?

505
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,530
That's right.

506
00:39:39,783 --> 00:39:43,366
When Sing and Thapthim
first moved here,

507
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:46,219
there were two kids at your house.

508
00:39:46,536 --> 00:39:48,053
But unfortunately,

509
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:50,973
the other kid passed away.

510
00:39:51,629 --> 00:39:53,146
That kid...

511
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:54,989
was called Mueang, right?

512
00:39:55,275 --> 00:39:57,426
I can't possibly remember

513
00:39:57,662 --> 00:39:58,815
what his name was.

514
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:00,510
But I remember that...

515
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:04,800
Sing and Thapthim were heartbroken.

516
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,980
Birth, old age and death

517
00:40:09,357 --> 00:40:11,740
happen to all living things.

518
00:40:11,863 --> 00:40:13,407
Make peace with it.

519
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:15,520
I know, sir.

520
00:40:17,383 --> 00:40:18,754
But...

521
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:25,140
No matter how hard you cry,
the dead won't come back, Thapthim.

522
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,000
Venerable Father was right.
Make peace with it.

523
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,426
That's all.

524
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:38,433
I know.

525
00:40:41,161 --> 00:40:42,728
Thank you, Venerable Grandfather.

526
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:44,743
Bless you.

527
00:40:48,203 --> 00:40:49,400
Venerable Father Dech.

528
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,846
Did I do something to offend you?

529
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:58,135
Personally, no.

530
00:40:58,603 --> 00:41:00,193
But for Ms. Malai...

531
00:41:00,942 --> 00:41:01,942
you might have.

532
00:41:02,056 --> 00:41:03,613
I'm gonna ask you again.

533
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,720
What are your parents' names?

534
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:07,044
I already told you

535
00:41:07,457 --> 00:41:09,600
their names were Sing and Thapthim.

536
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:11,866
But from what you told me,

537
00:41:12,323 --> 00:41:16,230
I think your parents'
real names are Kam and Uan.

538
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,083
No way.

539
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:20,529
How could you know better
than their own kid?

540
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,270
My parents told me everything.

541
00:41:22,592 --> 00:41:24,819
They never told me
they'd changed their names.

542
00:41:24,945 --> 00:41:26,963
Don't you accuse my parents.

543
00:41:26,973 --> 00:41:28,160
I don't like it.

544
00:41:28,446 --> 00:41:30,040
I'm not accusing them.

545
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,623
Kam and Uan really
had a son called Mai.

546
00:41:33,026 --> 00:41:34,239
Who was probably you.

547
00:41:34,773 --> 00:41:36,370
Things like that could be...

548
00:41:37,379 --> 00:41:39,123
It could be a coincidence, right?

549
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,080
People can have the same name,

550
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:45,040
but Young Master Mueang's name
in the Dark Shadow House deed?

551
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:48,473
Don't you think
it's too much of a coincidence?

552
00:41:49,253 --> 00:41:50,253
Uh...

553
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,720
I just want to meet
Young Master Mueang.

554
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:58,240
At least once.

555
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,087
"About a decade ago,

556
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:11,463
people weren't required
to register deaths

557
00:42:11,856 --> 00:42:15,146
so I don't have written proof
to confirm it to you.

558
00:42:15,356 --> 00:42:18,894
But from a first-person account
and the funeral urn I found,

559
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,767
it's very likely that

560
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:22,654
Mr. Mueang passed away.

561
00:42:22,871 --> 00:42:25,261
Please accept my condolences,
Venerable Father.

562
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:29,086
As for me, I will stay here
and investigate a bit more

563
00:42:29,249 --> 00:42:32,460
because I'm curious if Mr. Mueang
passed away at a young age,

564
00:42:32,936 --> 00:42:35,416
how he could sell the Dark
Shadow House to my parents.

565
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:39,094
If I find anything,
I'll pay you a visit.

566
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:40,809
Mai."

567
00:42:53,677 --> 00:42:55,297
You people are not welcome here!

568
00:42:55,623 --> 00:42:56,800
- Ghost!
- Ghost!

569
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,250
Get out!

570
00:43:04,223 --> 00:43:06,756
And did you know
he claimed to be Mr. Mueang?

571
00:43:06,856 --> 00:43:08,253
He did it to find out the truth.

572
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:09,369
