"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 40)

19
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:05,845
You have finally arrived,

20
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:07,517
you scum.

21
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,246
I've already written a

22
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,543
letter for Ms. Bu-nga,

23
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:22,800
she's probably going to bring

24
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:23,988
the police to arrest you.

25
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,238
You assume people will believe

26
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:26,644
a crazy person like Bu-nga

27
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:27,933
over a Marquis like me?

28
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,921
But Ms. Bu-nga isn't crazy.

29
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,787
Please tell the truth whether

30
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:38,014
you killed the Viscount or not.

31
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:44,119
Thanks to you,

32
00:02:44,737 --> 00:02:47,065
if you hadn't made him paralyzed,

33
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:48,440
I wouldn't have been

34
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:50,002
able to kill him myself.

35
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:21,783
So how have you been, Viscount Wisan?

36
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:23,213
Right,

37
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:25,510
even if you wanted to answer me now,

38
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,556
you can't answer anymore, right?

39
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,525
Why are you looking at me like that?

40
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:35,471
We're family after all.

41
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:37,635
What is there to be afraid of, right?

42
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:43,799
Shhh.

43
00:03:44,127 --> 00:03:45,955
Loud noises this late

44
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:47,603
is impolite.

45
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,443
Didn't Father teach you that, remember?

46
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,939
If only you saw me as your big brother,

47
00:03:57,268 --> 00:03:58,361
everything wouldn't

48
00:03:58,386 --> 00:03:59,705
have ended up like this.

49
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:02,471
But you only

50
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:04,392
looked down on me

51
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:06,728
and I was never in your eyes.

52
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:08,572
And what now?

53
00:04:08,612 --> 00:04:11,002
Who's the useless one now?

54
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:20,791
Cease resisting.

55
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:23,025
Don't try to escape.

56
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:25,877
Even if you want to escape,

57
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:27,291
you won't be able to escape.

58
00:04:57,718 --> 00:04:58,718
Don't worry,

59
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:00,678
after your death,

60
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:02,522
Kam and Uan will

61
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:05,131
conspire to frame Dech

62
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:08,545
for murdering you.

63
00:05:11,663 --> 00:05:12,873
Once Dech is caught,

64
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:15,397
all the assets

65
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,338
will belong to me alone.

66
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:16,249
In the end,

67
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,921
Wisan died as a man who was

68
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:20,390
unable to do anything.

69
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:24,662
I wished Father could see

70
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:25,741
with his own eyes,

71
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:28,296
his beloved son,

72
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,109
dying so pathetically!

73
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:44,512
In the end, the lingering question

74
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,631
in my mind has finally been solved.

75
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:52,983
Only one issue remains...

76
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:10,765
Why do you look at me like that, Dech?

77
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:14,703
The only thing I want to know...

78
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:23,695
- Who killed me?
- Who killed me?

79
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:36,618
Be careful!

80
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,625
Ms. Malai.

81
00:08:14,688 --> 00:08:16,523
I'm asking for a chance to investigate,

82
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:18,641
so we can find out what really happened,

83
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,898
don't you want to know?

84
00:08:27,938 --> 00:08:29,547
I will give you another chance.

85
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,984
Who killed me?

86
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:56,331
Tell me then, my lord.

87
00:08:57,438 --> 00:08:59,219
Was it Dech who killed me?

88
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:03,077
You have heard everything, Ms. Malai.

89
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:04,219
I did not do it.

90
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,664
Why don't you still believe me?

91
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:06,688
Shut up.

92
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:11,086
I'm willing to accept

93
00:09:11,703 --> 00:09:13,711
that you were framed for other things,

94
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:15,430
but for killing me,

95
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:18,117
I saw it with my own eyes!

96
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:21,149
The things that happened

97
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:22,814
were because of you.

98
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:26,211
I have no choice but to kill you

99
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:28,367
so won't tell others.

100
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:43,186
Goodbye,

101
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:44,937
Ms. Malai.

102
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,410
You killed me

103
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:21,262
even though you said you loved me.

104
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:28,167
You broke my heart

105
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:33,073
even though I gave you

106
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:35,042
chance after chance.

107
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:55,768
Ms. Malai!

108
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:01,886
Ms. Malai!

109
00:11:08,582 --> 00:11:09,582
Let Mai go!

110
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:21,472
Hey! Rerai!

111
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:24,324
No, sir!

112
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:27,682
Don't hurt Rerai anymore!

113
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:28,995
If you want to kill me

114
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:30,628
then do it!

115
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:31,722
No!

116
00:11:32,222 --> 00:11:34,003
Even if you kill him,

117
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:36,464
you still wouldn't get the inheritance.

118
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:37,722
Are you threatening me

119
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,815
with the police again?

120
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:40,448
I have money,

121
00:11:40,964 --> 00:11:41,948
I'm not afraid.

122
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,667
Prison is for dogs, not me!

123
00:11:45,832 --> 00:11:48,175
You may not be afraid of prison,

124
00:11:48,394 --> 00:11:50,565
but you still won't get the inheritance

125
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:52,675
because I...

126
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,918
Don't, Rerai!

127
00:11:58,988 --> 00:12:01,480
Because I am the child of the viscount,

128
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:03,964
the sole heir,

129
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:05,183
not Mai!

130
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:12,472
Have you gone crazy?

131
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,167
Why did you say that?

132
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,714
Because I won't let you die,

133
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:17,714
I will absolutely not let you die

134
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:18,738
because me.

135
00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:24,671
There's no need to argue,

136
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:28,304
anyway you'll all die together.

137
00:12:43,037 --> 00:12:44,037
No!

138
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,068
No!

(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

141
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,373
There's no need to argue,

142
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:20,919
anyway you'll all die together.

143
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:36,616
No!

144
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:38,647
No!

145
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:57,937
Dech...

146
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:07,530
Venerable monk...

147
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:08,741
Venerable monk...

148

Venerable monk...

149
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:18,510
Venerable monk!

150
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:20,478
Venerable monk!

151
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:21,908
Venerable monk!

152
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:40,283
No!

153
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:42,072
No!

154
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:40,319
Don't do this,

155
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:43,116
the children are unrelated.

156
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:48,709
Shut up,

157
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:50,746
stay in your realm!

158
00:15:59,771 --> 00:16:01,225
No!

159
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:01,905
Ms. Malai!

160
00:16:01,921 --> 00:16:03,441
Enough! Stop do it!

161
00:16:05,093 --> 00:16:05,749
Ms. Malai!

162
00:16:08,912 --> 00:16:11,530
No!

163
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:16,928
No!

164
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:24,304
My lord.

165
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:29,498
I know you're here.

166
00:16:29,694 --> 00:16:31,760
Let us meet.

167
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,620
My lord...

168
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,310
It's not possible.

169
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,510
Have you gone crazy now, Dech?

170
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:50,705
Well, my lord?

171
00:16:53,815 --> 00:16:55,370
It has reached this point,

172
00:16:57,331 --> 00:16:58,784
won't you have the courage

173
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,963
to face me a little?

174
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:03,448
Hey!

175
00:17:09,581 --> 00:17:10,581
No!

176
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:48,998
What's going on?

177
00:18:01,178 --> 00:18:02,232
The wind is so strong,

178
00:18:02,256 --> 00:18:03,576
I can't even open my eyes!

179
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,255
What should we do, Ms. Bu-nga?

180
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,123
Please help me, Malai.

181
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:22,216
It has stopped.

182
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:24,481
Let us proceed.

183
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:06,080
Viscount Wisan.

184
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,330
What is going on?

185
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:39,018
Viscount Wisan.

186
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:40,072
What is going on?

187
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:44,971
Wisan!

188
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:46,893
I had thought that

189
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:48,455
the only one who would know

190
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:50,213
my spirit still exists would be you,

191
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:51,893
Dech.

192
00:19:54,517 --> 00:19:55,517
Father...

193
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,265
I have waited a long time

194
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:05,570
for when you would call me out.

195
00:20:12,526 --> 00:20:13,846
When I was meditating

196
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:15,752
as a monk,

197
00:20:16,198 --> 00:20:18,221
I have long seen another spirit besides.

198
00:20:18,246 --> 00:20:20,041
Ms. Malai's that was here,

199
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:23,447
but I did not know who it belonged to.

200
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,953
I was the only

201
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:29,885
foolish one,

202
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,861
not realizing you were so close

203
00:20:34,628 --> 00:20:35,963
for decades.

204
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:38,127
Don't criticize yourself, Malai.

205
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:40,463
I intentionally hid from you.

206
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:46,974
If you didn't know who it was,

207
00:20:47,654 --> 00:20:49,356
then why are you so certain it was me?

208
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:51,044
Because Ms. Malai has

209
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:52,936
misunderstood me all along.

210
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,245
Everything didn't make sense,

211
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,346
that's when I deduced the only one

212
00:20:57,362 --> 00:20:58,479
who wanted me

213
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:01,885
and Ms. Malai to be at odds

214
00:21:02,947 --> 00:21:04,541
could only be you, my lord.

215
00:21:09,952 --> 00:21:11,185
Is it true, my lord?

216
00:21:12,975 --> 00:21:15,350
Did I misunderstand Dech because of you?

217
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:17,511
Yes,

218
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,260
It was my doing.

219
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:21,980
I started from making you

220
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:23,878
encounter the poison that harm me.

221
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:47,703
No wonder, I was suspicious back then

222
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,180
about how Ms. Malai encountered

223
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:51,274
that bottle of poison.

224
00:21:56,313 --> 00:21:57,977
Then what about Dech killing me?

225
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:03,563
I saw with my own eyes

226
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,935
it was Dech's doing!

227
00:22:05,052 --> 00:22:06,185
Didn't you ever hear

228
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:08,974
not to readily believe anything,

229
00:22:10,013 --> 00:22:11,505
even with what your eyes see?

230
00:22:56,002 --> 00:22:57,493
You promised me, Ms. Malai,

231
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,862
that if I successfully find the culprit,

232
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:01,237
you'll tell me

233
00:23:02,636 --> 00:23:04,018
who my real parents are

234
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,455
and what happened to Mr. Mueang.

235
00:23:09,893 --> 00:23:14,814
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

236
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:19,830
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

237
00:24:20,112 --> 00:24:21,517
Forgive me, Malai.

238
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:25,885
I truly could not let you keep living

239
00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:28,853
in order to

240
00:24:29,275 --> 00:24:30,970
retrieve the inheritance back to me.

241
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:34,135
Goodbye, Malai.

242
00:25:25,786 --> 00:25:26,926
Please die

243
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:29,286
with such a misunderstanding, Malai.

244
00:25:29,505 --> 00:25:31,458
Because Dech had to be mine alone...

245
00:25:31,607 --> 00:25:32,607
only mine.

246
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,004
In truth, everything was your doing?

247
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:09,355
Why did you have to do this?

248
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:12,832
Wasn't the forgiveness

249
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,754
I gave you still not enough, my lord?

250
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,004
Forgiveness?

251
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,590
Don't make me laugh.

252
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,306
Did you think I would let you

253
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:22,965
and Dech be happy together?

254
00:26:22,996 --> 00:26:23,996
No way!

255
00:26:36,641 --> 00:26:38,602
It was my fault, Ms. Malai.

256
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:42,703
Back then.

257
00:26:43,165 --> 00:26:44,525
I was too slow.

258
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:46,578
If I had gone faster,

259
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,688
Ms. Malai might not have had to die,

260
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:58,102
and would not have opened

261
00:26:58,126 --> 00:26:59,719
the opportunity for the viscount

262
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:01,594
to sow misunderstanding for so long.

263
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,642
Where are you, Ms. Malai?

264
00:27:13,721 --> 00:27:14,721
Ms. Malai!

265
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:17,025
Ms. Malai!

266
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:19,541
Ms. Malai!

267
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,119
Ms. Malai!

268
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,275
Ms. Malai!

269
00:27:44,392 --> 00:27:45,392
Ms. Malai!

270
00:27:49,463 --> 00:27:50,463
Ms. Malai!

271
00:27:54,627 --> 00:27:55,627
Dech!

272
00:27:57,197 --> 00:27:58,197
Ms. Malai!

273
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,111
Dech!

274
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:02,136
Ms. Malai!

275
00:28:02,275 --> 00:28:03,165
Escape now!

276
00:28:03,197 --> 00:28:04,806
The fire has engulfed everything!

277
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,830
Ms. Malai!

278
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:07,892
Ms. Malai is dead.

279
00:28:08,346 --> 00:28:10,040
- If you don't escape quickly,
- Ms. Malai!

280
00:28:10,096 --> 00:28:12,033
You'll die too!

281
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:13,556
Let us go!

282
00:28:13,581 --> 00:28:14,612
I won't go!

283
00:28:15,698 --> 00:28:17,206
I have to save Ms. Malai!

284
00:28:18,394 --> 00:28:19,940
Dech, we must leave now!

285
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:20,956
- Hurry up!
- Ms. Malai!

286
00:28:21,714 --> 00:28:22,714
Let go!

287
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:37,713
Ms. Malai's question had been clarified.

288
00:28:42,317 --> 00:28:43,363
In that case,

289
00:28:46,114 --> 00:28:47,371
the only thing remain...

290
00:29:12,908 --> 00:29:14,470
I never did anything to you

291
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:18,002
but you still killed me.

292
00:29:18,596 --> 00:29:19,634
Without

293
00:29:20,103 --> 00:29:21,462
Wisan,

294
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:23,337
without you,

295
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:25,814
without Ramphoei,

296
00:29:26,783 --> 00:29:28,587
without children,

297
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,408
all the assets would be mine alone!

298
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,970
Was it

299
00:29:37,158 --> 00:29:38,150
just for this?

300
00:29:38,908 --> 00:29:39,892
For assets,

301
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:42,955
this house...

302
00:29:43,393 --> 00:29:45,533
You killed me for this?

303
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,486
So you killed me!

304
00:30:08,447 --> 00:30:10,642
Let go!

305
00:30:12,275 --> 00:30:13,767
Crying like a dog burnt by hot water.

306
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,330
How pathetic.

307
00:30:18,752 --> 00:30:19,947
Ms. Malai,

308
00:30:20,924 --> 00:30:22,751
please stop your vengeance,

309
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,876
let us forgive each other.

310
00:30:26,877 --> 00:30:28,298
In one life or another,

311
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:33,064
the two of us might be fated to meet

312
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,345
and be together again in another life.

313
00:31:13,243 --> 00:31:14,251
Whoa!

314
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:15,699
Open the door!

315
00:31:16,025 --> 00:31:17,025
Release me!

316
00:31:22,618 --> 00:31:23,738
Open the door!

317
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,290
Malai!

318
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,977
Don't kill me!

319
00:31:40,173 --> 00:31:41,173
Bu-nga!

320
00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:45,490
You were not actually insane

321
00:31:45,515 --> 00:31:46,561
like Im told me.

322
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:49,155
Please forgive me for

323
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:50,428
lying to you, Countess.

324
00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:52,248
And where is Im?

325
00:31:52,264 --> 00:31:53,748
I told her to go gather more people,

326
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:55,156
just in case something happens.

327
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:57,249
Mother...

328
00:31:57,546 --> 00:31:59,412
I've heard the story from Im already

329
00:31:59,428 --> 00:32:01,115
but I will not believe your father

330
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,389
did something like this

331
00:32:03,124 --> 00:32:04,514
until I see it with my own eyes

332
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:06,131
and hear it with my own ears.

333
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:08,444
And if it's true,

334
00:32:09,397 --> 00:32:10,623
I will try persuade him

335
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:11,990
to change his ways himself.

336
00:32:13,576 --> 00:32:14,616
Let us hurry.

337
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:16,724
- Yes.
- Yes.

338
00:32:23,523 --> 00:32:24,631
Dream on,

339
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:26,788
no matter how many lifetimes,

340
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:28,514
I won't let you two be together!

341
00:32:28,773 --> 00:32:30,639
You must be mine alone, Dech!

342
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:34,053
Father,

343
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,553
please let it go.

344
00:32:37,483 --> 00:32:38,655
The more you do,

345
00:32:39,616 --> 00:32:41,750
the more you increase your sin.

346
00:32:41,944 --> 00:32:43,878
Don't lecture me about karma.

347
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,155
You're not me, you didn't suffer,

348
00:32:46,187 --> 00:32:48,225
you weren't treated horribly like me!

349
00:32:49,527 --> 00:32:50,590
Even your mother's

350
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:52,301
resentment

351
00:32:52,841 --> 00:32:54,325
would be no different from mine.

352
00:32:55,989 --> 00:32:57,043
And another thing,

353
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:58,957
I'm just the father

354
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:00,918
who brought you into this world,

355
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:02,637
I never raised

356
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,864
or even wanted you to be born!

357
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,450
So,

358
00:33:06,755 --> 00:33:09,332
cease calling me your father!

359
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:18,129
But still,

360
00:33:20,677 --> 00:33:21,762
you'll

361
00:33:22,325 --> 00:33:24,004
always be my father.

362
00:33:38,192 --> 00:33:39,332
Otherwise,

363
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,371
I wouldn't be alive

364
00:33:43,668 --> 00:33:45,277
until today.

365
00:33:52,612 --> 00:33:54,095
I love, Father,

366
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:31,474
Leave.

367
00:34:32,224 --> 00:34:33,318
I'll clear a path,

368
00:34:34,474 --> 00:34:36,130
except that foul brother of mine,

369
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:39,669
for you two to leave this place safely.

370
00:35:01,998 --> 00:35:03,450
You promised me, Ms. Malai,

371
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:05,927
that if I successfully find the culprit,

372
00:35:06,232 --> 00:35:07,365
you'll tell me

373
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:10,060
who my real parents are

374
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:12,427
and what happened to Mr. Mueang.

375
00:35:17,577 --> 00:35:18,756
Look into my eyes,

376
00:35:20,538 --> 00:35:22,029
I will take you there myself.

377
00:35:39,856 --> 00:35:40,856
Whoa!

378
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:41,871
Thapthim.

379
00:35:42,762 --> 00:35:43,802
Here you are.

380
00:35:44,387 --> 00:35:45,964
I was looking for you everywhere.

381
00:35:46,238 --> 00:35:48,050
Hurry and return, it'll be night soon.

382
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:50,285
Will you really chase Ms. Malai ghost

383
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,527
out of the House of Dark Shadows?

384
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:52,980
If we don't chase her away,

385
00:35:53,012 --> 00:35:54,168
how can stay in it?

386
00:35:55,192 --> 00:35:56,433
Who wouldn't sell it?

387
00:35:56,785 --> 00:35:57,839
It's a lot of money.

388
00:35:57,926 --> 00:35:59,433
But villagers around here say.

389
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,793
Ms. Malai's ghost is ferocious.

390
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:03,394
She may resent us

391
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:05,597
and wait for a chance to take revenge.

392
00:36:05,613 --> 00:36:06,972
Let us not provoke her.

393
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:08,355
We did it out of necessity.

394
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:10,004
If we didn't, Ms. Malai will report us.

395
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:11,080
If we didn't do it,

396
00:36:11,113 --> 00:36:12,808
can we live comfortably like this?

397
00:36:14,503 --> 00:36:15,839
Even if ghosts are real,

398
00:36:16,848 --> 00:36:18,800
Ms. Malai just can't blame us alone.

399
00:36:19,348 --> 00:36:21,261
I'm not just selling it

400
00:36:22,262 --> 00:36:23,782
only for the money.

401
00:36:25,144 --> 00:36:26,636
I'm also doing it for our child.

402
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:28,965
For Mai?

403
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,316
You know what the truth is,

404
00:36:31,613 --> 00:36:33,347
Mai, our real child, died long ago.

405
00:36:33,715 --> 00:36:34,644
Now,

406
00:36:35,182 --> 00:36:37,143
we're raising Mr. Mueang instead of Mai,

407
00:36:37,168 --> 00:36:39,168
we only changed his name to Mai.

408
00:36:40,582 --> 00:36:42,433
What if one day the truth comes out?

409
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:43,816
And he refuses to love us?

410
00:36:45,418 --> 00:36:46,768
Selling the house will

411
00:36:46,799 --> 00:36:47,963
cut off ways for the child

412
00:36:47,979 --> 00:36:49,270
to know the truth.

413
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:50,549
So he will love us like before.

414
00:37:06,936 --> 00:37:08,146
I am actually Mueang.

415
00:37:17,663 --> 00:37:18,663
Dech will go nowhere,

416
00:37:19,295 --> 00:37:20,295
you must stay with me

417
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,185
according to our "oath"!

418
00:37:21,225 --> 00:37:22,225
I am ready

419
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:24,006
to fulfill my oath

420
00:37:24,545 --> 00:37:25,982
to you, my lord.

421
00:37:26,366 --> 00:37:27,366
My lord!

423
00:37:34,225 --> 00:37:39,146
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

424
00:37:41,061 --> 00:37:42,271
I am actually Mueang.

425
00:37:51,975 --> 00:37:53,787
Mueang, son of Dech and Ramphoei!

426
00:38:00,254 --> 00:38:01,824
Have you just realized it, Mueang?

427
00:38:02,996 --> 00:38:04,222
What a pity.

428
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,568
It's too late.

429
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:09,621
Father.

430
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:16,592
Father.

431
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:18,865
Father.

432
00:38:19,638 --> 00:38:20,638
Mueang.

433
00:38:35,404 --> 00:38:36,404
Mueang.

434
00:38:37,154 --> 00:38:38,154
Father.

435
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,090
I will bring you out of here, Father.

436
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,012
Dech will go nowhere,

437
00:38:55,215 --> 00:38:56,418
you must stay with me

438
00:38:56,442 --> 00:38:57,684
according to our "oath"!

439
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,090
But...

440
00:39:01,122 --> 00:39:02,559
my father is gravely injured,

441
00:39:04,434 --> 00:39:05,874
are you going to

442
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:07,074
leave him like this?

443
00:39:07,153 --> 00:39:08,230
Enough, Mueang.

444
00:39:16,464 --> 00:39:18,019
Just seeing my child again

445
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,659
makes me so happy.

446
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,800
But...

447
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:26,842
Hurry and bring Rerai away.

448
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:33,271
But...

449
00:39:33,296 --> 00:39:34,412
What about you?

450
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:35,896
Trust me,

451
00:39:37,006 --> 00:39:38,802
I know I won't survive.

452
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:42,412
Don't waste time.

453
00:39:45,209 --> 00:39:46,935
If the viscount doesn't open a path,

454
00:39:46,943 --> 00:39:49,060
no one can leave this place.

455
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,710
Hurry and escape.

456
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,960
Go, my child!

457
00:39:59,717 --> 00:40:01,077
Escape from here.

458
00:40:06,902 --> 00:40:07,980
Escape from here.

459
00:40:08,363 --> 00:40:09,862
Father...

460
00:40:13,464 --> 00:40:14,323
Father.

461
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:15,613
Escape, my child.

462
00:40:20,214 --> 00:40:21,414
Let us go, Mai.

463
00:40:56,645 --> 00:40:57,645
I am ready

464
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:00,183
to fulfill my oath

465
00:41:00,894 --> 00:41:02,254
to you, my lord.

466
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:20,395
Whoa!

467
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,066
I'm not wrong.

468
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:37,512
I'm not wrong.

469
00:41:49,353 --> 00:41:50,353
Malai.

470
00:41:56,752 --> 00:41:58,869
Help! Let go! Help me!

471
00:42:55,689 --> 00:42:57,337
Lieutenant,

472
00:42:57,362 --> 00:42:58,470
Ms. Bu-nga!

473
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:01,929
How is Rerai doing?

474
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,415
We've just arrived as well.

475
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,501
Mai, Rerai!

476
00:43:11,939 --> 00:43:12,790
Mom!

477
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:13,807
Rerai!

478
00:43:14,783 --> 00:43:16,275
- Mom!
- My child!

479
00:43:18,611 --> 00:43:20,330
Rerai!

480
00:43:24,572 --> 00:43:25,423
Mom!

481
00:43:26,002 --> 00:43:28,189
I met Father!

482
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,900
Father

483
00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:34,462
was the one who released us.

484
00:43:38,393 --> 00:43:39,393
It's okay.

485
00:43:42,064 --> 00:43:43,298
How is the Marquis?

486
00:43:45,432 --> 00:43:46,228
Umm...

487
00:43:46,252 --> 00:43:47,772
How is the Marquis?

488
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,299
Let me go!

489
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,080
My lord!

490
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:09,459
My lord!

491
00:44:10,654 --> 00:44:11,654
My lord!

492
00:44:11,662 --> 00:44:14,490
Please approach him, Countess.

493
00:44:14,897 --> 00:44:16,630
The Marquis is behaving strangely

494
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,052
and has a gun in his hand.

495
00:44:18,077 --> 00:44:19,568
Please don't approach him, Countess.

496
00:44:19,585 --> 00:44:20,608
My lord,

497
00:44:21,194 --> 00:44:22,795
I've learned about everything.

498
00:44:23,569 --> 00:44:25,811
I'm not asking if it's true or not.

499
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:27,780
Please put the gun down first

500
00:44:27,805 --> 00:44:28,959
and let us talk.

501
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,991
I'm begging you, my lord.

502
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,569
We've been husband and wife for so long,

503
00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:36,991
no matter what happens,

504
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,577
I will never love you any less.

505
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:42,366
Please? Please put the gun down.

506
00:44:43,397 --> 00:44:45,170
Please put the gun down, Father.

507
00:45:25,946 --> 00:45:27,344
Do you all want to kill me?

508
00:45:28,391 --> 00:45:30,191
Do you all want to kill me?

509
00:45:32,853 --> 00:45:34,196
Please forgive each other,

510
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:36,196
my lord.

511
00:45:39,517 --> 00:45:40,517
Finally,

512
00:45:40,688 --> 00:45:42,488
Dech and I will be together.

513
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:46,438
I wish to return all the assets

514
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:48,040
to Rerai.

515
00:45:48,485 --> 00:45:51,055
And Fueang, please don't refuse me.

516
00:45:51,406 --> 00:45:53,821
Think about your child's future, Fueang.

517
00:45:54,437 --> 00:45:56,796
