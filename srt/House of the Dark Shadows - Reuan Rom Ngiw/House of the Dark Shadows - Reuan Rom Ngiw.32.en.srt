"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 32)

19
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:01,542
No one will know what we talk about.

20
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:05,398
Dech poisoned me!

21
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:08,104
I'm very hurt.

22
00:02:08,547 --> 00:02:10,080
It seems you no longer trust me.

23
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:10,781
Dech.

24
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:11,766
Just you wait.

25
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,977
It won't be long before

26
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:14,146
I unveil that mask

27
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:16,375
and reveal how evil you truly are.

28
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:18,788
The boat is leaking, Ms. Malai!

29
00:02:18,812 --> 00:02:20,513
Can you swim to the shore?

30
00:02:20,538 --> 00:02:21,561
I cannot swim!

31
00:02:23,406 --> 00:02:25,108
If you cause harm to Ms. Malai again,

32
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:26,405
do not hold me accountable

33
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,461
for not forewarning you.

34
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:33,382
The alphabet...

35
00:02:33,764 --> 00:02:34,913
You wish to communicate

36
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:35,890
with me, my lord?

37
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:39,600
She neglects her own child

38
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:41,093
and disregards her husband,

39
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:42,319
yet Malai must undertake

40
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,366
all tasks on her behalf.

41
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:45,132
It's truly exasperating.

42
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:48,124
You may express your frustrations to me,

43
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:49,194
but refrain from directly

44
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,390
addressing Ramphoei.

45
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:52,194
Why is that, my lord?

46
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:53,374
She may retaliate,

47
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:54,819
as she did earlier with me.

48
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:57,561
She dared talk back to you, my lord?

49
00:02:58,109 --> 00:02:59,632
Such audacity from a lowly woman.

50
00:03:00,984 --> 00:03:01,984
Dech.

51
00:03:02,445 --> 00:03:03,975
I rely on you to oversee the viscount

52
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,686
and everyone else in this household.

53
00:03:06,343 --> 00:03:07,780
Apart from you and Malai,

54
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:09,780
I do not see anyone else

55
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:11,186
I can place my trust in.

56
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:13,882
Thank you for your trust, Count Phichit.

57
00:03:15,187 --> 00:03:16,702
Indeed, as you have stated, my lord

58
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:18,194
I wonder whether Mueang will inherit

59
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:19,250
his father's temperament

60
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,085
or his mother's.

61
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,444
If he takes after his mother,

62
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,647
he might drive everyone out

63
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:23,874
of this household.

64
00:03:24,796 --> 00:03:25,921
Pondering the future

65
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:27,225
will only burden you now.

66
00:03:27,288 --> 00:03:28,358
It's regrettable,

67
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:29,944
if only the viscount could

68
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:31,022
still communicate.

69
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:32,374
He should consider divorce,

70
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,475
division of assets,

71
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:35,140
and sending away Ramphoei.

72
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,663
The would be far better.

73
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:37,765
What if

74
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:40,390
the viscount could communicate, my lord?

75
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:43,179
What are you saying?

76
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:45,030
It's clear how the viscount's

77
00:03:45,054 --> 00:03:45,968
condition is.

78
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:47,147
No, my lord.

79
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:49,249
Earlier, I found a letter sheet Malai

80
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:51,288
use to communicate with the viscount,

81
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,304
but I was not able to use it.

82
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:55,046
Given more time,

83
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:56,811
we could inquire whether the viscount

84
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,335
desires to divorce Ramphoei.

85
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:04,132
Malai never mentioned this to me, ma'am.

86
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:06,054
Malai informed me that

87
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,319
compared to direct observation

88
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:08,569
of the viscount's expressions,

89
00:04:08,594 --> 00:04:09,765
this method is less reliable,

90
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:11,054
so she discontinued its use.

91
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:12,093
Upon reflection,

92
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,561
composing each word accurately

93
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,983
takes considerable time.

94
00:04:16,593 --> 00:04:17,944
Let us depart,

95
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:19,725
I have unfinished business to attend to.

96
00:04:20,203 --> 00:04:21,108
Yes, my lord.

97
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:23,843
Please convey my regards to Malai.

98
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:25,413
Yes, ma'am.

99
00:04:25,663 --> 00:04:27,061
Should you require any assistance,

100
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:28,468
you may find me at the estate

101
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:29,155
at any time.

102
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,203
Yes, my lord.

103
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,547
Safe travels, my lord.

104
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:04,853
Oh.

105
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:06,782
Have you sent Count Phichit

106
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,247
and Ms. Ranchaun off?

107
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:09,626
Indeed, ma'am.

108
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:11,579
Where are you off to now?

109
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:13,431
It's lunch time, so I'm going to

110
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:14,938
bring some food for the viscount.

111
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:16,978
And what about the young master?

112
00:05:17,003 --> 00:05:18,563
I've entrusted him to Fueang.

113
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:21,196
Then it's better for you to

114
00:05:21,212 --> 00:05:22,471
take care of the young master.

115
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:24,228
I'll go look after the viscount instead.

116
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:25,860
Is that so, Dech?

117
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,353
Don't worry about me.

118
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:29,618
I'm grateful for your compassion

119
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:30,845
to the young master,

120
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,509
even more so than his real mother.

121
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:34,267
I'll take care of the young master.

122
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,292
Yes, ma'am.

123
00:07:04,514 --> 00:07:06,341
It was you who aroused suspicion

124
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:07,693
in Ms. Malai against me?

125
00:07:09,654 --> 00:07:11,232
Fine, if that is what you want.

126
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:12,763
If you have bad intentions,

127
00:07:12,787 --> 00:07:14,091
then let us go all out.

128
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:04,037
Peek A Boo!

129
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,185
Peek A Boo!

130
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:07,733
Fueang.

131
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,091
What term should I adopt for myself?

132
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:12,599
Would "Auntie" be suitable?

133
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:14,029
Considering Ms. Malai's elevated

134
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:15,498
status compared to Ms. Ramphoei,

135
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:16,888
as Mr. Mueang matures,

136
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:18,279
he will naturally refer to you as

137
00:08:18,287 --> 00:08:19,487
"Head Mother."

138
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:21,099
Therefore, you can address

139
00:08:21,115 --> 00:08:22,146
yourself as Mother.

140
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:24,248
Do you think Ramphoei will consent

141
00:08:24,264 --> 00:08:26,279
to her child addressing me as "Mother"?

142
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,677
It is not worth pondering over

143
00:08:27,702 --> 00:08:28,999
someone like her, ma'am.

144
00:08:29,436 --> 00:08:31,646
She's solely responsible for childbirth;

145
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:32,888
all other responsibilities

146
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,068
are delegated to others.

147
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:35,453
Now, now, Fueang.

148
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:37,265
Let her be.

149
00:08:37,826 --> 00:08:39,560
You only get what you give.

150
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:41,178
Hmm?

151
00:08:42,748 --> 00:08:43,748
Perhaps

152
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,068
it would be beneficial for

153
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:46,280
the viscount to witness

154
00:08:46,303 --> 00:08:47,529
the young master's growth.

155
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,365
I believe it would be inadvisable.

156
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:50,966
He is not his own offspring,

157
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:52,849
the viscount would not care, ma'am.

158
00:08:52,936 --> 00:08:54,459
Yet, it is said that being in

159
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:55,920
the company of children can

160
00:08:55,928 --> 00:08:56,943
uplift the spirits of

161
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:58,255
the elderly and patients.

162
00:08:58,756 --> 00:08:59,810
Maybe it'll soften

163
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:01,357
the viscount's heart a bit.

164
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,490
Sathu!

165
00:09:04,896 --> 00:09:06,607
Oh my goddess, my angel.

166
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:09,154
Even forgiving those

167
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:10,677
who think of murdering themselves,

168
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:13,771
I can't do it, ma'am.

169
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,724
I can't even bear to look at his face.

170
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:17,709
Engaging in acts of kindness

171
00:09:17,717 --> 00:09:18,991
while one is still alive

172
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:20,052
holds greater merit

173
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:21,560
than waiting until death.

174
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:23,920
Who knows if it will reach him or not.

175
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:27,474
Yes, as you wish, Ms. Malai.

176
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:29,427
Alright, let us depart.

177
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,149
My sole happiness lies with Ms. Malai.

178
00:09:58,485 --> 00:10:00,070
You still wish to separate her from me?

179
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:01,274
What is your wish?

180
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:02,977
What are you planning to do with me?

181
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:04,500
What do you want?

182
00:10:58,048 --> 00:10:59,368
Thank you, Dech.

183
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,086
I forgot to ask you to turn

184
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:02,493
the Viscount's body over.

185
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:07,325
Is the young master

186
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,520
in good spirits today?

187
00:11:08,723 --> 00:11:10,223
Here to visit your father?

188
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:13,879
He has just drifted off to sleep.

189
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:15,551
Please come again another time.

190
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:18,013
How strange,

191
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:19,278
the Viscount typically isn't

192
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:20,371
asleep at this hour.

193
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:25,448
Given the warm weather today,

194
00:11:25,473 --> 00:11:26,926
he may be feeling fatigued.

195
00:11:27,575 --> 00:11:28,606
It's better to take him

196
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:29,567
to play in the garden.

197
00:11:30,622 --> 00:11:31,622
Alright.

198
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:34,452
Let us go.

199
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,709
Please play in the garden.

200
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,155
Peek A Boo!

201
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:40,248
Peek A Boo!

202
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,209
Despite being burned down,

203
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:51,896
it still manages to sprout again.

204
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:04,845
I was drunk.

205
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:06,373
You were drunk.

206
00:13:06,548 --> 00:13:08,202
We had a great time together.

207
00:13:50,895 --> 00:13:52,598
Why did you done that, my lord?

208
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,277
I acted out of love for you.

209
00:14:00,364 --> 00:14:01,598
I've loved you for a long time,

210
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:03,152
yet you remained unaware.

211
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:04,918
So, I had to resort to this method.

212
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,816
Did you not confess your love for me?

213
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,637
Indeed, my lord,

214
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:10,816
I've said so,

215
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:12,137
but I love you in the way

216
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:13,332
a servant loves their master,

217
00:14:13,356 --> 00:14:14,949
with gratitude for your kindness.

218
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:16,239
But not like this.

219
00:14:27,698 --> 00:14:29,362
If that is the case, then it is time

220
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,089
for you to reciprocate my benevolence.

221
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:32,393
And I have chosen for you

222
00:14:32,402 --> 00:14:33,620
to do so in this manner.

223
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:36,488
My lord...

224
00:14:36,925 --> 00:14:38,182
Without my patronage,

225
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:39,729
you and Fueang wouldn't have

226
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:40,979
had shelter over your heads

227
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:42,018
or sustenance to

228
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:43,517
sustain yourselves comfortably.

229
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:44,550
Is that not true?

230
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,408
What happened to you, my lord?

231
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,443
Why are you looking at me like that?

232
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:45,686
Are you saying...

233
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:54,904
No.

234
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:57,138
I wish to avoid

235
00:15:57,849 --> 00:15:59,466
any further misunderstandings.

236
00:16:02,697 --> 00:16:04,188
Let's just say that I've fulfilled

237
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,634
my duties of taking care of you,

238
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,650
my lord.

239
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:11,946
Until tomorrow, my lord.

240
00:17:58,267 --> 00:18:01,032
Please forgive me, my lord.

241
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:27,618
In this household, besides the viscount,

242
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:29,454
you are the sole mistress, Ms. Malai.

243
00:18:29,516 --> 00:18:30,867
The mistress of this household

244
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,289
is solely Ms. Malai.

00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,822
Please forgive me, my lord.

248
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:39,128
You may sleep in my room.

249
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:41,041
But, Baron...

250
00:19:41,057 --> 00:19:42,057
Just sleep.

251
00:19:44,088 --> 00:19:45,088
Come.

252
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:21,408
Do you understand?

253
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:23,455
No, my lord.

254
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:31,974
Please get up.

255
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,705

to depart with Fueang.

271
00:24:06,635 --> 00:24:07,658
I do not believe you.

272
00:24:07,721 --> 00:24:09,244
You're not departing with Fueang,

273
00:24:09,252 --> 00:24:10,580
you're leaving with Malai!

274
00:24:10,831 --> 00:24:11,854
I won't permit it!

275
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:13,651
I have taken care of you,

276
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:15,597
but you have become ungrateful!

277
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:23,643
I have never forgotten your kindness,

278
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,920
for taking great care of me.

279
00:24:26,385 --> 00:24:27,525
However that kindness

280
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:30,206
and

281
00:24:30,822 --> 00:24:31,807
vengeance

282
00:24:32,432 --> 00:24:33,729
are distinct entities.

283
00:24:34,604 --> 00:24:35,721
Regardless of the actions

284
00:24:35,729 --> 00:24:36,814
directed at me,

285
00:24:36,838 --> 00:24:38,197
I've never complained.

286
00:24:38,815 --> 00:24:40,236
However, instructing Kam

287
00:24:40,682 --> 00:24:42,018
to murder Ms. Malai,

288
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,799
the woman whom I love more dearly

289
00:24:43,824 --> 00:24:44,900
than life itself,

290
00:24:45,924 --> 00:24:47,338
is an offense I cannot pardon.

291
00:25:59,162 --> 00:26:00,739
No! Don't kill the viscount!

292
00:26:03,654 --> 00:26:12,810
(1940 CE)

293
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:15,325
Do you now perceive Dech's

294
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:16,716
malevolence and malice?

295
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,450
He administered poison

296
00:26:22,466 --> 00:26:23,591
to induce paralysis,

297
00:26:24,192 --> 00:26:25,394
then ruthlessly killed

298
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:26,458
him without mercy.

299
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:27,739
A traitorous act.

300
00:26:28,201 --> 00:26:29,552
And where is Dech now?

301
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:31,075
Has he faced the consequences

302
00:26:31,107 --> 00:26:32,012
of his actions

303
00:26:32,036 --> 00:26:33,333
or has he evaded justice?

304
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:37,036
Should you desire to know,

305
00:26:40,748 --> 00:26:43,044
I shall reveal the outcome to you.

306
00:26:44,794 --> 00:26:46,145
Only then will you comprehend

307
00:26:46,185 --> 00:26:47,661
the extent of his wickedness

308
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:51,575
and the anguish I endure.

309
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:35,990
(1920 CE)

310
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:38,451
Thank you, Uan.

311
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:41,841
And how about Ramphoei?

312
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:45,006
Does she ever make an appearance

313
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:46,396
for her morning meal on schedule?

314
00:27:46,412 --> 00:27:47,451
Lately, she tends

315
00:27:47,475 --> 00:27:49,208
to venture out frequently,

316
00:27:49,506 --> 00:27:51,513
I expect her to return around noon.

317
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,319
My dear Uan,

318
00:27:55,521 --> 00:27:57,068
It is not good to gossip your mistress.

319
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:58,849
In this household, besides the viscount,

320
00:27:58,858 --> 00:28:00,591
you are the sole mistress, Ms. Malai.

321
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:02,295
There is no one else.

322
00:28:02,943 --> 00:28:04,482
Uan speaks truthfully, ma'am.

323
00:28:05,037 --> 00:28:06,521
The servants here do not regard

324
00:28:06,537 --> 00:28:08,240
Ms. Ramphoei as their mistress.

325
00:28:10,318 --> 00:28:11,412
And what of Dech?

326
00:28:13,389 --> 00:28:14,389
Dech.

327
00:28:16,131 --> 00:28:17,131
Dech?

328
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:20,615
What is your inquiry, Ms. Malai?

329
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,927
Do you perceive Ramphoei as

330
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:23,326
the mistress of this household?

331
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,912
The mistress of this household

332
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,520
is solely Ms. Malai.

333
00:28:41,227 --> 00:28:42,617
Had Ms. Malai didn't come down

334
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:43,977
to receive her breakfast,

335
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:45,281
I may not have come to attend

336
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,500
to you either, my lord.

337
00:28:51,008 --> 00:28:52,375
This treacherous servant wishes to

338
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,288
assume the role of master of the house!

339
00:28:54,313 --> 00:28:56,313
That's not it. I never thought...

340
00:28:56,532 --> 00:28:57,328

I may not have come to attend

346
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:15,625
to you either, my lord.

347
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:37,099
That's Fueang's voice!

348
00:29:40,115 --> 00:29:41,115
Dech!

349
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,380
What has occurred, Fueang?

350
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,221
The viscount...

351
00:29:51,865 --> 00:29:53,520
The viscount has passed away!

352
00:30:10,115 --> 00:30:11,115
My lord...

353
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,560
This cannot be true.

354
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,380
My lord...

355
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,599
Dech,

356
00:30:49,568 --> 00:30:51,005
you didn't kill him, right?

357
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,613
Uan,

358
00:30:58,832 --> 00:31:00,066
what are you saying?

359
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,816
How could Dech do such a thing?

360
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:04,581
I witnessed Dech exiting

361
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,394
the viscount's chambers last night.

362
00:31:32,012 --> 00:31:33,097
Dech,

363
00:31:34,152 --> 00:31:36,152
is there any truth to Uan's claim?

364
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,472
I only went to check on things, ma'am.

365
00:31:41,121 --> 00:31:43,721
I swear that the viscount

366
00:31:43,738 --> 00:31:45,253
was alive when I departed.

367
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:48,155
If it wasn't you, then who could it be?

368
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:50,667
Why were you present at that late hour?

369
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:53,863
And what kept you in the main hall, Uan?

370
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:55,952
And at that late hour?

371
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:57,792
I was tending to Mr. Mueang, ma'am.

372
00:31:57,801 --> 00:31:59,660
When Mr. Mueang wasn't crying anymore,

373
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:00,761
I went out

374
00:32:01,418 --> 00:32:02,792
and happened to encounter.

375
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:04,433
Dech leaving the viscount's room.

376
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,965
I did not perpetrate this act,

377
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:10,816
Ms. Malai, you must believe me.

378
00:32:13,207 --> 00:32:14,340
Kam,

379
00:32:15,418 --> 00:32:16,707
inform Count Phichit and

380
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:18,785
Ms. Ranchaun of the viscount's passing,

381
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:21,558
and contact the authorities as well.

382
00:32:22,723 --> 00:32:23,949
Understood, Ms. Malai.

383
00:32:26,707 --> 00:32:27,707
Ms. Malai, I...

384
00:32:27,732 --> 00:32:28,941
Nevertheless, we must allow

385
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:30,629
the authorities to handle this matter.

386
00:32:30,654 --> 00:32:32,691
If someone did indeed kill the viscount,

387
00:32:33,457 --> 00:32:35,043
I want to know who it was.

388
00:32:37,297 --> 00:32:38,497
Ms. Malai...

389
00:32:41,532 --> 00:32:43,212
The viscount's passing,

390
00:32:43,524 --> 00:32:45,117
this isn't a small matter.

391
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:47,781
No one can turn a blind eye to this.

392
00:32:52,657 --> 00:32:53,742
Yes, Ms. Malai.

393
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,857
Uan, aid Fueang in tidying up

394
00:32:59,882 --> 00:33:00,997
the spilled breakfast,

395
00:33:03,146 --> 00:33:04,388
ensure no one disturbs

396
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:05,724
the viscount's remains.

397
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:08,083
I don't want the police to accuse us.

398
00:33:08,092 --> 00:33:09,521
Yes, ma'am.

399
00:33:38,413 --> 00:33:39,483
You treacherous servant!

400
00:33:39,491 --> 00:33:40,264
You killed my brother!

401
00:33:40,288 --> 00:33:43,021
My lord! Please, calm down first!

402
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:44,373
There's no room for composure!

403
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:46,319
If not him, then who else could do it?

404
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,757
My lord,

405
00:33:47,781 --> 00:33:48,812
I implore you not to

406
00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:50,062
hastily draw conclusions.

407
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,569
The authorities are coming for

408
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:53,179
a thorough investigation.

409
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:55,163
Why bother with an investigation

410
00:33:55,273 --> 00:33:56,804
when it's glaringly evident that

411
00:33:56,812 --> 00:33:58,265
this treacherous servant has

412
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,874
profited from this tragedy?

413
00:34:01,078 --> 00:34:02,523
Isn't that so, Dech?

414
00:34:04,328 --> 00:34:05,452
Without my brother,

415
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:06,546
you would be living

416
00:34:06,571 --> 00:34:08,141
lavishly in this household,

417
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:09,376
perhaps even daring to

418
00:34:09,401 --> 00:34:10,728
assume the role of master!

419
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,692
That's not it. I never thought...

420
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,132
- Count Phichit!
- Count Phichit!

421
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:19,015
Spare me your excuses! I won't listen!

422
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,382
Your guilt is transparent to me!

423
00:34:22,695 --> 00:34:25,062
You should be dragged to meet your fate!

424
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:27,882
My brother took care of you well,

425
00:34:27,907 --> 00:34:29,757
only to cherish a viper in one's bosom!

426
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,858
Count Phichit, please calm down!

427
00:34:31,883 --> 00:34:33,968
Count Phichit, please!

428
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,749
Count Phichit, please calm down.

429
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:38,187
Let's not have a brawl here.

430
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:39,273
Do not intervene!

431
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:40,827
Take him to prison!

432
00:34:40,852 --> 00:34:42,960
He's the murderer who killed my brother!

433
00:34:42,992 --> 00:34:44,374
We can't do that, my lord.

434
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,601
We need to conduct

435
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:46,632
a proper investigation.

436
00:34:46,657 --> 00:34:47,702
Why waste time?

437
00:34:47,843 --> 00:34:48,960
Don't assume that

438
00:34:49,327 --> 00:34:50,554
I'm unaware, Dech!

439
00:34:52,906 --> 00:34:54,062
Let's step out for now.

440
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:55,413
- Before it'll be messier.
- Yes, sir.

441
00:34:55,671 --> 00:34:56,671
Go on.

442
00:34:58,015 --> 00:34:59,671
I'll have you thrown into prison!

443
00:34:59,695 --> 00:35:01,210
Remember my words, Dech!

444
00:35:11,015 --> 00:35:12,421
You see, Malai?

445
00:35:12,484 --> 00:35:13,991
I told you he's the culprit!

446
00:35:14,664 --> 00:35:16,187
- Let us go.
- Release Dech immediately!

447
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:20,187
Ramphoei.

449
00:35:28,414 --> 00:35:33,335
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

450
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:36,077
Mr. Kam, where were you last night

451
00:35:36,102 --> 00:35:37,960
during the time of the viscount's death?

452
00:35:37,984 --> 00:35:39,030
I was attending to

453
00:35:39,843 --> 00:35:41,788
my child in the servants' quarters, sir.

454
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:42,929
Were you alone?

455
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,444
I witnessed Dech emerging from

456
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,976
the viscount's chambers, sir.

457
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:47,819
His countenance was quite alarming.

458
00:35:47,836 --> 00:35:48,866
I've never seen him

459
00:35:48,882 --> 00:35:50,101
in such a state before.

460
00:35:51,054 --> 00:35:52,288
Aside from Uan,

461
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,773
anyone else see Dech exiting the room?

462
00:35:55,117 --> 00:35:56,304
I was the sole attendant of

463
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,835
Mr. Mueang in the main hall, sir.

464
00:35:57,867 --> 00:35:59,101
It was late,

465
00:35:59,126 --> 00:36:00,696
and I did not anticipate encountering

466
00:36:00,703 --> 00:36:01,898
anyone in that vicinity.

467
00:36:01,945 --> 00:36:03,007
Uan had to

468
00:36:03,812 --> 00:36:05,562
supervise Mr. Mueang in the main hall

469
00:36:05,586 --> 00:36:07,202
as Ms. Ramphoei went outside.

470
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,092
Uan returned to me and my child

471
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
quite late.

472
00:36:10,851 --> 00:36:12,077
Yes, sir.

473
00:36:12,468 --> 00:36:13,694
Since the viscount's accident,

474
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,093
resulting in his paralysis,

475
00:36:15,118 --> 00:36:16,398
Dech has assumed oversight of

476
00:36:16,414 --> 00:36:17,976
all matters within the household.

477
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,538
Oversight of what precisely?

478
00:36:19,648 --> 00:36:21,328
Please elaborate, Uan.

479
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:24,257
He even manages household finances, sir.

480
00:36:24,787 --> 00:36:26,490
With the exception of Ms. Malai,

481
00:36:26,515 --> 00:36:28,140
he holds responsibility for every

482
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:29,382
aspect of this household.

483
00:36:29,406 --> 00:36:30,406
Dammit!

484
00:36:31,296 --> 00:36:33,030
I refuse to let him off easily.

485
00:36:34,389 --> 00:36:36,178
Dech must be expelled immediately!

486
00:36:36,203 --> 00:36:38,003
We cannot harbor a traitor!

487
00:36:38,507 --> 00:36:40,241
I can't do that, my lord.

488
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:41,819
As I've said,

489
00:36:41,844 --> 00:36:43,343
the matter must be handled

490
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:44,788
by the police first.

491
00:36:45,343 --> 00:36:46,632
Are you planning to shelter

492
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,913
a murderer in your household?

493
00:36:47,937 --> 00:36:49,617
You don't truly know him.

494
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,116
Please, calm down, my lord.

495
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:53,952
Your anger isn't helping.

496
00:36:54,585 --> 00:36:56,506
Malai speaks wisely.

497
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:59,216
If Dech is cleared by the authorities

498
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,392
and subsequently expelled,

499
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,310
it would be akin to easily believing

500
00:37:03,334 --> 00:37:04,849
and being biased, my lord.

501
00:37:05,412 --> 00:37:07,012
How could I not be?

502
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,130
Kam has already divulged that

503
00:37:09,155 --> 00:37:10,380
Uan witnessed Dech exiting

504
00:37:10,404 --> 00:37:11,998
the viscount's chambers last night.

505
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:13,880
If it wasn't him, was it done by ghosts?

506
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:16,591
Still, I am hesitant to rush

507
00:37:16,616 --> 00:37:17,834
to judgment, my lord.

508
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:19,818
Dech has been Viscount Wisan's valet

509
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,755
for a long time.

510
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:23,294
It is not uncommon for him to

511
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:25,146
attend to duties late into the night.

512
00:37:25,717 --> 00:37:26,888
Are you siding with

513
00:37:26,904 --> 00:37:28,584
that servant more than

514
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:31,341
with the viscount, your husband?

515
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,107
Think carefully.

516
00:37:34,123 --> 00:37:35,537
Who stands to benefit from

517
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,529
the viscount's death if not Dech?

518
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:53,180
What was your purpose

519
00:37:53,205 --> 00:37:54,727
for entering the viscount's chambers?

520
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:56,665
I entered to ensure all was in order

521
00:37:57,322 --> 00:37:58,720
and to attend to any needs

522
00:37:58,745 --> 00:38:00,393
the viscount might have had, sir.

523
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:02,846
Yet, according to Uan's account,

524
00:38:03,612 --> 00:38:05,877
since the viscount's paralysis,

525
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:07,940
you've assumed control over

526
00:38:07,964 --> 00:38:09,135
household affairs

527
00:38:09,448 --> 00:38:11,448
as though you were the new master.

528
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,627
I've only been doing what I can, sir.

529
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,963
Everything I do is based on

530
00:38:15,988 --> 00:38:17,511
what the viscount taught me.

531
00:38:18,183 --> 00:38:20,752
Do you think I would become ambitious

532
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,541
and betray his trust and kill him?

533
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:25,807
Evading the question will not help.

534
00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:26,877
We have encountered

535
00:38:26,901 --> 00:38:28,245
many scenarios in our line of work.

536
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,409
The viscount's assets

537
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,377
are well-documented.

538
00:38:34,393 --> 00:38:35,830
Tell us plainly,

539
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:37,627
did you enter his chambers

540
00:38:37,659 --> 00:38:39,792
with the intention to kill him?

541
00:38:39,948 --> 00:38:40,995
No, I did not!

542
00:38:41,011 --> 00:38:42,065
If I had,

543
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,534
would I willingly subject myself

544
00:38:43,558 --> 00:38:44,924
to police interrogation?

545
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:45,987
Running away with

546
00:38:46,011 --> 00:38:47,362
his treasure would be easier.

547
00:38:47,378 --> 00:38:49,088
But if you're smart enough,

548
00:38:49,854 --> 00:38:51,721
staying put to prove your innocence

549
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,416
could secure your position

550
00:38:53,425 --> 00:38:54,612
in this household.

551
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:55,940
There will be no need

552
00:38:55,956 --> 00:38:57,049
to escape the authority.

553
00:38:57,074 --> 00:38:58,721
Don't try to persuade us.

554
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,346
There is clear witness to this incident,

555
00:39:01,362 --> 00:39:02,565
and denial won't help!

556
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,198
I maintain that when I departed

557
00:39:04,223 --> 00:39:05,995
the viscount's chambers,

558
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,560
he was alive.

559
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:09,338
If you persist in your defiance,

560
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,526
we are left with no recourse.

561
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,399
What are you going to do?

562
00:39:17,548 --> 00:39:18,938
I haven't done anything wrong!

563
00:39:18,962 --> 00:39:20,250
How will you apprehend me?

564
00:39:20,337 --> 00:39:21,735
Don't resist, Dech.

565
00:39:21,853 --> 00:39:22,954
If you don't comply,

566
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,594
you'll face additional charges.

567
00:39:25,392 --> 00:39:26,461
Please release me.

568
00:39:27,946 --> 00:39:29,586
Presently, we are escorting you

569
00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:31,086
to the station.

570
00:39:31,665 --> 00:39:33,625
Should you confess

571
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,290
or new evidence surface

572
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,538
to exonerate you,

573
00:39:36,563 --> 00:39:38,422
we will reassess the situation.

574
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,250
I haven't done anything wrong!

575
00:39:41,282 --> 00:39:42,969
Please release me this instant!

576
00:39:43,306 --> 00:39:44,766
- Take him away.
- Yes, sir.

577
00:39:45,118 --> 00:39:46,274
Please release me!

578
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,844
Officers, where are you taking Dech?

579
00:39:49,282 --> 00:39:50,282
Ms. Malai...

580
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,610
We are transporting him to the station.

581
00:39:53,548 --> 00:39:55,196
Good. You see, Malai?

582
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:57,032
I told you he's the culprit!

583
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,125
I did not commit this crime!

584
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:03,399
- Let us proceed.
- Yes, sir.

585
00:40:03,681 --> 00:40:05,204
- Let us go.
- Release Dech immediately!

586
00:40:08,142 --> 00:40:09,142
Ramphoei.

587
00:40:13,415 --> 00:40:15,290
He couldn't have killed the viscount

588
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:17,688
because

589
00:40:19,134 --> 00:40:20,814
he was with me all night.

590
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:34,524
What nonsense is this?

591
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:36,422
Uan witnessed Dech

592
00:40:36,438 --> 00:40:38,101
leaving the viscount's room.

593
00:40:38,126 --> 00:40:39,946
How could he have been with you?

594
00:40:40,423 --> 00:40:41,516
Indeed.

595
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:42,961
And why would Dech be

596
00:40:42,978 --> 00:40:44,618
in your quarters late at night?

597
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:47,821
Why not,

598
00:40:48,353 --> 00:40:50,922
When Dech is my lover.

599
00:41:06,056 --> 00:41:07,149
Scandalous!

600
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:08,603
The viscount, your husband,

601
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:09,657
has just passed,

602
00:41:09,682 --> 00:41:11,182
and you're already admitting

603
00:41:11,207 --> 00:41:12,610
to an affair with a servant?

604
00:41:14,134 --> 00:41:15,470
The viscount has been

605
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:16,907
a vegetable for so long,

606
00:41:17,205 --> 00:41:19,696
everyone knows but turns a blind eye.

607
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:23,032
Why can't I look for a new husband?

608
00:41:29,618 --> 00:41:30,906
Is this true, Dech?

609
00:41:31,016 --> 00:41:32,696
Were you with Ramphoei

610
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:34,665
all night.

611
00:41:35,477 --> 00:41:36,477
Is it true?

612
00:41:55,107 --> 00:41:56,262
Once the funeral

613
00:41:56,271 --> 00:41:57,543
for the viscount concludes,

614
00:41:57,567 --> 00:41:59,317
I invite everyone to attend mine

615
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:01,142
and Dech's wedding ceremony.

616
00:42:03,482 --> 00:42:04,482
I...

617
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:09,024
I shall depart for Bu-nga's residence.

618
00:42:09,047 --> 00:42:10,167
No, Ms. Malai.

619
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,774
This household is your domain,

620
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:13,188
you cannot simply depart.

621
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,750
I explicitly advised against it.

622
00:42:15,775 --> 00:42:17,328
Why wouldn't you listen to me?

623
00:42:17,399 --> 00:42:18,399
