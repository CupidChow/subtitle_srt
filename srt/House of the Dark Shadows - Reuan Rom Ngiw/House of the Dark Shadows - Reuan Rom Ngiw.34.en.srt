"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 34)

19
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:00,546
Once the funeral

20
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:01,827
for the viscount concludes,

21
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:03,601
I invite everyone to attend mine

22
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:05,426
and Dech's wedding ceremony.

23
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
I...

24
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:13,188
I shall depart for Bu-nga's residence.

25
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,386
No, Ms. Malai.

26
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:15,993
This household is your domain,

27
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:17,407
you cannot simply depart.

28
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:19,969
I explicitly advised against it.

29
00:02:19,994 --> 00:02:21,547
Why wouldn't you listen to me?

30
00:02:21,618 --> 00:02:22,618
Dech!

31
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,867
Go, and tranquility will

32
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:43,938
reign in this household!

33
00:02:43,962 --> 00:02:45,321
My husband and I can finally

34
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:46,383
dwell together!

35
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,353
Let us depart, Fueang.

36
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:56,033
Ms. Malai!

37
00:02:56,228 --> 00:02:57,228
Dech!

38
00:02:58,025 --> 00:02:59,384
And what say you, Dech?

39
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:00,665
Does the woman you love

40
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:02,087
reciprocate your affections?

41
00:03:06,517 --> 00:03:08,134
Please don't go, Ms. Malai.

42
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:11,502
I have no reason to stay, Dech.

43
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:13,248
Ramphoei is right.

44
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:15,869
I am merely a caretaker,

45
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:18,962
My duties are over, I should leave.

46
00:03:29,151 --> 00:03:30,572
Don't say that, please.

47
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:32,642
You know the reason

48
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,502
why I wish for you to stay.

49
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:36,299
If you're going to say

50
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:37,378
it's because you love me,

51
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:38,760
I implore you to desist.

52
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:49,811
It's clear that I'm an outsider here.

53
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,873
Please stay with your wife and child.

54
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:55,490
I have no desire to impede anyone's joy.

55
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,256
Let us depart, Fueang.

56
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:02,632
Ms. Malai!

57
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:39,722
I instructed you to bring Dech along,

58
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,136
so why are you here alone?

59
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,456
Dech had some tasks to attend to, ma'am.

60
00:04:43,464 --> 00:04:44,839
He requested me to deliver

61
00:04:44,863 --> 00:04:45,925
the funds to you.

62
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:53,253
Why would Dech have

63
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:54,776
external tasks to attend to?

64
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:10,558
I won't allow you to leave!

65
00:05:10,574 --> 00:05:11,956
Are you intending to visit Malai?

66
00:05:11,972 --> 00:05:13,581
Don't presume that I am oblivious.

67
00:05:15,003 --> 00:05:17,019
Yes, I'm going to see Ms. Malai,

68
00:05:17,738 --> 00:05:18,938
and what of it?

69
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:26,769
How dare you speak so boldly?

70
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,308
Everyone knows that we are

71
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:29,847
about to get married!

72
00:05:30,082 --> 00:05:31,379
You are my husband.

73
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,050
How can you utter such words?

74
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,613
That's all in your imagination.

75
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:36,903
I never consented or agreed to it.

76
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:39,355
Very well!

77
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:41,254
You want to challenge me, Dech?

78
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:43,863
I'll inform the authorities that

79
00:05:44,238 --> 00:05:45,629
I may have misremembered

80
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:46,715
the events of the night

81
00:05:46,738 --> 00:05:47,793
the viscount died.

82
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:56,559
Oh dear.

83
00:05:57,105 --> 00:05:58,722
I thought you wouldn't be afraid.

84
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:00,558
You're all talk and no action.

85
00:06:03,004 --> 00:06:05,035
Remember that

86
00:06:05,472 --> 00:06:08,691
that now you're my lapdog.

87
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:11,039
Don't you dare defy me again.

88
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:24,099
Dech.

89
00:06:36,794 --> 00:06:38,270
Um, I've brought items from

90
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:40,395
Count Phichit for the funeral service.

91
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:44,450
How long have you been here?

92
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:45,614
I just arrived.

93
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:47,708
Where should I place these?

94
00:06:48,122 --> 00:06:50,083
My lord has sent a significant amount.

95
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,684
Then I'll dispatch some staff

96
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,919
to help carry them over.

97
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:54,481
Thank you. Please do.

98
00:07:05,237 --> 00:07:06,237
Kam,

99
00:07:06,503 --> 00:07:07,565
do you think

100
00:07:07,605 --> 00:07:08,964
he'll hear about Dech arguing

101
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:10,112
with Ms. Ramphoei?

102
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:11,315
I'm uncertain,

103
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:14,096
if this matter reaches the Count's ears,

104
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:16,706
Dech will be in trouble.

105
00:07:53,002 --> 00:07:54,540
I knew you would be here.

106
00:07:56,384 --> 00:07:57,478
What do you want?

107
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,165
I thought you didn't want to

108
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,142
see me anymore.

109
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,353
Why?

110
00:08:02,378 --> 00:08:04,166
I've come to see for myself whether

111
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:05,946
you've lost hope and contemplated

112
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:07,142
leaping into the water.

113
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,696
I've persevered this far,

114
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:17,674
I won't die so easily.

115
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:27,207
If anyone is to meet their demise,

116
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:28,751
it would be others,

117
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,551
not me.

118
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:31,919
Dech!

119
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:33,559
Refrain from such jests.

120
00:08:33,575 --> 00:08:34,950
Why can't I speak?

121
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:37,129
I'm already as good as being dead.

122
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:38,746
Ms. Ramphoei exerts pressure

123
00:08:38,763 --> 00:08:40,004
on me from every angle.

124
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:41,754
I find myself in a precarious situation.

125
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:51,840
Ms. Malai harbors no faith in me.

126
00:08:52,192 --> 00:08:54,254
She won't even let me look at her face.

127
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:56,348
She doesn't even think about the times

128
00:08:56,356 --> 00:08:57,356
we ran away together.

129
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:05,234
Dech, enough.

130
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,203
Don't drink anymore.

131
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,922
You're drunk, are you aware?

132
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:10,492
Go, sleep.

133
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:11,789
- Hey!
- Hey!

134
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:12,805
Get lost!

135
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,321
Leave!

(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

137
00:09:57,239 --> 00:10:02,160
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

138
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:15,120
You're really getting bold now.

139
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:17,432
Coming into my room without knocking.

140
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:19,284
Have you forgotten all respect for me?

141
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,776
I never regarded you as a master.

142
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:23,432
A woman with your loose morals,

143
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,112
wherever you go, trouble follows.

144
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:26,260
Why should I respect a

145
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:27,284
promiscuous woman like you?

146
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,643
Your words are crossing a line!

147
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:29,870
There is no line to cross!

148
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,916
You're both shameless and sinful.

149
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:33,862
Despite the man's disinterest,

150
00:10:33,878 --> 00:10:35,534
you persistently pursued him!

151
00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:40,901
- Ouch!
- Get out!

152
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:42,922
- Fueang!
- Oww!

153
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:45,127
Scram!

154
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:50,362
Damn you, Ramphoei!

155
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,604
You dare insult me in my own domain?

156
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:58,752
Don't assume I'll let you leave easily!

157
00:11:03,948 --> 00:11:05,228
- Come!
- Let go!

158
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:07,073
Let me slap you!

159
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:09,424
- Ms. Ramphoei!
- Ms. Ramphoei!

160
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:10,698
Please stop!

161
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:11,972
Let go!

162
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:13,308
Let go!

163
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:16,401
Kam, I order you to let go!

164
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:17,667
Let go!

165
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:20,096
I can't, ma'am!

166
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,472
If I let you go,

167
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,018
Fueang might miscarry.

168
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:24,237
Let her miscarry then!

169
00:11:24,472 --> 00:11:25,620
She overestimates herself

170
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:26,651
and insults me.

171
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:28,658
She deserves to be slapped. Let go!

172
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:30,659
Leave now. It's getting worse

173
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:31,752
the longer you stay.

174
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:34,463
Remember my words.

175
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:36,901
Someone like you will surely go to hell,

176
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:38,199
you malevolent woman!

177
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,877
Damn you, Fueang! Come here!

178
00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:42,557
Come and let me slap you!

179
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:45,276
Let go!

180
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Leave!

181
00:11:53,023 --> 00:11:54,086
Damn you, Fueang!

182
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:55,351
You arrogant wretch!

183
00:11:55,844 --> 00:11:57,109
Do not assume that

184
00:11:57,531 --> 00:11:59,101
because you carry Dech's child,

185
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:00,695
I will tread lightly!

186
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,757
Look at what Ramphoei did to you.

187
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:10,312
You're covered in wounds.

188
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:12,304
Oh, Fueang, if you confront

189
00:12:12,313 --> 00:12:13,772
with Ms. Ramphoei like this,

190
00:12:13,797 --> 00:12:15,539
how will you manage to remain here?

191
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:17,968
I don't know.

192
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:19,445
If I can't stay, then I won't.

193
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:21,460
I have no desire to remain here.

194
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:24,937
But if you leave, where will you go?

195
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:27,546
If you encounter Ms. Ramphoei again,

196
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:29,375
there will likely be more trouble.

197
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,656
Kam and I might not be

198
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:31,724
able to intervene in time.

199
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:33,437
What if you end up miscarrying?

200
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:37,500
I cannot bear to

201
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:39,453
witness Dech being tormented

202
00:12:39,469 --> 00:12:40,843
by that woman, Ramphoei.

203
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:43,062
The mere thought of it infuriates me.

204
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,726
I am tempted to slap her again.

205
00:12:45,836 --> 00:12:46,836
Fueang,

206
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,367
it's not your business.

207
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:49,906
What are your plans now?

208
00:12:49,922 --> 00:12:51,421
After a confrontation like this,

209
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:53,492
that Ramphoei woman won't spare you.

210
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:14,147
I've just provided you with funds,

211
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:15,842
and it hasn't even been a month yet.

212
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,397
You understand me too well.

213
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:19,006
I refuse to give you more.

214
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:20,523
But I will obtain it.

215
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,288
This money isn't something you can

216
00:13:30,313 --> 00:13:31,952
simply demand whenever you please.

217
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,006
No matter how rich you are,

218
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,116
no one becomes wealthy by squandering it.

219
00:13:38,296 --> 00:13:40,514
You possess this wealth because of me

220
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:42,835
I can use it however I want.

221
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:44,217
If you don't want to fulfill

222
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:45,342
the duties of a husband,

223
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,288
then fulfill those of a breadwinner.

224
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,530
You decide.

225
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:13,257
I can only give you this much.

226
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:14,976
The funds in the safe are intended

227
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:16,773
for the purchase of additional land.

228
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:18,742
Try to save a bit.

229
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,929
Wait until the salary is out.

230
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:44,205
I'm losing my sanity.

231
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:57,885
Fueang,

232
00:16:57,971 --> 00:16:59,854
there's no need for you to bow to me.

233
00:17:01,643 --> 00:17:03,252
That's impossible, Ms. Malai.

234
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:05,604
I'm intruding upon you here.

235
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,057
How can I not seek forgiveness?

236
00:17:08,463 --> 00:17:10,143
You're not intruding.

237
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:12,354
You should already know

238
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,588
that I'm the one who

239
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:15,293
understands you the best.

240
00:17:15,753 --> 00:17:17,182
How are things at home?

241
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:19,072
Is it so intolerable?

242
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:24,440
Ms. Ramphoei never allows

243
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:25,721
peace in the household.

244
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:28,400
She's always commanding the servants.

245
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:30,619
Even Dech is constantly summoned

246
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:32,229
and intimidated day and night,

247
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:33,322
so much that he can't

248
00:17:33,331 --> 00:17:34,338
focus on his duties.

249
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:35,775
It's true, ma'am.

250
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:37,252
With each passing day,

251
00:17:37,277 --> 00:17:38,957
she grows more haughty.

252
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:40,932
No one can restrain her.

253
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:42,549
Indeed, we have no right

254
00:17:42,574 --> 00:17:43,822
to argue with her.

255
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:46,205
Or we might suffer as Fueang has.

256
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,260
Truly unfortunate.

257
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:51,690
Fueang is welcome to stay here

258
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:54,354
as my attendant.

259
00:17:55,034 --> 00:17:56,221
I don't mind.

260
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:58,830
However, I have limited finances,

261
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:01,440
so I hope you won't mind.

262
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:03,275
It's not a problem, Ms. Malai.

263
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,979
I am content to remain with you.

264
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:07,166
Hell is not a location,

265
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:09,322
but a mental state.

266
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:15,315
Come.

267
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,340
Let me see.

268
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:19,527
Does it hurt?

269
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:23,065
Are you alright?

270
00:18:23,331 --> 00:18:24,331
Yes, ma'am.

271
00:18:30,221 --> 00:18:31,741
Selling well today?

272
00:18:31,745 --> 00:18:33,838
Not really, ma'am. Please buy some.

273
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,955
I'll buy some later.

274
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:35,963
Yes, ma'am.

275
00:18:35,979 --> 00:18:38,338
Then I'll have 10 grams.

276
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:41,854
I'll have this, and this too.

277
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,830
And five more of this.

278
00:18:44,354 --> 00:18:45,416
I'll come back later.

279
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:47,495
Good luck.

280
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,065
Do you believe I would

281
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:01,252
release you so easily?

282
00:19:01,276 --> 00:19:03,315
We're both in the same boat now,

283
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:05,486
with our child, our wealth,

284
00:19:06,026 --> 00:19:07,783
and our secrets.

285
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:10,221
No one belongs together like us.

286
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:12,463
Helping me is like helping yourself.

287
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,424
I've never considered it a favor.

288
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,400
If you dare speak like this,

289
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:18,932
I'll publicly condemn your wickedness.

290
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,947
Let's see who will lose first.

291
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:24,501
You wouldn't dare.

292
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,471
Perhaps I would.

293
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,260
I always attain what I desire,

294
00:19:29,463 --> 00:19:30,846
and if not,

295
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:33,277
then no one does.

296
00:19:34,768 --> 00:19:37,533
You won't have your way for long.

297
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:41,158
We shall see.

298
00:19:41,276 --> 00:19:42,463
Because I doubt you

299
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:44,705
possess the courage to defy me.

300
00:20:03,606 --> 00:20:05,121
Ms. Malai,

301
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:07,332
please forgive my persistence,

302
00:20:07,762 --> 00:20:08,824
but I believe

303
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,895
you should consider giving

304
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,600
Dech another opportunity.

305
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,480
I have extended numerous chances to Dech.

306
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,621
All I've received in return

307
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,129
is heartache.

308
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,066
If I agree again,

309
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:25,832
I'd be foolish.

310
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:31,781
Since your departure from the household,

311
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:33,703
Dech has taken to excessive drinking.

312
00:20:34,586 --> 00:20:37,119
I'm afraid he'll drink himself to death.

313
00:20:37,782 --> 00:20:39,656
There's nothing I can do about that.

314
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,297
Dech chooses his own path.

315
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:43,063
Ms. Malai,

316
00:20:44,406 --> 00:20:46,156
there is someone here to see you.

317
00:20:47,008 --> 00:20:48,203
It must be Dech,

318
00:20:48,555 --> 00:20:49,633
as I suspected.

319
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,449
As I said, he misses Ms. Malai a lot.

320
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:52,969
As I've stated,

321
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:54,399
I don't want to see anyone.

322
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,212
Inform him I decline to meet.

323
00:20:58,141 --> 00:20:59,141
Ms. Malai...

324
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:00,227
Please, just go.

325
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:01,586
Understood, I will inform

326
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:02,773
Seng, the merchant,

327
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:04,531
that you decline to meet him.

328
00:21:04,594 --> 00:21:05,820
Wait, please.

329
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:07,633
Who is seeking an audience with me?

330
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,133
It's Seng, the merchant, ma'am.

331
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:11,938
As today marks the end of the month,

332
00:21:11,962 --> 00:21:13,866
he has arrived to deliver the goods

333
00:21:13,891 --> 00:21:15,491
and collect the payment himself.

334
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,188
Please instruct him to wait.

335
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:19,539
I shall retrieve the funds.

336
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:20,844
Yes, ma'am.

337
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,015
Is this the one who yearns for me?

338
00:21:33,555 --> 00:21:34,867
Oh, Dech, oh, Dech.

339
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:36,695
I've done all I could to assist you.

340
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:37,758
Where are you now?

341
00:21:50,995 --> 00:21:52,495
May I accompany you home?

342
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,588
That won't be necessary, handsome.

343
00:21:56,604 --> 00:21:57,932
I can manage on my own.

344
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:00,144
Perhaps another time.

345
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:01,690
I'll allow you to

346
00:22:01,706 --> 00:22:04,010
escort me all the way to my room.

347
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:07,698
With your handsome appearance,

348
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:09,455
I'll seek you out next time.

349
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,327
If you've really done something wrong,

350
00:22:47,352 --> 00:22:48,860
there's nothing I can do to help.

352
00:22:55,969 --> 00:23:00,890
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

353
00:23:49,813 --> 00:23:51,281
The fireflies are as beautiful

354
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,672
as the stars in the sky,

355
00:23:53,446 --> 00:23:55,779
shining so close for us to admire.

356
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:57,758
Although I cannot reach

357
00:23:57,783 --> 00:23:59,223
the stars for you,

358
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:00,867
I can certainly catch

359
00:24:00,892 --> 00:24:02,572
the fireflies, Ms. Malai.

360
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:04,883
You can place it beneath your pillow.

361
00:24:04,923 --> 00:24:06,610
It may bring you sweet dreams.

362
00:24:06,915 --> 00:24:08,547
What dreams can someone like me

363
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,789
still harbor in this life?

364
00:24:10,188 --> 00:24:13,195
I vow to protect you

365
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:15,422
and bring you happiness.

366
00:24:15,992 --> 00:24:17,249
Please trust me.

367
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,076
Yet, you are the father of my child!

368
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,749
If I forbid you from leaving,

369
00:24:28,774 --> 00:24:30,077
then you simply cannot!

370
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,632
Please desist. The more you speak,

371
00:24:31,657 --> 00:24:33,358
the more you reveal about yourself.

372
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:34,598
And what of it?

373
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:36,711
Go wherever you desire!

374
00:24:36,874 --> 00:24:39,007
I won't permit you to take my husband!

375
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:40,272
Do you get it, you mistress?

376
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:26,077
Help me!

377
00:25:26,093 --> 00:25:27,655
Let go, help!

378
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:28,968
Help!

379
00:26:16,094 --> 00:26:17,548
Do you miss Dech, ma'am?

380
00:26:23,775 --> 00:26:25,142
Not in the least.

381
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:26,985
Please refrain from speculating.

382
00:26:28,845 --> 00:26:30,314
I'm not speculating, ma'am.

383
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:32,220
But even from this proximity,

384
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:33,674
you remain oblivious.

385
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,524
It's evident that someone is

386
00:26:36,634 --> 00:26:39,056
preoccupying your thoughts?

387
00:26:40,384 --> 00:26:41,579
Even if I do miss Dech,

388
00:26:41,588 --> 00:26:42,829
that's all it amounts to.

389
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,742
I won't allow someone like Ramphoei

390
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:46,806
to accuse me of stealing a husband.

391
00:26:47,142 --> 00:26:49,025
Ms. Malai came into the picture first...

392
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,220
If I came first,

393
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,837
Dech should have remained

394
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:53,017
faithful to me instead

395
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:55,241
of clandestinely visiting Ramphoei.

396
00:26:55,588 --> 00:26:58,188
What if Dech didn't betray you, ma'am?

397
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,110
If that were the case,

398
00:27:00,273 --> 00:27:01,538
it implies that Ramphoei

399
00:27:01,563 --> 00:27:02,765
intentionally aided Dech

400
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,150
in evading suspicion,

401
00:27:05,766 --> 00:27:07,150
which would suggest Dech

402
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,157
is the murderer.

403
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:43,741
Help...

404
00:27:51,241 --> 00:27:52,241
Help...

405
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,132
Help...

406
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:01,708

Why do you return at this hour?

422
00:30:39,162 --> 00:30:40,435
I went to find Ms. Malai.

423
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:42,211
What is wrong?

424
00:30:45,883 --> 00:30:47,695
Something happen to young master Mueang?

425
00:30:50,812 --> 00:30:51,921
It's Ms. Ramphoei.

426
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:52,960
Ms. Ramphoei?

427
00:30:53,054 --> 00:30:54,343
She's deceased.

428
00:31:07,562 --> 00:31:08,562
Eek!

429
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:09,984
Hey, isn't that someone from

430
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:11,109
the House of the Dark Shadows?

431
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,515
Yes, it's Dech.

432
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,655
Isn't he rumored to be

433
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:17,015
the husband of that woman?

434
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,687
Oh my.

435
00:31:18,703 --> 00:31:19,937
Did he perhaps murder

436
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,296
his wife for her wealth?

437
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:22,782
You're right.

438
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:24,600
The viscount, the household's owner,

439
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:25,609
recently died.

440
00:31:25,641 --> 00:31:27,131
His body hasn't even been cremated yet.

441
00:31:30,383 --> 00:31:32,343
From the House of the Dark Shadows?

442
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,250
Yes, sir.

443
00:31:34,547 --> 00:31:35,937
I'd like to invite you to provide

444
00:31:35,968 --> 00:31:37,601
some information at the station.

445
00:31:38,484 --> 00:31:39,648
Certainly.

446
00:31:39,687 --> 00:31:41,382
I am willing to cooperate fully.

447
00:31:42,828 --> 00:31:44,348
Officer, bring him.

448
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,720
- This way.
- Oh, thank you.

449
00:31:58,178 --> 00:31:59,178
Ms. Malai! Uan.

450
00:31:59,203 --> 00:32:00,021
Uan,

451
00:32:00,046 --> 00:32:02,014
What's the matter? Why the rush?

452
00:32:02,163 --> 00:32:03,803
Ms. Ramphoei has died, ma'am.

453
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,818
Currently, Dech has been taken

454
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:07,037
to the police station.

455
00:32:09,522 --> 00:32:11,202
How did Ramphoei died?

456
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:12,850
Why was Dech arrested?

457
00:32:12,944 --> 00:32:14,553
Uan, please give me all the details.

458
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:15,670
This morning,

459
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:17,896
someone discovered Ms. Ramphoei's body.

460
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,303
She was stabbed to death.

461
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:21,471
Now, Dech is the prime suspect.

462
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:23,334
Oh no, Dech!

463
00:32:24,186 --> 00:32:26,853
Uan, arrange for a rickshaw immediately.

464
00:32:27,373 --> 00:32:28,904
Where are you headed, ma'am?

465
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:31,076
To the police station, without delay!

466
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:32,240
Right away, ma'am!

467
00:32:33,655 --> 00:32:35,068
- Ah, Fueang,
- Yes, ma'am?

468
00:32:35,084 --> 00:32:36,420
Kindly fetch my bag for me.

469
00:32:36,445 --> 00:32:37,445
Yes, ma'am.

470
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:44,549
The fact that you're here to help me

471
00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:46,447
means you still care about me right?

472
00:32:48,353 --> 00:32:49,759
Don't misunderstand, Dech.

473
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:51,267
I'm just here to see

474
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:54,228
if there's anything I can do

475
00:32:54,244 --> 00:32:55,720
to help according to my duty.

476
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,931
If you've really done something wrong,

477
00:32:57,955 --> 00:32:59,635
there's nothing I can do to help.

478
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,564
He did it! You know nothing about Dech!

479
00:33:03,073 --> 00:33:04,541
Count Phichit, Ms. Ranchaun,

480
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:05,752
why are you here?

481
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,392
I'm here to rescue my nephew from

482
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:09,189
the clutches of this criminal scum!

483
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:10,861
Ever since he came into power,

484
00:33:10,893 --> 00:33:12,510
there have been endless troubles.

485
00:33:12,846 --> 00:33:14,478
People dying like leaves falling.

486
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,306
If I leave my nephew here,

487
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:17,697
he'll be the next victim.

488
00:33:18,487 --> 00:33:19,783
Count Phichit is right.

489
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:21,478
Regardless, Mueang must come with us

490
00:33:21,494 --> 00:33:22,978
and stay at our place from now on.

491
00:33:31,955 --> 00:33:32,978
You can't take

492
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:33,908
Mr. Mueang, Count Phichit!

493
00:33:35,463 --> 00:33:37,400
Why not? He's my nephew,

494
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:39,799
my kin, my family!

495
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:40,970
You're unrelated.

496
00:33:40,994 --> 00:33:42,658
I've been responsible for his upbringing

497
00:33:42,674 --> 00:33:43,713
since he was a child.

498
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,095
And in this legal matter,

499
00:33:45,112 --> 00:33:47,041
I'm merely a suspect, not a murderer.

500
00:33:47,588 --> 00:33:48,908
I haven't killed anyone!

501
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:50,635
You have no reason to

502
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:51,791
take Mr. Mueang away.

503
00:33:51,807 --> 00:33:52,807
No reason?

504
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:54,166
My nephew carries

505
00:33:54,191 --> 00:33:55,861
the bloodline of Father!

506
00:33:56,698 --> 00:33:58,150
You have no rights over him,

507
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,033
or is Mueang your child, Dech?

508
00:34:04,174 --> 00:34:05,455
But I have evidence to

509
00:34:05,471 --> 00:34:07,439
substantiate my legal guardianship

510
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:08,752
of Mr. Mueang.

511
00:34:19,014 --> 00:34:20,505
This document grants me legal authority

512
00:34:20,537 --> 00:34:21,537
to care for Mr. Mueang.

513
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:22,561
Crafty!

514
00:34:23,037 --> 00:34:24,435
A scoundrel like you will never

515
00:34:24,443 --> 00:34:26,185
lay claim to my family's wealth.

516
00:34:26,217 --> 00:34:27,217

519
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:41,299
I urge Count Phichit and

520
00:34:41,324 --> 00:34:43,581
Ms. Ranchaun to try to remain calm.

521
00:34:44,112 --> 00:34:46,779
How can we possibly remain calm, Malai?

522
00:34:47,214 --> 00:34:48,768
Will you let the viscount's child

523
00:34:48,823 --> 00:34:49,917
be cared for by that ungrateful servant

524
00:34:49,942 --> 00:34:51,354
who killed the viscount?

525
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:53,682
It still hasn't been proven.

526
00:34:53,707 --> 00:34:55,604
Even the police haven't concluded yet

527
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,206
that Dech is the one who did it.

528
00:34:58,003 --> 00:34:59,128
Oh, dear Malai,

529
00:34:59,355 --> 00:35:00,909
don't digress now.

530
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,385
It's obvious from the circumstances

531
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:06,150
that it could only be Dech.

532
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,182
You should also come live with us.

533
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:13,370
Thank you for your concern,

534
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:15,784
but I am currently comfortable

535
00:35:15,808 --> 00:35:17,096
at Bu-nga's residence.

536
00:35:18,581 --> 00:35:19,581
Very well.

537
00:35:20,636 --> 00:35:21,885
My worry is now that

538
00:35:22,402 --> 00:35:24,142
Ramphoei is gone, the responsibility

539
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:25,626
for managing the assets and

540
00:35:25,651 --> 00:35:27,024
caring for Mueang

541
00:35:27,049 --> 00:35:28,368
falls upon you

542
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,946
as the viscount's primary wife.

543
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:33,485
I fear Dech may become ambitious enough

544
00:35:33,837 --> 00:35:35,353
to consider harming you and

545
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,407
Mueang to seize control of the assets.

546
00:35:38,212 --> 00:35:39,298
Ms. Ranchaun.

547
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,298
Please don't look at Dech

548
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,556
in too negative a light.

549
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:48,321
Judging others unfairly without evidence

550
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:50,403
or reason serves no purpose.

551
00:35:50,736 --> 00:35:52,181
No matter how good they are,

552
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:53,384
we won't see it.

553
00:35:54,134 --> 00:35:56,603
It will be meaningless.

554
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:00,591
In my view, let's wait for the police to

555
00:36:00,615 --> 00:36:02,052
conclude their investigation

556
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,692
before making any judgments.

00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:29,205
This document grants me legal authority

561
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:30,329
to care for Mr. Mueang

562
00:36:30,353 --> 00:36:32,345
and manage all of the viscount's assets

563
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,703
until Mr. Mueang reaches adulthood.

564
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,681
You forged it, didn't you?

565
00:36:37,518 --> 00:36:38,642
Ramphoei wouldn't have had

566
00:36:38,658 --> 00:36:39,900
the capacity to write this!

567
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:41,767
It's true that Ramphoei didn't write it,

568
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:44,540
but she consented to its creation.

569
00:36:44,565 --> 00:36:46,150
Her signature is there to attest to it.

570
00:36:50,244 --> 00:36:51,376
Crafty!

571
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:53,900
Who even knows if Ramphoei could read?

572
00:36:54,408 --> 00:36:55,970
You might have written it

573
00:36:56,143 --> 00:36:57,580
and told her to sign!

574
00:36:57,838 --> 00:36:58,978
Regardless,

575
00:36:59,189 --> 00:37:00,970
Ramphoei did sign it, my lord.

576
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:02,408
Is this why

577
00:37:03,877 --> 00:37:05,557
you murdered Ramphoei?

578
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:07,275
To eliminate any obstacles to

579
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,189
your control over the family's assets?

580
00:37:10,283 --> 00:37:11,963
You despicable fiend!

581
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,267
Know that you have no right

582
00:37:17,275 --> 00:37:19,158
to take Mr. Mueang away from here.

583
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:23,525
Mark my words,

584
00:37:24,447 --> 00:37:25,955
a scoundrel like you will never

585
00:37:25,963 --> 00:37:27,603
lay claim to my family's wealth.

586
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:28,619
You villain!

587
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:45,197
I'm very glad that you agreed

588
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,416
to meet me like this, Ms. Malai.

589
00:37:48,987 --> 00:37:50,744
I just want to come make merit

590
00:37:50,963 --> 00:37:51,924
and also

591
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,680
to talk to you clearly.

592
00:37:56,088 --> 00:37:58,486
What would you like to discuss with me?

593
00:38:00,057 --> 00:38:01,720
I'll speak to you straightforwardly.

594
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,853
While I went to help you

595
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:03,923
with Ramphoei's case,

596
00:38:03,947 --> 00:38:05,674
I didn't fully believe in my heart

597
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:07,377
that you didn't kill everyone.

598
00:38:07,705 --> 00:38:08,705
Ms. Malai...

599
00:38:09,174 --> 00:38:10,854
I must speak honestly,

600
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,830
it's not just about Ramphoei,

601
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:14,814
but also the viscount,

602
00:38:15,682 --> 00:38:16,947
Chaem,

603
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:18,482
or even Saeng.

604
00:38:20,963 --> 00:38:23,048
I want to believe you didn't do it,

605
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:24,226
But I have to admit

606
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:26,642
you do seem suspicious.

607
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,754
If you really want me to return

608
00:38:31,763 --> 00:38:33,091
to the House of Dark Shadows,

609
00:38:33,115 --> 00:38:34,661
you'll have to find a way to prove

610
00:38:34,669 --> 00:38:35,949
to me that you didn't kill anyone.

611
00:38:35,973 --> 00:38:37,145
Can you do that?

612
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:50,723
If I'm truly the murderer

613
00:38:50,748 --> 00:38:52,325
who killed people as believed,

614
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:54,075
whether it be the viscount,

615
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:56,083
Ms. Ramphoei, Chaem

616
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,208
or Saeng,

617
00:38:57,786 --> 00:38:59,434
may the karma from my actions

618
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,895
cause me to die within

619
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:02,511
three to seven days.

620
00:39:02,872 --> 00:39:04,286
What are you doing, Dech?

621
00:39:05,122 --> 00:39:06,450
I am making an oath.

622
00:39:08,677 --> 00:39:10,825
If I am the murderer as you suspect,

623
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:12,762
and if the Lord is truly divine,

624
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,489
he'd hasten the karma to

625
00:39:14,505 --> 00:39:16,294
cause my death according to my oath.

626
00:39:17,114 --> 00:39:19,262
This is not something to take lightly.

627
00:39:19,778 --> 00:39:21,520
Withdraw your oath immediately.

628
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:24,908
Why should I withdraw it?

629
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:27,025
Since I know full well

630
00:39:27,057 --> 00:39:28,791
what I did and did not do.

631
00:39:29,229 --> 00:39:30,471
I did not kill anyone.

632
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:32,119
I have no way of dying

633
00:39:32,143 --> 00:39:33,291
according to my oath.

634
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,518
Now it's up to only you, Ms. Malai,

635
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:38,760
to believe me or not.

636
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,984
Won't you give me a chance, Ms. Malai?

637
00:40:00,891 --> 00:40:02,891
I need some time to consider it.

638
00:40:03,462 --> 00:40:04,906
But I want you to return to

639
00:40:04,922 --> 00:40:06,899
the House of The Dark Shadows with me,

640
00:40:06,915 --> 00:40:09,727
Now no one will obstruct our happiness.

641
00:40:10,227 --> 00:40:11,258
You also rightfully

642
00:40:11,274 --> 00:40:12,954
deserve to live there.

643
00:40:13,087 --> 00:40:15,328
I want to live with you, Ms. Malai.

644
00:40:16,273 --> 00:40:17,476
There will be no better

645
00:40:17,492 --> 00:40:18,694
opportunity than right now.

646
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:21,726
We don't need a formal marriage.

647
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:24,384
Just being together is what matters.

648
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:31,226
Then I have a condition.

649
00:40:32,976 --> 00:40:33,976
Yes, Ms. Malai?

650
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,702
It's good that you've moved back here,

651
00:40:48,711 --> 00:40:50,398
and bringing Ms. Bu-nga as well

652
00:40:50,423 --> 00:40:51,884
will put your mind at ease.

653
00:40:52,093 --> 00:40:53,741
That's what I was thinking too.

654
00:40:56,312 --> 00:40:58,007
It's good that Dech agreed,

655
00:40:59,297 --> 00:41:01,241
and even prepared the rooms.

656
00:41:02,851 --> 00:41:04,835
Consider this a new beginning, ma'am.

657
00:41:05,156 --> 00:41:06,859
There are no other people here now.

658
00:41:06,945 --> 00:41:08,577
I hope it turns out as you say.

659
00:41:10,312 --> 00:41:12,132
I don't want any more misfortune.

660
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,804
It's a pity, ma'am,

661
00:41:21,898 --> 00:41:23,999
if only she regained consciousness now,

662
00:41:24,476 --> 00:41:26,676
she'd surely get chatty with you.

663
00:41:29,336 --> 00:41:30,499
You speak the truth,

664
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,710
but if she awoke she wouldn't

665
00:41:32,718 --> 00:41:33,749
need to stay here.

666
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:38,171
Ever since Ms. Bu-nga fell ill,

667
00:41:38,616 --> 00:41:40,327
the house has been so quiet.

668
00:41:40,507 --> 00:41:41,663
Speaking of what makes

669
00:41:41,687 --> 00:41:42,859
one miss her, ma'am.

670
00:41:46,181 --> 00:41:50,251
I believe Bu-nga will recover soon.

671
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:53,102
Someone like Bu-nga

672
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:54,927
wouldn't give up so easily,

673
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:58,204
right Bu-nga?

674
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,009
- Dech!
- Ms. Bu-nga!

675
00:42:14,306 --> 00:42:15,506
The viscount...

676
00:42:20,296 --> 00:42:21,416
Remember, Dech,

677
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,256
nothing ever happened tonight.

678
00:42:31,921 --> 00:42:33,147
Did you see that Ms. Malai

679
00:42:33,172 --> 00:42:34,451
finished it by herself?

680
00:42:34,522 --> 00:42:35,717
Ms. Malai brought it to eat

681
00:42:35,725 --> 00:42:36,787
at Ms. Bu-nga's room.

682
00:42:42,452 --> 00:42:44,139
If Dech killed everyone,

683
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:45,779
as both of us understand,

684
00:42:46,412 --> 00:42:48,404
nowhere is safe, Bu-nga.
